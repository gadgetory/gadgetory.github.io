Hindy the android authority app guy do
you like Angry Birds I know I do who
doesn't right after the intro will show
you the latest angry birds game called
angry birds friends let's start with the
most important part and that is the
gameplay as it turns out this game plays
like every other angry birds game in
existence pretty much all the same
mechanics or present that people know
and love you have the standard birds
plus all the new birds they get tossed
in a slingshot and you sling them at
pigs the beginning of the deviation
comes with the special Angry Birds
powers you can now upgrade the slingshot
which slings birds further and faster
along with that you can add a sniper
sight so you can see where the birds are
going to fly there is a powerup that
makes birds a little more powerful
there's also a powerup that shakes the
area and can cause some damage before
you shoot the next bird perhaps the
funnest new power up is the wingman it
gives you an additional bird that
doesn't count towards your current bird
total so if you have for birds and you
use a wingman you actually get a fifth
bird this can be helpful for getting
higher scores or help complete rounds
where you just need that one extra bird
now how do you get these power-ups I'm
glad you asked because it helps segue
into the next feature angry birds
friends is fully integrated with
facebook hence the name angry birds
friends to play the game you must have a
Facebook account once you signed into
facebook you'll have access to six or
seven levels you have a week to perform
these levels at the end of the week
angry birds friends determines who among
you and your Facebook friends had the
highest scores and that person wins the
week so not only is angry birds back but
it's now competitive as you progress and
do better in levels you get more angry
bird coins this can be spent in the
angry bird store for additional power
ups as always with facebook games you
can spend a few bucks and get a few
extra coins if you want to also when you
get into the top three at the end of the
week you get awarded with coins so it's
not necessarily difficult to get them
next we'll talk about graphics and sound
don't worry this won't take long it's
essentially the same sound effects we're
all used to at this point the graphics
are no different all the birds look the
same all the pigs look the same and most
of the obstacles still look the same if
you were hoping for a new and exciting
look too angry birds then keep looking
this game is all about the competition
and integration with Facebook not about
graphics there were a couple of things
we didn't like there really isn't much
of a single-player offline mode this is
all for people who want to connect on
facebook and compete so if you're
downloading this just to play on your
own and you don't have a Facebook
account this app is going to be really
for you we also didn't like the lack of
levels every week six to seven new
levels are released however all of the
old levels become inaccessible so you
never have more than six or seven levels
that you can play at any given time this
sucks a little bit because it doesn't
really take long to beat seven levels
and angry birds aside from those two
minor complaints the game really is a
lot of fun you can interact with your
friends by sending them mystery gifts
which are really just random power-ups
they get for free you can also brag to
your Facebook wall when you beat
someone's score if you're one of those
kind of people overall we enjoyed angry
birds friends because it has a fresh
Angry Birds experience it isn't
everything it could be since they really
should let you keep playing old levels
and there should be an offline mode for
those of us who don't have facebook
accounts however the pros outweigh the
cons on this one by just a little bit if
you want to try out Angry Birds we have
