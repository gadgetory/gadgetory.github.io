just reviewed the POC effective one
and both of us kind of came to the
conclusion that we really like plastic
valve people think that plastic build
materials mean the friend is gonna be
worse to use that it's not as good and
it's not going to perform as well but
after some truly legendary plastic
phones we're here to convince you
otherwise
in my pixel 3a review I talked about how
that phone is about democratizing the
pixel experience it's about getting the
pixel experience in more people's hands
for a lower price and a plastic build is
a really great way to do that and the
people that are buying this phone are
probably not gonna want their phone to
be cracking if they're not using a case
with it hey Google has these really nice
colors like purplish and it would be
pretty nice if you could show that phone
off without having to hide it behind a
case with many of today's devices in the
top and bottom portions of the market
being made out of premium material such
as glass and metal makes you wonder how
much of the budget is going into
internal things things that matter such
as camera sensors displays and of course
processors the pocke phone came in late
last year with specs that rivaled the
top-end flagship
such as the galaxy s 9 plus and note 9
but it cost 1/3 the amount that they did
how did Xiaomi accomplish this well when
you look at the build materials it soon
becomes clear sure having a shiny smooth
elegant phone is cool but what's cooler
to me is being able to do whatever I
want on my smart phone and the pocket
phone allows for this considering it has
top-end specs and at a lower price
because it makes use of that plastic
polycarbonate composite material plastic
phones also allow for the newer
networking technologies like sub 6
gigahertz and millimeter wave 5g now
glass also allows for this technology
but you have to play some special tricks
to get it to work on the Samsung Galaxy
S 10 5g they had to add more glass
around the rim of the phone and that
just adds chance to it cracking on
plastic phones the technology just works
natively through that plastic material
so you're good to go
adding to that plus the
also allows for some features that we'd
like to see on the highest-end
smartphone so you're not going to miss
out by going with a plastic smartphone
wireless charging can be done through
plastic and a good example of this is
the legendary Nexus 5 and you can even
do water and dust resistance too as
we've seen with the likes of the Galaxy
s5
these are creature comforts things that
we're used to saying in the highest end
smartphones but just because a device is
made out of plastic doesn't mean we
can't have those here too now there are
clearly reasons why you might want a
glass phone they look really great they
feel really great in the hand but there
are a lot of ways that plastic makes a
lot of sense to it can reduce the cost
its shatter resistant and I just like to
see this material populate the market a
little bit more than it is today
all right that's been it let me know
your thoughts in the comment section
down below do you want to see more
plastic devices or would you prefer that
every single phone was glass let me know
and I will catch you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
