into the ten inch tablet market with
their latest release but the space is
starting to get a little crowded
especially with Google's own offering to
contend with hey Josh from guard from
Android authority what's going on
everybody
and this is the sony xperia tablet z vs
the google nexus 10 and what might
become one hell of a tight race we start
off with the design we'll start with the
sony xperia tablet z which really turns
heads easily with its rigid rectangular
design the Xperia tablet Z is a black
slate with rigid corners and one of the
thinnest profiles we've ever seen on a
tablet the front is all black with a
front facing camera and the spine has
all the buttons on the left side
including the metal silver power button
the ports include SD card and micro USB
slots covered by pieces of plastic of
course you know what that means
water resistance the back houses the
rear facing camera and is made up of a
slightly rubberized material that helps
keep it from slipping about bottom line
this is one of the most attractive
tablets on the market and also one of
the best handling
well the tablet is thin and light as
this only 495 grams to be exact
you'll be tossing it around as easily as
a spiral notebook the Google Nexus 10 on
the other hand takes on a more classical
look made by Samsung it gets the more
rounded pebble design that has been
pretty tried and true you have the black
slate front with front facing camera but
this time you also get stereo
front-facing speakers along the sides
the buttons are found at the top with
the port's found on the sides the right
side port is four mini HDMI connections
the back of the Nexus 10 has a much
stickier material around the rear facing
camera now I know I have a big scratch
down the middle altogether the Nexus 10
is a somewhat no-frills tablet in terms
of design other than those front-facing
speakers in the hands it is heavier than
the Xperia tablet Z at around 600 grams
you probably will be keeping the Nexus
10 in both hands as one-handed
performance may feel a little perilous
bottom line if you want a tablet that
brings a new exciting style to what we
already know the Xperia tablet Z is
going to please you the Nexus 10 might
be a little more classical but it is far
from unattractive it's just something
we've seen before we could expect a lot
from displays on larger tablets and both
of these devices give their best while
both of these screens
our teenage beasts the Xperia tablet Z
rocks a LCD display capable of 1920 by
1200 resolution at 224 PPI with good
viewing angles and the Bravia Engine
backing it you get a TV like experience
worthy of Sony's pedigree the Nexus 10
on the other hand has some extra power
with its display capable of 2560 by 1600
resolution rated at 299 PPI with a
resolution so off the charts as this the
viewing experience is onion soup rising
Lee great while this pls display is
definitely not a Super AMOLED like we
generally expect from Samsung it still
has good color reproduction that rivals
the great performer in the Xperia tablet
Z while there is a difference in the
pixel density between these two it is
pretty negligible general users will not
notice the difference and viewing text
whether in websites or ebooks poses
absolutely no problems if you really
need that extra resolution the Nexus 10
obviously will be your choice but when
95% of our media is made for 1080
resolution anyway you should have a
great time with either choice it's
really up to how spec hungry you are in
this case performance might change the
game up a bit while the processor
package in the Xperia tablet Z might
seem a little dated by now Sony knew
that the Snapdragon s4 pro was and still
is a reliable performer there is no
reason to discount that 1.5 gigahertz
processor backed by the Audrina 320 and
2 gigabytes of RAM as if powered their
flagship devices and achieved scores of
above 20,000 in n22 the same goes for
the tablet Z you'll get a lot of
multitasking done with the RAM and small
apps and everything from work to play
will be easy to handle Samsung didn't
exactly follow the Snapdragon herd when
it came to the Nexus 10 as they instead
outfitted the Google tablet with an
in-house package the exitos dual-core
cortex a15 that comes in at 1.7
gigahertz while we might be used to
hearing about quad-core processors these
days don't count the Nexus 10 out
because it is still a reliable performer
backed by the Molly T 604 and 2
gigabytes of RAM the stock Android
experience here is still very speedy the
scores in antutu this only tell part of
the story optimization may play a big
role in the Nexus 10 obviously those
wanting more updated specs will go with
the Xperia tablet Z but I cannot stress
enough how a tablet like the Nexus 10
that scores under 15,000 antutu actually
feels more like a 18,000 for
former and now we come to hardware the
Sony Xperia tablet Z already has a trump
card in its water resistance it isn't a
feature that will always take advantage
of but it helps keep accidents from
being more than just mishaps another
boost comes from the expandable memory a
microSD card that can bolster the 16 or
32 gigabytes built in the speakers found
on the two bottom corners are decent
performers but this is where the Nexus
10 shows its trump card
it's clear nowadays that front-facing
speakers are awesome these two
nondescript speaker grilles on the Nexus
10 provide rich and loud sound that you
don't often find on mobile devices they
are certainly the biggest selling points
in terms of hardware the 16 or 32
gigabytes built-in are not expandable
though what the Nexus 10 can boast also
is HDMI connectivity secondary display
capabilities on the Xperia Tablet are
through MHL ultimately comes down to
this do you want your tablet to survive
a dunk in the depths or as sound your
ultimate satisfaction these features do
well to truly differentiate these two
top tier tablets so it's up to you what
is more important
it might seem unfair to compare the
battery life in this test considering
the Xperia comes with a six thousand
milliamp hour unit that is somewhat
dwarfed by the 9000 milliamp hour
performer in the Nexus 10 while the
Nexus 10 does get through about seven
and a half hours of general usage on
Wi-Fi quite easily the Xperia is able to
reach Sony's claims of around 6 hours of
usage in the end you'll get a little
more work and play out of the Nexus 10
but it really isn't that huge of a
difference cameras on tablets are often
hard to take seriously but both of these
optics packages actually perform pretty
well the Xperia tablet Z comes with an 8
megapixel shooter that is less powerful
than but still similar to the 13
megapixel shooter in the Xperia Z
smartphone as such you get an X more
sensor and the app is bolstered with
many different scene modes that support
superior auto which helps you get the
right shot picture quality is quite
decent though it definitely doesn't
perform as well as its smartphone
counterparts the Nexus 10 doesn't have
as powerful the camera as it is a 5
megapixel shooter instead the app is
also not as robust though it does come
with the yet ubiquitous a photosphere
function it is a fast performer with a
good shutter to file speed but pictures
are even worse here which doesn't come
as much of a surprise really while it is
nice to have a camera handy even on a
tablet these are definitely backups when
you have much better performers on any
smartphone you might have in your pocket
and finally the software depending on
who you are this could be a skewed
category after all many of us Android
users really do prefer the standard
Android experience the Nexus line makes
it clear that Android at its purest can
be the best and that's what you get with
the Nexus 10 not only does it come with
the most advanced version
of jellybean you can rest assured that
we'll continue to get the most updated
software available apps optimized for
tablets come along with Google now and
the smoothness of project butter it
might not come with a whole lot of bells
and whistles compared to forked versions
but it is usually thus the best
performing hands down those extras might
help Sony's Xperia UI though while the
general look of the UI found in the
Xperia tablet Z resembles at least the
Ice Cream Sandwich edition of Android it
does come with some other apps and
functionality that give it a boost in
this case we have the small apps that
serve as small overlays overcurrent
workspaces for easy quick multitasking
but on top of all of that or Sony's own
great applications like the Walkman and
album picture gallery they do bring some
key differences to this version of
Android if you are certain that you will
be using the extras in the Xperia UI it
will be the right companion for you to
get stuff done otherwise stock Android
is as smooth as it can get and in
general functionality isn't far off in
this comparison either way you get an
easy-to-use interface with a few extras
depending on your choice and now finally
price the Nexus 10 is the tablet made
for Google's line but it doesn't retain
the same low price that the Nexus 4 in
the Nexus 7 can boast but the 399 price
tag is still eclipsed by the much more
premium price of the Xperia tablet Z at
$499 and so there you have it this
really is a matter of necessity there's
no question how much fun you'll have on
either of these devices so you have to
ask yourself what is it you really want
from a 10-inch tablet experience do you
need water resistance or do you want the
nimble kind of fun that you can have
from such a thin and light device do you
need sound fidelity via front-facing
speakers or do you at least want the
promise of the latest and greatest that
Google stock Android has to offer well I
can't answer those questions for you but
I can tell you this these are two of the
best tablets around and no matter which
one you choose you are in for a good
time if you want to see the full reviews
