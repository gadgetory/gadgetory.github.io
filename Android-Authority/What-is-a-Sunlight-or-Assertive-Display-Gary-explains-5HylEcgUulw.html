authorities now you may have noticed
that some smartphones have the option to
enable sunlight readability or sunlight
view ability now when this mode is
enabled the idea is that photos and text
are clearer when you're outdoors in
bright sunlight so the question before
us today is what is sunlight viewability
and how does it work well let me explain
now there are a couple of different
sunlight viewability technologies out
there and the one i'm going to
concentrate on today is called assertive
display which is from armless arm who
make the cortex processors and the Mali
GPUs now arm have this technology which
enables video and photos and games and
text to appear better when you're
watching your phone outdoors now
additionally when your phone is being
moved around from indoors from outdoors
to room with more light to route of less
light the phone automatically changes
the brightness of the display and you
can actually override that of course in
the settings but when you put it on
automatic there's a photo sensor on the
front of your phone that detect how much
ambient light there is and then it
powers the display accordingly now when
you're in a darkened room you know what
a bright display could is bad on the
eyes and things appear to white and too
sharp but when you go outdoors and
there's lots of ambient like you need
the phone to work harder so that it's
light is able to kind of be better
stronger than the light that's around it
now the problem with sunlight
readability is that there is a limit to
how much brightness a display can make
depending on the quality of display
depending on the type of display the
levels of the brightness will change but
at the end once the photo sensor detects
as bright sunlight it will push that
display up to its very maximum and there
it stops there's nothing more it can do
but when you're using sunlight
readability technology like assertive
display then there's another trick that
the phone has up is provoking sleeves
so the solution to this problem of
sunlight readability is actually to use
a technology called tone mapping and
what happens in tone mapping is that the
picture itself is processed so that
things that are darker appear to be
lighter while things that are already
light remain exactly the same very
similar roughly to what we see with HDR
displays and HDR photography
now what assertive display does is in
combination with the photo sensor when
it senses strong amount of light it
actually processes the image that's on
the display so that actually the darker
things have more detail and the lighter
things don't get washed out by always
having to pump up the brightness and
there's also an interesting side effect
because the image is being present and
this happens in real time which means
it's not just about photo it could be
films and games anything that's
happening on the screen because it's
being processed now actually it turns
out you can see lower the brightness a
bit so actually you go out into bright
sunlight that is the image is processed
for a greater readability in sunlight
and as a result the brightness can't be
pushed down of course that means battery
saving in fact armed record you can
actually get up to 50% battery saving in
some circumstances by lowering the
brightness but by applying assertive
display now the best way to see what I'm
talking about is with a demo okay so for
this first experiment here I've got the
peaking light which is quite assertive
display built into that and I've enabled
it in the settings and here we have a
picture that's a mixture of dark and
light here is a some clouds and there's
a road and a pathway in some bushes as
you can see there's quite a lot of
contrast between these two areas now I'm
about 50% of the display brightness now
and now only doing the maximum is going
outside to the display automatically
bumps up the brightness so we'll just
bump up the brightness and manually now
and we can see that a bit more of the
picture is clearer some of the road
there is clear as it was before but now
that the phone bumped up its Vaught its
brightness up to the highest level what
else can it do to make this display more
readable so what I've got here is a
basically little torch and I'm going to
shine this torch
on the photo sensor on the display to
mimic us going out into much brighter
light and as you can see here now look
at this how this pathway has become
visible the graph there is much more
visible if you start to need some detail
to in the bushes but the sky area here
hasn't lost haven't become all whited
out bleached out because it's increased
of rightness it actually only mapped
tone map to the areas that needed
improving so we can see this picture
more clearly okay so as a comparison
here I've now got the Google pixel phone
here and I've got the while a p10 light
here most of the same photo and you can
see that actually the display on both
devices is pretty good there's a deeper
range of colors it appears to me here on
the pixel but basically there's the same
problem here I can't see the pathway
very well and a lot of detail here
amongst the trees in the road is lost so
I take my torch here and if I shine it
brighter on the pixel absolutely nothing
happens once is that full brightness
because it doesn't have a sunlight
display or assertive display it can't do
anything but again we go back to the
while we P 10 which has got a certain
display in it and you can see how the
tone mapping is applied there so the
colors come up here definition comes up
here in this darker picture again the
same two foes I've got the pixel and the
Huawei p10 light let's set both of them
now to 50% around about 50% brightness
just what I can kind of charge with my
eye there and let's set this one to 50%
points well approximately okay so there
we have both devices and as you can see
again the sky is bright look match
colors of blue here and the clouds are
mostly all the stuff down here is kind
of the detail is lost because it is too
dark so let's bump up the brightness to
a hundred percent as if we kind of
stepped outside a bit we wanted to see a
bit more okay and as you can see a bit
better now some definitions come out
here but again we'll use our trusty
torch to mimic bright sunlight
and if we go out into even brightest
sunlight once the display has reached
100% brightness the backlight or the
AMOLED display does nothing more it can
do but from the p10 light it can apply
assertive display and we can see now
here little red detail coming out here
in this bottom part of the picture and
that's all down to local tone mapping it
hasn't increased the brightness of that
display now as you just saw the effects
of a hooded blade can be quite dramatic
so you get a better sunlight readability
and you get lower back to consumption
out in my books that should make a 30
display actually mandatory in every
single Android smartphone however
unfortunately is not in fact it's also
quite strange because many OEMs don't
talk about this function even when it's
enabled in their phone they don't talk
about it now I actually find it quite
hard to kind of go through all the
different SOC in all the different
smartphones to find one that actually
speak about assertive display or
sunlight reading display now we do know
a few things a couple of years ago
Qualcomm announced that the Snapdragon
800 support assertive display and we are
assuming that all the 800 range
continued to support the xxx display and
also as you saw from the video while we
have included 30 display in lots of
their keyring processors so really a my
shout out to the OEM please tell us when
you have a certain display in your phone
so that we can actually see the benefit
that it brings to the display and as for
us consumers it come down to this if
you've got a choice between two phones
that are similarly matched in terms of
their processing power and in memory in
their storage and and other things my
camera quality and you can't quite
decide which one to buy always get the
one that's got assertive display in it
because that will improve the outdoor
view ability well I'm going to inform
and your authority I hope you enjoyed
this video if you did please do give it
a thumbs up please subscribe to Angela
policies YouTube channel hit that Bell

least do go over to hand
