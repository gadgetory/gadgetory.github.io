going everybody and I'm standing right
in front of the austin convention center
to
to South by Southwest yes South by
Southwest is a huge festival that has
film music but in our case we were going
to be here at the interactive areas and
the thing is that even though I have
just gone into the tradeshow area where
all of our vendors are a lot of what
happens at South by Southwest occurs
across the entire city so I'm going to
be running around to a lot of different
sessions and a number of little meetings
to learn about a couple of very
particular things in the world of mobile
and what is really making a splash here
at South by Southwest is virtual reality
and a lot of what we're going to cover
the next few days will cover that
Samsung actually has a huge presence
here at South by Southwest with their
gear 360 and they're going to be talking
about VR in a number of different panels
we're going to be taking a look at that
and speaking of having venues in all
different places there's actually one
right behind me across the street from
the convention center and you could
probably see a pretty plain wait and
I'll just do that real quick we have the
samsung latch and the Samsung lounge is
where VR is going to be shown the gear
VR and it's a demo that we saw at mwc or
rather lon was able to where you are
able to sample or rather experience in
virtual reality the two or rather to
roller coasters from six flags and so
just to give you guys a brief look I
said already that a lot of South by
Southwest happens in a lot of different
places outside of the Convention Center
and you can kind of tell with what are
you seeing behind me behind me right now
you don't see a whole lot of people in
the interactive tech tradeshow area and
the reason why is because well South by
Southwest tends to be more of an
incubator for startups and you see a ton
of startups here and not necessarily too
many of the big names so you're not
going to get a whole lot of device
updates or even announcements here at
South by Southwest but you are going to
get a look at what a lot of these
companies that are starting up are going
to bring that might become big things in
the future and given that there is a
film and music area of South by
Southwest I should tell you that a lot
of the people who would otherwise be
right behind me at places like CES mwc
and Aoife are probably out watching
films and enjoying live music this is
definitely a more creative space here in
Austin Texas for South by Southwest and
that's the reason why vr 360 video and
other content of the like are going to
be more of our focus while we are here
at
southwest we are looking to have Darcy
lack of a and gaurav gondia here as well
I'm here a couple of days early so I can
check out the interactive area but after
that the three of us are going to get
together really have some fun with a
virtual reality and bring you our
findings behind it and then we'll be
able to enjoy what is one of the great
cities Austin Texas so keep it tuned
here for even more because we are your
source for all things Android and then
we're also your source for all things VR
at South by Southwest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
