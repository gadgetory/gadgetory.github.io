authority what's going on everybody and
we're taking a look at a couple of
phones that have just been announced at
MWC 2017 by a company called Joanie
now the a1 and the a1 plus pack full HD
displays with the a1 housing a 5.5 inch
screen and the a1 plus pleading the
larger one at 6 inches however both of
them are boasting large batteries and
really big cameras of my big cameras I
mean very high megapixel count but
before we get to those marquee features
these two phones are powered by Helio
processors a p10 is in the a1 and the a1
plus has the Helio p25 both phones come
with 4 gigabytes of RAM 64 gigabytes of
internal storage and support for microSD
cards and they're both running 7.0
Android Mugen this certainly isn't
anything wrong with the construction and
design of the Jony phones however they
are somewhat generic they do have their
logo on the back and the solid metal
construction makes them feel a little
bit more premium however they really
aren't a whole lot of frills or thrills
when it comes to the look and feel of
these devices now that we've gotten that
out of the way we can talk about the
camera and the battery now on the a1
you'll get a rear 13 megapixel camera
and a 16 megapixel front-facing camera
but the a1 plus puts a 13 megapixel and
dual with five megapixel camera setup on
the back with a whopping 20 megapixel
front-facing camera both devices come
with flash on the front and rear also
and those cameras as you can see in this
interface are not necessarily the
fastest that I use right off the bat is
my first impression but also those
Beauty modes that are there they're
really pushing for the selfies on these
particular devices and the beauty mode
can be incredibly aggressive now the
battery is also pretty large for phones
of this size as the a1 has a four
thousand 10 milliamp hour battery and
the a1 plus has a 45 50 million power
battery now that's significantly more
than the ones that usually come in and
around 3000 milliamp hours for more
recent flagship devices and Android and
you can also expect some really fast
charging as both of these phones for 18
watt fast charging now the Jony a1 will
go on sale for 349 euros while the a1
plus will go on sale for 499 euros
and they're going to start going on sale
in March but the a1 plus will have to
wait until April there's no word yet on
us availability now keep it into Android
