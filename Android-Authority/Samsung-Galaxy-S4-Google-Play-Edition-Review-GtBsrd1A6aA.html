you because here we have one of the most
recent examples the masses asked and
they delivered hey it's Josh McArthur
manager I thought oh what's going on
everybody
and this is the Samsung Galaxy s4 Google
Play edition as should already be
obvious this is the exact same phone as
the original Galaxy s4 and thus has
nearly every same attribute in terms of
design all the way to the hardware and
the battery so instead of going through
each one in depth make sure you check
out my original s4 review if there is a
lot about this phone you don't already
know about yet aesthetically this is the
white version of the galaxy s4 with no
changes whatsoever you get the same
nimbleness and easy handling of the
5-inch screen along with the same button
layout all around the screen is the same
five inch Super AMOLED display that is
very saturated and is capable of 1080p
resolution at 441 PPI I will say that
jelly bean overall less flamboyant than
Samsung's TouchWiz looks absolutely
gorgeous on this screen if you thought
that the Nexus 4 was easy on the eyes
try getting your Nexus kicks from the
Galaxy s4 it still scores very high in
benchmark tests as it is sporting the
same Snapdragon 600 at 1.9 gigahertz
with the Adreno 320 and 2 gigabytes of
RAM and going through the elements of
jelly bean is as buttery smooth as ever
hardware is where the story gets a
little interesting as this phone still
comes with all of the same inner bits
including every sensor and the IR
blaster will get to their applications
in the software section but it is
important to note that they are still
there of course you get the removable
battery and the micro SD card slot
underneath the back cover the battery is
the same 2600 milliamp hour unit that
provides a great deal of longevity that
can easily support your busy day ok so
as a pretense to the overall software
section we will start with the camera
the same 13 megapixel shooter is found
here but that is about all that returns
instead of the full-featured TouchWiz
camera with all of its modes and
settings the stock Android camera brings
it simplistic but stylish interface to
the Samsung camera the entire screen
becomes the viewfinder and there are
only a few buttons on the side all
settings are accessed by touching
anywhere on the screen and swiping
through the small arched menus when it
comes to the modes you get HDR and a few
different preset scenes to choose from
and of course there is photo
fear the picture quality is largely the
same as the optics do well to capture
details and they do a great job in good
lighting a more in-depth look between
the two cameras will be done in an
upcoming verses video but rest assured
that any differences you may see in the
pictures from either phone aren't
explicitly noticeable and finally we
make it to the software section the crux
of the Google Play edition you get the
familiar Samsung Galaxy s4 hardware with
a new operating system baked in Android
4.2 jelly bean it sounds like a dream
pairing and for the most part it
actually is the stock Android experience
is widely regarded as the best way to
enjoy Google's operating system and
until now the only way to get it was to
buy a Nexus device anyone who has used
anything from TouchWiz to sense and
lament it over the extra software it
will really enjoy the stripped down
simple yet elegant look and feel of
jelly bean proper the user interface
gets back to basics you get your app
drawer the home screens ripe for widgets
and folders and the notification
drop-down what the original shade for
settings hold down the tactile home
button and you get to the great Google
now some people might see every setting
and feature of the original Galaxy s4
and get overwhelmed that is far from the
case here you get simplistic elegance
that is ready for customization once
your adventurous side takes over but of
course you lose quite a bit when you
convert over to vanilla jelly bean think
about everything you saw in commercials
or on online ads that made the galaxy s4
special pretty much none of that is
available here and it is almost
painfully obvious from the get-go in the
notification shade no s-health group
play or watch on though apks of these
apps could be acquired for installation
all of the sensors that you might use
for air view and hand gestures will lie
dormant as none of the software in the
installed operating system here can take
advantage of them so the galaxy s4 gets
traditional and everything you do with
it is the same as it ever was perhaps
the most controversial part about this
device is its price while it is great
that the galaxy s4 now has the nexus
experience it doesn't bring the nexus
price you will still be paying about the
same full price unlocked for the galaxy
s4 Google Play edition $649 from the
Google Play Store and so there you have
it
I do have to admit that using stock
jellybeans on this best-selling Android
device was very refreshing you could
argue that getting very vanilla with the
operating system and losing all of the
extras might quickly make the phone
boring but for us seasoned Android users
that isn't what it's all about the look
and utility of stock Android is pretty
unanimously loved and everything else
about the general experience is a blank
canvas ripe with customization
possibilities that's why we love our
Nexus and it only gets better on the s4
hardware
unfortunately plenty of people are
finding it difficult to handle the price
point of what is kind of supposed to be
a Nexus device there is a pretty hefty
price to pay in order to enjoy this
phone but let me present to you a
possibility I never really hated
TouchWiz on the original s4 but I did
wonder what stock Android would have
been like on it I didn't really pull the
trigger though because I was afraid of
losing all of the extras and losing all
of the features but these Google Play
editions are Google pretty much saying
to us it would be okay as I was using
the Google Play editions of the galaxy
s4 and also the HTC One I found myself
not really missing those extras that
were on the original devices so if you
were anything like me take the Google
Play editions like a sign google telling
you that it would be alright and making
it clear to you that the original stock
Android experience works beautifully on
these devices so if you've been waiting
until now perhaps these phones are
assigned for you to go ahead and root
and flash away like I said before I'm
going to have a full versus available
soon pitting the Google Play edition
galaxy s4 versus the original stay tuned
