the motives III is probably the least
exciting phone of 2018 and that's a
shame because it's coming from a company
that has done some pretty innovative
things in the past we had moto maker
back in the day which is pretty exciting
and a couple of years ago when they
introduced the original moto Z we had
all these moto mods these attachable
parts that basically added more
functionality to your phone and motorola
is still using these moto mods and
they're still trying to make more of
them and that's one of the main draws of
the Moto Z 3 there's a new Moto mod
that's going to give this phone 5g
speeds in the future but take that out
of the equation and you have a phone
that is really not all that compelling
ok so here's why the Moto Z 3 is really
not all that exciting this phone right
here is the z3 play which came out not
that long ago and it looks exactly like
the z3 the z3 basically recycles a lot
of the components from the z3 play the
design is exactly the same and honestly
there's nothing wrong with that
but it's not new it still feels great in
the hand it has a nice glass and metal
design it's comfortable and it's also
super super thin and it also doesn't
have a headphone jack either like the z3
play if you care about that stuff the
screen is also exactly the same it's a
six inch AMOLED screen with 18 by 9
aspect ratio and 1080p resolution and
it's a fantastic display but again same
exact screen from the z3 play so on the
inside is where you'll find the biggest
differences from the z3 play to the z3
but even though this is a 20-18 flagship
it doesn't have 2018 specs it's actually
rocking last year's snapdragon 835
instead of the 845 that we're seeing on
pretty much every other flagship but it
still has plenty of RAM and the 835 is
not a slow processor by any means it's
still a very fast processor
I didn't have any issues with
performance on the z3 at all it's a very
smooth phone it's just that if you care
about specs and you want the latest and
the greatest and you plan on using this
phone for a long time it's gonna come
with outdated specs right out of the box
because this phone is using last year's
specs it's actually cheaper than most
other 2018 flagships a lot cheaper
actually it's four hundred and eighty
dollars outright from Verizon which is
oddly underneath the z3 place price at
five hundred dollars but something to
take note of is you're not getting a
moto mod included in the box before
under $80 price tag is actually a pretty
good deal especially if you're on
Verizon but something you have to keep
in mind that this phone is an investment
in the future it's gonna get 5g speeds
later on with Moto's brand new 5g moto
mod but this isn't coming out for a
while it's actually not gonna hit store
shelves until early 2019 but if you want
to be one of the first people to jump on
the 5g bandwagon this is the phone to do
it with as far as the 5g moto mods
compatibility it's only gonna work with
Verizon at the moment because as e3 is
back to being a Verizon exclusive but it
may work with other networks in the
future and also with prior moto Z phones
but Motorola hasn't confirmed anything
yet the thing that's impressed me the
most with the Moto Z 3 is its battery
life it doesn't have the biggest battery
in the world at 3000 milliamp hours but
it's been able to comfortably last me
all day which I didn't expect and I'm
getting a consistent 5 hours of screen
on time and sometimes a little bit more
so I was really pleasantly surprised by
how long this phone lasts now the camera
on the Moto Z 3 is actually pretty
decent it's not amazing but it's not a
bad camera either you have dual 12
megapixel cameras on the rear the
secondary sensor is a monochrome sensor
that lets you take true black-and-white
photos and it also helps capture a
little bit more detail and it also of
course lets you take portrait mode
photos if you want that background blur
it performs pretty well in well-lit or
outdoor situations there's a lot of
really nice color a lot of detail and
dynamic range is also pretty good I
never really noticed any overexposed
highlights or underexposed shadows but
it does fall apart extremely quickly in
low-light you get a lot of muddy images
soft
details and colors are extremely washed
out so I would try to avoid shooting in
low-light as much as possible and as far
as the features of this camera goes it
has all the same features that we
originally saw in the z3 play so you
have these cinemagraphs that let you
take animated stills and google lens is
also integrated directly into Motorola's
camera app my favorite part about any
Motorola phone is the software
experience because it's very close to
stock but you get some useful Motorola
enhancements like the chop-chop to turn
on the flashlight the wrist twist to
launch the camera and the Moto display
it's running Android 8.1 Oreo at the
moment hopefully an Android Pi update
will be coming up soon but for now Oreo
is what you get the only thing that
really bogs down the experience for me
is the fact that it's on Verizon and
because it's on Verizon you get a ton of
pre-installed bloatware you get the
entire suite of Verizon applications
which nobody really uses and you also
get a bunch of other third-party apps
from games and apps like eBay and Bank
of America but thankfully all these apps
can be uninstalled with the exception of
the Verizon apps of course so that helps
clean up the experience a little bit and
frees up a ton of space so that is the
Moto XIII in a nutshell it's a good
phone that doesn't really have any major
faults but the only thing that makes
this compelling over other flagships is
the promise of 5g but I don't think
there's gonna be very many consumers
that are going to be willing to invest
in a phone with outdated specs with a
promise of future technology so that
