brought to you by domain.com all right
so let's jump off the hype train for a
moment and talk about if these new
flagship expensive phones are worth the
hit to your wallet each year a handful
of high-priced top-shelf devices are
announced and treated like huge launch
events along with major marketing
campaigns while most of these devices
live up to the hype there are plenty of
viable alternatives flying below the
radar of power users and casual
consumers alike alright so as many of
you know I just bought the Sony Xperia
z3 compact and it's a great phone love
it
glad I paid the price I did for it but I
did just give a perfectly good Nexus 5
to my teenage son and he loves it it's
never slowed down never had a problem
slick wonderful phone for a fraction of
the price in the early days of Android
off-the-charts specs and frequent
software enhancements were driving
forces when purchasing a new smartphone
or tablet spec sheets certainly still
play an important part but these days
the playing field is much more leveled
mid-range gear isn't so mid-range
anymore and while I'm personally not a
fan of OMS cranking out dozens of
smartphones each year I do recognize the
importance of being able to offer
consumers budget-friendly handsets so
let's not just talk about what's the
best bang for your buck but are you
getting a premium experience for that
premium price a few years back most
smartphone makers would release flagship
hardware with unique designs that made
them stand out compared to other devices
in their categories however things have
changed over the past couple of years
although Android heavyweights like
Samsung LG and HTC are now releasing
mid-range and low-end handsets with
design aesthetics almost identical to
their respective annual flagship
smartphones it's most likely a
cost-effective measure this new trend
makes some premium handsets feel a
little less chic case in point let's
talk about Motorola's Moto G well it may
not pack the same punch as a flagship
phone it's hardware is more than
sufficient for the vast majority of
users for around 180 bucks u.s. you can
score a 5 inch 720p display a quad-core
processor an 8 megapixel shooter and
most vanilla build of Android not too
shabby at all but the former Google
company isn't the only place offering
low-cost devices Chinese phone
manufacturers like Huawei and ZTE are
producing more budget-conscious handsets
that wouldn't put a dent in your bank
account a more recent example of this is
the Asus zenfone 2 and mid-range device
that offers speedy Intel processing and
up to four gigabytes of RAM depending
upon the configuration while it's priced
aggressively the zenfone 2 performance
and even aesthetics are more in line
with what you'd expect from a flagship
device sure the phone isn't perfect but
our very own lon certainly was impressed
with the performance of the handset in
his recent review now of course we can't
cover this topic without talking about
the oneplus one a fantastic phone other
than the Nexus device probably your best
bang for the buck phone if you can get
it
oneplus has made it very difficult to
get the phone with their invite system
and even if it does get easier that's
the dominant narrative that most people
think about when they hear about the
oneplus one so if you haven't invited or
you have a friend who has an invite
you're good to go if you're not you got
to look at an alternative now let's talk
about the Nexus 5 the phone is 18 months
old and it's never slowed down never had
a problem with it whatsoever it's a
sleek premium looking and feeling device
I gave it to my son when I bought then
you compact phone from Sony and he plays
intensive games on it all day if I let
him and he's never had a problem with
the phone do you really need to spend
six seven hundred dollars when you can
get an old Nexus 5 it's 18 months old
for like I don't know 200 bucks now you
got to think about that now what about
you hardware geeks out there that have
convinced yourself you absolutely need
four K or you absolutely need three
gigabytes of RAM you might want to
reconsider that we've all got to ask
ourselves the question does the added
feature actually change the functional
use of my device or is it just kind of
sexy to have and then of course there is
the hardcore geeks among us who will
only really be happy with the latest
possible specs now if your love for
gadgets borders on obsession and you
don't mind shelling out big bucks or
committing to long service contracts
there are some benefits to buying a
brand new flagship device while the
after mentioned alternative
fit in with most budgets some of them
will lack the amenities typically
offered by big-ticket flagship handsets
items like LTE network NFC support and
full 1080p or 4k HD are among some of
the more common features missing from
budget-friendly smartphones number one
recommendation here is save up for a
little bit and buy the phone off
contract if you can do that you are
going to save a lot of money number two
try and put your ego and check and
seriously consider a device that's a
year old the Samsung Galaxy s5 for
example is a very powerful phone and
quite a bit cheaper than the s6 the
Nexus 5 the HTC m8 I mean look at the
difference between the HTC m9 and the m8
very similar phones quite a bit cheaper
consider that some of you may know my
other job is to teach the Performing
Arts to young people and when I chose
the name for the company I wanted to
make sure I had the dot-com so I chose
the name undivided company and Gotha com
why because dot-com gives the most
credibility and trust out of any other
domain extension that's one reason the
second reason is if I choose a you know
dot info or some other domain name I'm
giving free traffic to the person who
does own the dot-com when you buy domain
names from domain.com you immediately
get the power to control what people
find when they search for you online and
no domain name extensions tell your
story with the same amount of trust like
it does with a.com or.net domain name
dot-com and dotnet domain name
extensions and Jack credibility and your
online presence and who doesn't want
more credibility and you can also save
