written review of the oneplus 60 and I
titled it fundamentally great but that
got me thinking what exactly does
fundamentally great really mean so
probably one of the most important
smartphone fundamentals for me is
software oxygen OS is probably one of my
favorite Android skins that has ever
existed they're going with this fast and
smooth methodology which pretty much
means that it just gets out of your way
when you're trying to use your phone but
there's also this cohesive design
language just just pulls it all together
whether it's the fun or the navigation
gestures or anything that you're just
trying to use the software for it just
feels like one really great skin of
Android and if you want something super
simple this is for you and notice how I
said the software was just kind of
trying to get out of the way of your
experience well the hardware is pretty
much the same thing it's incredibly
simplistic almost to a fault they've
gotten rid of the headphone jack on the
bottom just can add this little symmetry
thing and they've also removed the
fingerprint sensor on the back to put it
in the screen and so far it's not great
I do hope it gets better oneplus did say
it was gonna get better over time I
haven't really found that to be the case
over the last three weeks but it all
kind of feeds into the fact that they
want the hardware to just be incredibly
simplistic and be a slate for the
software honestly the software is so
good on this phone that you kind of just
want the hardware to be a way to access
the software and that's pretty much
exactly what oneplus have done with the
60 alright so one of my other smartphone
fundamentals is performance and as usual
oneplus doesn't disappoint here just
like the oneplus 6 they've still got six
to eight gigabytes of RAM they've still
got 128 and 256 gigabytes of storage and
they've still got that Snapdragon 845
and that just kind of makes it so the
software and the hardware just get out
of your way you're not seeing dropped
frames and you're not seeing any lag or
stuttering issues they've also done
things like putting key app data in
memory to make things launch faster so
they're really taking advantage of the
fact that they have so much RAM in this
phone I don't think you're ever going to
have an issue with performance in the
oneplus 60 so probably the last of my
smartphone fundamentals personally is
battery life and then oneplus X T does
not
point I'm getting around six and a half
to eight hours of battery life out of
this phone and that is really really
good for a three thousand seven hundred
million power cell that's even beating
out the huawei mate 20 which has a four
thousand two hundred million power cell
and I feel like if you want really good
battery life in a smart phone like I do
then you will not be disappointed with
the oneplus 16 so those are my personal
fundamentals of what makes a great smart
phone and that's why I love the oneplus
60 so much but it's not the same for
everybody most people actually want a
really great smart phone camera and the
oneplus sixties camera is not bad it's
just not quite as good as something like
the pixel but it's in a totally
different pricing tier so you really
can't compare it now what it does do is
capture some pretty sharp images and
they're little bit desaturate is here
they're not gonna look like a samsung
camera or even really a pixel camera but
they're pretty unique they actually look
really similar to like a Fuji film
camera and I love Fuji film colors so
I'm actually really diggin this camera
oneplus also added this new mode called
night mode which isn't the same as
Google pixels nitesite effectively what
it does is bump up the dynamic range so
if you have highlights they're not gonna
be blown out and the shadows are
probably gonna be raised a little more
so you can see a little more detail now
this isn't actually that useful at night
time so I'm not really sure why they
called it night mode but if you're
taking photos during the day when you
have a lot of highlights and shadows
then it can make them look pretty good
so if you want the best smartphone
camera you're not gonna find that in the
60 they did make it a little bit better
than the 1 plus 6 so that's a plus if
you're coming from the 6 or a 5 t but
you're gonna want to go for a pixel 3 or
a huawei mate 20 if you're looking for
the best smartphone camera on the market
so I guess that's what it means to be
fundamentally great right you've got
great hardware great software great
performance and great battery life and
those are the things that I value so if
those are the things that you value in
the smartphone then the oneplus sixteen
might be for you and it's also like half
the price of every other flagship on the
market right now at five hundred seventy
nine dollars and it's on t-mobile this
is the first one plus device to actually
be on a carrier in the US and that is a
huge deal so overall if you don't want
any gimmicks you just want something
that is fundamentally great they get the
oneplus 60</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
