authority what's going on everybody and
here we are taking a live look at the
Sony Xperia z3 this is the new update to
the Xperia line they do have a bi-yearly
type of release schedule so you are
seeing an incremental change in the
Xperia line with this new iteration but
we will say that we do like what we see
now we are here live on the floor so I
am giving you this live look but we will
have an even closer look at this in a
more controlled environment which is
where I will give you a much better look
at all of the features of the phone but
I will talk at length about the changes
that are in this version of the Xperia
the z3 or the z3 if you so choose to
call it that now comes with the more
rounded look all around and you can see
here that all of the ports are still
available and you can easily just take
the port covers out in order to get to
the microSD card slot and also the
charging ports and the SIM tray of
course we also have the button layout
right here on the side that has the
signature silver power button right here
that has a pretty meaty feel to it
already but also has the volume rockers
below it and of course that great
dedicated camera button here where my
thumb is from there we do have a much
lighter device all around as well and
it's actually also quite a bit thinner
at only 7 millimeters this is quite a
bit thinner than the original z2 which
came in at a little bit of a thicker
size right here we have on the back
you're going to notice that I actually
have a special color on here the first
one of its kind in the Xperia line this
is the copper edition of the phone but
as far as the innards go we do get the
bumps these Snapdragon 801 in terms of
the processor and the Adreno 330 for all
of the gaming that you would need and
the camera itself also has the 20 point
seven megapixel optics that will allow
you to get the same type of great image
quality that you already expected from
the Xperia line especially in the z2 now
jumping into the actual software itself
when we will see here let me just bump
up the right
for you to make a little bit easier to
see
what we will see here is the Xperia U I
still really looking as simplistic as it
does and it looks pretty much as close
to a stock Android build as you can
really sort of muster with the app
drawer a small pullover over there and
the home screens it's really kind of
simplistic keeps it them about the way
that you already expect from the Xperia
neo from previous iterations and here's
the recent apps screen and of course we
have the quick settings right over here
in the notification drop-down now this
is basically the Xperia UI we do
remember but we would expect some
upgrades to be throughout just little
optimizations throughout the actual
operating system and the user interface
itself now one thing that I'm really
excited about especially when it comes
to the z3 itself and the z3 tablet
compact is the fact that these are the
first phones and tablets that we'll be
able to connect to the PlayStation 4 as
you can see this icon down here in order
for you to do some remote place so if
you have both of the devices on the same
network and you need to give up your
spot at the TV you will be able to have
your playing experience here on this
screen and also on the tablet screen
which is really great so you will be
able to stream those two games over and
have a great time with those looking at
some of the applications in here we have
a lot of the same experiences and the
ps4 connectivity is really the marquee
feature here especially for those of you
gamers out there taking a look at these
small apps we do still have the small
apps right here that will allow you to
have small applications that will give
you access to some quick tools
on top of the types of experiences that
you're already having whether it be in
the browser or anywhere in the operating
system really like for example
calculator if you take a look at that
right here and these small apps are
something that Sony has really had in
their phone since the beginning of the
Experion really and they continue here
in this a3 taking a look at the camera
here you'll see that the operating
system provides the same type of camera
experience that you've come to expect
already with all of the modes in here
that have a lot of them that do return
but there are a couple of new ones like
for example face in and also AR has been
turned into a are fun which will allow
you to have some fun with all of your
pictures but from there we do will look
at these settings real quick
aspect ratio at 16 by 9 in this case now
that will allow us to have actually you
know what we're in the and superior auto
mode let's go to manual we can take a
look at the settings from there
here is the resolution we do have the
20.7 up there as you can see at the top
but there is also the fifteen point five
megapixel if you still want to take a
large sixteen by nine photo and the 8
megapixel down there now you will be
able to use all of the modes and the a
megapixel mode if if it's the same as
the z2 and it does look like it will be
from there we have the same type of
options all around that allow it to be
pretty customizable when it comes to
getting the kind of image
you want and really the experience seems
to be quite the same only with some
enhancements that are somewhat on the
outside and somewhat on the inside as
far as the field goes if you did feel
the Xperia z2 and then you put this in
your hand you will think that the
optimization is pretty nice this rounded
feel really gives it a nice touch and it
really does make it feel a lot sleeker
than before this copper color does look
quite nice and with a lighter form all
around with a thinner body it does feel
like an even more premium device than
before with a much easier handling
experience than before as well so that's
just a quick look at the Xperia c3 or z3
that does bring quite a few of the same
things you would expect from the Xperia
z2 but further enhances the feel on the
inside and out in certain particular
ways so keep it tuned to Android
authority as we're going to bring you
yet another look at the EC 3 and we're
also going to compare it to the z2 as
well once we get our hands on in a more
controlled environment we'll also take a
look at this e3 compact the z3 tablet
compact and the sony smartwatch sporting
Android wear in another video coming up
very soon so keep it tuned here because
we are your source for all things FIFA
