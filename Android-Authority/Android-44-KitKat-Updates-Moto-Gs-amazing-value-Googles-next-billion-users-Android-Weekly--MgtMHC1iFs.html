is Jace and today we cover things like
new kit kat releases both official and
unofficial and how exactly will Google
reach the next billion users here comes
now by far the most common and anxious
question ask your android authority is
something like when will the next
android version be available for my
particular phone well in that case we
have some good news for you since last
Tuesday we had official over-the-air
kitkat releases for both the Nexus 7
2012 2013 and the Nexus 10 google does
assures that the nexus 4 and cellular
Nexus 7 will receive updates soon now
for those of you left still waiting and
can brave the wilds of rooting your own
phone you can now find unofficial
releases from rom creators AOKP
cyanogenmod and omnirom for KitKat 4.4
see the links below to find if your
device is eligible but of course those
Nexus updates can take time and if
you're really impatient you can now
manually install KitKat 4.4 my good
friend Adam Kuwait er provides a
detailed step-by-step guide with images
to do just that but now for some not so
good news regarding the galaxy s3 4.3
jellybean release and samsung released
this update for android 4.3 jellybean to
international handset owners users that
install the software notice several
issues with their phones some of those
problems included reduce battery life
app crashes inconsistent Wi-Fi
connections laggy performance and even
complete lockdowns on the device on lock
screens that can only be solved by
pulling out and reinserting the battery
so how does android reach the next
billion users some people believe the
Moto G is a good start so although
Samsung dominates the budget handset
market currently none of their
affordable devices can compare to the
moto g's value offer consider this chart
created by our own Android authorities
andra crush you can see here that with
the moto g's quad-core better RAM and
battery life make it a compelling offer
considering the low price point move it
onto Google search on android google
search three-point 1.8 bring several
improvements to devices running 4.1
jelly bean or later including new
designs and feature
this is right from google if you are a
fan of a particular blog the website
update card can bring you things like
the latest post so you'll never miss a
story and the news topic can bring you
fresh articles from the web on topics
you care about the what to watch card
gives you movie and TV recommendations
when you're staying in now you know
we've got to talk about how cyanogen mod
installer arrived to Google Play to grab
the app you simply need to head over to
Google Play keep in mind that the app is
useless without the required PC
Companion program which is available
directly from cyanogenmod website so
what does the Installer actually do
basically it automates the entire
sandage and mod installation process
requiring very little knowledge from the
end user the Installer even handles
routing your handset and unlocking the
bootloader all you needed is a supported
device a USB cable and of course windows
am at client is also in the works but
isn't quite ready yet now if that news
did not tickle your pickle you may like
to know that there is a rumor emphasis
on rumor that sentence mod is working on
their own phone different from the Oppo
and one that will run cyanogenmod right
out of the box and is priced very
attractively meaning culpable to the
price of the Nexus 5 at about three
hundred fifty dollars the rumor makes no
mention of the hardware partner that
will build the same device though the
obvious candidate is Oppo though we
should take this rumor with a grain of
salt creating their own device isn't the
next logical step for this antigen team
alright guys so I read all the comments
that I got the message loud and clear
you would really like me to go into
detail about why OEMs and device
manufacturers cannot release an android
update at a reasonable time we're going
to go into that in depth this wednesday
for android QA</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
