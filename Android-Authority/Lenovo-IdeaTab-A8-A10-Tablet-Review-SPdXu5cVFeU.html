Android authority and usually when we
think of budget or cheap not a whole lot
of good really comes with it but Lenovo
seems to believe they can offer up some
really nice tablets for a very
affordable price but let's find out how
good they actually are let's take a look
at the Lenovo tab a8 and the Lenovo Tab
A 10 alright so let's get right into it
starting off with the design in both the
a8 and a10 feature a pretty simplistic
design with some slight curves on the
corners and sides nothing too special
that's going to make it stand out or
anything but it's practical and it gets
the job done
and for many people that is all that
really matters anyways they're both
entirely made of plastic but they feel
very solid and well-made and the matte
finish on the back does a great job of
detracting fingerprints all while giving
the tablets a very nice grip making them
easy to hold on to they're not the
thinnest tablets in the world both
coming in at roughly 9 millimeters but
they're fairly lightweight for their
respective sizes making them very easy
to carry around and hold onto for long
periods of time the bezels around the
display are a little large for my liking
but they do serve a purpose besides
being a nice spot to rest your thumbs
they also house the front-facing
speakers that are actually enhanced with
Dolby Digital Plus so you actually get a
Dolby audio interface built-in for
controlling the audio fidelity whether
you're listening through headphones or
these speakers themselves it's
essentially just an equaliser app as far
as I can tell but it does make quite a
bit of a difference in terms of how loud
and fuller everything sounds
both tablets with their respective
display sizes feature the same
resolution at 1280 by 800 which is a
rather typical resolution when it comes
to more mid-range tablets it's not
anything that will blow you away and
pixels are noticeable especially on the
10-inch model where the pixel density
takes a much bigger hit but it's
certainly more than passable with great
colors viewing angles and brightness so
I don't think many people will have too
much of a problem with it while I do
wish the resolution was a little bit
higher it didn't detract much from my
overall viewing experience whether it
was playing games or watching videos on
the inside both the a8 and a10 are being
powered by MediaTek processor clocked at
1.3 gigahertz with one gigabyte of RAM
and 8 or 16 gigs of internal storage on
the a8 and 16 or 32 gigs of storage on
the a10 with microSD card expansion on
both up to 32 gigs the specs sound
really generic but general performance
through day-to-day usage has been far
better than I've expected it to be it
probably also helps out they're both
running KitKat but we'll get to that in
a sec swiping through home screens
opening up apps and browsing through the
web was all fairly smooth and quick and
multitasking was also not much of an
issue either I do notice a few hiccups
every now and then but nothing that
really took away from my overall
experience whether these tablets
struggle most is in gaming performance
more simplistic games play just fine
no real problems there but with
graphically demanding titles while
certainly more than playable I do notice
some lag and the occasional drop frame
especially when there's a lot of stuff
happening on the screen at one time the
camera around back of both of these
tablets is extremely basic it's a 5
megapixel fixed-focus shooter and no LED
flash like most tablet cameras it's not
going to replace the camera on your
smartphone which is most likely better
anyways but it's a nice secondary option
if you really need it
Lenovo's camera UI is just as basic in
bare-bones as the camera itself there's
a few basic shooting modes like panorama
HDR and beauty face but nothing too
unique that's worth mentioning if you're
planning on uploading these photos to
social networks the camera is certainly
good enough for the
at but really not much better for
anything else with only five megapixels
you don't have much to work with as far
as zooming and cropping goes and photos
lack a lot of detail sharpness and
dynamic range is pretty bad
it also doesn't get any better in low
light especially when you don't have a
flash to compensate leading to a lot of
dark and grainy looking shots and
without a variable focus taking clear
close-up shots become virtually
impossible the a 8 and a 10 compact with
some decently sized batteries at 4200
milliamp hours and six thousand three
hundred forty million hours respectively
and battery life isn't terrible but I've
certainly gotten better on other tablets
like I mentioned before I'm a pretty
heavy user when it comes to tablets I
primarily only use them for gaming and
watching videos on YouTube but even with
my usage I only managed to get between
six to six and a half hours of screen on
time on both so it felt a little bit
short of what I was expecting I was
hoping for between 7 to 8 hours but on
the positive side these tablets do idle
extremely well losing only between 1 to
2 percent overnight and if you're a
lighter more average user you're
probably going to get a little bit more
out of the battery than I was able to so
like I mentioned earlier the a 8 and a
10 are running on the latest version of
Android with 4.4.2 kitkat so it's nice
to see Lenovo keep these tablets up to
date even if they are mid-range tablets
but not only is it running KitKat it's a
mostly stock version of KitKat which was
very nice to see there are some lenovo
customizations namely the custom
launcher that's filled with a lot of
very bright and colorful looking icons
and this very weird sliding pane that
comes out from the left or right edge of
the display that gives you access to
some recently open apps but you can't
actually use it for multitasking because
you can only get to it when you're on
your home screen the good thing is
lenovo does give you the option to
disable it if you don't like it there's
also no app drawer so your home screens
will get cluttered up very quickly if
you like to download a lot of apps but
this is Android afterall so if you don't
like Lenovo zone launcher and want a
more standard Android experience just
download a different one from the Play
Store in problem solved
the Lenovo tab a eight and a ten are
available now for a price of one seventy
nine ninety nine and two forty nine
ninety nine respectively and they're
both currently on sale through Amazon as
of right now if you want to take
advantage of that price they both come
in Wi-Fi only in 3G models but as far as
I can tell the 3G model is either really
hard to find or currently not available
either way I think the price is pretty
fair for what you're getting and the
overall specs are actually very
comparable to something like the Galaxy
Tab four line of tablets which I
reviewed earlier and in some ways
they're actually better like the
front-facing speakers and the higher
resolution camera so if you were
considering a tablet from the Galaxy Tab
four line but the price was a little bit
too steep the Lenovo Tab a eight and a
ten are certainly great alternatives
that won't put such a big dent on your
wallet but that is it for this review of
the Lenovo Tab a eight and a ten there's
a lot of things that these tablets do
really well and a lot of things that
they do not so well but at the end the
day I think they're pretty fairly priced
for what they're capable of and are a
perfect example of you get what you pay
for anyways thank you so much for
