authority what's going on everybody and
here we're taking a look at the ZTE
grand s3 what we have here is a 5.5 inch
screen on the front powered with Full HD
resolution and we're taking a look at
the back real quick I wanted to show you
this soft touch vacuum that's here that
is actually removable I'm going to go
ahead and remove that here there you go
and we have the removable vacuum right
here that has a removable and
replaceable battery along with the dual
SIM setup that's down here on the bottom
but the backing itself is of a soft
touch material which is really nice in
the hand and I get a little bit smudgy
from time to time but that's what we
expect from a soft touch backing but
nonetheless it's a very attractive
looking device at 5.5 inches with a
metal frame all around with the power
button and the volume rocker right here
on the side the power button falling in
a very nice place in order for you to
get at it really easily and here's the
full HD screen I'm gonna go and unlock
the phone and we're just gonna go
through some of the elements the
Snapdragon 801 powers this KitKat
version of ZTE sui and as you can see
there's no app drawer but you will be
able to get some organisation done using
folders and whatnot gained through the
settings you call it you I'm going to go
ahead and show you just inside of the
settings the security area that already
shows you the sky lock and sky eye areas
now sky is what we're going to be
focusing on it's an eye print that
you'll be able to use in order to unlock
the phone using your own eyes in order
to do so
but just going through a few of the
elements before I get into the actual
eye printing the colorful UI over here
and these capacitive buttons here on the
bottom three gigabytes of RAM will allow
you to have multitasking on here and a
pretty easy fashion if you can see we
already have some apps in the background
going already
I'm just going to just clear all of
those you can see that happen but yeah
the design itself is actually quite nice
but the features are obviously what is
underneath sound is as you can see down
here enhanced by Dolby and really the
main crux of this particular device is
its security features which I'm going to
show you
right now alright so here we are taking
a look at the eye printing technology
I'll go ahead and jump into the
notification drop-down to get easily to
the settings it's a nice little
transition that they have that I
actually like the way that ZTE shows the
quick settings panel but coming down to
security is where we're going to find
here the sky I as it is called in the
settings area I'm going to go ahead and
go there I'm going to change the eye ID
from the one that our presenter already
had confirm our pattern and I'm going to
go ahead and erase the existing eye
print in order to create mine so you'll
see it happening in real time over here
alright position my eyes in the window
there now what's actually happening here
is that a 20 second video is actually
scanning not only the how my eyes look
but actually zooming in using the 8
megapixel optics on the front-facing
camera and you know in order to see the
blood vessels inside of my eyeballs now
I actually have glasses on but the edge
I'm going to show you in a little bit I
am NOT going to have a problem with that
if I take off my glasses so there we are
we have the sky eye idea already set up
I'm going to lock the phone right now
and when you unlock the phone you swipe
down from the top
now considering you're already going to
be looking at your phone the moment you
unlock it's kind of nice that you're
just going to use your eyes to unlock it
and then you'll be able to get into what
you need to do right away oops it timed
out there here you go
position wise
and there you go now take a second there
because I blinked but as you continue to
use the eye printing on this it will get
better and better because each time it
scans your eyes in order to unlock the
phone it updates the scan I already
mentioned that the front facing optics
are of an 8 megapixel resolution and
that is really great for a front facing
camera we're gonna go ahead and jump
into that camera real quick after I had
just shown you the eye printing or the
sky eye that is there so this is the
camera interface here I'll just bring
that around everybody and you can see
the settings here you have 8 megapixels
there at 4 by 3 6 for 16 by 9 video
capabilities are 1080p on the front
facing camera so it's a pretty powerful
camera optic package that is on the
front that is able to do the eye
printing that you just saw me
demonstrates if I bring it back around
will have a pro mode in the rear-facing
camera which is always great and if I
wanted to have a leveler on here some
manual focusing there's a lot of
different little elements that kind of
get out of the way and transitions
aren't keeping it from doing what it
needs to do in a faster matte fashion I
should say and going into the 16
megapixels is the resolution on the back
at sixteen by nine twelve four four by
three and you also have u HD resolution
for video capture so we have a pretty
powerful camera package on here
obviously we're going to reserve our
camera picture quality opinions until we
get our own review unit and be able to
take pictures with it but nonetheless
that is the camera experience on the ZTE
grand s3 and it's just that easy the
grand s3 by ZTE has that new security
feature in there and I'm sure it's going
to be a pretty fun one to use but it's
also very good for security if you want
to make sure that other people are gonna
keep their prying eyes away from your
device this is Josh super guard from
Android authority here at MWC 2015 we're
hanging out was ute taking a look at the
grand s3 with brand new eye print
technology in the front-facing 8
megapixel camera so keep it tuned to
Android Authority for even more and stay
tuned for our future review of this
particular device and remember that we
are your source for all things MWC 2015</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
