you're watching this video you probably
love phones but today I'm going to see
what the general public thinks of these
phones the Samsung Galaxy s7 edge and
the LG g5 I'm going to try to get some
iPhone users some Android users just a
good mix of people and see what they
think of them hello everybody it's
crystal or from Android authority and
I'm here with David Chuck
Jonathan Neil Courtney Liam Scarlett and
today we're taking a look at the Samsung
Galaxy s7 edge and seeing what people
think about it you want to just play
around with it and let me know your
first thoughts I like that it's really
just light it's super light super smooth
well if I don't like the camera I'm not
going to like it well it's really very
colourful um I was interesting that it's
got a curved screen that's I guess the
first thing that stands out to me I
don't know seems fine I think the way it
feels though because this one that's
like a straight rectangle this one like
I guess the edges to make it like easier
to hold it's kind of hard to figure out
like my way around the menu screen it
was actually my phone I probably figure
my way around it but it's brighter than
my screen I like it I would never go to
a hand Roy but I like it
have you ever used like an Android phone
before I haven't no my first smartphone
was an iPhone so have you ever used an
Android phone before never 5c correct
yeah I'm currently using a Sony Xperia
so I'm definitely team Android all the
way but I've never seen the Samsung edge
this is cool and what do you think of
like these curved edges on the side I
really like that I think it looks cool
yeah the curve the curve feature is
interesting I like it though I think I
don't like how it curves over I feel
like I'm gonna break it cuz I need like
a case then it goes over the side cuz I
drop it all the time but like it's
pretty cool uh but it's like giving me
weird vibes cuz like I'm turning so like
see the glare whoa that's really flat
they're really stepping up their game um
it's kind of cool I don't know curves
with the curved edge like that's kinda
neat guys different yeah definitely oh
my gosh this camera is awesome yeah the
picture quality is a lot better than the
iPhone that I have
take a selfie oh now I'm like the way I
look um well it's it's a newer phone so
it's just a better camera better
resolution yeah that's that's kind of
all I have to say camera was a pretty
nice I don't know I like the iPhone
camera a lot but this is nice nice it's
really clear it's also good lighting so
I don't know yeah what do you think let
me take out my phone for good hair yeah
I can't even see my phone and you can't
even see it
well you can that's a huge difference
it's also like kind of see those much
more close-up yeah yes you like the
picture quality is different my iPhone
looks a little foggy blurry even and
then this phone is a lot sharper clearer
can you see the pimples on my face on
your phone this is a lot better than
that one better this is a lot better
it's okay yeah I like this camera a lot
you okay all right you see it's like a
wider angle and you see like a like a
little bit this is like a it's almost as
good as like a canon camera and I have
to shoot videos for class I would
totally use this phone instead of
getting a camera um I don't know if you
guys have seen that meme about Android
cameras though but how come your
snapchat videos still seem like world
war ii documentaries yeah yeah they're
anything like is being done about that
there's one more thing about this one
they're going to show you oh I'll let
you hold it to your water yes let's do
that pour water on it we like to hold
your hand out real quick like as far
than you know if we're not about to do
this
no kami yeah like is it gonna breathe
you could turn it around too with the
camera there we go
the phone will be oh my god get the
water on anywhere you can turn it around
Oh completely oh wow that's it
what oh oh yes yes baby bye y'all
fire back this is like this is some like
22nd centuries I mean it's the future so
yeah oh my oh my gosh Wow
oh my god so so it's not like broke oh
my god just like picked up phone's dry
and like it you're like wow that's a
game-changer that's really cool that
something iPhone definitely doesn't have
so um I'm gonna go later
well that was interesting
now let's move on to the LG g5 so we're
gonna see what Katrina thinks of the LG
g5 you're currently using an iPhone
correct and what phone are you currently
using right now I have the iPhone
have you used Android before um long
time ago ever since I um upgraded to
iPhone I haven't went back are you
coming from a four yes 4s I've only ever
had an iPhone well it fits in my hand
just like kind of like the galaxy s6
it's a little big
okay so you use the galaxy s6 oh you're
familiar with Android kind of course
yeah not team iPhone definitely not part
of the bandwagon it's really weird that
the lock buttons on the back but it's
also kind of cool like if I had a
fingerprint right Oh
deparvine is actually the binary yeah or
worse a lock button on this is its it is
a power button on the back oh is that
word is that what that is yeah there's
that button right on right on the back
over here I mean for me it's a little
bit out of the way I'm like I mean I'm
used to like my iPhone which is just the
thumb it's kind of like weird though
like where it is like I don't really put
my finger there I mean I don't know
that's pretty cool then cuz I feel like
that oh that's pretty cool I feel like
that might be better I use this before
like stealthy I actually really like it
because it's like hidden not
lot of people would like know it's there
unless you have the phone I mean kind of
suck if this is on your desk then you're
trying to use it and then you have to
unlock it with the button on the back
but oh man I guess it's a nice feature I
think that's kind of weird especially if
you're like trying to pull your phone
out quickly to just do that compared to
like the thumbprint do you have
different emojis on those yeah I could
he has an Android I found the same size
as my iPhone oh you have the 6s yeah
okay I like how the screen isn't like
super big gets a good size it's really
thin lightweight I really like it nice
design feels nice in the hand it's light
it's pretty big you know it's definitely
a lot sleeker than the iPhone the screen
kind of feels plasticky though like a
little it feels kind of cheap
I feel like does it have a good nice
heavy feel like the iPhone has so what
is with the looks like some paint
chipped off or something right there on
both sides like that yeah a lot of
people don't like that I don't know
looks kind of cheap is that like the
antennas I'm not a big fan that there's
no buttons on the bottom of the screen
because I have the s6 edge I like how
like there's no like buttons on it
that's one thing I don't like about an
iPhone is I don't like the button get
sticks a lot and I like how it's all
touchscreen I don't like how it doesn't
have any physical buttons but do all
Android phones have don't have physical
buttons or some do Samson yeah Samsung
Galaxy guys but how good is the camera
let's take a look at the camera see the
camera up here you can see this phone
actually has two cameras on the back so
I'll let you so said I'm not bad it
definitely looks gives you more depth
okay so we're in the wide-angle camera
CeCe's help you get a lot in the shot
yeah this might be a better camera than
iPhone game whoa that's pretty wide
that's a really nice camera much more
than my iPhone camera like I was two
cameras it looks kind of fisheye this
one it's almost like a fisheye view of
your phone without any attachments
sometimes you take like a panorama you
don't really need the whole thing so you
stop it like a quarter of the way
through so this would be like perfect
and also a big thing with this phone
it's a modular phone which is just a
fancy way of saying that it comes apart
you can add other things to it oh really
I'll show you how to do a jeweler's loan
but the big thing is that it has a
removable battery so if you I'll let you
hold that you could just swap it out if
you've run out of battery for a new
battery and
I really like that because phone
batteries die so easily that you don't
always have a charger on you so this is
like perfect that you can just buy two
batteries keep one fully charged that's
good I'm a backpacker a lot so like I go
hiking and everything that'd be really
cool if my phone died and I needed my
phone as directions or some that's
really nice that's cool I know I dropped
my phones and water a lot so that would
really help with putting it in a bag or
ice because you can't really take the
battery out of my phone's this looks
really cool I like a lot actually cuz I
know I run out like bad with my iPhone
and I have no charger nearby I don't
have a spare battery so it's kind of a
pain if I want to if I need use it in a
bind I can't really do that but this
definitely can do that I'm always on the
go either working or at school so I
think that's really convenient I work at
a zip line and my battery I was a
photographer there always dies and if I
can easily just swap batteries and
continue using my phone that's never
definitely helped out awesome I really
do like it though
