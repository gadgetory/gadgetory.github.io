handy the Android authority app guy and
it's about that time to round up the
best new Android apps from June of 2016
after three long years of silence it
seems as though ADW launcher is finally
making a comeback the 2.0 version of the
launcher is currently in beta in the
Google Play Store and features quite a
large selection of new features along
with a new UI the better complements
today's material design some of the new
features include a custom widget
mechanic where you can create widgets or
use widgets that others have created a
bunch of new customization features and
there is now a backup manager if you
want to try it out for yourself
you can join the beta using the link in
the video description below cambree is a
new camera application that features a
ton of live photo filters there are 130
filters in total to choose from which is
an absurd amount to begin with and they
range between a number of various styles
colors and techniques it's probably not
something that serious photographers
would enjoy but these kind of filters
can be fun for things like social media
images or for adding a little bit of
color to your day it also comes with
some minor editing tools if you need to
make a quick adjustment after a photo is
taken tango is an application that helps
you find emoji stickers gifs and other
various forms of media the premise is
that you can use it in any application
to find the stuff you want to find
without opening any other application
the chips are sourced through jiffy and
it worked in pretty much every messaging
service that we tried without too many
problems it could be fun if you engage
with that kind of content often it is
free to use for now but it may have
in-app purchases in the future flamingo
for Twitter is a newer Twitter
application that seems to check all of
the right boxes it features material
design theming and multi-account support
that all work together to provide a
pretty decent Twitter experience along
with that there is built-in jiffy
support some additional customization
features and its focus on simplicity
means that it's relatively easy to use H
account can be individually themed which
we thought was a nice touch it's $0.99
but it's also still in beta so do beware
of those bugs flatland is a 2d live
wallpaper that features beautifully done
silhouetted nature scenes
it features three scenes in total
including an African landscape flamingo
and a forest scene it comes with a
variety of customization options and you
can even change the color of each
individual scene the developers have
also stated that more animated scenes
are coming in future updates the muted
colors and smooth animation making an
excellent choice without being too
flashy and it's relatively inexpensive
boomerang notifications is a fun little
app that helps you store your
notifications to remind you to do things
later on the basic idea is that you
activate the app and when you get a
notification you get the option to put
it away in boomerang until you feel like
dealing with it boomerang isn't the
first app to do this but this one is
completely free and seems to work well
for the most part it doesn't work with
all notifications but it works well
enough with them most of the time
footage camera is another newer camera
application that focuses on simplicity
and function it features the camera to
API which means it allows for manual
camera controls if your phone Hardware
supports it it also allows you to create
animated gifs record video in slow
motion and you can separate the focal
point from the exposure point similar to
the 1+3 camera software if you get the
pro version there are some additional
features that you can get including a
histogram and better image quality as
for the shot if you're looking for
something new
good morning alarm clock is an alarm
application that tries to wake you up in
a more intelligent fashion the basic
idea is that you sleep with your phone
in the bed and when the phone detects
enough movement it makes an alarm go off
so that you're woken up at your lightest
phase of sleep it has positive reviews
so far but apps like this can vary
greatly from person to person so your
mileage may vary it's free to download
so there's no harm in checking it out
and who knows it may work for you as
well whether mate is a free weather
application that really likes to keep it
simple it has some material design
elements along with some euy design
elements that really gives it a clean
and colorful look it's a single page app
so everything you need is right there on
the front page and that includes current
weather the future forecast and the
hourly forecast it won't replace
anything more complex but it's hard to
beat this one if you need weather at a
glance this way for Facebook is a new
Facebook application that just seems to
do it right it features material design
and includes a floating action button
swiping tabs and a slightly more logical
layout
it also has Facebook messenger access at
least for right now you can theme the
application using a variety of color
options and you can
the layout style as well the pro version
gives you access to more customization
options more layout styles and more
themes it's pretty good and worth a shot
if you want a different Facebook
experience and that about does it for
this one folks we also have the best
android games of the month on our
youtube channel if you want to check it
out don't forget that the download links
for all of these applications are in the
video description below and keep it
tuned to android authority because we
are your source for all things Android
thanks again for watching everybody and
have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
