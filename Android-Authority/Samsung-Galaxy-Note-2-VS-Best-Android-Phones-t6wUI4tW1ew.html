reporting live from berlin with Aoife
we've been lucky enough to be invited to
a pre briefing here with Samsung and
we're just taking a look at all these
different devices anyway obviously we're
here for one reason and we're here for
this device this is the Galaxy Note 2
now it's got a 5.5 inch screen corporal
device obviously zs3 which feels large
for some people but with comparing to
the note 2 obviously you can see that
it's substantially larger really good
for a lot of people who love to consume
content web browsing watching movies all
that kind of stuff now another device
that we're going to take a look at right
here is the Galaxy Nexus now the Galaxy
Nexus is interesting because it's also
made by samsung and now it's actually
thicker device but it's got a 4.6 inch
screen rocking at 1280 by 720 AMOLED
display and what we have here is a 1280
by 720 display too but in the 5.5 inch
really really responsive with this
quad-core 1.6 gigahertz processor two
gigs around on board to an eight
megapixel image since from the rear and
a 2-megapixel for the front but it's
just smooth as butter now another cool
thing that we forgot to mention is that
it's actually running android 4.1 jelly
bean out-of-the-box it's likely to go on
sale about three weeks four weeks after
its initial unveiling here that's going
to happen officially at 7pm tonight
I know we're just taking a quick look
this is the Galaxy Nexus just for
perspective so you can get a sense what
it's like in hand both of these are
packing Android 4.1 jelly bean on them
right now really impress the benchmarks
is this 1.6 gigahertz eyes I mean we're
seeing 13,500 922 so anyway just to give
you guys an idea of what it's like in
the hand you know it's quite a
substantial device but if you're hooked
to the internet as much as we are here
to android authority that big screen
with this five and a half inch profile
is going to be really really good for
you anyway guys galaxy note 2 it's gonna
be awesome big fan of what we're seeing
so far thanks for checking in hundred
