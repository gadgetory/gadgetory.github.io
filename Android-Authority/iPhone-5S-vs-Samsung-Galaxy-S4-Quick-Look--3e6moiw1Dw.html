best eight stretch of Agartha man's
right authority what's going on
everybody and this is the Apple iPhone
5s up against the samsung galaxy s4 in
this quick look of course we're dealing
with two different size markets here
with the iPhone 5s keeping to the
original four inch form factor and the
Samsung flagship being one of the many
5-inch screen devices available but in
terms of their pedigrees both of these
phones can be described as updated
versions of their former selves in the
iPhone 5s we get the same aluminum clad
body with the same flat profile with
rounded corners it's easy to handle in
one hand as all elements are reachable
from a neutral grip otherwise the button
layout is pretty much the same all over
with the front home button no longer
concave in order to aid with its
fingerprint reading the galaxy s4 takes
on a similar trend by being pretty much
the same as its predecessor in design it
does get a larger screen but its
footprint is the same as the galaxy s3
glossy plastic is Samsung's Forte and
thus you get a fingerprint prone and
somewhat slippery feel one-handed
operation is definitely possible with
the s4 but it is definitely pushing the
boundaries on ease its button layout is
classic Samsung including the home
button up front flanked by a couple
capacitive keys the screens really make
these two devices while the size you
want will depend on your viewing desires
it's fair to say that both of these
displays do well by their respective
markets the smaller retina display is
capable of 11 36 by 640 resolution at
326 PPI and is adequately bright even in
broad daylight it does real justice to
the newly colorful iOS 7 and media
viewing is still an enjoyable experience
this display does continue the tradition
of iPhone 5s display quality so those
who have used the original know what to
expect here but then you get into the
larger 5 inch Super AMOLED screen of the
galaxy s4 even if the size isn't
completely for you it's hard not to
enjoy the viewing experience on a 1080p
display this Oubre colorful TouchWiz UI
really pops out of the screen and
everything from watching videos and
reading text is a joy ultimately it
comes down to what you want in both size
and display if you're not totally
convinced to the 5 inch form factor
there are plenty of other smaller
screens in the Android space but the
iPhone deserves to be called one of the
easiest to use smaller devices but there
are just as many people who flocked a
larger to the larger screens and the
Galaxy s4 is one of the best to use and
handle
in performance both phones promised to
bring greater performance in their
updated packages whereas the stamps on
galaxy s4 took to the more powerful
quad-core Snapdragon 600 clocked in at
1.9 gigahertz Apple took to an updated
dual-core 64-bit a7 that hopes to
preempt an upcoming shift in smartphone
computing while there is no doubt that
the current crop of Snapdragon
processors is very fast and the Galaxy
s4 is a prime example of this the f-15s
introduces one of the first processors
that will handle the higher memory
demanding futures of ours ecosystems
it's a change that won't seem overtly
obvious to the general consumer but
expect to hear about 64-bit packages a
lot in the coming year nonetheless the
iPhone 5s flies through its operating
system and should bring good and
reliable performance to its users we are
looking at two different ecosystems and
thus different kinds of demands here but
nonetheless both of these phones perform
within them very well in hardware the
iPhones unibody design keeps it from
having expandable storage or a removable
battery both things that the galaxy s4
can boast with its removable back cover
with a slightly larger battery than
before the 5s can get a little bit extra
longevity but having a spare battery for
the s4 is always a plus Apple did add in
a fingerprint scanner within the home
button and while it is a cool feature to
have I didn't feel it really added to
the unlocking experience you have to get
it just right the first time or you're
just gonna get delayed trying to do so
the galaxy s4 on the other hand added in
a ton of sensors to enhance the
navigation experience sensors for air
and hand gestures are available as well
as barometers and thermometers for
gauging your general surroundings when
it comes to cameras the 5s did get a bit
of a boost but it's mostly in its new
app the 8 megapixel optics are largely
the same good performer as before but
its interface has been updated into a
much nicer looking and functional design
with a swipe you can change the modes
that now include a square mode or for
Instagram photos slow motion video
capture and a bunch of live filters it's
a matter of quantity for the 13
megapixel shooter in the galaxy s4 which
comes with so much from dual recording
to drama in eraser modes picture quality
can go quite head-to-head between these
two devices as both of these phones
produce very good photos that have been
well received since their predecessors
finally in software the 5s brings an all
new looking iOS innovation with a
flatter interface that includes
translucent effects its overall more
vibrance and much nicer to look at
especially considering how the operating
system has started to show its age it
does also bring additions of the control
center and the updated Notification
Center but overall the general
experience is still the same this can
also be said for the updated TouchWiz in
the galaxy s4 however which brought a
slew of new ways of getting around the
phone but overall looks and feels just
like previous Samsung UIs while on the
one hand we see a much different looking
but still familiar feeling experience
the other adds new ways of getting
around but is still overall a familiar
feeling experience and so there you have
it two of the top smartphones in the
market today
what we find in these two iterations is
an updated version of what we might
already know and whether or not they're
enough to warrant a jump is up to you
we're going to have a more in-depth
comparison between these two phones soon
