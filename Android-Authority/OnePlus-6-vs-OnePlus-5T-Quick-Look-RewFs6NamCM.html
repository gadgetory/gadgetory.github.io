what's different about it and how does
it compare to last year's one plus 5t
let's take a look in this quick
comparison spoiler alert
not a whole lot one of the biggest and
most notable change between the 1 plus 6
and the 1 plus 5t is really all on the
outside the 1 plus 6 uses a mostly glass
design whereas the 1 plus 5t wasn't all
metal unibody design so the 1 plus 6
sort of follows in the same sort of
design footsteps as the Samsung Galaxy s
9 the LG G 7th in Q and even the Apple
iPhone 8 and iPhone 10 so it has glass
on the front and back and metal rails
along the sides and it still feels
really sturdy and high-quality build
quality has never really been an issue
with oneplus phones but this is very
different from last year's design and I
think a lot of people are going to be
pretty split on how they feel about this
new design some people may like it more
and some people may not like it quite as
much you'll also notice that the cameras
on the back have been repositioned
they're in the middle now instead of in
the left corner and they also change the
shape of the fingerprint sensor to more
of an oblong shape instead of a circle
but this doesn't really affect any
functionality whatsoever it's just an
aesthetic difference one design change
that I actually like a lot is the
relocation of the notification slider on
the 1 plus 6 it's now on the right side
whereas with previous 1 plus devices
it's been on the left and this may not
sound like that big of a deal but having
it on the right side makes it a lot
easier to reach with your thumb whereas
before you had to awkwardly reach it
with your middle finger or your index
finger or use your other hands so I like
this change a lot it may sound pretty
minor but it makes a pretty big
difference the screen on the oneplus 6
now has a notch and depending on how you
feel about notches you may or may not
like that but oneplus does give you the
option to hide it if you don't but
otherwise it's still pretty much the
same as the 1 + 5 T it is a little bit
taller at 19 by 9 but it's still a 1080p
display and it's still an AMOLED display
that's very vibrant and gorgeous now of
course with the oneplus 6 being a brand
new flagship smartphone you have updated
specs for 20
so you have these snaps during an 8:45
processor along with six or eight
gigabytes of RAM whereas the one plus 5t
had the Snapdragon 835 you also have 64
or 128 gigabyte storage options but this
year one plus has stepped it up a notch
no pun intended and has added a 256
gigabyte option as well the 1 + 6 + 1 +
5 t have the same 3300 milliamp hour
battery but unfortunately there's still
no wireless charging even though the 1 +
6 has a glass back now and it also isn't
IP certified but oneplus does say that
it carries some sort of resistance to
water despite not having an official IP
certification as far as the cameras are
concerned the oneplus 6 carries the same
16 and 20 megapixel combo as last year's
5 T but this time around they've added
optical image stabilization and made the
pixels 19% larger so it should perform
better in low light they've also added
some new features like 4k video
recording at 60fps and improved portrait
mode effects so you can add stuff like
hearts or stars to your portrait mode
bokeh there's really no surprises when
it comes to the software on the 1 + 6 +
5 T again they're pretty much identical
here you have oxygen OS running on
Android 8.1 so it's that same clean sock
like Android experience with the same
oxygen OS features but with the oneplus
6 you will have the option of running
the Android P beta when the phone
launches if you want to get a head start
on using Android P but that's pretty
much it for this quick comparison
between the 1 + 6 and the 1 + 5 t if you
own a 5 T do you think this will be
worth the upgrade and you think some of
the changes that oneplus has made are
better or worse let us know in the
