gain some traction in the US market and
the xperia x z is their newest flagship
for the second half of 2016 from a
design standpoint it's been refreshed in
a few different ways but it still has
that signature rectangular slab look
that makes it easily recognizable as a
Sony phone the XZ is made from a
combination of materials with glass on
the front and all metal backplate and
plastic along the sides it has what sony
calls a loop design which basically
means that the sides are rounded and
tapered towards the front in the back to
make the transition between the
different materials feel more seamless
and also gives the phone a very
comfortable feel in the hand the build
quality is what you expect from Sony it
feels very sturdy and because it only
has a 5.2 inch display it's generally
pretty easy to operate in one hand it
comes in a few different colors like
blue silver and this black version that
you see here and the black is more of a
satin finish it's not super glossy but
it does still tend to pick up
fingerprints but overall the black on
black gives us phone a very sleek and
stealthy look because the back is
completely made of metal with no plastic
breaks or inserts the NFC chip is not on
the back of this phone where we normally
expect it to be and instead has been
moved to the front next to the
front-facing camera this isn't the first
time that we've seen Sony do this but it
does make tapping this phone to other
devices or payment terminals a little
bit more awkward
unlike the ex compact that was announced
right alongside the x/z the XZ is ip68
dust and water resistant which means you
can dunk it in water and use it in the
rain and it'll be perfectly fine going
around the device you have the headphone
jack
up top USB type-c port on the bottom a
SIM card slot that also doubles as a
micro SD card slot on the left and
finally on the right side you have the
power button volume rocker and sony
signature dedicated camera shortcut key
now I said this in the xperia x compact
review and I'll say here again for the
Xperia XZ having the dedicated camera
shortcut key is a very convenient and
quick way to get into the camera but
having the power button volume rocker
and camera key all on one side makes the
whole right side of the phone feel very
cluttered sony puts the volume buttons
by the camera key to
controlling digital zoom with the camera
feel much more natural but for
controlling volume it's very awkward and
uncomfortable to press with your thumb
the xperia x ease power button does
function as a fingerprint sensor but
just like the X compact and previous
devices that Sony has released here in
the States the US version will not come
with a fingerprint sensor and it's
unfortunate because fingerprint sensors
are starting to become the norm and a
lot of smartphones and sony hasn't
exactly made it clear why it's getting
left out audio is a pretty big part of
the experience on the Xperia XZ by
plugging in a pair of headphones you can
take advantage of the XDS built-in
support for high res audio files like
flak and it can upscale any compressed
music files to give it more of a
high-res sound the xperia x ii also has
two small slits that sit above and below
the display for stereo front-facing
speakers which sound great and don't get
distorted but in comparison to something
like the Nexus 6p they aren't anywhere
near as loud and don't have as much
low-end punch
the 5.2 inch display uses LCD technology
with a resolution of 1080p which some
may be disappointed by simply because
most high-end flagships if not all of
them are coming with quad HD displays
but unless you plan on using this phone
for VR you're not going to notice any
difference the screen still looks plenty
sharp for comfortable reading text and
web browsing has excellent viewing
angles and is surprisingly very vibrant
it gets plenty bright that is easily
viewable outdoors and you also have the
usual white balance controls and Sony's
x-reality engine built in to give you a
sharper and more natural-looking image
when looking at photos and videos
there's also some benefits to having a
lower resolution display one of those
benefits is performance the XC has three
gigabytes of RAM instead of the usual
four that we've been getting accustomed
to on flagships but it does come with
the Snapdragon 820 which we all know is
a great processor with a 1080p panel the
processor won't have to work as hard to
push all those pixels so you'll
generally get much smoother gameplay and
graphics performance because there's
less strain on the GPU and gameplay on
the XC is definitely very smooth games
look great and I never noticed any
stutters or drop frames with high-end
games day to day operations such as web
browsing opening apps checking emails
watching videos has also been very
smooth and despite having three
gigabytes of RAM I haven't managed to
slow this phone down with heavy amounts
of multitasking the software also plays
a big part in why this phone performs so
well it's running Android 6.0
marshmallow but Sony's custom skin but
Sony has scaled back a lot of their
customizations to keep the experience
fairly light you still have Sony's own
launcher settings menu app icons and a
built in theme engine but the majority
of the experience feels very close to
stock and they've even added the Google
now homescreen into their own launcher
that makes it feel even more like stock
Android even though this phone is
unlocked and free of carriers it does
come with quite a few pre-installed
bloatware applications like AVG
protection Amazon shopping and Sony's
own list of apps but otherwise it's a
very clean and simple Android experience
at 2,900 milliamp hours the xperia x II
has a relatively small battery in
comparison to a lot of flagships out
there but it's been more than good
enough to last me comfortably through a
day but don't expect it to last much
more
beyond just a single day even with a few
hours of gaming per day on top of the
usual social media email and texting I
still manage at least 12 hours off the
charger which is definitely not bad for
heavy usage so I could imagine this
phone lasting much longer for people who
don't play a lot of games or videos on
their smart phone it does come a quick
charge 3.0 to make it easy and quick to
charge back up but if you're really
hurting for battery life and can't get
to a charger you do have Sony's usual
stamina and ultra stamina modes that
limit certain functions and performance
in favor of longer battery life Sony's
been known to make some really great
camera sensors for smartphones however
when it came to their own smartphones
they never managed to get the camera
quite right but they've made a lot of
improvements to this new sensor on the
XZ it's sharing the same 23 megapixel
rear camera as the smaller X compact
with five axis image stabilization and
we've added a new laser autofocus sensor
and a color sensor to help you get the
most accurate white balance no matter
the lighting situation something to know
about the five axis image stabilization
is that it's purely software based so
there's no physical moving parts here to
make this all happen and the five axis
image stabilization only kicks in when
you're recording close-ups or macro
shots otherwise you're getting three
axis stabilization but even then Sony's
in-camera stabilization works extremely
well for video and stabilizes the
footage without any noticeable warping
or Distortion where the XZ differs from
the X compact is with the front-facing
camera instead of five megapixels you
have a 13 megapixel shooter which works
very well for taking selfies there's
plenty of detail in color and at 13
megapixels this gives you a lot more
flexibility with zooming and cropping
the rest of the camera experience is
pretty typical sony the camera app is
fairly simplistic and navigating between
superior Auto manual video recording or
switching to the front-facing camera can
all be done by simply swiping on the
screen and you also have all Sony's
usual fun and playful modes like AR
effect sweet panorama and time shift
video the only quirk what's tony's
camera app is that HDR mode still
continues to be buried in the settings
and only accessible when shooting in
manual mode but otherwise it's a mostly
straightforward camera app the camera
itself is very quick to launch and snap
photos especially with the dedicated
camera key and the pictures that it
takes are surprisingly very
good they're extremely sharp and
detailed and it produces colors that are
much more natural and true to life but
at the same time are still very pleasing
to the eye the predictive hybrid
autofocus feature that Sony has been
using for a while now also works well
for tracking moving subjects and
capturing them without motion blur and
as long as the subject is moving at a
reasonable speed you'll be able to get a
crystal-clear shot in low-light there's
still a fair amount of detail and the
images come out relatively noise-free
but it does tend to overexposed and have
a lot of blooming in the highlights the
camera can also be really slow to
capture in low-light situations and if
you aren't holding the phone perfectly
steady you'll wind up getting a lot of
blurry shots if you're looking to get
this phone the price is going to be
something to contend with as $700 it's
not exactly an impulse purchase and puts
in the same price range as other
flagships like the s7 edge and Google's
brand new pixel phones then there's
phones at the other end of the spectrum
like the axon 7 + 1 + 3 that offer
flagship experiences at a fraction of
the price I will admit that I generally
do like this phone and it's the first
time in a long while that a Sony phone
has impressed me it's got a refreshing
new and beautiful design that at the
same time is still true to Sony and it
has a beautiful display excellent
performance and a really great camera
there was so much to like about this
phone that I was able to forgive things
like a lack of a fingerprint sensor and
a qHD screen is a $700 forgivable to
most people it might not be but if you
choose to buy it you're getting the best
phone that Sony has made in a long while
