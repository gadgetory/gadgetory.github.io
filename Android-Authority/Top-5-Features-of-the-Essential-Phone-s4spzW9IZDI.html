everybody
and hopefully by now you have seen our
video our hands-on with this the
essential phone now the essential is a
very hotly anticipated device and we
have had our hands on it for the last
few days so make sure you check out the
full hands-on now well you can get some
of our opinions regarding this phone and
what it was like to use for the last few
days however in this video I wanted to
bring you some of my favorite features
of the phone itself after using it for
the time that I have and we have a five
of them in particular that we want to go
through in this list the first top
feature that we want to talk about right
now is the build quality now we do have
this moon black version of the phone
which has a glossy bag that is pretty
fingerprint prone however if you take a
look a closer look at the phone you
might recognize its design language it
does harken back to a design that we saw
from Xiaomi the Xiaomi me mix was one of
the first phones to try and go
completely bezel-less
and in their case they put the camera on
the bottom in order to make room for all
of that screen unfortunately that one
was just a little bit too big and like I
said in my review if we had a smaller
version of this phone it would probably
be one of the best devices that we've
seen at least in terms of design and
with the essential foam that is
essentially what we get the build also
greatly benefits from a titanium body
but the backing especially on this unit
that I'm using right now is a ceramic
backing much like the Xiaomi me mix and
we love ceramic backings on phones
because it just gives the phone a
different level of quality with the flat
sides as well it is very easy to handle
and it definitely feels like it's not
going to slip about especially with this
size that I can grip really easily but
of course we have to talk about that
screen it is a 19 by 10 aspect ratio
screen that is a quad HD resolution
however there are a couple of quarks
about the screen that make it really
eye-catching of course we talked about
the lack of bezel on this phone and
indeed there is a bit of a chin on the
bottom but everywhere else around the
phone you're basically holding what is
all screen all the time and there's a
little bit of a contour at the top that
makes room for the front-facing camera
this 8 megapixel shooter on the front
gets a little bit of a lip just a little
bit of a dip into what is essentially
the notification area and it's a really
nice look that
differentiates the design of this phone
from pretty much any other device out
there but that little u-shaped lip at
the top that just sort of cuts into the
full screen just that tiny bit is
incredibly eye-catching it's very crowd
pleasing and with that notification area
at the top blending in with basically
any application there are a few where it
doesn't really blend in that well but
I'm sure that updates are going to come
later it's just really a wonderful look
which leads us to our next feature that
we really love and that is the dual
camera setup now essential has gone for
the RGB and monochrome sensor combo in
order to get the most detail out of the
shot and the monochrome pictures that
we've seen if you go to the mono mode in
the camera app are incredibly detailed
we actually really love taking black and
white photos because all of the lines
are so detailed and there's a lot of
sharpness inside of those photos the
color pictures are pretty fine still
however we are going to do our full
testing as the time goes on the camera
app is also a little bit simplistic so
for a lot of general users out there
it's not going to be hard to pick it up
and be able to get some good shots
however we do wish that there was a bit
of a manual mode involved and right next
to those cameras our connector pins that
give this phone some modularity now we
don't really have a whole lot of time
because we don't have the 360 camera to
talk about the 360 camera but they do
connect to those two connector pins over
in the corner on the back of the phone
and it does pass through data so you'll
be able to take 360 photos and videos
and they will communicate straight
through those connector pins that are
going to be more accessories made
available for the essential including a
wireless charging dock that you can
connect to those pins but we're sure
that there are going to be even more
accessories that will add to the
expandability of the essential line and
they have also promised that future
essential devices are going to have
backwards compatibility with all of the
accessories they plan on releasing and
finally it would be hard to talk about a
phone called essential if you didn't
talk about well the essentials there are
a lot of specifications that should
please everyone out there looking for a
high end device but we want to highlight
the software experience essentially this
is a stock Android built if you get an
unlocked version of this device you
basically only have a dozen applications
including the ones that are already
built into Android in the stock build
and you only get a few extras maybe five
or six as we were told during our Q&amp;amp;A
session with essential and over the last
few days I've had a very
happy and very smooth experience with
this version of Android and we're sure
that with some updates to the software
it's going to continue to get better
even after I put the Sprint SIM card
into the phone and it downloaded a
couple of sprint applications right off
the bat it didn't bog down what has
continued to be a very speedy experience
so for all of you Android purists out
there it's kind of interesting that we
have the phone like the essential that
provides a stock Android experience
aside from the pixels and the Nexus
devices of the world so that might be a
big feather in the cap of essential that
is going to get a lot of you to really
consider this brand new device this
brand new phone that has just come out
on the market and is available for
pre-order right now you can head over to
retailers like Amazon and Best Buy or
central.com themselves to find unlocked
versions of the phone or if you happen
to be on the Sprint network you can see
when they are going to have it available
as it is available for pre-order across
all of these different networks the
essential phone is incredibly
interesting not only because of what
it's trying to introduce into the
flagship game but also because it feels
like they're really trying to redefine
what the word essential means to general
users and that is exactly the question
we will explore in our full review so
keep it tuned to Android authority for
even more about the essential phone
we'll probably do some comparisons but
we'll definitely give you our full
review that will include camera testing
and pretty much all of the bells and
whistles you would expect from us here

more about this exciting device and
