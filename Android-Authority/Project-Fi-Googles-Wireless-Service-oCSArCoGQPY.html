to you by domain.com so the rumors have
turned out to be true Google has created
its own wireless service and it's called
Project 5 now although Google didn't buy
sprint like I hope they would they did
make a new significant partnership
project Phi is the first wireless
service to seamlessly switch between
both Wi-Fi and LTE always choosing the
connection that is the strongest to LTE
networks are supported at the moment
both t-mobile and Sprint the catch here
is that only one phone has been designed
to work with the special sim required
for project by the Google Nexus 6 the
good news is that Google hints that this
is just the first of many devices and so
hopefully it's only a matter of time
before other popular Android devices
gain support now while you need a nexus
6 for the service those with project 5
will be able to use their number even
when they're not on their phone
utilizing any device with Google
Hangouts installed for calls texts and
checking voicemail that means the
laptops tablets Chromebooks and so forth
pricing is pretty straightforward with
project 5 you pay $20 a month for
unlimited talk text and Wi-Fi tethering
data is separate though and build at a
very reasonable $10 for every one
gigabyte of data you use why this is
prepaid and you pay for data in advance
any unused data will be credited back to
you it won't be rounded up either if you
use 1.9 gigabytes of data you'll get
refunded point 1 gigabytes that you
didn't use for those that travel you'll
be happy to know that this service
extends to 120 countries while traveling
abroad at no cost for data or texts the
only restriction is that speeds are
limited down to just 256 K while abroad
international calls are on a separate
charge of 20 cents per minute so you've
got a nexus 6 and you're interested in
signing up for project Phi not so fast
similar to inbox for Gmail this is an
invite-only program that you can request
an invite the only requirement is a
gmail account and a Nexus 6 the service
isn't up and running just yet but Google
says the invite
we'll be able to jump in with the
service sometime next week Google will
be sending up batches of invites each
week but don't be shocked if it takes a
while to get to you now the CEO of
t-mobile has become famous for trying to
make t-mobile V uncarrier and he had
this to say about the deal disruption is
what the uncarrier does our mission is
to change the wireless industry for the
better so if you're looking for a
partner who lives and breathes
innovation and has a network built for
today's data centric world and data
hungry consumers it's easy you're gonna
want to come to the uncarrier
so the big hope here is that this new
initiative by Google t-mobile and Sprint
will push other major carriers to be a
little bit more customer centric because
let's face it Wireless data is not that
great and it's awfully expensive to see
if you're in an area that project five
currently covers check out Google's
official map coverage enter your address
and see if you qualify I just want to
take a second and thank our sponsor and
remind you that with all the new domain
name extensions out there there's lots
of opportunity for creativity but
remember Icom is always the premium real
estate why because no domain name
extension tells your story with the same
level of trust like a.com or.net domain
name dot-com and dotnet domain name
extensions and jet credibility into your
online presence and who doesn't want
