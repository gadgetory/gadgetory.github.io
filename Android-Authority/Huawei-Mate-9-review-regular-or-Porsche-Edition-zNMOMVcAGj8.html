presented opportunity for rival OEMs but
can Huawei take advantage is partnering
with porsche design enough for the mate
9 to take the market by storm what's
going on guys is narrow and this is our
review of the regular and porsche design
mate 9 the design of the regular mate 9
may be largely unchanged from last year
but it does bring with it further
refinement the smaller more compact
profile provides a much better in hand
experience while the curved union body
is finished with a soft feeling
aluminium the result is a smartphone
that doesn't feel as large as you'd
expect considering the 5-point knowledge
displayed the mate line is roughly the
same size as both the iPhone 7 plus and
the Google Nexus 6p
which both have smaller displays the
button arrangement is familiar as well
with power and volume keys on the right
a dual SIM tray on the left USB C port
and one of the dual speakers at the
bottom you'll also find the headphone
jack in the IR blaster up top the dual
speaker at the bottom is joined by a
second speaker in the earpiece and let
me tell you these are some really loud
speakers on the back both devices have a
laker branded dual camera but the
similarities stop there as well the
regular mate 9 has its fingerprint
scanner on the back the porsche design
variant moves it to the front beneath
the display in its stead comes a posh
design logo that is quite frankly a show
of opulence porsche design version also
trades a soft finish of the mate 9 for a
pitch black anodized metal that looks
striking and shimmers in the light but
it does attract a lot more fingerprints
while the designer that mate 9 may not
be revolutionary it does represent
another year of refinement for huawei
the mate 9 is great in the hand and
while we're showing that it is possible
to make a big phone that is friendly in
the hand the regular make 9 has a full
HD screen whilst the posh design model
has a smaller 5.5 inch qHD AMOLED panel
looking at the spec sheet it would be
easy to be disappointed in this
resolution of the regular make 9 but
this doesn't tell the whole picture the
display has a high contrast ratio and a
brightness of over 608 which helps
shield the fact that it's not actually
an AMOLED
panel by comparison the max brightness
of the Porsche design is just 337 mids
making it a lot less impressive than its
counterpart all last year's mate eight
running both phones through our testing
lab reveals they both ship with a core
display out of the box although it is
rather simple two changes in the
settings the Porsche design is more
accurate than the regular mate nine
screen by default and both also come
with a blue light filter which works as
you might expect the porsche design mate
nine aside while we are stuck to its
guns about not sacrificing battery life
for a higher resolution display and the
mate nine is a shining example of why
this is actually a wise choice yes it
would have been nice to have qhd on a
panel this big but this regular mate
nine screen is fantastic nonetheless so
what happens when you put a full HD
display and a four thousand milliamp
hour battery inside of the same phone as
you might expect you get excellent
battery life using our custom Android
authority battery testing app we found a
mate nine can last for five thousand
twelve minutes on a full charge when
gaming while the porsche design version
lasts for four hours and 34 minutes for
video playback the mate nine last for 14
hours and 12 minutes whilst the porsche
design taps out at 10 hours and 36
minutes while in our web browsing test
that mate nine last for 14 hours and
four minutes versus 11 hours and 28
minutes for the porsche design variant
in actual use you can expect the regular
mate nine to easily last two days with
heavy usage which translates to between
5 and hour eight hours of screen on time
for those more interested in the porsche
design this drops to between four and
seven hours on a single charge for the
times when it is getting low both
devices come with Huawei's new nine volt
four-and-a-half amp fast charging
solution dub supercharge when using the
bundled wall or car supercharger your
battery can go from empty to 55% in one
hour to charge to full the mate nine
takes 89 minutes whilst the porsche
design version takes 111 minutes while
we also says that thanks to a chip
inside the supercharger which constantly
communicates with your smartphone the
mate nine won't overheat and can run up
to twenty-five percent cooler than other
smartphones both versions of the mate
nine are powered by the new kieran 960
chipset which combines the latest cortex
a 73 processors from
with the latest GPU from mali the kiran
960 is the first phone to run the new
marley g71 mpag pu which is also
expected to power the galaxy s 8 next
year why waste care and chipsets have
always offered excellent performance but
have severely struggled in the graphics
department but the kiran 960 puts an end
to that whether it's in gaming video
playback or general use the processing
package just flies and we're yet to
experience a drop friend or any really
noticeable lag with 4 gigabytes of RAM
and 64 gigabytes of external storage
inside the regular mate nine and six
gigs of ram and 256 gigabytes of non
expandable storage in the porsche design
version there's plenty of gram under
hood and both handsets are capable of
pretty much handling anything you throw
at them yes the 6 gig of ram on the
porsche design version does provide a
slightly smoother experience but the
regular mate 9 is certainly no slouch
and has around two-and-a-half gigs of
ram free with no applications running
the benchmark for month also lives up
the real-world experience with the
kieran 960 proving to be a very capable
processor the improvement in the
graphics is particularly noticeable with
the Mali GPU living up to while exclaims
of an 8 times increase in graphics
performance over previous years both
devices also come with a lightning-fast
fingerprint sensor although the one of
the mate 9 is considerably faster than
the front mounted sensor on the porsche
design other noticeable hardware
includes an array of sensors and
connectivity options including NFC
Bluetooth Wi-Fi and an infrared port the
dual SIM card slot on the regular mate 9
allows you to use either two SIM cards
or a similar micro SD card slot with
emui providing several granular controls
over how the two SIM cards work together
call quality is fantastic especially as
the mate 9 eliminates ambient noise when
you raise your phone to your ear during
a call both handsets come equipped with
the second generation like a branded
dual camera which brings some tweaks and
enhancements over the ones found in the
Huawei p9 and Huawei p9 plus the camera
experience is centered around a 12
megapixel
RGB sensor with optical image
stabilization which captures colors and
a secondary 20 mega pixel monochrome
sensor that captures additional detail
the larger secondary camera means you're
able to capture images with an
impressive bokeh effect whether closed
up or
away in the right conditions you're able
to take images that top the portrait
mode and photosphere effects found on
both the iPhone 7 plus and the pixel XL
respectively overall image quality from
the maintenance your camera is
impressive in daylight you get images
that are crisp and full of detail with
colors that are more realistic and less
saturated than those captured by the
galaxy s7 edge or the pixel excel y ways
camera app also makes tweaking pictures
easy with pro mode just a tap away
allowing you to adjust the exposure ISO
and focal point in real-time to take
even more stunning photos in default
mode it seems to struggle with picking
the right focal length as images are
often under or overexposed
but manually selecting the right focal
point quickly overcomes this Huawei is
often struggled with low-light
photography but the main train can take
pictures that are seemingly on par with
its rivals however the overall low-light
performance is impressive
the main tonight does struggle with
slight movement with oh is proving less
effective done on other devices the
while way camera is rather
straightforward to use with options for
flash wide aperture and filters found in
the viewfinder a swipe to the right
brings up the settings menu whilst so I
think the Left brings up the camera
modes here's where you'll find HDR and
it can't be activated by default which
means remembering to actually activate
it HDR doesn't seem to be as effective
as on other devices she'll end up
activating it a lot less than you might
otherwise expect the front camera is an
8 megapixel shooter with F dot 1.9
aperture which can shoot Full HD video
at 30 frames per second for the most
part selfies come out rich and full of
colors in good lighting and in low
lighting the camera does a good job of
boosting the ISO to let more lighting
for the most part the camera on the mate
9 doesn't seem to disappoint and it
seems to be on par with most Android
flagships it's not perfect no phone is
after all but the mate 9 is capable of
taking pictures which you'll be proud to
share look at past Huawei phones and
there's a single trend that come to
pretty much define why we've mobile
efforts
up until now great Hardware not-so-good
software until now about is the make 9
is the first phone to run the new EMU
i-5 interface
which is based on Android 7.0 nougat and
the biggest overhaul of WoW is interface
that we've ever seen there's a lot of
changes but the most important is that
yes you can now have an app drawer with
this out the way the other changes are
both visual and feature based with the
odd color scheme of old replaced by a
new as your theme with white backgrounds
faint gray accents blue highlights and
tones if this theme isn't view of course
there's other themes in the theme store
Android nuga also brings some
improvements and tweaks to lend to the
overall experience and it's nice to see
that Huawei has resisted preview habits
of overhauling everything in favour of a
more minimalist approach with a few
tweaks in select parts of the OS swiping
from the top down brings a new darker
notification shade that displays more
icons than before and can be heavily
customized in the settings menu there's
an option to toggle between individual
notification icons or just the number of
unread notifications which can be used
to prevent the top from becoming really
cluttered moving around emu i5 and it's
clear that this is a snappy interface
with bloat we're mostly kept to a
minimum
the launcher is fast full of features
and heavily customizable and aside from
a slight stuttering going to your home
screen when you have the app drawer
enabled there's no noticeable lag Mui 5
also comes with Huawei's new machine
learning algorithm which aims to learn
your habits and allocate more resources
to the apps you use most frequently out
of the box the mate 9 is a fast phone
and while Wei says the handset was
designed to remain fast will the
algorithm using memory compression smart
CPU allocation and optimized ufs 2.10
storage to remain fast even after 16
months of use of course we can't back up
these frames but the initial results are
positive
what makes a Mui five easy to use is
that despite a large feature set it has
been designed to ensure almost all tasks
are only two or three taps away taking
the settings menu as an example it's
been redesigned with ease of use in mind
and nowhere is it more imporant than the
battery menu in previous versions it
could be found four levels deep in the
settings menu but now it's a top-level
item
battery management has also been
improved specifically in the way emui
handles and notifies you about power
intensive apps rather than the nagging
pumps of old emui five now discreetly
notifies you in the notification menu
and makes it pretty easy to close these
apps within the tap or two if you rather
close all apps when you turn off the
screen this is also possible as is the
ability to select individual apps to
automatically close a feature that I
found particularly useful is Twitter
which allows you to run two instances of
a single account app on your phone given
the dual-sim nature of the mate 9 being
able to run what's up on two accounts is
particularly useful while if you've got
two Facebook accounts this is also
possible the curve display on the
Porsche design make nine doesn't have
any special software benefits like the
galaxies and instead the only difference
is the way you navigate the phone rather
than on-screen keys you have two
capacitive keys flanking the home button
and when while you can turn these off
and use gestures on the sensor to
navigate the phone we'd recommend you
done as it doesn't work that well we
wish there was an option for on-screen
navigation but the capacitive keys seem
to do the job well enough overall the
main line isn't revolutionary upgrade
over its predecessor nor is it going to
appeal to everyone but it does excel in
the areas that while we intended it to
battery performance and camera compared
to previous phones even as recently as
the huawei p9 this year there were
several things which deterred people
from buying a huawei phone these have
now been fixed and an emu i-5 wha we now
has an interface that is smooth
feature-rich and up there with the very
best of them all things considered the
main line is probably the best big
screen Android smartphone you can buy
right now at a cost of 699 euros it's
certainly not cheap but it does offer
great value for money at 1399 euros
however the porsche design does not the
post design mate 9 is arguably the
flagship the mate 9 should have been and
it's actually available at lower price
sandless porsche design branding as the
mate 9 pro that being said the regular
mate 9 is a joy to use if you're after a
big smartphone that offers exceptional
battery life an intriguing dual camera
an incredible performance the make 9
deliver
this in spades what do you think of the
regular and the posh design while we
mate 9 let us know your thoughts in the
