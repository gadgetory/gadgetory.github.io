show on google+ I'm dare cross and I'm
Scott Anderson I'm Dan Charlton I'm
Johnathan Franklin I'm Chris look i'm
nate swanner and we are joined this week
with special guest Tony McDonald from
technician technician is the mastermind
behind the chameleon launcher for
android Tony thanks for joining us ain't
no problem it's great to be here guys
thanks for having me alright so if you
aren't familiar with technician or
chameleon launcher this is actually the
third time we've had them on our show
we're very happy to have them continuing
to support the show come back and join
us the first time we had them on there
was uh was late last summer when
chameleon launcher for tablets first
pushed out to kickstarter backers and
since then we've had them on talking
about a major update to the platform and
now we're back again I believe to talk
about another major update to the
platform um before we get started with
Tony here I guess if you're not familiar
with chameleon um they're in in Tony you
can correct me from wrong here the the
design philosophy behind chameleon was
home screens on Android are kind of you
know poorly executed home screens should
have the information you want at your
fingertips you know you shouldn't have
to go searching for it and and it should
be based on context you know where
you're at and so forth so so you guys
set out to make the android home screen
experience much better correct yeah I
know that's sort of the simple way to
say it but you know I the idea behind
chameleon was to be you know sort of a
Content centric launcher which is very
different from you know the way
everybody else approaches a launcher we
wanted to do something you know with
chameleon that was different than just
oh here's an icon and launched an app or
you know here's a widget with next to no
relevant in
showing in it that just looks good on
your home screen instead we wanted to
make your you know launcher experience
be something that as soon as you turn on
your tablet you'd be seen enough
information that was relevant to you
right when you turn it on so that was
primarily the goal and and you know it
informed a lot of the chameleon
philosophy which you know in a way was
aliens some people at the beginning
because you know the sake watchers
normally are focused on content they're
just pointers to other applications
right I said yeah that's the difference
primarily and how we try to distinguish
ourselves and continue to you know as
chameleon evolves we want to continue to
explore that idea more and more okay so
as I we said you know initially when
chameleon launcher first came about to
Android it was initially just for
tablets that's right and as of this
afternoon Kickstarter backers we're
happy to find out that something
exciting came along the way chameleon to
ya million to added support for phones
you tell us a little bit about that yeah
so well the idea we always wanted to
adapt chameleon to you know as much of
the like as big of an Android scope as
we could get but it was true that the
history of chameleon would like it was
built off the back of another project
that you know we a technician were
working on with texas instruments which
was tablet centric at the time like that
was the form factor we were shooting at
and we kind of built off that because
what we found was that if you look at a
lot of people maybe it's changed these
days but at the time a lot of android
tablets people would have all the screen
real estate on their launcher and not
really much to do with it you know like
yeah you can populate through a whole
bunch of apps around but i always find
that you know people might have a
launcher screen that's filled with apps
but how often do they actually engage
with all that screen real estate they
tend not to like the vast majority of
people probably only use a handful of
apps rather than this whole scope of
apps that they would have on their
tablet so you know
idea was trying to figure out how do we
make something engaging like by adding
more content that's relevant in the
tablet format and then you know
eventually we'll go to the phone because
there's a very big difference and we
know especially where we're at now
supporting the tablet and the phone
we've realized the dramatic difference
between those two form factors when
you're in a contract content centric
environment it really you know informed
it forces to change you know how the
widgets work to an extent and how other
things in chameleon-like contexts and
stuff work as well so you know we did
start from the tablet but we wanted to
expand it out and you know in there
there was many little places that we hit
that you know there was almost a
conflict between the two forum factors
that made it challenging for us so what
was it hard to add tablet support were
there any major design changes or horse
philosophies need to be changed along
the way you mean phone support I'm sorry
phone support yeah yes there was
actually quite a lot so um like very
simply at the beginning it just
introduced way way more devices that we
had to develop for and the thing to
remember that's like kind of important
about chameleon you know it it talks to
the architecture underneath is that our
chameleon widgets are HTML based right
so um that being the case we had to do a
lot of HTML and CSS development to get
the widgets to behave in all kinds of
different sizes and different you know
screen resolutions different screen
densities which can be a little bit more
challenging in some senses in CSS than
it is like natively in android so right
there just widgets alone we had to
approach them and change a few things
about how they work the other thing is
you know our the way we present our
grids and chameleon isn't like fixed
it's not the same as the normal android
launchers you know we kind of its it's
more design from a relative size type
perspective and because of that the
widgets really had to
have a proper responsive design kind of
implementation because you know each box
in the grid can actually vary in size
depending on what device it is and what
screen density is and all these various
things so you know some of the guys who
work with us particularly Ian Shaw who
does a lot of our HTML development and
CSS work like man that guy work day and
night many times to get all of the
possible configurations that a lot of
the widgets could be in to look decent
right so did you guys have any hurdles
going from tablet size to down to sign a
smaller form factor then yeah well we
had to change some things about the
widgets like for example the header bars
of all our widgets are totally
redesigned now and they're designed to
be like there's two kind of focuses
their one they're meant to be bolder and
square because on the phone it just felt
like you didn't have as much empty free
space to deal with you it was much more
condensed so our kind of new square bold
headers box things in a little nicer it
looks better on the phone just from an
aesthetic perspective but also we
introduce this new like sort of action
menu it's like you know your traditional
Android options button that's at the top
right and the reason for that is you
know originally we had the idea that
you'd have a few actionable icons on the
top right of the widget but on the phone
immediately that goes away and you know
you're not getting the type of space
alongside of the title of the widget
that you need on a phone and in that
amount of space so this new drop out
menu is you know the new approach that
we've added and that was kind of
interesting too because it'll allow us
with widgets to add a lot more options
for actionable items to each individual
widget so that was another major
development that you know we change and
then throughout the application it was
you know kind of your more
run-of-the-mill you know dealing with
the screen densities in the smaller
sizes and just adapting all the
chameleon graphics to really scale down
and it chameleon now will actually run
on very very small devices like those I
forget the exact model but there we have
one in our office one of those really
tiny phones and chameleon runs fine on
it
it can be a little bit tight you know
but at the same time at least it's it's
not off limits we can basically go from
any size small size enough now so okay
yeah I i noticed that i believe
correctly from wrong that the phone
launcher supports 720p devices and
higher you don't support any lower than
that resolution is that right yeah well
the reason for that is mainly an
aesthetic thing amongst our design team
yeah you know they are just nitpicky
about that we could actually go smaller
but then you're starting to enter in the
range where things just become a little
bit unwieldly so you know the lower
limit you know is you know pretty much
as low as we can get it all make sense
usable leader that probably isn't um
most of the ice cream sandwich and above
phones and i can think of or 720p
anyways happen on the ankle the vast
majority of them are just as a reminder
to our live listening and watching
audience on YouTube and Google+ if you
have any questions about chameleon for
Tony go ahead and drop them in the
comments I'll we've a few more talking
points to lined up here and then we'll
go and get to your question so if you
have any go ahead and put them in the
comments and we'll mark them down and
we'll talk about them here a little bit
so what'd you talk about saw a few of
the new new features and some of the
challenges and so forth uh he kind of go
over some of the new features that
you're announcing with with chameleon
too yeah so there's a couple things that
are brand new um you know one thing that
I do want to mention is you know we
really you know even though sometimes
people don't believe it we really really
listen to what everyone's saying and you
know I mean this has been a whole
adventure for us this chameleon thing
but we really really have listened to
our the heavy criticisms that people
have given us and that and this new
version we started by actually focusing
on critical matters that people were
complaining about so the first thing and
I'm glad to see it today actually I
we've really been paying attention to
what people are
and I'm really glad to hear that where
we put most of our focus is what people
are noticing so for example Phil and I
in particular you guys know Phil yep it
spent a lot of time and really pushed
out deliverables like within you know
technician for chameleon to make sure we
got a couple of things right and
performance and you know especially on
older devices and stuff like that is
what we really focused on so there was a
time where Phil and I sat down and we
basically gutted a whole bunch of the
code that we wrote to render various
parts of chameleon and the HTML widgets
and we rewrote them from scratch and
that's sort of why yellow like a lot of
people say well why are you guys taking
so long this and that well Phil and I
wanted to make sure that we got a couple
of things right at the core going
forward because you know we notice the
criticisms were there primarily and so
we did that and luckily like the good
news today as people are saying yeah
it's performing great on my old tablet
the transitions are smooth it feels
great so like we put a lot of effort
into that like over fifty percent of the
time spent was just making it faster
making it perform on old devices and get
where we want so that's a big thing and
I know that's not necessarily the bells
and whistles things people get excited
about but it was something we wanted to
get right and I think we did in this
version but I don't think you did get it
right yeah yeah and what Mikey the one
thing I've realized about android
development cuz I've been doing it now
for a couple years but I mean to do it
right you have to have an army of
devices in your shop for us now like I
mean everyone's desk is covered in five
or 10 devices if you ever see Ian Shaw
that works for us he's always posting
pics on Instagram you know when he's
designing widgets and stuff he's got
like 10 devices on his desk and you know
they're all running the same thing it's
updated hilarious but it really is like
that with the Android development is
crazy but so that was a focus but new
features and chameleon stuff that is
great is one of the biggest things was
when we finished chameleon the first
version you know aside from performance
stuff that we knew we had to fix
another thing that we didn't think we
got right was something that we were
actually trying to focus on which was
this whole concept of context oriented
no data and dashboards right yeah now we
like the idea we thought we were in the
right ballpark but I remember goober
evita he's our president and stuff he
sat down with this one day and said you
know there's something wrong with
context and he he explained his vision
of what he wanted it to become and I
agreed with him and Phil and I I know we
were are there was technical reasons why
we wanted to go in the same direction
but it was this idea of okay with
chameleon we want to get to this but you
know we'll put that feature out a little
bit but as we started re working on this
new version of chameleon eventually we
said okay let's just do it now too while
we're doing this big overhaul of various
other things and we got in so one thing
people notice is the whole idea of
context are in to dashboards is very
different in the new chameleon instead
of it being originally it was like I've
got five pages and each of those pages I
can attach rules to and then chameleon
I'll switch between those pages we
discarded that and now it's sort of like
your dashboard scenario opens up and
you've got three pages beside and that's
one context so you apply your your rules
of time and space or whatever do that
and then you can create right now I
think the maximum limit we have of
context is 15 but that's this arbitrary
for now we could actually make it bigger
and hopefully want to go to the world
where you can have unlimited amount of
context so each dashboard context you
create gets three pages it gets its own
app tray and all of the stuff and you
can create context for anything like
it's not only just spatial stuff too
it's not even just like oh I'm traveling
or oh it's 9pm activate this you can
create content oriented ones as well so
like I create dashboards for young you
know I'm a hockey fan because I'm a
Canadian I guess that's a good
comparison but you know like on a game
night where my team the ottawa senators
are playing I've
or that's just related to Twitter feeds
and news feeds of what's going on on
game night now and that dashboard will
automatically activate itself you know
you know if I wanted to but normally
I'll just switch it on and look at all
the pre-prepared feeds or whatever love
you had for let's say let's say nine
p.m. with the time the game time was yo
on time would automatically be
contextually it would switch over to
your game feed to have your you Twitter
feeds your RSS feed set up for the you
know hockey news or whatever yeah but
we've tried to set it up so that the
context the contextual rules aren't the
only thing about context now now you can
create topical dashboards as well that
don't necessarily have rules they're
just something you can switch to and
there was technical reasons for that
change as well which was that we were
doing it in the original chameleon you
know eventually we would just not have
the capacity in memory to load all this
stuff in real time the way it worked so
now each context when you switch
contacts it reloads the dashboards up
individually so it allows us to add way
more context but not hold them all in
memory at the same time so it was both a
technical challenge and aux challenge
and I think in the new chameleon it sets
the standard for where we're going with
it in the future and we've got some
great ideas of how to expand it in the
future as well so that's one big one
that people notice as a difference other
things this is just stuff that people
wanted to see so we've added folders as
you'd expect and that's big i noticed
that as well item i thought that was big
because you know we're so used to
organizing things and folders and I was
actually missing that now in you know
previous versions of chameleon I noticed
that yesterday when I loaded it up and I
have hey what's this little link icon
here you know and I started playing
around with it and you know all you talk
about it but i'll explain that is the
new concept that we put in there but um
to talk about folders first people
wanted it it's pretty standard issue in
chameleon the only the first chameleon
the only reason we didn't do it was just
we wanted to get something out to the
public and we were focused more at that
time on the widget experience in the
content experience but commute like
folders sorry we're always on
like our product backlog we knew we were
doing it so now it's there people have
it just like they'd expect um but what
we also added was linked folders like
you said which is something a little bit
different that you know I you know I've
gotten some great feedback from it but
at first people are puzzled by it a
little bit we're gonna upload some
videos next week probably that'll
explain some of these features that
people can see but linked folders the
concept line is if you create a folder
in chameleon and you open it it's got as
you said this little link icon that you
can click and when you do that it
basically creates like a saved version
of that folder that sits sort of where
your apps are there's another tab there
I don't know I well people see it when
they download it but the whole idea is
then you can create multiple instances
of that folder so that original like yo
template of it you can create and put
that same folder wherever you want now
every time you create an instance of
that folder all those folders as long as
they have the little link on icon
they're all linked so if you change one
like if you change its title or its
contents every instance of it where you
put it also updates right so they remain
insync all the time but that's the
reason it's there that makes it special
is chameleon the ideas we're trying to
promote contextual dashboards so you're
using this yo context or this context or
this one and it gets annoying if you say
if you were the type person that would
have ten contexts you don't necessarily
want to add your phone and your messages
and your blah blah blah like all these
group taps your games or whatever it may
be to your dashboard every time so if
you create a linked folder you can
instantiate it across contexts and it'll
remain in sync across all of those so
it's think of those linked folders is
like a reusable group once you create
that group you can put that group
anywhere and anytime you change it
everywhere else will remain insync all
the time he's going to group what's up
delete the group if you delete the group
then right now and chameleon what will
happen is it'll when you go to delete
it'll say whether if there's instances
of it across it'll say if there's
instances it'll remove them
basically um we're gonna play with that
feature a little bit and I'm open to
feedback on that feature like if people
say hey it'd be cool if it worked this
way or that way actually from our alpha
testers who are awesome by the way
thumbs up to them I had kind of our
secret group of people um they've given
a me some Indian Phil and the team
working on that some great feedback of
things that I'm already thinking of
changing a little bit about linked
folders but it's a feature that works
pretty well in chameleons very useful
especially if you use context but you
know it's kind of new and you know I'm
open to feedback from what people say
when they see it I like the linked
folders I'm one of the guys that likes
to have a folder with all my google apps
you know on my home screen I you know I
like that so no matter what my home
screen looks like I want to have all my
google apps right there just in case so
the fact that i can now do that that's
very nice well to give you guys an idea
if you want to know where we're going
with it i have some development stuff
already it's not in this version of
chameleon but just to give people an
idea of where it's going is this like
linked folders are like user controlled
right so you create a group and you say
that's my group and i want to use that
all over the place and keep it in sync
but other that little folders tab I got
a tweet today people are saying well
that's a lot of screen real estate just
for a couple of folders that I created
well what I intend to add to it in the
future is intent like I don't know how
many people are developer oriented here
but probably a lot but they're going to
be intent oriented folder so it would be
things like you can say well it'll
probably be done automatically but
chameleon will automatically create a
few folders and search for certain
intent categories like things like
things that are labeled as games are
things that are labeled this
productivity and art automatically
create those as folders that's very cool
automatically find all your social apps
or some you know and that's right or
yeah that's very cool yeah so stuff like
that is where we're going to go with it
and we've got even some more advanced
ideas around folders and you know maybe
want to do there have a you know
automatically create your social screen
or something like that yeah very very
neat yeah
so that's one and another one if you
want another feature sorry I don't know
how much I'm unhappy yeah yeah talk talk
about another feature I could talk all
night but another future this one is
huges and people were yelling at us all
the time about this one so we finally we
finally did it but it's a middle ground
I would say is that people like one of
the things people like why can't I put
an icon on my dashboard like people were
outraged in some ways about that like
kind of in a good way but what people
didn't realize is and you know maybe
it's you know partially our fault is you
know chameleon we wanted it to be a
content oriented experience so like I
keep saying that but that was our
philosophy so the idea was we wanted to
use as much dashboards faces we could
for content that was important to you
and we used ourselves as templates so
we're Twitter users and Instagram users
and Facebook users so our widgets we
wanted to put them front and center
right so to us like apps on the
dashboard was a minor factor like does
we wanted to have our tweets and all
that taking up all the space and you
know we did realize we were like okay
you know this is where you know the
status quo is kind of dragging us into
doing it this way and you know people
have a good case like okay I want to put
more impor so we were trying to solve
the problem and it was kind of like a
head scratcher because we were like well
do we introduce a new grid that's
designed for icons like all the other
launchers or do we is there a way to
meet in the middle so what we did is we
introduce this new thing in the new
chameleon that we call app launcher
widgets which is basically half way
between from what we want and what
people were asking us for on that tip so
basically the idea is now if you grab to
pick up an app from chameleon from the
app you know the main app grid or
whatever it'll pop down and will say
would you like to put this to the
dashboard you drag it up there it snaps
back down to your dashboard and as you
drag over the dashboard you see the grid
high light with this blue kind of
highlight in the circle in the middle as
you move it in it'll prompt you it'll
turn to a plus sign and if you drop it
it
creates a widget like every other
chameleon widget but that chameleon
widget is an app grid so you can clip it
essentially creates the same effect of
putting apps on your dashboard like
you'd be used to in other launchers
except it's in the container of a widget
which kind of creates this interesting
situation because you USC you can create
folders and drop whatever you want on
there but you can edit that widget
change its size it pages so you could
add like every app you want into one of
these widgets and you could have it
being like a one by one and you could
scroll through every single app if you
wanted and an app launch or widget um so
it was kind of us meeting in the middle
we thought it was kind of cool too
because if you lay out apps on your
dashboard you can move them around and
resize them in it it kind of is a
different approach as to everyone else
and you know it met in the middle from
sort of like the architecture of
chameleon without us having to
fundamentally change our approach to
widgets in that so again that's another
thing that we think is kind of cool
we'll see what people say I'm looking
for feedback on it you know like V our
twitter account or you know the
chameleon forums and all that tell us
what you think but you know it works out
pretty well that's what at least our
opinion yeah I put some on some tap
widgets I guess is we'll call them on my
screen my home screen yeah I did I like
that feature said I'm one of the guys
that i have a few screen setup using the
standard widgets you know the chameleon
widgets and then I have another screen
with you know some Android widgets and
then some some apps as well so actually
speaking of of widgets one of the I know
a lot of people wanted to know are more
chameleon based widgets coming i
remember back when we first spoke with
you guys many months ago philip had said
that at some point that you were
envisioning almost for lack of better
words on call like an app store a place
to go to to get widgets that other
people had developed the third party you
know developers had had added and
submitted that this you know this store
is that something that you're still
thinking of adding in the future or is
that changed
yeah it's changed a little bit but you
know it's surprising because it's
something that we actually worked a lot
on and it works really well in chameleon
right now but you know not a lot of
people know about it because we haven't
made a big stink about it yet but we're
going to in this version so the thing
about it is right now we haven't
introduced a store because you know as
say like chameleons we're still small
like the team doing it and we're not I
guess at this very point in time
prepared to invest in doing that yet
like making a big story you have to get
the interest there first right so what
we've done though and you know I've
posted a bit on our twitter account
about this today and you know a few of
us on the team intend to do a blog post
in detail about this over the next
couple days maybe into next week is that
chameleon has a system built into it
where if you create an HTML widget which
by the way we have a whole SDK that
we've created where people can create
HTML widgets for chameleon which is out
there and people are using that already
so you can do that but chameleon cannot
install widgets like directly right so
we actually have this chameleon protocol
that you can use it's like an install
protocol that if you make a web page and
you hit it using anything like your
browser in chameleon you can create a
link that will actually prompt the user
to install a chameleon widget it's very
high rated one and we have a whole bunch
of people that work with us on our beta
site in our alpha group or whatever that
have done a lot of that um you know like
one guy I know in particular Matthew
told he's done a whole set of widgets
he's still working on there's a few
others as well that have experimented
with it and you can install these
widgets it's very very easy to do so
what we at this stage what we intend to
do is just take the lid off that and say
to people well if you want to make
widgets it's actually really easy and
the chameleon AP is for doing it in
JavaScript like expose all this great
simple stuff for things like tapping
into our settings windows and all that
and tapping into a loss for example like
it simplifies that process we've got all
that streamlined and you know it's
really quite easy to make cool widgets
so we want to try and promote you know
see if there's anyone out there that
wants to develop some good HTML widgets
and we're gonna try and bolster a little
bit of a community exchange already out
there you know a few guys that kind of
got into it already and started
experimenting set up a little site it's
like chameleons widgets com it's still
very early on you know they they just
basically set up the infrastructure to
exchange and install widgets the people
make and we're going to build off that
so we're going to keep it open for now
and you know if it turns into something
that people are interested in and want
to contribute to you well then you know
that will drive us to you know
potentially build the store or that but
I think it's still for us right now a
little bit early for that um I like that
approach only because recently I don't
know how familiar you are with dashclock
widget if you've heard about and it's
the latest craze in my opinion with with
with Android everybody's making
extensions to to hook into this new
widget and so many apps are adding
support people were adding the
third-party extensions and it's it's
just the latest craze right now and I
think that that would be awesome if
something along those lines you continue
with chameleon where people were just
randomly making and additional widgets
and contributing to it from a community
standpoint it is letting the community
grill and I think that I like that
approach well it's in our court right at
this point because we have the
functionality like I mean our widget SDK
in like our approach to it this is part
of the reason why we chose to go that
way in a way is because you know not
everybody that wants to make content is
a Java programmer or an Android
programmer and like is willing to
download like the Android SDK and do all
the stuff we've really been
experimenting with you know web
developer types that you know are you
know use a lot simpler of a tool set and
you know the widgets are a lot simpler
in their nature so that's
sort of like where the chameleon
philosophy for widgets is but that being
said you know we have the infrastructure
in our widget system like we drink our
own kool-aid all of our widgets are made
on the exact same platform that we put
out to everybody else in JavaScript and
the feature set that we have for them
like I mean we've implemented like a web
caching system that is super robust like
it's not just like your traditional
html5 web cache like this thing you know
pulls down files in real time across
multiple domains and makes them
available like you know you've got all
data saving mechanisms you've got you
know you can tap into androids full
intent system and do all kinds of neat
stuff there and you can even create
native Android services if you are an
Android developer and have your HTML
widget leverage that like our calendar
widget does that's built on the same
system that we put out there so that
kind of thing is what we're going to try
and focus on in the next little while we
do have one other widget that is almost
finished and people are on our back
about this all the time because we did
talk about it so we do have a media
player widget as well um it's not
designed in in HTML it's actually like
chameleon has about three or four
different types of widgets actually like
under the hood so we've got our html5
widgets we support Android application
or app widgets and then we have two
other types internally to chameleon so
one example of that is like our make a
widget widget is like an Android or a
chameleon native widget and the music
player widget will be like that too so
it'll be something that is sort of
native in the code in chameleon but it's
almost finished like I mean we have it
pretty much ready we just back-burnered
it a bit for this release because there
is other priorities that we thought were
higher on the scale but it won't be very
long like I mean we've pretty much had a
finish and people keep bugging us for it
we're like yeah we're gonna get there
it's just there's other things that we
need to get straight first so all right
we'll be more we have a handful of user
questions let's take a break from some
questions dan you want to hit up some of
the user questions people been
submitting yeah so Dexter Johnson asked
about the performance so how is it
compared to the stock Android launcher
in terms of resource usage honey your
gel ones that's great the good news on
that is the newest chameleon what you'll
notice right away is you know it's just
responsiveness is so much faster than
the previous chameleon was which is good
we really focus on that so the rendering
and stuff like that but you know like
I'll air the baggage right away like I'm
one of the lead engineers on at me and
Phil and I can talk to this because it's
potentially one of our biggest biggest
challenges and something that doesn't
always come out in the normal blog so
think about this is that chameleon uses
and leverages web views in android for
those that are technical to render the
widgets which gives us as say a lot of
advantages we can install them and
uninstall them in real time and simplify
like workflow in a lot of ways but our
biggest challenge completely has been
dealing with the implementation of web
view on Android and its various versions
like I would almost go to the point to
say that it's been a nightmare that and
I can list three bugs in particular that
are Android like system level bugs that
have almost been showstoppers for us
that we've barely been able to
circumvent so two of them are very well
known amongst the development community
just issues that have not been addressed
actually one was addressed in jelly bean
and now it's fixed but see this is the
type of issue that we have is like in
jelly bean and up everything's okay but
in for example android 4.0 point 3 there
was a brutal bug in webview that just
literally would crash chameleon and
nothing to do with any of our codes
fault it was something we couldn't
change and it's that'd to get around
that were you aiming were you able to
get around out what up devices are stuck
on four point oh three so uh well we've
sort of contained it there is an issue
with it all
mit that straight up we're actually
going to do a post about that directly
there isn't really a way around it
because the problem you know for the
technical heads out there you know is
basically that once a web view or if you
use web views in an Android application
in four point zero point three what will
happen is that the webview system or
like the web core puts a limit of 512
local file references on you right so
that means basically if I load files
locally from the system which we have to
do through our web cache to make our
widgets work if 512 references are made
then everything just crashes there's no
way around it at all it's inside you
know that that Android ROM are inside
you know the basic android of that
version so it's been logged many times
and people have been totally frustrated
about it it was such a bad bug that they
fixed it shortly thereafter so you know
now we're okay in the newer versions but
in that particular series like there's
nothing we can do about it so it's that
type of frustration we've had others as
well like any Android developer out
there that may have worked with webview
in the environment where we are where
we're creating an app on the App Store
has probably encountered some of the
others like some of them like to do with
web view memory leaks for example which
are well-known from which context you
pass to it blah blah blah like this is
developer stuff another issue is that
our Android widgets use web view and use
a transparent background which means
that on certain old Samsung devices like
I was saying before their implementation
of webview creates this weird problem
that we refer to as double draw where it
all of a sudden these these Samsung
implementations of webview catches this
one first like view of the widget and
won't release it and that one we
eventually figured out a fix for but it
was literally like okay like we have to
force rerender and resize the widget x 1
pixel in the background in order to get
the background implementation to redraw
the widget properly so the problem is
that
part of chameleons around the web
widgets has been a bit of a nightmare
because the basic implementation of
WebKit and how it's exposed through the
Android SDK is filled with problematic
bugs like ones that we've had to work
night and day to try and figure out how
to get around if we could at all so it's
been a challenge that I would say you
know it's like out of all the problems
that we face when you know working with
Android and working on chameleon sixty
to seventy percent of all the problems
we face come from web view and the
implementation of it on various devices
and how it's different on various
devices and platforms is a challenge
that's something that's a lot of fun so
yeah we've almost got to the point where
we just to put it this way where we've
had to almost been forced to buy android
totally abandon the html5 thing
altogether because it's that problematic
like across the fragmented atmosphere in
android so one of the other listeners
asks where can they get this launcher
right you've been here talking about it
where can they go and find it is it on
the Play Store or just cost money what
if it's due to get it um well right now
so uh none Google Play we have it up
there and if people go and look they're
going to see the plethora of things and
actually in the future they're going to
see a plethora more of things so what we
have is chameleon is a really original
II started as a Kickstarter project that
if you go there you're going to see Oh
chameleon launcher pre-orders free right
well the thing is if you download that
chameleon you won't be able to use it
because it's only for people that have
registered and paid later sorry not just
paid by contributed to our Kickstarter
campaign so that's clothes now you can't
use that unless you're a Kickstarter we
do have chameleon for sale that's the
normal pay version or whatever it's 399
but I would tell people just hold up we
haven't released new chameleon to that
yet because our promise to Kickstarter's
is we'd give them the first stab at this
new version which were
very proud of and they get the first
stop of the phone and also they are
working with us to clear out some of the
final issues so you know we're still
collecting feedback right now that our
Kickstarter edition that's out there you
know we have a tool in there that where
we're logging feedback and logging bugs
and stuff like that so we've still got a
bit more time to just get it perfect so
when that's finished it'll go to Google
Play to the pay version and people be
able to download it for three I think
it's I'm sorry I gotta check it's 399
399 yeah you're right yeah but we're
also going to create a new version on
Google Play that'll just be specifically
tailored for the phone only for those
that are phone oriented people that just
want that and not the tablet experience
and it'll be a dollar cheaper so it'll
be at times okay and then the 399
version includes both phone and tablet
them that's correct yeah so so that's
what you can expect to come to see there
well that's very nice very good I didn't
know that ok so we have another user
asking if the launcher still works with
live wallpapers so no it does not and
you know this is something that's kind
of interesting is wallpapers are
something we opted out of of chameleon
it's actually been a debate in our
office we can return to using our like
showing natural android wallpapers the
reason that we don't is twofold one is
that uh our design team in particular
who are really nitpicky wanted the
design to work a certain way where you
know like I say the the wallpaper is
part of the dashboards that slide up and
down and reveal and you just can't
capture that from the native android
wallpaper system it must remain there
especially live wallpapers which there's
no access to it all as an Android
developer so we kind of put a layer over
top of that however we've always kind of
in our back pocket had well we can
return to that system if we want to and
maybe we will in the future if people
really want just to tap into the normal
android wallpaper system so right now we
we kind of dodge it but we can come back
to it and our design team likes to make
cool wallpapers we have kind of our
own wallpaper system you know we like it
we think it's cool and you know as say
our design team would probably yell bark
at most people's wallpaper
configurations anyway go who wants to
look at that yeah no not Tony can't you
you can share any image on your phone
with million launcher right yeah yeah
but that's a custom implementation of
wallpapers that we made specifically for
chameleon that we sort of control but
you know talking about live wallpapers
people say can I use live wallpapers no
but that's just because we block it with
our own wallpaper so you can use your
own regular wallpaper you want to use oh
yeah you could but you know we're always
open like if there is enough feedback
where people say you know what I'd
really like to use my whatever crazy
well live wallpaper with chameleon well
you know that would push us over the
edge to enable that right all right
that's another listener question is
would you ever consider adding root or
adding a reversion to increase the
functionality or potentially so the
widgets that you'd be able to discipline
it well you know the thing is is that
where we listen to everything people say
and you know we have our own featureless
like we're passionate about features we
we actually have a whole bunch of things
we want to do and believe it or not
they're very different than probably
what most people are thinking because I
say we've got this kind of weird vision
of how we want to detour chameleon away
from the status quo more even from
launchers but we're driven by what
people want so if people communicate
with us and make a big enough stink
about it we will do whatever needs to be
done you know so like we're open to
anything so anything's possible that's
yeah okay I do any other user questions
dan not that I've seen all right so
let's go back to our our list here um I
believe John one other thing I can
drastically that I thought about because
it goes back to the first question you
guys asked me from users and it's
something I would like to address
because I've already talked about it a
couple times on Twitter tonight just
because it's a thing that again me and
Phil effaced big time and I'd lie
to share with everybody so everyone can
sort of see what we're facing this is to
do with performance and stability like
people asked about that and one of the
biggest questions we get from people
that are technical enough and know what
they're doing on Android they'll say why
does chameleon use so much memory or so
much RAM right that we get that a lot
and it's true it does and I just wanted
to address that there is a point because
chameleon can often use double in some
cases the amount that some other
launchers use right so I wanted to
address that here if you guys are open
to it sure so chameleon first off we use
web views to render a lot of the content
that is our widgets right and web views
are something that you know if you're
developing an application the way we're
distributing over Google Play it's a
system oriented service it's not part of
our applications so you'll we
instantiate these web views and they
allow us to render the HTML content that
memory is actually held by Android and
managed by Android not by us but if you
look at the you know memory reports from
various tools it automatically
associates that memory with us which is
fine but the main reason it why
chameleon uses so much memory is because
our widgets are like many applications
so some people would say whoa chameleons
using a hundred megs of ram that's
outrageous and then I'm like yeah you're
right it is if you look at it that way
but think about this take a look at
Twitter running on your device add it to
the amount of memory instagrams using on
your device and Facebook and then add a
launcher to that as well and then
calculate what you end up with right and
if you look at that you'll see chameleon
behaves exactly within the frame of
memory that it should in the penis
chameleons not just a launcher we're not
just icons with folders and a nice
transition on there like our widgets are
full bore you know applications in a way
that stand alone and you know we can't
leverage Twitter's local data because
they don't expose that right like
they're they're not going to open that
sandbox for
so we have to go out and get that data
ourselves so our Twitter widget is a
mini Twitter application same with our
Instagram same other Facebook so if you
have a dashboard filled with those
widgets that we have to take on that
memory right and that's why it looks
like you know chameleon wow it's running
with a lot of memory but if chameleons
doing its job right hopefully it is
maybe it's not i don't know we'll see
what people say but you'll probably get
if you set up if you're a user of
Twitter and Facebook and Instagram
everything you need to know just by
turning on your tablet and seeing
chameleon not necessarily going and
navigating through all these individual
apps our goal was to go you know it's to
be always relevant immediately valuable
you open up chameleon BAM your Twitter
feeds their your Facebook feed your
Instagram feed you know what you need to
know and you didn't go clicking through
all these apps so we were ready to take
on that memory and the do that heavy
load of memory that comes on just to
achieve that there's no way around that
right so that's the explanation when
people ask me why does chameleon use 100
or 120 megs of ram well because you want
to see a lot of content that's what
makes sense really running less a
launcher and more a window manager then
yeah it's it's a Content experience
posing as a launcher if you will you
know sort of like that yeah uh John I I
believe you had a question for Tony yeah
just um looking at especially in the
last year or so you look at like HTC
when they announced since five and some
parts of life TouchWiz and even with
Google with Google now and having
context it's it seems like a lot of
people are agreeing on the philosophy of
having context and content become a
bigger part of your home screen yep no
no you originally said this was a
project that came from working with
texas instruments so glad you see
working with OEMs in the future that
would want to bring chameleon almost as
a stock experience to a device you know
off the shelf or well i mean
so there's things I can say in things I
can't say but you know yes is that haha
yeah so that that's sort of our goal is
yeah we know we've known people are
interested in this idea and you know
we're just exploring it raw like it does
we realize it was a good idea we tried
to execute on it there's certain things
for example that Google can do that we
can't do right they have information
that we just cannot ever get access to
so it's inevitable that they're going to
make that same move but for us you know
we just wanted to explore that space and
see what one could do even with the
information that was just available to
us and as say we do one of the things
with chameleon that took us some time to
get here right like a lot of people have
said well why did it take you two or
three months from the last update till
here well we wanted to reorganize a
couple of things because we want to get
ourselves on a road where we can
innovate away from the status quo like
our biggest problem is the status quo
actually is that we end up in this arms
race with other launchers that we don't
want to be in you know people keep
saying to us they're like hey well you
know this launcher has this feature and
you guys don't this one has this feature
and we're like who cares you know we
don't care about that what we want to
start doing is being something very
different and that's the future for
chameleon is something that is a
launcher but not like the traditional
status quo launcher that you think and
in the future we're going to continue to
push it in that direction and context
like you said is an air in an area where
we really want to focus and as I said
when we change the context system in the
new chameleon to present it differently
that what the idea was that is behind
that was is we had to get the foundation
for that right in order to innovate
further so that's what we focus on in
last one that's why we delayed our
timelines because we realized we
wouldn't get where we wanted to go
without that change and without that
holdup at that time that make sense
mm-hmm makes a lot of sounds yeah
but you know I can give you an idea the
if you guys want to know like i'm
talking like a here and say these grand
ideas that are invisible but let me
throw you a scenario it kind of kind of
gives you an idea of what you where we
could go is what about a situation for
example for chameleon where some user
like how many people are on this chat or
on this system right now like watching
this i don't know i can't tell cuz
there's seven people in the Hangout
right now okay oh say you got a group of
people and you guys have a fan base you
know for your site what happens if we
allowed you guys really easily to create
the android authority dashboard that
other users could download and you guys
have ended in the way where you guys
could decide what content shows on a
stash board and update it remotely at
any time and the app tray or whatever
for that dashboard you guys could not
only decide what apps are in there but
you could promote other apps you could
say hey this is our app of the week and
in that person launcher if they didn't
have it it would appear like hey
download this app of the week that's the
type of area that's where we want to go
with it and have some fun kind of up
that alley that's way different than
other launchers so that's sort of like a
vision thing for you to see where we're
going and what we mean by context our
dashboards we want to turn them into
this thing that is bigger and shareable
and all these kind of i think that
they'll be interesting for brands for
pay you know four pages for entities to
go out there and do whatever they need
to do to download their dashboard or
distribute their dashboard to their
customers or clients and that's an
interesting concept okay well uh if
anybody else is watching this live right
now and has a question for Tony go ahead
and drop it in the comments if not we're
gonna move on to a few minutes Android
news the this segment ran a lot longer
than anticipated but you know what we
found out a lot of cool stuff about
chameleon that we didn't know so
exciting information two possible
scenarios about the future and it's
always exciting these guys have been a
constantly adding stuff as to
he said at the beginning of the show
that they listen to feedback and they
really have I can I've seen this
launcher grow over time adding user
requests and keep getting better and
better and better it's definitely
something to check out if you haven't
done so yet okay I do not see any new
questions so let's a chat about some
Android news real quick for another five
minutes here and then we'll wrap up the
shell um so really really quick we we
saw the Galaxy Nexus get an unofficial
whoa I'm sorry miss all the Galaxy Nexus
on verizon get updated through a leak to
android for 10 sad since have which is
great that somebody found the link on
google servers and distributed it it's
sad that it's had to be Leah it's sad
it's for updates behind and verizon has
an updated it yet so if you want this
rom you have to be on this stock four
point one point one rom and then there's
a download it's like a tea bagger 90 mag
and you flash it through a TV side load
and it's what it's supposed to be the
most current version of android in its
full glory so if we remove is a four
point two point two Wow what's the
latest really it's the latest version
android you know it it brings a lot to
me president wait until the for that do
that too well you know it something it
has new radios in everything everybody
said oh you know four point one point
two was too buggy that's why Verizon
didn't do it in then I said all 4.1 or
4.2 is buggy and you know people make
excuses British judge for us buddy you
know people miss Mashable widows are you
technically and they still released the
phone so Verizon was waiting for to
release new radios to say that hey it's
got something new that we put in it but
wait for our ass to put it in there so
there's new radios if you're rocking the
Galaxy Nexus all in big red let us know
how those new radios work out I slapped
it on my wife's phone my old Galaxy
Nexus and my dad as gox Nexus a couple
other friends have got to network well
uh they're all running the new radios so
far they really can't tell any
difference but hey if you notice
something awesome let us know battery
life maybe hey you mentioned big red I
need a try big red gum all that the
other notable a device news real quick
Motorola the razor yeah we talked about
that it was a jelly bean update big evil
you know what's really cool about about
the razor getting jellybean the razor in
the razr maxx is motorola or / google
rolla actually did some cool stuff
they've removed all sorts of crap from
blur the companies they removed moto
active moto print verizon video on
demand they're all dead they removed
like the alarm and the timer and they
replaced them with a stock google clock
so they actually puts on google apps in
there they removed like moto cast and my
gallery and my music and they replace
them with gallery and google play music
like they they removed you know bullet
bloat and put them in the fat yeah they
put in good and that's awesome you know
that Motorola's doing that so start
spamming your your update button if you
have the razor razor maxx you you should
have jellybean 4.1 point2 available
service framework first stop clear cache
all the all the tricks try to get it oh
yeah so uh dan you want to bring us up
to date on some real quick patent wars
yes the big news over the last week was
a judge Cote somewhat reversing course
and setting aside or vacating rather
some 450 million dollars out of apples
little over 1 billion dollar award so
right almost half of that big victory
just disappeared but not entirely she's
actually ordering a new trial so there
will be presumably some damages to come
from that trial but almost certainly not
450 million dollars worth because any
quasi saying jury would never have award
it but it was a word in the first place
but really the big piece of this is
cheese now turning back on the oh no
this was a totally valid jury decision
and having to set aside almost half of
it and is holding off on the retrial
until after the appeal may
more and more obvious that they feel is
not going to uphold it here 40 planes
all right so uh to keep the show in an
hour here one more quick question on ask
nate nate recently wrote an article for
android authority basically saying that
what if the most hyped phone of this
year i assume it's going to be fails you
know last year the galaxy s3 sold an
insane amount of phones it was insanely
hyped and completely accept successful
and nate's take on it was what if the s4
flops today you won't tell us a little
bit about that what what were you what
were your thoughts on that uh my
thoughts on that were you know kind of
when you look back like it leaked a
blackberry the z10 that was really hyped
and nobody came out it was just kind of
like you know okay iphone 5 same thing
that was kind of a big whomp whomp
moment for Apple so my thought was you
know there's a lot of hype to it and
everybody's excited but what if it's not
what we think it is yeah I think what it
probably is not going to have that
octa-core CPU a lot of people are gonna
be really pissed just like they were
with the sgs3 about not having the
Exiles five then again people still
bought it in droves and people are still
buying the iphone 5 in terms you go
remember the only people that actually
care about what's underneath the hood is
the people that are probably watching
this right now you know the people that
actually buy the devices the general
customer the average consumer that Boz
exits the newest latest and greatest
don't care about numbers they did they
don't you're so right like people people
don't buy the iphone 5 they buy the
iphone yeah the vast majority of their
customers just go hey it's the iphone on
getting a new one and that's that it's
not because it's the iphone 5 and i
really think the same thing happened
with samsung's next galaxy there oh it's
the next Galaxy everything's gonna
happen like that well look at how many
people were disappointed with the gs3 on
the tech you know us the techies when we
looked at and initially said this
doesn't look any better than the One X
and then it becomes the best-selling
front of the year founder selling 20
million of them you know 10 million
pre-orders
but Samsung the marketing campaign has a
lot to blame for that and I mean they
did a great job doing that and you know
really going against apple and those
commercials they did a phenomenal job
and they made us techniques you know
laughs and hard it's like the notes
doing right now versus them again yeah I
I don't know if they're marketing
campaigns gonna say the same but
playfellow another thing is the galaxy
s3 when you had a couple of phones I
just didn't do anything blatantly wrong
it didn't do anything particularly the
best hood yeah it just the camera wasn't
you know had a good camera and had a
good display and there wasn't anything
that was blatantly awful about it so it
just ended up being a good option I
guess we'll find out about the s for
next Thursday night when Chris woke wiki

well okay so to android authority guys
