cuvee reporting live from CES 2016 I'm
here with one of my colleagues mr.
Andrew Elliot he's the VP of strategic
marketing for ZTE in the United States
thank you very much for spending time
with me today I drew to be here how are
you today sir I'm doing fantastic how
are you doing yeah I think I'm doing
pretty good all things considered that's
quite a setup
thank you yeah you know we're really
blessed the station yeah I know it's uh
we're here in South Hall one just at the
entrance of the Las Vegas Convention
Center so we're really lucky to be here
and you know just want to say big thanks
for coming by so let's let's talk about
2015 sure how was 2015 for CTE 2015 was
a fantastic year for us so you know we
started off here last year 2015 we
announced the grand xmax plus it has
since become when I'm a runaway hit with
with Cricket Wireless ice we couldn't
keep enough of those units on hand for
them but in addition to that we we
launched many other products to the
point where we're at today we have 67
active SKUs across the table carriers in
the United State
and we've also of course announced a few
wonderful unlock devices this one in
particular the axon the axon which you
recall back in July so that was a pretty
bold move for you guys you've never done
anything like that before unlocked the
high specs available on the market quad
HD Snapdragon 810 349 you know also with
the passport just talk about passport a
little bit and tell the audience what
what it is let me get to that and just
well okay here we go
I'll dovetail into okay sure but the
first thing I want to mention is that as
you know you've spoken to our CEO for
ZTE USA we talked a lot about the idea
of affordable premium yes and throughout
the years we continue to do that right
so whether it's the grand ax Max Plus
last year are these two new devices
which we could talk a little bit about
later but essentially there's an entry
level a mid tier and a high-end that we
see as opportunities for us to play in
and in each of those tiers we want to be
able to provide the most affordable most
premium experience and
and I think it's easy to say that we've
done that with the grand ax Max Plus
this last year and that's really where
the active axon device fits in it so
when you look at that hi Ann teer
beautifully spec device it's wonderful
looking of course beautifully priced as
well too so it puts us there now we have
a full range of affordable affordable
premium offerings that we're able to
deliver to consumers and so here in the
United States so that's how that all
plays out and that's why we did that
device to begin with and we've
subsequently launched that all around
the world when we announced this device
here in the United States we announced
this with the with the axon passport
program so even though ZTE is the fourth
largest handset manufacturer in the
United States it's not a household name
and so we knew that when we sold this
device unlocked that consumers some
would have familiarity with the ZTE
brand even though it's been doubling
every year over the past three years but
some may not and in that instance we
wanted to provide assurance to consumers
when they purchased this device from ZTE
that they knew that the company that was
selling it was standing behind it and so
what we did with the axon passport
program is we extended the life of the
warranty on most mobile phones today
it's 12 months this went to 24 months we
also enabled a consumer if there was an
out of warranty repair that needed to be
done we would fix that for the consumer
in any instance where there were a need
to ship the product back and forth
we cover the cost of the shipping as
well very generous it's very generous
and it's again it gets to the - to
really the essence of what we wanted to
do not only with how it fulfilled the
the dream of delivering a series of
devices across a wide range but also
from the standpoint of what we did with
this device so we put the consumer at
the heart of everything that we design
build and deliver and from the moment
that we had the idea of building that
that's what this device was about not
only from the specs to the hardware but
also to the after sales and support
which is what you get with the ax on the
passport program nice this year at CES
just yesterday we announced the the
evolution of the axon passport program
to make it even better so now we have an
ability for a consumer to have unlimited
repairs done unlimited warranty for how
for the life of the warranty over two
years over - if you track your screen
more than you drop it anything send it
back to ZTE of course we continue to do
that they advance exchange like we've
done in the past are there any other
manufacturers on the market that are
aware of any that do that
no HTC has that program but it's a lot
more limited than that it's I think ours
is the best that's available out there
from u.s. manufacturer today so in
addition to that we also have this
ability to provide replacement credits
or
upgrade credit doesn't that I would say
doesn't that cost the company a lot of
money you know it costs money of course
it yes money and he's all do but at the
end of the day once we have a consumer
that's made the decision to purchase
this device it's far more expensive to
attract a new consumer to come in to
replace somebody should they decide to
leave if we were not servicing them
properly so this is a wonderful way to
bring somebody into the ZTV family and
keep them there we want to we want to
continue to Brandt build this consumer
loyalty towards the ZTE brand and this
is a perfect way that we think that we
can do that not only delivering it from
the hardware standpoint but on the
support side of it as well know it's
very important and I think you know
there needs to be more awareness about
it to be honest but it takes time to
build awareness I don't like my
colleagues back at the back of the well
trained you know media professional
who's been in telecom and mobile for a
long time and most you guys might not
know this but Andrew used to work at
Nokia and he's got a lot of great
stories you've been in the industry how
long his room probably well I mean I you
could say I've always been in the
industry so as soon as I got out of
school I started working at a small
software development company up in
Redmond Washington called Microsoft I
was there for 10 years and then after
that I
I joined Nokia yeah and I was there for
eight years and actually almost of the
day have been with de lot for three
years be cool so yeah I mean mobile is
probably the least forgiving industry on
the planet you know we've seen companies
rise and fall my question to you is this
what did ZTE do well in 2015 that needs
to be repeated for further success and
what do you think needs to be changed so
that the company can continuous
trajectory forwards I think there's two
things that we've done well and need to
continue to do extremely well in the
future if I can use that as proper
grammar but the one thing is is working
with the carriers and so making sure
that the products that we develop are
properly fulfilling the needs and
requirements that we work on with them
and they've done a fantastic job based
on our partnerships that we've had with
them over the last several years as long
as we can continue to meet the needs and
demands that they have and their high
there's a high bar to meet there if you
want to have a device in this portfolio
mm-hmm and if you fall they will take
you out of the portfolio so I think it's
a testament to the fact that the success
of the company and our leadership here
at ZTE that we've been successful in
meeting those needs of the customers the
carriers yeah and so we continue to do
that and as I mentioned we have a nice
portfolio of product
that we that we have available for
consumers across all carriers today to
be able to provide we cannot miss a step
in that area yeah so that's one thing
that you'll always see and then you'll
see other devices too that we announced
here one with Cricut at one with
t-mobile again demonstrate how a grand
ecstacy $129 price point you know for a
device to this statute it's in clear
competition with Moto e and the blue
life 1x but I think it's probably a more
compelling option yeah and it's talked
about the accent a little bit more I'm
how did it sell overseas and in Europe a
pack and in China it's done extremely
well yeah so all told across so when we
launched it here in the United States we
launched axon Pro we came with the
companion the axon in China they
launched several versions of excel Macs
and so we have the X on mini axon luxe
and the ax max that's available in China
and then Copely we have the axon elite
okay so all told roughly 1 million
shipment not bad yeah so first time out
of the gate with a flagship device I
think that's pretty impressive I did see
particularly as you said this is an
unforgiving industry and so if it didn't
resonate somewhere I don't think we
would have had the success that we've
had here so and you'll continue to see
you know
sixteen keep an eye on us there's
there's more to come as it relates to
our actual odd story we didn't see a
refresh of the the beloved zmax line
busy Maxine kumin anytime soon well keep
it simmers for te there's an opportunity
to do something like this again and
participate in this yeah I think we'll
have more news about some other products
that's like at Accenture yeah we'll be
checking you guys out of the booth and
you know we'd love to have you come by
thank you very much a great environment
to come by there now I don't know if you
saw our booth last year we did it was
quite entertaining we had some lovely
activation with some NBA legends yeah
and we'll have them again this year in
addition to in addition to that I think
this is the first time at CES which is
that the NBA championship trophy won by
the Golden State Warriors who we are the
official smartphone core will be
featured in our booth tomorrow
oh really by tomorrow it'll be there all
definitely come check violently it's
gonna be very cool that's cool
is there anything else you'd like to add
before we finish things off your
favorite Android site well I just you
know I welcome the opportunity to be
able to bring these devices here and
share them with you today this I think
is the the best budget Android device
that consumers are going to be able to
get
in place probably the best one that
we're announcing here at CES 2016 when
does it go in cylinder so this is going
to be I don't know if we talked about
price or not but it's a hundred 129
dollars this is going on sale this month
okay Cricket Wireless is available on
their 4G and LTE nationwide network
unsung hero of LTE in the States right
absolutely
yeah they do a fantastic job I think so
too well congratulations on a successful
2015 thank you so much for coming by
starts to that today from Android 40
