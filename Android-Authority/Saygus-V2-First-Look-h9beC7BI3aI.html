Andhra Authority and we are still here
at CES 2015 taking a look at the saygus
V squared and this phone has received a
lot of attention here at CES so we
wanted to give you guys a quick first
look and starting off with the design
you're looking at a phone that's made of
Kevlar and metal so it has really nice
build quality and it also has a 5-inch
display on the front that comes in at
1080p resolution so it actually feels
really nice in the hand and it's very
easy to use in one hand because of that
five inch display but some of these
specs on this phone are basically
they're very beefed up specs and that's
the reason why a lot of people have been
looking at this phone it's basically a
phone for people that want very high-end
specs so for the camera for example
you're looking at a 21 megapixel camera
with optical image stabilization built
in and you're looking at a 13 megapixel
camera on the front which also has
optical image stabilization so the
camera is actually really nice and the
phone also comes with a Snapdragon 801
three gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigs of
internal storage which is upgradable to
320 gigs of storage because this phone
actually carries two SD card slots so
you're gonna get a lot of memory you're
gonna be able to fit a lot of stuff onto
this phone it's running on Android 4.4
KitKat and it is upgradable to lollipop
and it's a stock version of Android as
well but the coolest part is that this
phone is bootloader unlocked right out
of the box and they support the whole
rooting process so you're gonna be able
to root this phone without having to
worry about voiding your warranty on the
front of the phone you're looking at
dual front-facing speakers which are
powered by Harman Kardon sound so you're
gonna get really great audio for
listening to music watching videos
movies things of that nature and keeping
this phone powered is a very large 3100
milliamp hour battery so you should be
able to make it through a full day and
possibly even a little bit more the
phone will be available directly through
saygus starting with pre-orders in the
coming weeks and they plan on making it
compatible with all major US carriers
but this has been a quick
first look of the saygus v-squared we're
still here at CES 2015 so stay tuned for
the rest of our coverage because we are
your source for all things Android and
CES 2015</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
