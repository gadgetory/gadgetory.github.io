Android authority and we are live here
at Mobile World Congress taking a look
at the Lenovo pocket projector and this
is Lenovo's portable projector solution
and just to take a tour around the
device here you can see the navigation
keys for navigating through all of your
various content and pausing and playing
videos and on these sides here you're
gonna find two speakers one on the left
and one on the right so you should get
some really great audio when you're
consuming content and just to go over
some of these specs on here you're
looking at a 50 lumen bulb which is
fairly bright for a bulb the size and it
can project up to a hundred and ten
inches worth of display size the
resolution comes in at 854 by 480 you're
looking at up to two-and-a-half hours of
battery life and it weighs only a
hundred and seventy grams so it's fairly
lightweight it's also very small very
easy to hold and sort of carry around in
your in your book bag it's not going to
take up a lot of space it's compatible
with any device running Android 4.3 or
above whether it's a phone or a tablet
and you can broadcast your media either
through the micro SD card slot here so
you can do it locally or you can also do
it via DLNA or miracast from your phone
or tablet all in all this is a very nice
and portable projector and it's being
priced at $1.99 and it will be available
globally but this has been a quick
hands-on look of the pocket projector by
Lenovo make sure to stay tuned to Andrew
authority for the rest of our Mobile
World Congress 2015 coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
