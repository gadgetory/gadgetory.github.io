authority and we're taking a quick look
at the LG G 6 and comparing it to
BlackBerry's new key1 smartphone these
were both announced here at Mobile World
Congress 2017 and they're both Android
smartphones obviously but they're
radically very different on the outside
you've got a glass and metal design on
the g6 and with the key one you're
looking at an aluminum body with a soft
touch leather like backing size-wise
they're actually roughly the same size
despite having completely different
screen sizes both are LCD but with the
g6 LG is gone with a 5.7 inch display
with an 18 by 9 aspect ratio that makes
the screen taller and narrower and it
also has super thin bezels all the way
around which is how LG managed to
squeeze such a large display in a small
body the key one has a smaller 4.5 inch
display with a 3 by 2 aspect ratio and
it's also lower resolution at 1080p
whereas with the g6 you're getting a
quad HD panel but the real
differentiator here is the physical
keyboards that you get with the key one
aside from the satisfying typing
experience that you get from the
keyboard it also doubles as a capacitive
trackpad for navigation scrolling
through webpages or emails and can
assign up to 52 shortcuts to
applications and a variety of other
functions as far as specs go you have a
Snapdragon 820 one with 4 gigs of RAM on
the g6 and a Snapdragon 625 processor
and 3 gigs of ram on the key one battery
capacities are fairly close with 3300
milliamp hours on the g6 and 3505
milliamp hours on the key one and they
both feature quick charge 3.0 but if you
have the US version of the g6 you'll
also get wireless charging something
that you get on the g6 that you won't
find on the key one is ip68 dust and
water resistance which may make the g6 a
more compelling option if that's
something that you need both of them
have fingerprint sensors with the g6 as
being on the rear where it typically is
on an LG device while the key one
actually has it pretty cleverly embedded
into the space bar of the keyboard with
the cameras you have two 13 megapixel
cameras on the rear of the g6 with one
wide angle and one standard angle lens
and over on the key one you've got a
more traditional setup with a single 12
megapixel shooter
but it is a very good sensor at 1.5 5
microns and f2
point-o aperture both of them are
running on Android nougat but the
experience on the key one is much closer
to stock with only a few customizations
from blackberry like the BlackBerry hub
and their state-of-the-art D Tech
security software the g6 features a
revamped version of LG GUI that's been
redesigned with a new 18 by 9 aspect
ratio in mind which you can see trickle
throughout many of the apps and other
parts of the UI like the lockscreen and
wallpapers but which one would you guys
choose let us know down the count's
below and for more on the g6 the
blackberry key one and everything else
here at mold congress 2017 keep it tuned
