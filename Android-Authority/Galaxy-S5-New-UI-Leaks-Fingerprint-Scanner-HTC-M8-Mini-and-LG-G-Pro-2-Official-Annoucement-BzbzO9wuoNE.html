slash Android and sign up now welcome
back to Android weekly where we cover
the week's Android news and we received
even more leaks above the Samsung Galaxy
x5s new UI a supposed on-screen
fingerprint scanner and a rumored almost
bezel asst display the wall street
journal also confirmed that nokia and
microsoft will indeed be launching an
android-powered phone with a new UI that
could look something like this forgive
me for not having much faith in a forked
version of Android I sort of think we're
gonna get scroogled on one side and
micro dicked on the other this latest
rumor suggests that the s5 will indeed
have some form of a fingerprint scanner
it also suggests that Samsung will
depart from the physical home button
according to the rumor the galaxy s5
will allow users to scan their
fingerprints at the bottom of the phone
screen although previous reports have
hinted at a fingerprint scanner this is
the first time we've heard about it
being an on-screen scanner now that
sounds sexy but even though I'm not a
hardware engineer I have to doubt the
durability of such a display that brings
us to the galaxy s5s new UI leaps
several apps including s voice and s
health expected to be pre-loaded on the
galaxy s5 have leaked in the past weeks
and have received a flat utilitarian
overhaul but we should all remember that
Samsung's VP did promise and i quote a
very different design well android army
it turns out that Normandy's d-day has
been confirmed that's right The Wall
Street Journal has confirmed that Nokia
will be announcing an android-powered
smartphone later this month at Mobile
World Congress the device will be quote
tailored in a way that won't promote
some of the key Google developed
features that a more traditional
android-powered phone might in other
words Nokia is forking its version of
Android and therefore the
android-powered phone will not be
compatible with apps in the Google Play
Store now leaks are a good thing in the
world of Android but if you're a house
of cards fan spoilers are a bad thing
but that's okay because I found a way to
hide for my family long enough to watch
all the new 13 episodes of house of
cards on Netflix before any of you
spoilers can spoil my fun chase what are
you doing in the closet with your tablet
welcome back you see as a netflix member
you can instantly watch TV episodes and
movies as much as you want anytime you
want on any device you want an android
authority can give you a free 30-day
trial if you go to netflix.com forward
slash android and sign up now dad I
really need my coat now oh and finally
some hard news because the LG G pro 2
has officially been announced the LG G
pro 2 features a 5.9 inch 1080p display
but LG keeps the phone to a somewhat
more manageable size with it's just a
3.3 millimeter side bezel and an
industry-leading screen to frame ratio
of 77.2 percent inside the LG G pro 2
you'll find a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800
processor and Adreno 330 GPU 3 gigs of
ram 16 gigabytes or 32 gigabytes of
storage a microSD card slot and a
massive whopping 3200 milliamp hour
battery also good news is that the phone
will ship with Android 4.4 KitKat you'll
also be happy to know we have alleged
leaks from the HTC m8 otherwise known as
the successor to the HTC one with dual
rear cameras two tone flash and an
on-screen navigation bar also some good
news for those of you who don't like
large phones is the HTC m8 mini rumor
although it will have the flagship looks
sadly it won't have the flagship specs
dubbed the HTC m8 mini evleaks has
published a short spec list a 4.5 inch
display Snapdragon 400 one gigabyte of
ram 16 gigabytes of on-board storage but
with an SD card slot 13 megapixel rear
camera and it will ship android 4.4
point to kick ad now company executives
told routers that these phones will
launch in the next couple of weeks and
with the s5 launching on februari 24th
and a sony flagship device being
launched soon at Mobile World Congress
this
a month is going to be a delight for
Android aficionados thanks for watching
and write army my name is Jace and I
would love to connect with you on
Google+ or Twitter I read all my common
app replies and tags I may not be able
to answer all of them but I read every
single one of them even the ones trying
to be trolls and micro dicks that's
right don't want to forget about my
brother's an Android Josh Joe in the
tech ninja Kevin and now Christopher is
