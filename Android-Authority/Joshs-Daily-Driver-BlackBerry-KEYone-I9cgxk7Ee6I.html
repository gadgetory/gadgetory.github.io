thumbnail so I'm sure a lot of you users
out there are wondering why well it's
Joshua Vergara what's going on everybody
and I'm here to talk to you about my
daily driver on the daily I use the
BlackBerry key one I'm going to get into
my reasoning in a little bit however if
you haven't seen Milan's video about the
galaxy si and why that phone is his
daily driver you should definitely check
it out he does a good job of explaining
exactly what a daily driver means to him
and I agree mostly with those points the
only other thing I would add to it is
that well this is the phone that I would
actually pay for if I was just a general
consumer and not a reviewer now a lot of
you out there swear by the galaxy Si and
the fact that a lot of you even have one
is actually part of my first reason
exclusivity a BlackBerry brand was
really easy to find back in the day you
had people using bold and curves and
everyone was exchanging bbm pins but
back then much of what blackberry was
doing actually permeates into today's
version of Android you have end-to-end
encryption from device all the way to
the BB servers and you also have bbm
send receipts on top of other great
messaging features now BlackBerry is a
friendly brand it's not one that you
find too often and you might actually go
up to someone and ask them why is that a
Blackberry when they're using it and
that's actually part of the fun we
always talk about Android being a place
where you can personalize and customize
the operating system in order to make it
more individualistic well I think
actually using the BlackBerry key one is
kind of a sign of who I really am and
it's another level of individualism and
part of the reason why the phone is even
head-turning is because of the design a
lot of flagship devices these days go
for the glass and metal designs but
since blackberry is a fringe product
like I mentioned before they could
experiment a little bit more with what
their main phones look like I love what
TCL and Blackberry have done in making
the industrious and business-oriented
key1 design no other device in the
mainstream smartphone game quite looks
like this and it manages to be pretty
sturdy too I dropped this key one a
couple of times in Taipei and aside from
a few scuffs the phone is working
beautifully but of course what the
design comes the main part of the phone
the physical keyboard and one of the
main facets of having that keyboard is
extra input now if you know me from the
Android authority podcast and also
even previous videos I love the physical
keyboard and I also love when there are
extra inputs on phones the reason why is
because it provides a different
experience than the full touchscreen
even just one more button can make all
the difference on a phone but you get
more than 26 in the BlackBerry key one
and that leads to more than 52 different
shortcuts and I actually rarely use the
app drawer or even my doctor's to get to
my most used applications I have see for
calendar K for Google keep Y for YouTube
long press Y for Yelp long press F for
facebook Messenger I for Instagram the
list goes on now even though the screen
is a little bit smaller the fact that
you're doing a lot of the work on the
keyboard itself means that you have the
entire 4.5 inch screen to look at all
the content you want and that includes
scrolling up and down because you can
use the keyboard as a swipeable trackpad
it allows you to go through a number of
places like Instagram and not have to
worry about accidentally liking any
photos Edgar our fellow Andrew authority
brother and also a blackberry fan made
the point that typing with real keys
isn't about typing really fast it's
about typing with confidence because you
have to physically type the right
letters for the most part your overall
typing accuracy actually goes up and
even though this might be a little bit
heavy I actually think that there's a
benefit to typing out the words that end
up appearing on the screen there are
some studies out there that say that
writing in a notebook can be more
beneficial than just typing it onto a
laptop and I think that the key one
keyboard is kind of a happy medium I'm
actually thinking about the letters I'm
typing and thus the notes the journals
the tasks the calendar events that I
create tend to be a little bit better
and remembered in my mind and it's not
like you have to sacrifice that much
speed in order to type what you want to
type swiping to the left deletes whole
words so that that level of speed is
provided on a physical keyboard I know
this all sounds a little bit
unbelievable to you guys but honestly
the BlackBerry quinoa is everything that
I need in my smartphone device now it's
not going to have the Snapdragon 835 and
yes I can feel the difference with the
Snapdragon 625 but for most applications
I don't really need to have the highest
and specifications there are some times
when the phone might get bogged down
when I'm watching youtube videos or
playing some games but for the most part
my main reason why I love this phone is
because of the level of productivity
I've been using the BlackBerry as a way
to get better at calendaring jotting
notes responding to emails and just
generally getting things done audio in
the form of music and podcast is a big
yet secondary need that this phone still
fulfils without many problems and
watching YouTube or TV hasn't been a
problem despite the smaller screen even
then I don't do it so often unless I
have no other way of watching and the
same thing goes for the camera the
camera on the blackberry q10 and it does
a pretty good job I know that I have
said in the past that the LG G 6 would
be my smartphone shooter of choice but
as a vlogger type and as someone that
actually really enjoys photography I
tend to have a compact camera on me at
all times anyway so I usually have those
bases covered it's all about honing in
to exactly what kind of user you are and
I think I've done a good job of figuring
out what it is I really need and the
blackberry King ones to provide all of
that specialization is simply underrated
these days in the tech world and for the
BlackBerry p1 knowing exactly what it is
meant for means that the design the
keyboard and the overall experience are
honed in and if you know me as a
reviewer by now you know that I love it
when a piece of tech does just that and
that is why the BlackBerry key one is my
daily as always thank you guys very much

the BlackBerry key one is my daily
