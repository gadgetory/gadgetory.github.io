you either have or are gunning for
something like this this or even this
but I'm here to tell you that there are
several other options out there some
unsung heroes that you either don't know
about or are just a wee bit underrated
and first up let's start off with the
unsung selfie hero and I'm talking about
the vivo v5 plus and as painful as
browsing our social media feeds with
endless selfies can be most of us have
taken a selfie and we all know that it
can take dozens of shots before you get
that perfect dog thing and for all you
selfie aficionados out there the vivo 5
plus is a device you may want to
consider it has a 16 megapixel shooter
on the rear but that's not where the v5
Plus shines on the front is a dual
camera setup with a primary sensor of 20
megapixels and an 8 megapixel secondary
to bring in additional depth of field
information in other words you get
incredible sharpness and rich detail due
to the primaries higher than average
pixel count and the secondary sensor
allows you to achieve that highly
desirable bokeh effect which is how you
get the creamy blurred background behind
the subject that's perfectly in focus
now this phone also has an aluminum
unibody design with a 5.5 inch display a
high-five audio chip and vivo zone fun
touch 3.0 Android skin after a quiet
launch of last year the vivo 5 plus is
available for around four hundred bucks
u.s. but the cost of importing device
may drive the cost up considerably since
it's not officially available in the US
at this time it may be worth the trouble
with slightly unimpressive specs but in
the hands of someone with a selfie
addiction the veto v5 plus is priceless
now let's move on to where power and
design shamelessly converge in the
Xiaomi me no 2 fortunately the me no
twos resemblance to the Galaxy Note 7 is
more than just skin deep
unfortunately Xiaomi didn't use the qHD
display like Samsung did on the note
seven they use the full HD 1080p display
but the Mino to does run a Snapdragon
820 one CPU an Adreno 530 GPU six
gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes of
on-board storage our own benchmarks show
that the Meno 2 has an outstanding
performance meaning the power users
among us should have no issues running
the latest apps and games it can appease
photography enthusiasts too with a 22
point 5 megapixel rear camera and is
somewhat less impressive megapixel front
facing shooter but one of the most
polarizing features of Asian made
Android phones is the distinctive
software many Asian OEMs put an iOS like
skin over Android and Xiaomi is no
exception
while the consensus seems to be that
Xiaomi skin has been getting better over
time the development community has
gained root access to the mean Note 2 so
you're not stuck with Xiaomi skin
necessarily also like other Asian made
Android phones the main issue with them
you know - seems to be access since it's
not officially offered in the West yet
you'll need to be motivated to get your
hands on the note 7 look-alike but for
those who put in the lake work the Meno
2 features LTE bands that make it usable
in virtually any market now next up
let's talk about a phone that still
provides a great media experience and
I'm talking about the HTC 10 and I'll
tell you why it has an impressive
all-metal build with a dramatic chamfer
that lent to a more dramatic appearance
as well as great in hand feel and
usability for those who find tablets too
big and unwieldy the HTC 10 5.2 inch qHD
display hits that sweet spot but what
made the HTC 10 a compelling option for
2016 and what continues to make the HTC
10 a viable contender is the multimedia
experience that it offers in addition to
the boom sound speaker setup the HTC 10
offers high res audio processing with a
24 bit DAC coupled with display
resolution at 1440p the HTC 10 is a
beast when it comes to media whether
you're listening to music watching
movies or even just watching me on
youtube you really see a
all the time and effort a shippi put
into the HT 210 and let's not forget
that the 10th primary camera ranks among
the top smartphone cameras to date
receiving the same score as the brand
new Samsung Galaxy s8 and being beaten
only by the Google pixel and the new HTC
u 11 now let's talk about the
jack-of-all-trades then mizu pro 6 plus
considering it's running one of the top
CPUs of last year it goes without saying
the Museo 6 plus is a strong performer
and rather than being another iPhone
ripoff in terms of design it's almost
like music a more Frankenstein approach
boring design cues from a number of
other devices for instance the
vertically oriented rear camera and
circular LED flash are reminiscent of
the axon 7 but the aluminum unibody
design evokes the 1+3 while still being
faithful to design of honors other
devices now this device is available in
Asian markets for just over five hundred
dollars but as with other entries on
this list it's not too difficult to have
one shipped to you in the US from abroad
now three and a half years ago if you
guys remember I predicted that Chinese
manufacturers would dominate the market
especially the mid-tier market and that
has happened and it will continue the
onward march will happen and case in
point my daughter my beloved daughter is
now burned through four iPhones the most
recent one was dropped down an elevator
shaft by accident and as well it's gone
it was not buying her a fifth iphone
we're going to buy her something like
this that's far more affordable and if
it gets lost or broken again it doesn't
quite as hurt as much fewer and fewer
people want to buy the $1200 it cost to
buy a new Samsung Galaxy at 8 or more in
some cases what do you think
are you more apt to buy a mid to your
device like this I think more and more
people will be let me know in the
comments below or on the Twitterverse
meet Jeremy shoemaker otherwise known as
shoe money and he became famous for this
