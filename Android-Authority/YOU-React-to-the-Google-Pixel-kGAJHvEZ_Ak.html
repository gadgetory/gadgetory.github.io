via a tweet and also the YouTube
comments on my hands on video so it's
about the Google pixel and I think I
should address the elephant in the room
I am just worried about the guy who
tripped in your 6p comparison I hope he
is alright let me assure you guys that
no one was harmed in the making of that
hence on video a fresh cigar from
Android authority what's going on
everybody and we're here to talk about
the Google pixel and the pixel excel now
we are looking forward to getting those
devices in our hands and doing our full
reviews but even just right after the
announcement of the two phones you guys
had a lot of stuff to say about it so
what I'm doing in this video is using
tweets and also comments on my hands-on
video so that I can relay back what you
guys have been making the discussion
about these phones now I'm not going to
go through the trouble of actually
trying to pronounce anybody's names you
can go in and see it just over on the
side who tweeted or commented on that
particular video so let's go ahead and
get started and I alluded to it earlier
the big elephant in the room is of
course the price of these phones number
one costly number two should have
started with 64 gigabytes it's
definitely a beast but the price tag may
be the biggest obstacle in considering
to get one I actually kind of agree with
all of this the 32 gigabytes might be
good for the typical user especially
somebody that doesn't take a lot of
pictures and let's say videos in 4k
which definitely takes up all of the
space in the phone really quickly but
128 gigabytes is still a really good
option to have starting out at 64
gigabytes well that would have been a
nice thing to have I agree the Nexus 5
was $350 the Nexus 5x was 380 the pixel
is 650 and I thought Google phones were
all about good specs at a good price
it's a shame that it's not that case
anymore now there are a lot of people
being very vocal about this particular
aspect of the pixels and we have talked
about this on the andr thority podcast
Joe Hindi in particular kind of put it
very succinctly that all of the Nexus
users got a little bit too used to
having their phones be at a good price
that was the case of the Nexus and well
the pixel is very much a different beast
at this point now whether or not you
agree with that I can understand
I'm also a little bit peeved about the
very high price of these phone so I can
see where both sides of the argument are
coming from pretty nice phones but
definitely too expensive I would buy two
oneplus threes instead and they would be
just as fast so one of the best parts
about Android is that you have a lot of
choices but one of the worst parts about
it for the pixel is that you do have a
lot of choices one kidney might not be
enough just canceled my pre-order can to
justify the damn price well it's great
that you pre-ordered it but shouldn't
you have known that the price of the
phone was that high when you were
actually pre-ordering it or maybe
thought about it after a while and
decided to cancel it because well maybe
you realize the price really is that
high it looks like an older iPhone and I
think the low price points is what made
the Nexus phone so cool I'll wait for
sleeker hardware in the future that may
justify the price points now to go back
to a point that I made earlier it might
be better to think of the pixel line as
a completely different beast rather than
actually connecting it to the Nexus line
just because it's coming from Google
doesn't mean that pixel and Nexus are at
all the same thing
galaxy s7 and s7 edge over the Google
pixel and pixel excel because
water-resistance microSD card supports
and in addition I wish that gone with
dual front-facing speakers now having a
microSD card I can kind of agree with
that especially if with a 32 gigabyte
model I will be the nice to have some
extra storage but at least you get the
unlimited storage in Google photos so
you can have everything in the cloud and
you can save some device storage that
way here comes another iPhone one I
don't see I'll put the word C there
anything special I just want this phone
to be snappy just like the iPhone
software and hardware are made by Google
it has to be faster and for now I'm
going to say that when I was at the
Google event it did seem like the pixel
phones were really snappy they were
definitely polished and because google
makes Android nougat and there's the 7.1
version that's in it well yeah it did
seem like it was streamlined and
definitely as smooth as you would want
it to be
they are awesome I wasn't happy to see
the chin at first but I'm over it now
the chin is kind of big after all if
this is indeed an HTC designed device
maybe this doesn't come as much of a
surprise but then again you also have a
very powerful what should be a very
powerful microphone in there so it can
always be picking up your voice and
accurately do speech-to-text so I guess
I can see where this is coming from but
I also understand why there might be a
lot of chin there and just for the sake
of a little bit of fun there Jaime
Rivera actually said what's up with the
chin himself - so he's this person's not
alone in what he's saying about the
design of this device and then one of
the big portions here in q4 there's a
lot of competition and the pixel devices
are missing the right feature to really
stand apart now I do agree with this as
well like I said earlier there's a lot
of devices that are available in the
Android space and the pixel is kind of
trying to nudge itself in there and I
don't know if it really has the staying
power to actually do so if Google
assistant will be made available to
other devices I hope that it does
personally but I also understand that if
it's what really makes the Google pixel
stand apart from everything maybe that's
the future you were trying to look for
it's an iPhone
hashtag made by Google only with the
home button placed on the back I hadn't
really thought of it that way but if you
take a look at the back of that device
it's kind of funny that you make that
connection
no oh is no IP rating no wireless
charging no SD card no dual camera no
stereo speakers no physical button
Google obviously wants to make sure that
the focus of the Google pixel and the
pixel excel are the Google assistant and
also the camera which they did a good
job with in the Nexus 6p so there are a
couple of trade-offs here and yeah a lot
of people out there want these
particular features to be in the phone
but then again you have other phones if
you really do want those - now even
though a lot of the criticism might be
coming through these tweets take a look
at this comment right here am I the only
one who is excited for the phone no not
at all we're super excited I'm super
excited to get my hands on a pixel excel
and to review it I actually think that
Google assistant is pretty cool actually
so there's a lot to like about the phone
I'm gonna put the camera through its
paces and know you're not the only one
that's excited I think the transition
from Nexus to pixel has changed the very
reason people bought these phones
earlier on never been more excited but
they took away the affordable in their
flagships something we loved about
hashtag Nexus now I actually really like
this response because it takes into
account the fact that Nexus probably had
its own identity and thus had its own
features and price so while it isn't
completely valid for many
users to feel like they are being let's
say overcharged or maybe these funds are
too expensive for them because they're
used to previous Nexus phones it's
important to understand that the pixel
line is completely different I totally
get where you're coming from and I feel
your pain trust me but it's kind of
clear now that we're not gonna have
Nexus phones for a while if at all so
you know this is what Google has brought
us and to end this video just a couple
of final tweets some fun ones rather
from a couple of our friends a quick
shout out to you guys just pre-ordered
an XL I'm gonna hate returning my note 7
but at least the pixel won't explode on
me god forbid the pixel actually has to
get discontinued the way that the note 7
has and of course just making sure that
we're all very practical about all this
lawn responds with you don't know that
just yet they make me really blue they
speak to my quite black soul I think
I'll remember this day until I'm really
silver now the only question I have for
that is what exactly do you mean by
really silver so that should do it for
this reactions videos I just wanted to
bring you guys a look into what you guys
are saying about the pixel and pixel XL
and about this and change in Google's
mentality at large now in the future we
might do more reaction videos like this
so stay tuned to andrew authority for
hands-on device videos and make sure you
let us know how you feel about various
pieces of news and if you see a tweet
from us asking your opinion you can
always respond to that and maybe you'll
be featured in a video like this as well
keep it tuned to Android Authority for
even more about the Google pixel and the
pixel XL and future devices of course
and stick around for that full review if
you're still on the fence and have them
out pre-ordered your device already of
course there's a long wait for it still
so keep it tuned here for that and even
more because we are your source for all
things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
