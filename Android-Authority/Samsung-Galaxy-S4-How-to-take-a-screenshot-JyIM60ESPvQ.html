from Android Authority comm today I've
prepared a simple tutorial on how to
take a screenshot on the Samsung Galaxy
s4 smartphone sit tight for the
instructions on how okay many of our
viewers will probably know how to
capture the screen on their phone but
for those of you who just got the
Samsung Galaxy s4 or new to Android
devices
sit tight because we're going to be
covering two methods on how to capture
the screen so whenever you find yourself
wanting to capture the screen simply
hold the power button and the home
button simultaneously until you get the
confirmation that the screen was
captured method 1 is as simple as that
now on to method 2 right from the home
screen we're going to jump in and enable
the palm motion well access our settings
menu and then we'll click the my device
folder under there going to click
motions and gestures where we'll access
the palm motion option we're going to
want to make sure that that's activated
you can slide left and right for the
capture screen and also palm controls to
mute and pause music but to capture the
screen you simply put your palm on the
display and slide left to right you can
then save your screen shot and access it
right in the notifications bar or you
can make various edits as well as view
your other screenshots edits include
cropping color changing and you can even
draw on your photo to share a certain
aspect of it with your friends you have
various pencils as well as a racer and
many colors to choose from in fact I'll
go ahead and choose red so you can make
sure this stands out you can save your
image and share it on various social
networking sites so let's say you're
browsing your favorite web site you
stumble upon an article that you want to
save for later or perhaps share with
your friends simply place your palm on
the left of the screen and slide right
then when you get the visual
confirmation that the screenshot is
saved you can access it again from the
notification bar from there you'll be
directed to the folder containing all of
your recent screenshots this time I'll
make some color balance tweaks similar
to Instagram you can run your photo
through various filters and make changes
to the color brightness and saturation
of this photo now we can choose to save
these changes or discard them I'm going
to go ahead and discard them
and like I said from there we can share
them on our various social networks
that's it folks have fun saving all of
your screen shots on your Samsung Galaxy
s4 and thanks again for watching this is
