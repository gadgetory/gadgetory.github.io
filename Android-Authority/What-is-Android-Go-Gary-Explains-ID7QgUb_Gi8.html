authority and you may have heard of
Android Go and how it started to appear
on certain low-end Android devices for
example I recently reviewed the Nokia
one which is an Android device running
Android Orio 8.1 Go Edition so that does
lead us to the question what is the
difference between normal Android and
Android go well if you want to find out
please let me explain ok the first thing
I'll say about Android Go is it is
actually Android it isn't a kind of
cut-down version or a kind of a semi
compatible version it is Android and you
can actually when you go to the Play
Store you have access to all the normal
apps that your hardware could physically
support obviously if you hasn't got a
very good GPU or it hasn't got very good
CPU performance and there gonna be some
limitation to what it can do bring terms
of compatibility it can run all the
normal Android apps so from that point
of view this is just Android but there
are four things that we need to point
out that tell us about the difference
between standard stock Android and
Android go the first one is about
performance now Google spent a lot of
time tweaking the Android go sources so
that it works better on devices with one
gigabyte of memory or even less they've
also done a lot to make sure that the
apps start up quicker that they are able
to run with a reasonable performance on
a low-end device so the first point is
performance and Google Play itself will
actually recommend for you light or kind
of go apps including our Google's
Android go apps apps are designed to run
better on low-end devices in fact app
developers have the option to provide
two apk files as to application files to
the Play Store one of them being tweaked
and tuned specifically for running on
low-end devices and Google Play will
actually tell you about those our apps
when you use the Play Store now it isn't
only about performance it's also about
storage so the second point is internal
storage now many of these devices will
come with either 8 or 16 gigabyte of
internal storage
now the Nokia one which I reviewed
recently has
gigabytes of internal storage now on a
modern kind of phone from let's say
Samsung or oneplus or Sony or someone
like that that eight gigabytes will just
be completely eaten up with to have
Android and the pre-installed apps but
Android Go does two things first of all
there is a minimum number of
pre-installed apps and secondly they've
Google and a lot of work optimizing the
space so that as little as possible is
actually used by Android and by those
apps so for example on the Nokia one
although it's got 8 gigabytes 4
gigabytes of that is free for files and
data and photos which is quite different
to example my note 8 11 gigabytes I use
just for the kind of Android and the
system apps so they've really pared that
down so the only four gigabytes are used
which means that you know you get some
free space on an 8 gigabyte device
obviously a 16 gigabyte device would be
even better and linked with that these
Android go apps like Gmail go and maps
go for example use much much less disk
space than their counterparts for
example you're talking just like 60 K or
70 K for one of these apps rather than
two three four five six even higher
megabytes that would be for the full
versions and the third important thing
is data saving many of these places
where Android Go will be used people
probably don't have access to high
amounts of data in their cellular plan
and so therefore Google offering various
data saving features for example chrome
itself can actually offer compression
for it's downloading things from the
internet and to do that it actually
sends the data first of all to Google
servers and then it compresses it and
then sent it down to your phone and
therefore saving your bandwidth when
you're using 4G of course there are
privacy concerns about that but Google
are obviously saying that name storing
of that data and it just gets streamed
in a compress form down to your phone
another data saving feature is that for
individual apps you can specify whether
they have access to the 4G LTE network
or whether they should only work over
Wi-Fi whether they can run in the
background of Seoul and that allows you
to pare down how much of your data plan
is being used by the Android system and
also the Android files
Oh app that is part of Android Go has a
really neat way of sharing files between
two phones using Wi-Fi and actually I
started using this myself
even on a higher-end phone like the note
8 because it's a really quick way to
copy file so recently someone went to a
family event and we wanted to copy the
files over and I said hey just install
file to go which we did and then we were
able to transfer these photos literally
in seconds it was quite amazing because
it's doing it at the full speed of Wi-Fi
between these two very close devices so
they're offering ways of saving data
that doesn't mean if I send things up to
the cloud and then back down again which
of course could use up your data plan
and the fourth thing to talk about is
updates now I'm like let's say the
Android that comes on a pixel device
Android go does not come directly from
Google it comes from the OEM so if you
buy a device from Nokia or from any
other device that's running Android Go
the updates of the security patches and
any updates of the operating system will
come from the OEM and not directly from
Google so on the Nokia one I was
reviewing actually I reviewed it in
April 2000 18 and actually the security
update was only from January 2018 so
there's already there we can see a lag
in what comes out but that's the normal
story that you get with Android and you
have to see which manufacturers which
OMS are actually providing more timely
updates for their version of Android go
and so they have it for things that make
Android go different to stock Android
first of all it's been tweaked for
better performance on low-end devices
secondly it's better at handling the
storage and in fact the Android go
versions of the apps are actually
smaller thirdly there are these data
saving functions that allow you to save
data on your cellular plan and fourth it
comes from the OEM and not from Google
directly itself
my name is Gary Sims and this is Andrew
authority I really hope you enjoyed this
video please you know what I'm gonna ask
you to do give us a like do share this
on social media do go down there into
the comments and tell me what you think
about Android go do also hit that Bell
notification icon do you become part of
our notifications squad okay well that's
it I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
