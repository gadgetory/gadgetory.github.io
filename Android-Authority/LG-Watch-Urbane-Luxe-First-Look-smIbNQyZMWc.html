in one of those really fancy cases well
then this one might be the one you've
been waiting for its structure of a car
from Android authority what's going on
everybody and we're taking a look at the
LG watch urbane luxe when after looking
at a new coat of paint here that allows
the LG watch urbane to add a new fancy
word behind its name 23 karat gold
featuring an exotic alligator leather
strap inside of this lacquer case that
you saw me open really kind of sums up
the changes with the LG watch urbane has
everything underneath the surface here
is still the same as last year's pretty
well reviewed watch by LG in the West
we're really looking at 500 units and
each one will have their own unique
serial number making this a true
one-of-a-kind proposition the version
that I'm using right now was used by one
of our friends over at LG which is the
reason why it is in Korean right now
just so you know but what we're looking
at here is 23 karat gold around the
actual digital face itself including a
very large crown on the side is still
just a push button from the LG watch
urbane now a 23 karat gold has been
mixed in with what we think is a
stainless steel that allows it to be a
little bit heavier than 24 karat gold
and definitely a lot more solid than 18
karat gold at least that is what we have
been told by LG the clasp at the bottom
was designed by Cartier and it is a
deployment clasp as it's called and
after you get used to adjusting it a
little bit and then clasping down on
both sides of the strap it does feel
quite luxurious because of the fact that
it feels a little bit complicated to put
together but once again everything that
is underneath is definitely the same
watch as it was last year with the LG
watch urbane that comes with a one point
three inch p OLED circular display at
320 by 320 resolution with a pixel
density of 249 pixels per inch
additionally it has a quad core
Snapdragon 400 and half a gigabyte of
RAM underneath with a 410 million power
battery this is definitely a larger
watch if you're not used to very large
smartwatches and this one might be a
little bit too big for the majority out
there but really the gold just
absolutely shines for lack of a better
and this looks like one of the most
luxurious smartphones we have ever seen
it's definitely a sight to behold
especially when you have this lacquer
case that just starts off the experience
just opening it up really makes you feel
like you put your investment into this
particular luxury watch in this case a
Smart Watch probably one of the first
and hopefully not the last to have this
kind of style $1200 is what you're going
to be investing to get the LG watch
urbane luxe and at $1200 it might just
be the investment you've been looking
for if smartwatches haven't been doing
it in the style and luxury department
for you this is Joshua Vergara once
again from Android authority reporting
to you live from Aoife in Berlin
bringing you all the best from here our
meeting with LG</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
