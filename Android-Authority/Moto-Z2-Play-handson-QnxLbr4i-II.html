predecessor was released but I honestly
don't think that Lenovo cares at this
point
hey guys John be here with Android
authority and this is a quick hands-on
look at the Moto easy to play I'm not
going to lie I'm loving the design of
the z2 play it feels superior compared
to last year's model and it's also
thinner skinnier this time around it has
also a 30 or build construction it just
seems not as fragile as lasher's model
and that's because it features a unibody
aluminum construction so it feels super
sturdy in the hand and the same time too
it's lighter and thinner like I said now
the only compromise that's made to the
handset given now it has a thinner body
is of course the battery that's in here
compared to last year's model this only
has a 3000 milliamp power one versus the
35 10 milliamp power battery of the
original so who knows how it's going to
perform but again with all the
optimizations with the software and also
the processor it might be the same if
not more but regardless they do not
offer a moto mod pack which gives it a
thirty four ninety milliamp hour battery
through Turbo Power pack you could get
so if you're interested in battery
that's going to be solution for you but
it's nice to see that they've kept the
three in half millimeter has a jack you
have the USB type-c port the same
modular design coach as the other hand
steps and the fingerprint sensor on here
has been slightly tweaked it's now more
in an oval shape and it's recess now I
also don't have many complaints about
the display on here it's a 5.5 inch
1080p AMOLED display has a lot of great
qualities you have good details it's
short saturated colors exceptional
viewing angles the only concern I have
is maybe it's performance in outdoor
conditions but right now it looks really
nice it's definitely in mid ranger
territory because it features a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 626 processor you have three
gigabytes of RAM 32 gigabytes of
internal storage and a micro SD card
slot so the performance out of the box
here seems good it's running Android
7.1.1 new
it has very little customizations you
can see some of the influences from
Verizon because this is a Verizon
exclusive but besides that it has all
the typical features of Motorola so you
have things like the active display so
it breeds some useful information and
besides that it's pretty much a stock
experience now I'm not going to go in
too much detail about the rest of the
phone because this is a quick hands-on
look as far as the camera is concerned
here it sticks out in the rear here you
have a 12 megapixel do autofocus rear
camera with an F 1.7 aperture lens you
have a dual LED flash and up to 4k video
recording with this on the front we have
a 5 megapixel snapper with the wide
angle F 2.2 lens and also features a
dual LED flash if you're interested in
10 set just know that it is Verizon
exclusive but they will release an
unlocked version later in the summer and
that one's going to retail for $500 now
who knows whether or not it's worth $500
we'll be doing a lot more testing on
this handset but you guys won't learn
more about the Moto G to play you could
