by bitdefender mobile security Lenovo's
10 inch tablet has been updated with a
better screen a better processor and it
retains its own signature style it's
josh vagar from android authority what's
going on everybody and this is the
Lenovo yoga tablet 10 HD plus the
original yoga tablet took a page out of
the yoga line of laptops and that it
wanted to take mobility to a different
level many Android tablets these days
are black slates or large slabs that
require a third party accessory or some
sort of apparatus to make it stand up on
its own Lenovo sought to fix this issue
by creating a tablet that was not only
sleek but included its own solution to
this problem enter the yoga tablet 10
which sported a more enlarged lower
portion that house not only a larger
battery for better longevity but also a
sturdy stand that allowed the tablet to
be used in a couple different but very
practical positions as far as the tablet
itself goes we have a 10-inch screen
that this time around has been brought
up to full HD at 1920 x 1200 resolution
while much of what comes out of the
screen looks quite good I would argue
that the colors do look a little washed
out at times and could use a little more
fidelity all around a nice metallic
finish adorns this entire tablet making
the device feel very sturdy and other
premium quality it also is pretty
incredibly thin until you get to the
stand and battery portion of course as
the thinnest part of the tablet gets to
just around three millimeters thick for
a 10-inch tablet it sure doesn't feel
like it takes up too much space it's not
hard to maneuver the tablet in your
hands and it's not hard to keep it
steady in one hand especially if you use
it in portrait mode and take advantage
of the leverage provided by the thicker
portion underneath the surface are some
more updates especially when considering
the processing package the original yoga
tablet 10 sported a mtk chipset but this
time around the Snapdragon 400 has been
employed to bring solid performance 2
gigabytes of RAM and 32 gigabytes of
on-board storage are also available as
we have alluded to the large battery the
nine thousand million Bauer unit does
provide up to 18 hours of battery life
as per Lenovo's claims and it should go
for quite a while until it needs a
charge now Lenovo's you I does try to
keep things as stock as it can but it
may not impress too many users out there
as it does do away with the
drawer and thus you can get your home
screens riddled with icons and widgets
if left on it also doesn't seem to be
completely optimized at least from my
standpoint as it lacks the snappiness of
plenty of other user interfaces much
less more stock like offerings but in
the end what really differentiates this
tablet is its mobility with a stand
built-in you can use the tablet as a
simple viewing apparatus or angled up
for easier typing and manipulation it's
one of those features you don't realize
you really wanted until it's finally
provided to you and that is what makes
the yoga tablet pretty special we'll see
the yoga tablet 10 HD Plus in the market
towards the middle part of this year so
keep it tuned to android authority as we
continue to bring you all of the best
coverage from the Mobile World Congress
