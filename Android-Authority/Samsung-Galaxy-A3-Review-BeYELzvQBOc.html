Andrew authority and for the longest
time people have been begging Samsung to
use something other than plastic on
their phones and the desire for this
among Samsung diehards became even more
apparent when competing OEMs were
stepping up their build quality a few
months back Samsung finally gave us that
with the somewhat mid-range Galaxy alpha
and that eventually translated to the
flagship we now know as the Galaxy Note
4 what their new a series Samsung is
looking to step up their build quality
once again and while these phones might
not be coming stateside they're still
very important to look at because it
could be a preview of what's to come
with future Samsung flagships let's go
ahead and take a look at the Samsung
Galaxy a3 for many years Samsung phones
have been made entirely of plastic and
although this didn't affect the phone's
durability they certainly didn't feel
like a high-end flagship should what the
galaxy a3 or any of the a-series phones
for that matter you're getting one of
the first phones from Samsung to feature
a full unibody metal construction a step
up from what we saw on the Galaxy alpha
or no.4 which were only metal on the
sides aesthetically it still looks like
a standard Samsung phone with the
rounded corners and flat sides and the
signature home button flanked by
capacitive keys the way it feels in the
hand however is a stark difference from
something like the galaxy s5 which
featured a plastic construction the a3
feels solid and is proof that Samsung is
plenty capable of making a premium
feeling phone the back is smooth to the
touch but the phone isn't slippery like
you might think the flat sides and
chamfered edges provide plenty of grip
and because the a3 is the smallest out
of the a-series bunch it's extremely
easy to hold and operate in one hand
something you can't say about many
smartphones nowadays a staple feature
for many Samsung users has always been
the removable battery but because the a3
is unibody you're not going to build
swap batteries like you normally would
on many other Samsung phones for some
this might not be that big of a deal but
it could be a drawback especially if
it's something you've become so
accustomed to with Samsung over the
years the remainder of the hardware
comes with either 8 or
ten gigs of storage and LTE connectivity
onboard although I was not able to get
it to work on t-mobile's network in
typical Samsung fashion the easy to
reach power button is on the right side
and like most phones designed for
international markets two SIM card slots
can be found below the power button one
of which actually doubles as a micro SD
card slot for up to an additional 64
gigs of storage the volume rocker can be
found on the left side and the microUSB
and 3.5 millimeter headphone jack are
located on the bottom leaving the top
completely blank with the exception of a
microphone the single speaker can be
found on the back side of the phone next
to the camera and flash which is very
reminiscent of the rear layout on the
galaxy s3 it produces a clean sound
without any sort of distortion but the
actual speaker volume was pretty low
compared to a lot of other phones that
I've used with a single speaker the good
thing about the speaker placement is
that your hand is not naturally covered
up when holding the phone in portrait
but otherwise it's a fairly standard
rear firing speaker
the screen on the a3 is a super amoled
display measuring in at 4.5 inches with
960 by 540 resolution also known as
lowercase q HD with the M LED screen
you're going to get those really deep
blacks high contrast ratios saturated
colors and wide viewing angles at 4.5
inches the screen is great for
one-handed use but in today's day and
age where 5 to 5.5 inches is the norm
many might find it to be too small the
resolution is also quite low but in
general everyday use like web browsing
and reading social media I didn't find
it to be too much of a problem when it
comes to gaming and watching YouTube
however this is where I really missed
having an HD display not only do games
look pixelated but you can't watch
anything on YouTube beyond 360 P so from
a media consumption standpoint the
display leaves a lot to be desired
moving on to the performance the a3 has
performed quite well in most situations
inside is a Snapdragon 410 Adreno 306
and 1 gigabyte of RAM this is Qualcomm's
updated 64-bit mid-tier processor and
while it's a pretty modest package it
provides more than enough power to
handle most tasks on the a3 including
graphic intensive gaming with very few
hiccups the only real issue that the a3
suffers from is that it likes to redraw
the home screen after playing a high-end
game or spending a lot of time in the
camera this is most likely due to only
having one gigabyte of RAM as it only
happens with apps that eat up a lot of
memory but outside of that it performs
about as well as you would want it to
taking a look at the camera on the back
of the a3 you'll find an 8 megapixel
sensor and diving right into the camera
interface you'll notice that it hasn't
changed much aesthetically from previous
Samsung devices among many others
standard settings like exposure ISO and
white balance can all be found in the
bottom left and the shooting modes can
be accessed by a3 menu on the right
shooting modes have been slimmed down to
only include beauty face rear cam selfie
continuous shot and animated Jeff along
with the essentials like panorama night
mode and HDR the picture quality is
serviceable but for the serious
smartphone photographer the cam
is going to be a disappointment even in
good lighting there is a noticeable
amount of noise and in general photos
are soft and muddy with very little
detail this becomes more apparent in
low-light and nighttime photography and
with a maximum ISO of only 800 low-light
shots will suffer but the built-in night
mode and even HDR can help improve the
situation without resorting to flash but
all in all the camera isn't overly
impressive what I did find to be
impressive is the battery life the a3 is
a small and compact phone so naturally
the battery inside is also going to be
small coming in at only 1,900 milliamp
hours but battery life has been
surprisingly good some of this has to do
with the battery saving properties of
the AMOLED display and the low
resolution which means the processor
doesn't have to work as hard to push all
those pixels around thus conserving
battery life even with a fair amount of
gaming and watching YouTube I was still
able to get between 12 to 15 hours off
the charger and four to four and a half
hours of screen on time which is more
than enough to get through a full day
and that's all you can really ask of
this phone considering the battery
capacity fortunately if you are in
desperate need for extended battery life
Samsung's ultra power saving mode makes
a return here this switches your phone
to a grayscale color palette and limits
functionality so using it all the time
isn't practical but it can really come
in handy when you're low on battery and
need to prolong the battery life for as
long as possible and finally in software
the a3 is running on Android 4.4 KitKat
with none other than Samsung's TouchWiz
but this is not the same touch with
experience that you might be used to in
fact the only thing that TouchWiz on the
a3 shares in common with high-end
flagship like the s5 and Note 4 is the
aesthetic appearance other than that
this is a very slimmed down version of
TouchWiz there's no multi window no air
gestures no smart stay or smart pause
and the usual slew of pre-installed
Samsung bloat like chat on and s-health
are not present here surprisingly s
voice Samsung's personal assistant is
also gone the experience reminds me a
lot of what was on the Galaxy S 2 before
touchwiz became so cluttered and
convoluted and it really feels like
Samsung is taking a lot of steps
backwards and removing a lot of the
redundancies that they put on top of
Android it is possible that this could
be a preview of what we're going to see
on the Galaxy s6 and if it is I think
it's a TouchWiz experience that many
users will be very happy with and this
is the first time in a long time where I
actually didn't mind using TouchWiz so
hopefully it's here to stay
pricing and availability will vary based
on region with no plans on a u.s.
release but it can be had for less than
320 dollars through sites like Amazon
and expanses for a mid-range phone the
price can seem rather expensive
especially when you consider other
budget offerings like the Moto G which
will give you a very comparable
experience but without the same level of
build quality then there's phones like
the oneplus one which offers a much
higher end experience for around the
same price and if you can get an invite
it's obviously the superior choice when
looking at the overall package but there
you have it for the samsung galaxy a3
samsung is stepping up their build
quality once again with the a-series
lineup and while the a3 is not
necessarily a flagship it is an overall
very solid and affordable smartphone
with a build quality that can rival some
of the most top-tier devices out there
this isn't going to satisfy users who
want a higher end experience but if
history is any indication we're going to
be seeing this design or at least
something very similar to it in a
Samsung flagship pretty soon as always
