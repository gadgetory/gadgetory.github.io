Authority and Samsung is looking to
reinvent the wheel with their latest
SmartWatch this is your first look and
hands-on of the Samsung gear s2 but the
gear s2 Samsung is looking to really
make an impact in the wearable space by
changing the way we interact and use a
SmartWatch it's a circular SmartWatch
and it's going to come in two different
versions the regular gear s2 which has a
more modern and minimalist design and
the gear s2 classic which has a more
traditional take on watch design for a
more timeless and elegant appearance the
other big difference between the two
lies in the band's with the gear s2
featuring silicone bands whereas the
classic will come with leather straps
both of which felt really comfortable on
the wrist and the silicone bands were
surprisingly very soft
the band's come in different sizes and
styles so there's going to be something
for everyone and they're also very easy
to swap out on the gear s2 they simply
just slide out of the body and on a
classic you have a more familiar spring
bar mechanism that you would find on a
lot of normal watches on the side of the
watch you'll notice two buttons the top
button is basically your back button to
take you back a previous step and the
second button functions as a home key
and as a shortcut to quickly launch into
the app drawer and finally on the back
side you'll find a heart rate sensor to
help you monitor your health and fitness
outside of the design differences
they're practically the same watch but
the real kicker with the gear s2 is the
rotating bezel and this is no doubt the
best part about this SmartWatch the
bezel is used for navigating through all
the various parts of the UI like the
watch faces widgets notifications apps
etc and whenever you turn it it gives
off this extremely satisfying click
which makes it not only fun to use but
also great just to fiddle around with
it's also very easy to turn with just
your finger and just make sense in terms
of how intuitive it feels and it sort of
makes you wonder why no one's thought of
it until now on the front of the watch
is a 1.2 inch Super AMOLED display with
360 by 360 resolution and so far the
screen looks really good it's plenty
sharp first SmartWatch display and of
course since it's AMOLED it should be
much more battery friendly and you've
got all the usual things you might
expect like vibrant punchy
great viewing angles and deep blacks
inside the gear s2 is running on a
dual-core one gigahertz processor with
512 megabytes of RAM and 4 gigabytes of
internal memory which should be more
than enough for a smooth and seamless
experience and comes with all the usual
connectivity like Wi-Fi Bluetooth and
NFC which can be used to take advantage
of Samsung pay but Samsung is looking to
expand its use in a variety of different
ways like smart car keys
residential room keys or remotely
controlling your home the watch is also
ip68 certified against water and dust
but this is designed to just protect a
watch itself so if you get the classic
version don't expect the leather to hold
it well under water the battery is a 250
milli amp hour cell and Samsung is
promising at least 2 to 3 days worth of
battery life which sounds pretty
reasonable for a SmartWatch and it also
comes with wireless charging with a
wireless charger that looks eerily
similar to the Moto 360 for the software
the gear s2 is running on Samsung's own
Tizen platform and in conjunction with
the rotating bezel it's fairly easy to
navigate to the left of the watch face
are all of your notifications like
messages and emails and to the right
side or all of your widgets and you can
pretty much add a widget for anything
such as health and fitness news weather
or even music the watch faces are also
customizable and not only can you change
the watch faces but you can also change
the way they look and what type of
information they show like the current
weather or battery life just like any
typical SmartWatch the Tizen OS lets you
send and receive notifications like
emails and text messages and you can
also respond to messages through voice
input emojis or just use good old
fashioned t9 style typing with the
virtual keyboard another really useful
feature of the gear s2 is the ability
for notifications to still sync even if
the watch isn't connected directly to
your SmartWatch via bluetooth it works
pretty similarly to Android wear so as
long as your watch is connected to a
Wi-Fi network your notifications will
still sync through the cloud one of the
most important things when it comes to
any sort of mobile product is the app
selection and in order for Samsung to
make the Tizen platform as robust as
possible they've partnered with a bunch
of different companies like eBay and
Groupon for Commerce Twitter and line
for social and CNN and blue
berg for news the list goes on but
samsung says there's going to be around
a thousand apps from the gear s2
launches and if you're big on Fitness
Samsung has their own s health app but
they've also partnered with companies
like Nike and life some to help you keep
track of your goals even though the gear
s2 is running Tizen it's going to be
compatible with any Android device
running 4.4 kitkat or higher with the
least one-and-a-half gigs of ram which
should cover the good majority of
Android users Samsung has yet to
announce any sort of pricing or
availability but once they do we'll
definitely keep you posted on Android

tuned for that but this has been a quick
hands-on look of the Samsung gear s2
