original android hangout show on google+
I'm Derek Ross i'm scott anderson dan
Charlton and I'm Johnathan Franklin this
week we're going to talk to you about
Motorola's new logo and what that means
for google we're gonna hit up some
developer news we're gonna hit up the
google play edition devices let us know
in the comments what you think about
them if you're going to buy them we're
gonna hit up some contest information
we're giving away a galaxy note 8.0 we
have another special edition to give you
a special code for the giveaway we're
gonna talk about some devices from sony
some app updates from google search
google now is doing some awesome new
stuff people play movies is getting a
little more hollow with the new layout
and we just love its root and rom and
stuff over it's an engine mod that just
protects our privacy a little bit more
and Dan's gonna talk about what Dan does
best some carrier news some LTE
information and some patent wars that
judges denied the samsung galaxy s4 on
something which is cool alright guys so
uh so let's get started here let's talk
about Motorola's new logo ok it's a logo
why we making a big deal out of it well
cuz Google wants it right alright so so
for tech week at the bottom of the
website which motorola is a sponsor of
we noticed that a new logo appeared and
the traditional logo that you know we've
come to know and love it with a bright
red circle with an M in the middle it's
been it's been updated a little bit so
the new logo wraps the traditional m
logo with a segmented color wheel that
you know it feels very googley you know
that's the google colors but most
importantly underneath the traditional m
that we're used to seeing it says a
google company so why is this a big deal
well google has google bought motorola
you know roughly a year ago a long time
ago and just now you know year and a
half later we
are seeing the fruits of that labor come
to fruition we're seeing Google saying
all right Motorola is ready for a change
here's their new logo but more
importantly we are ready to tell the
world that Motorola is a google company
because remember you know they've been
following along with most likely with
devices that they've had in the pipeline
over the past year year and a half you
know it's been devices that were already
planned out already contracts already
made agreements already had so they're
there they're saying okay this is our
Motorola let let's move let's move
forward with it so with that said I
think Motorola is in need of a tire
change and in and needs to let the world
know who they are hello we're Motorola
this is a new awesome this is the new
motorola i thought you know i think
google coming out and saying that in
their logo and reading a lot of
intuitive is is good that's what do you
guys think about that it's a logo but i
mean it says a lot in a logo right yeah
i really could carry much it's not bad i
certainly seen wheres logos I've seen
cooler ones so you could only her don't
know the big deal that Google actually
says hey we all motorola in the logo
letting everybody know that i think it's
a good up publicity it's good publicity
for the company and you know God knows
they they need that because of where
they came from and you know your devices
they haven't come out with a device in a
little while um I think it's not a
googly device I like the fact that
they're putting the Google into Motorola
yeah the thing is making right the brain
where name not that you know the name
doesn't make the brand the logo doesn't
make the brand the brand makes the name
so rebadge is awesome just make it count
all right all right so so John speaking
of making it count talks let us know
about what developers can now do on the
google play store yeah so we saw a
little bit of an i/o when they dimension
that when they mentioned it but
developers are now able to mark their
applications for Google Play for
education
and as you can expect this is something
that's going to go out to kids and it's
going to be a little bit different than
the typical play policies where it's
going to be very heavily monitored and
curated is it necessarily for kids or is
it for google apps for education Oh are
there places a lot more universities a
little bit of both I mean I'm sure
there's I think there's going to be a
part of the market where you can you
know as a consumer you'll get to see
part of it to the way they're going to
do it is they're going to the developer
is going to mark it out to place it in
into a queue for evaluation you know by
a third party network of educators and
then the educators are actually going to
assign the apps to the appropriate
subject I mean grade level you know an
applicable common core standards like
the meta-data part of it so this is
going to be very professionally done
compared to you know what you would see
with a normal submission you know just
not the developers aren't just going to
throw it out there and you know get it
stamped as a educational app it's going
to be yet very monitored very curated to
something very specific for kids to and
that's really how it should be
especially for young children anyway you
don't want you don't want crap ending up
in that category all right so let's
continue talking about Google Play stuff
let's talk about the big news this week
yesterday the news that we've heard for
a month and a half you know since google
i/o finally happened the samsung galaxy
s4 finally dropped on the Play Store as
well as the HTC One in their pure
Android goodness their google play
edition this is it is what it's
officially being called your your pure
exportation quotation right now before
you know before we call these devices
Nexus user experience you know and
various people around the web of said
these devices were Nexus devices they're
like Nexus devices
and we've heard you know a lot of
speculation on what they actually call
so actually call Google Play editions
they're not a Nexus device and they
shouldn't be treated as a Nexus device
now a little bit of history here I
believe everybody here you know Dan John
Scott this is something that you know we
have wanted that we know losses android
fans have wanted to see the talk phones
from the top manufacturers come with
with stock and roy you know we don't
want their skins we don't want their
apps we just want a powerful phone from
the big guys run stock android right
sure but unfortunately we're still
waiting for that okay okay i will get to
that we'll get to that so this has been
something for years that the Android
enthusiasts such as us have wanted you
know we we root and we've wronged our
devices to get rid of TouchWiz to get
rid of sense and when google announced
this is like wow this is almost
unbelievable this is something that you
know we've been waiting for so so let's
talk about that and before we move on
let us know what you think of these
google play edition devices in the
comments have you bought one which one
did you buy why did you buy it or why do
you hate it why should we bring out our
pitchforks why should we kill it with
fire you know a lot of people don't like
these right so so let's move into some
talking points about this soap hugo
barra during the IO 13 keynote said that
these devices will receive you know
timely updates and everyone applauded
and that's a great because one of the
big things with Android is you know
timely updates Nexus devices are the
only ones to get updated right away hey
at the previous I Oh didn't they form
some common alliance for timely updates
yeah it i io io 2011 the year but Betty
alliances that have been formed that
have not necessarily held up their end
of the bargain yeah so that android
alliance actually never did anything in
the year was actually around but hey
last year the platform developers kit
you know became available to OEMs and
and yeah we're waiting to see a lot of
big changes
that too so that has helped with new
devices though because you're saying new
devices with the newest version a lot
more than okay all right I'll give them
that I'll give them that John okay so so
OEM OEM zar going to update the Play
edition devices so HTC is going to
update their device Samsung is going to
update their device and a lot of people
were really upset about this thinking
that Google should be pushing out these
updates to these devices but you
remember that these devices Google
didn't build you know with the LG Nexus
4 Google was there along the way
building the Nexus device you know they
were there saying you know we want this
we want that you know they they are
involved in the process where Google
Google didn't build the HTC One you know
they didn't build a galaxy s4 you know
so obviously when kernel updates which
include you know direct contact with the
hardware kernels interface with the
hardware right Dan I mean that's that's
what the colonel does is our steered you
know kernel developer in here so the
colonel has to come from the guys that
make the device because they're the ones
that knows how the hardware works so
having the colonel come from them isn't
that big of a deal they've already
released the kernel source you can go
ahead and download it you can hack and
slash you can do whatever you want with
it now another thing it is people are
saying so if these updates are going to
be timely Google came out and said once
again these updates are going to be
timely what does timely mean I mean this
is going to be within a week of the
Nexus devices getting updates going to
be a month it's gonna be three months
but it's still going to be for their
sense device or their TouchWiz device so
before we move on you know I don't say
Dan you know what do you think about the
OEMs being in charge of the updates you
know is is that a deal breaker for you
or is that we know what these devices
were designed for no I think that's the
sort of way things need to happen with
this arrangement I think my problem is
less to do with the updating process
because the you're right this more or
less is just the way it has to happen
my problem is with everything else okay
okay so John is it it if you were to buy
one of these is that a deal breaker for
you that Google is not directly pushing
out the updates for you that you know
that the OEMs are reviewing the code
they're putting it together and they're
pushing it out it would make me a little
bit nervous because you remember when
the Galaxy Nexus came out you had
different versions you had to google
maintain versions and you had the
samsung maintain versions and that was a
yak jus the that one was for a long time
behind even the verizon galaxy nexus on
updates so you know and they were
pushing pretty much an identical device
and identical software stack and they
just didn't push the updates and it was
you know some cases it was carriers but
still makes you worry a little bit
because the OEMs just have been they
would just have to prove that to me so
so the sky let's say you bought one of
these devices right you bought the
galaxy s4 for example you get an update
in it is it going to make or break the
device that Samsung is okaying that
update before Google releases it you
know is that a big deal to you not a big
deal just happy that the carrier is not
there um and you know what and I think
you just hit the nail on the head this
is taking the carrier's out of the
equation remember the carries the ones
that that have like let's say I hate to
save verizon because i'm on verizon but
that doesn't matter the carriers in the
united states are the ones that have to
certify the software have to certify the
updates have to certify the radio
changes have to certify everything and
guarantee that it's going to work 10
times over sign all sorts of paper and
then push the to push the update out or
okay the update to be pushed out so
we're taking one major chunk away from
this update debacle here you know it's
coming from the people that make the
device the carrier doesn't have to
approve it you know like I think that's
a big deal don't you guys so it's gonna
speed things up it's gonna speed up
updates are they gonna get them a week
later who knows
find out 14.3 drops and I wonder it
didn't carriers do anything about this
nothing it's not you know it's not
bought through them it's not directly
tied to their network in terms of you
know that how you would thank you
because they're not the ones that that
supplied it so yeah I don't think they
can and that's great yeah it boils down
to the same thing we talked we talked
about a couple of weeks ago boils down
to support because the Play Store is
managing the warranty handling in the
software support for this so that part
is the part that taste the carrier's out
of the equation because they don't have
to guarantee it okay so so it's good
that carriers don't happen it's good the
carrier's can't muddy the waters because
we know they do that here in the US
because that's what they do they they
you know they they do a great service to
us because they allow us to use our
devices but they also skirt some things
up from time to time I it so one thing
to add to this is this puts a lot more
pressure on OEM to seat to shoulder this
will eventually you know will know this
in a couple months this will show their
true colors you know are they supporting
their device are they doing timely
updates and will kind of know you know
who's who and you know who decide with
all right so before we move on Scott you
brought up a good talking point so the
s4 is going to sell dozens and dozens of
millions of devices the HTC one is going
to sell not a variable but it's going to
sell dozens of millions of devices they
want to support their 10 million their
50 million customers whatever that
number is they really carry about care
about you know ten thousand five you
know what would it you know fifty
thousand whatever that number turns out
to be that buy it from the Play Store
you know what I mean like that's a very
small fraction of their market you know
did it but the things that the things
that they're updating can they be used
on both platforms since they don't both
have the same framework underline in
them dan dan you're shaking your
IDs you know what can you explain yeah I
mean one of the one of the things that I
kind of just like about these devices is
that it's not really pure Android it's
basically TouchWiz or sense strip back
down to looking like stock Android but
it still got the sense and the TouchWiz
framework embedded it in so
realistically there's no reason I can
think of technically why it shouldn't
give it a run since apps just fine or
toes so the the TouchWiz or the sense
framework that is still that is still
relevant to the device in the colonel
yeah that's I mean that's another reason
why did oh yeah is have to be involved
with the releases and the update process
because they aren't just writing the you
know bringing the hardware and writing
the hardware abstraction layers they're
writing the whole software stack okay
okay all right so so let's let's talk
about the next talking point here so
people are flipping out that these
devices aren't Nexus devices yeah so so
so what does that mean well they're not
being updated by Google Google isn't
providing the factory images like they
do for Nexus devices there may never be
a factory image provided nobody supplies
factory images but there probably will
be factory images provided because pick
your samsung or HTC device I bet you we
can find some factory images for your
device whether the belief for direct at
the blatt this time there is no direct
factory image provided right from
Samsung rendering the colonel because
they have to comply with GPL but they're
not providing and in a you know an image
file that you can download to these
devices and you can flash oh that isn't
available yet there is no requirement
that that is ever going to come it might
and that's awesome if it does but that
doesn't mean that that that doesn't mean
that they have to do it just because we
want it or just because other devices
sold on the Play Store you know Nexus
devices have that capability
now another differentiating you know
factor here is factory you know binaries
obviously you know we kind of have that
we don't really have the source code and
we have the colonel but we don't have
the we don't have the operating system
source code besides the AOSP we know it
runs AOSP we know we have the the
colonel but there's obviously a few
things here and there that are different
on these devices right you know we're
just talking about how the the framework
is modified so are we going to see that
source code like we do from you know a
Nexus device there's no requirement to
do that you know are we gonna see the
binary so you can download AOSP you can
get the binaries you can pop them in and
compile your own rom probably not that
they might but you gotta remember these
aren't Nexus devices what these devices
are is they are stock Android you know
from from the outside its stock Android
for people that don't want to root their
phones and want to run the latest device
its stock Android for people that don't
want to avoid their carrier warranty and
run stock Android it's for people that
don't want buggy software that run you
know paranoid android are cyanogenmod
and run this crap for six months and
then they go take a picture and their
camera force closes it's for people that
want their phone to work and run AOSP
it's nothing more than that that's my
opinion without all the extra raises
that raises one question and what is
that John how many average consumers do
you think we're going to go to a store
like Google Play pay six hundred and
fifty dollars for a device that stock
Android for all of its merits really
probably accounts for less than one
percent of the entire Android user base
tackling so it's kind of like a question
of the business model it may be it's
meant for that type of consumer but is
that consumer really even gonna use that
Avenue to begin with you know who's this
really target and you know I'm confused
about that because the average person
does not know that you can go to play
google.com and buy a phone so so who are
who are these play edition devices as
John said who are they targeted towards
who are they supposed to be four chances
are if you're watching this or you're
listening to this you have rooted your
device you're on your device if you own
one of these devices you can already run
up sent you know sign engine mod or
paranoid android or AOKP something like
that you can already run an AOSP based
wrong but but but I'm still going to say
that you know those are buggy from time
to time you have to wait a long time for
them to become stable and these devices
provide a stable build out of the box
you don't have to wait three or four six
months for somebody to give that to you
and you know it's going to be supported
you know a year a year and a half from
now so true so I think in closing here
to talk about these devices I think that
the Play Store edition device is the
markets little confusing but they're not
going to sell a whole lot but I think
for people that want their phone to work
that one stock Android it's a good
choice I'm happy the way that it turned
out I think only good things can come
from it i I'm not sure you know uh
anything else besides that dan what's
your what's your 30-second recap on the
Play Store devices what what do you
think about them well throughout
everything you just said you probably
said AOSP a dozen times and that's the
worst thing you possibly could have done
because these aren't AOSP you're not
gonna get the wrong code it is all
proprietary there is nothing open source
about it it is not stock Android it's
sense with sent straight back off of it
just like the HTC first is sense with
sent straight back off of it and then
facebook home dumped on top
it's still all HTC framework and still
all HTC code it's still all HTC's
problems it's going to look like a USP
but if you really want that and your
basic consumer get nova launcher okay so
nova launcher fixes the launcher but
doesn't fix everything else you won't
know that HTC has their hands in the mix
unless you're a developer unless you're
a tinkerer unless you download the
colonel and you look actually look at
the colonel the average person isn't
going to know that hey look HTC's still
tinkered with the colonel the average
person also is gonna care about the
stock look and feel the person who's
going to care about the stock look and
feel is gonna care about it being stock
that's true no matter if root HTC is
overlaid crap strip back down to kind of
maybe being sort of almost there all
right so John about these devices what's
your thoughts I think the people that
get them will get them you know they'll
get a good device I mean because you're
talking about the two top flagship
devices on the market but you know and
the software they'll probably be very
happy with it to the development
community is going to be pretty much
exactly the same as what you're seeing
for the current devices now and probably
the only disappointing side is that what
I was excited for was not so much the
devices but what it could have done to
the development community had it been
open you know would have given them a
clean slate for the you know from not
having to have projects like San gym
workout Bluetooth and sound and
Arielle's and you know all of the stuff
that takes months to try to get right
before they can move forward with the
project it could have been erased you
know day one with these devices and just
really did that's the only disappointing
aspect of it to me because the people
that you know there are a lot of people
that get carrier phones they're going to
root their devices and want to push
something like this and they didn't
really benefit from this you know I
think one of our viewers I think Matt
wallabee clarks pretty much said it best
that the market is is is the same it
coincides with people that are already
going to do this you know people that
are already going to go to XDA or
or insert random website here to
download this to modify their devices
they're just doing it for you you know
it but then again the people the people
that can do it why won't things they can
buy the device for two hundred dollars
on contract versus six hundred and they
can do it themselves so it's although
confused it's cool don't get me wrong
it's cool but it's a little confusing
you know it's the tiniest step in the
right direction no yeah yeah that does
true a step in the right direction no
matter how small it is it's still a step
in the right direction it's like a like
a half like trip like you're like
walking along trip like the OEMs got
drunk and fell down and got that much
further forward well not entirely drunk
there's a little bit tipsy that's drunk
and tipsy I can I want to be interesting
though is if if HTC and Samsung can get
any kind of user data off of this versus
the user data that they would get off of
their typical you know and feedback from
the users themselves you know if you're
talking about that average type of user
you know something they find confusing
in Samsung's software stack versus AOSP
being easier you know maybe we'll give
them some kind of metric to go off of
the oh we need to work on this yes like
oh my god my eyes are on fire stop with
the assault upon something around those
lines maybe it'll help a little bit I
really hope Scott go ahead let's move on
lets you say your last comment about
this I really hope one device
manufacturer comes out with a flagship
phone that is strictly AOSP that would
be cool and I think HTC kind of needs to
just because you know their sales that
are having issues yeah mom and they need
to do something so why not side with
AOSP and just kind of blow it out of you
know because they're they're build
quality is awesome and yeah like dent
like Jen said step in the right
direction I like the fact that they're
cutting out the carrier's but it is one
of many steps that need to be taken yeah
it's just you can fire all of their
sense developers save all of that money
and just porn AOSP to their
and push it and I bet they would sell it
on more devices all right so so if
you're into ruin and ramen which we'll
get to in a little bit system dumps from
these devices are available and people
are already taking the system dump
supporting them to the international
versions or AT&amp;amp;T mobile versions of of
these devices you you can find those
threads on your favorite routes wiki or
xda-developers forum as yours on the
International s4 that would be a healthy
versions only and in Europe in your
quest to get more information about the
Google Play devices if you're like me
you don't own HTC One or an s 40 anyone
advise you hate anyway sorry sorry those
are going to getting ready to go off on
a tangent um if not if you own a non s4
from the google play store and on acc
one and you want your device to have
that wallpaper that live wallpaper if
you want the boot animation if you want
that new android 4.3 camera because
remember the 4.3 camera that comes with
the google play edition devices was
leaked or shown at trade shows over in
the Middle East a few weeks back so if
you want that new camera you can go and
download it and put it on almost any
device I'm seeing a lot of people put
this camera and getting photosphere and
devices it didn't previously support it
I'm seeing a lot of uncle get this new
camera on a lot of different devices and
the main thing about this different is
is that how you access the camera
functions and features and options the
wallpaper is the phase beam wallpaper
only it's red and it's called sunbeam
and it's awesome um and what else i say
all the boot animation now you can
install the boot animation if those are
you watching here on youtube or live
that is the Sun beam live wallpaper that
I have on my HTC DNA not going to show
you the boot animation because that
takes too long to show but the boot
animation is cool I like it alright so
let's move on to I'm sure most of your
here watchin our listen for this let's
move on to why you're here right
we are giving away a samsung galaxy note
2 thanks to the guys at natural motion
behind CSR racing check out that app
it's pretty actually i installed on my
Nexus 7 as i'm not a big game and it's
actually pretty cool game I good risk up
it's actually not bad like i said i'm
not a big gamer but i enjoyed it for the
few minutes i was playing it um so last
week on episode 69 we gave you a special
code that allowed you to visit android
authority com go to the contest another
special code and get one additional
chance as promised this week on episode
70 will give you the second special code
to enter and that special code is hold
on hold on this is the episode 70 we've
been doing this for 70 episodes pretty
cool yeah where have you been the past
few weeks continue what Scott I'm happy
to have you back I'm happy to be back
alright so oh by the way I made my bed
if you guys can see you for the viewers
that are giving me crap about Scott this
isn't even your house your girlfriend's
place of course you have to make the
better you're gonna be able to go to bed
that's very true what if what he's
saying is she kicked him out and put him
on the couch yeah she's sleeping right
now okay I so Scott is in this God is on
the couch hashtag Scott on couch let us
know what you think dirty bugger so this
week our code is h2g2 h2g2 that's H the
number two letter G and the number two
and I and I'll explain why we used h2g2
because shortly a little bit while a
little bit ago the wall street journal
reported on a few tidbits of android and
google information The Wall Street
Journal confirmed our previous reports
that Google is making a SmartWatch they
also confirmed our reports that
Android or Google is focusing on an
android game console or aim a media
streaming device that will also be a
android game console and we reported a
while back then this device was called
the h2g2 and it was a media streaming
device that would focus on gaming so
that's why that code is being used and
they also said that these would be
available this fall and they'll be much
less expensive than the three hundred
dollar Nexus Q that never really made it
out of the play store so that's exciting
we've known this based on sources and
reports we don't know when they're going
to be available don't know prices I
think it's awesome I can't wait to buy a
Google media streaming device to see you
wrote the changes for Google TV because
well no the Google TV hasn't really
gained a major foothold I think that
this is going to be google's new attempt
to capture the living room they're
streaming device they're streaming
device their console device that's their
new take on the living room i don't
think google TV is that but that's my
opinion okay so I've been talking for a
while John let us know what devices are
out in about this week so in case you
were wondering about the big phone trend
he calling it a phablet but the kind of
in between er devices on sizes it's not
going away anytime soon and sony has
just put their entry on the table is the
xperia z ultra or xperia z ultra however
you wanna pronounce it and right now
this thing is probably one of the
largest the hybrids it has a six point
four inch 1080p display and Sony is
calling this their new triluminos
display which is you know they're
promising better contrast a more vibrant
color balance and then it's got a lot of
the bravia TV technology and then it's
an ex reality you know they've merged
that software in which kind of analyzes
the videos and reproduces liking pixels
so you know one of the biggest
complaints with the Z was the display
just bitten
I live up to the hype of it so it's good
to see they're stepping up there you can
ride on the display with any pencil
stylus or pin so i guess it's kind of
their shot at samsung but it doesn't
come with an integrated stylus
Snapdragon 800 it's probably the first
real device we've seen with the 800 and
is clocked at 2.2 gigahertz but they're
they're marketing it as the world's
fastest mobile processor which they be
right that's going to be screaming and
it's also one of the thinnest devices on
the market is six point five millimeters
thin and and is the same water and dust
resistant design as the Xperia Z comes
with a three thousand million milliamp
hour battery 16 gigabytes of storage
with an SD slot the camera is an eight
megapixel rear camera with two megapixel
front it doesn't come with a flash I
would guess the reason it doesn't is
because the reason they probably went
with eight instead the 13 is because of
the thinness of the device i would think
but uh oh flash no flash interestingly
but um i would that's because they were
trying to trim the device size down the
weight down because the device is huge
but uh how'd i can't say that i would
want to get a phone that pic and a lot
of they're pushing a bluetooth accessory
which is a headset kind of like a
handset but it's not when you put in
your ear it's actually held almost like
you would hold a phone and then it
connects via bluetooth you can see
notifications on it you can plug a
headset into it naturally listen to
music through and clip it to your shirt
you have to get separate votes manage
your phone yeah basically it's like a
little remote for your phone which
actually looks really cool it would be
nice to have as an individual thing it i
would say that one exciting part about
it is this is probably the first Sony
device we've seen in a while it's kind
of ahead of the market on hardware yeah
which you know I mean they're usually
six months late to the party on hardware
but
you know this one's kind of jumping the
gun a little bit so I that part of it
makes me excited to see what Sony's got
down the pipeline I can't say I really
want this device because it's huge but
i'm sure some people will but it's
exciting to see Sony's really kind of
pushing the boundaries of what they've
been doing with mobile for the last
couple years how big the note 2 again
5.5 inches so this is an inch bigger
really it's gigantic I wouldn't ask what
he said yeah I don't know what little
stop you know what's god I don't know
but I know you tell us about some app
updates that happen this week they made
you feel a little bit more excited than
last week so Google now Google search a
long time going for a nap this one seems
to get updated a lot love it and yeah so
so one of the neat features that the new
google now the new google search added
this week yeah voice action tips you get
new voice actions play music from your
phone or on the Play Store you can also
specify what app you want to play it on
so like if you say like play Britney
Spears you can do YouTube plant magic
curious as to why your example was the
first example that came to your head was
Britney Spears for my childhood I'm
having a flashback okay saved offers
from google offers when nearby a
redemption location which is nice also
information about shows that you're
watching on your internet connected TV
us only I don't understand this one
fully uh Derek do you know if it's
google TV or any same TV that is on your
network is so what so what it does is it
uses them it uses a basic protocol and
scans your network to see if you have a
supported device so it queries your
network it says hey we're using the
simple discovery method and look here's
here's a device named insert internet TV
name here
and it says oh look this is a device
name model number samsung 6500 UEF 72 oh
that model number is a internet TV okay
so he's watching TV at home and then you
hit the listen to TV button which is
just sound search but only it
specifically looks for TVs and it does a
sound search on the TV program that
you're watching and then it tries to
determine what show you're watching then
i'll show you actor information TV show
information yada yada yada so now the
question is is why couldn't you just
sound search and have the TV show up
well because it doesn't you know the TV
card shouldn't show up all the time it
should only show up you know when
there's actually a TV that's turned on
and if you're TV isn't turned on the
card isn't going to show up so that's
why it looks at your network and says
look there's a TV on are you watching TV
versus always doing a sound search or
you know you're saying oh I'm watching
TV let me go do a sound search so I can
get more information that's one how you
know you will now works it knows that
you're watching TV therefore it asks you
if you want to find out more information
see I'd like it to be able to sort of
program your shows into it so I'm gonna
pop up with reminders about that more
like highlights from yesterday's or
stuff like that ya like like how you do
with you know pick your sports teams I
want to pick my TV show and you know
show me new episodes or show me
recurring episodes or that would be
sweet yeah I mean I I like how they
rolled out the sports and everything but
you can really play off of that if you
want to without green water different
things the right now on a new movie or a
new TV show that you're interested in
that you searched for or played before
is available on Google Play you get a
card notification saying the latest
doctor who episode is now available for
example right but I
that information in some way that Google
knows of those yeah so what about if so
what about if so you're saying you
wanted to just pop up on Saturday nights
at seven o'clock or wherever you know
three in the afternoon if you show on
walks look doctor who's on we know you
like Doctor Who yeah I agree I it would
be nice to be a little more proactive
with the TV and movie notifications or
are they good to be like set up not
necessarily like I had to search for it
therefore it knows it'd be nice to just
like preset it as well just like your
sports teams I mean you can disallow
certain teams to be on your thing to
follow so that'd be nice to have that
and and in your case Scott you know
maybe you don't want your TV
recommendations to show up everywhere so
like you know if you're at your
girlfriend's house you may not want
certain shows to pop up as being the
recommended show you know me oral I
don't want popping up good show all
right so it's a John let's uh Arden
actually no there's more information
about apps so speaking of google play
movies movies gotta refresh it's a nice
refresh got that sidebar ownage that's
out yeah the sidebar the visual design
you can all it also allows quick access
for what you're likely to watch next
it's kind of cool and then if you look
at the comments on in the Play Store you
can find that our people are kind of
pissed off because the personal videos
is no longer like a tab it's in the
overflow button which is I think nice
but it's kind of hidden for all those
people I guess yeah so people are pissed
off about that but personal video is
still there it's just in the open full
button and Facebook comes out swing in
with a beta program now this is
something that you know there they
stated that you know they're one of the
most downloaded apps and the Play Store
which is pretty much true because you
know a lot there's a lot of people on
facebook and they lot of people use the
mobile app and the mobile app is shit so
they're driving desire to make it better
on more devices and actually you know
usable they developed a beta program
that goes through google groups which is
awesome you know what's unique about
that is this beta program got announced
at IL and every single 1 i've seen has
been available through google plus so it
seems funny and obvious that Facebook
uses Google Groups a private google
group that you have to join and be a
member of similar to a community to be
part of the beta program but why would
Facebook want their users have the
wyldwood facebook want their users to
sign up for google plus to use a
Facebook beta they're not gonna do that
you know no really cool so obviously
they're using groups which nobody uses
Google should really make it mandatory
yeah I have Google Plus the way to
distribute the Bezos well they can
automatically urge google groups with us
but in my sorghum mr oops you're gonna
become Google+ communities that
Facebook's me straight faces would be
like wait what do we do we just built
this huge community in google groups
yeah Facebook's gonna announce do you
want to test our new beta program please
join the social network Google+ to do so
oh man but in all like Facebook was
trying to push the updates for
themselves inside the app and then a
google said uh-uh no now this could be
the same story uh-uh you ain't gonna use
google groups you're gonna use google
plus google allows you to use scripts
they know i know what could be really
funny yeah yeah mines now though yeah we
know i would i would definitely go back
on all right so so root root in ramen so
signage in mod did some neat stuff this
week John yeah you won't call it stable
or final
Tim you know 10.1 point 0 finals drop
two devices that qualify for that means
devices that are of good quality source
are stable enough to be considered final
um they also gave some clarification on
the Exynos for platform in which is not
really a secret but it's going to remain
on Knightley's it's not going to get
official stable because of the lack of
documentation for the ex knows platform
and all kinds of issues with the
binaries in the source that they
provided and also so it basically
applies to an international galaxy s3 or
any variant of the galaxy note 2 or s2
yeah um next most three devices which
are the hummingbird based devices like
the Nexus S and the ex knows five
devices which are Nexus 10 above like
the galaxy s4 those are not going to be
impacted because the nexus s already
gives them a solid base for the ex those
three platform and then the Nexus 10
gives them a base for the ex those five
so that's going to remain as it is those
will be stable eventually the gas has
forged it to newer phones they're still
both fixing it um one other thing that
showed off this week was a mini-camera
tile that actually is able to be added
to quick settings so you'll be able to
pull your Quick Settings panel down tap
and then you'll get a live view finder
and then you can take a quick snapshot
with your phone that way so it's a
little bit quicker way to get into your
camera while you're using the device if
you need to take a quick picture because
the one screen is so difficult enough
yeah it looked pretty cool but I don't
know how much I would use it but it's
nice to have the option I mean since
that it's pervasive as opposed to black
screen where you have to turn it off and
back on yeah the the biggest thing I
guess newswise to come out of them is
that their next big feature there's
really a big privacy and security push
from them anyway they've already merged
privacy guard into the nightlies and the
next thing is that couche is actually
writing a secure device to device push
messaging which he described it as being
kind of similar to how I message does it
but um basically what it's going to be
between to cyanogenmod devices and
going to be incorporated into framework
so it's going to be encrypted in the end
and they'll be sent over Google Cloud
messaging so it works pretty
transparently you know even if it's with
third-party applications it's PPP so
it's in Christian Post authenticity for
text messages is built into the system
if you're sending this mind without a
cyanogenmod device then it's going to be
pretty much as normal if we're saying
from cyanogen to cyanogen there's going
to be you know secured once what's
interesting about that John is it right
type of notification you know to to say
hey the person you're you're messaging
is on CM so it's going to be secure you
know otherwise you have to know that
that person is running CM yeah there are
many people I know personally on see
them that I mrs. normally but it'll be a
nice thing to have for geeks between
each other and so so all of us can like
text message each other and we're safe
and if we text message the majority of
the people we know we're screwed okay
when you flash another wrong or doctor
or when I tried something else is I mean
it's a cool feature don't get me wrong
it's cool but it's neat and its
innovative but as big a Santa janata is
and they are by far the largest custom
rom in the community they're not that
big so for a proprietary internal to CM
anything is just silly and arrogant I
love you Dan
I mean it's just area there's really
just no other way to describe it I mean
I get that they can't really control the
interaction between 1cm device on a non
cm device so i get the practical reasons
why they're doing it this way but it's
just arrogant to assume that cm is that
big and that important that a CM 2 cm
transfer protocol is even worth wasting
your time on it's bad enough when
Samsung build Samsung the Samsung
transfer protocols for Apple does the
same shit instead of just using a
universally available protocol for
device to device of fill in the blank
manufacturer or type or other specifics
it's just arrogant I somewhat I group
them it's just air there's really just
no other way to spend we like looking
for old the internet once twice and nuns
and I expected
that's right there look what you did I
don't think he can come back from that
period so rise about my dad the hair
covering 500 markets in America which
covers ninety-five percent of the
population that about 99 percent of
their 3g network is covered so they're
saying that their LTE network is now
substantially finished that said they're
still looking forward to rolling out a
to the u.s. LTE and voice over LTE both
which they plan to start sometime next
year though actually seeing that stuff
devices probably not until late next to
your live ear after that so definitely
good news for Verizon customers if you
want LTE you probably have a number isin
if you have Verizon coverage in general
also in carrier LTE news t-mobile said
that they are planning on rolling out
LTE advanced features before the end of
the year they were not very specific
about what they need my features a lot
of the tech blogs around have been
talking about how it was not gonna be
full lte-advanced and realistically
that's that's really true but
realistically nobody anywhere is going
to be building a real full LTE Advanced
Network anytime in the near future full
lte-advanced has a three gigabit
downlink capacity and also takes a
hundred megahertz block of spectrum no
carrier has that much spectrum to spare
so nobody's going to be rolling out
full-blown lte-advanced I'll to mostly
focusing on so the bigger features
though carrier aggregation which is
going to allow them to piece together
non-continuous blocks of spectrum to
come up with 20 megahertz or more blocks
and they're also going to be pushing the
downlink capacity up to 150 megabits per
second up from the current 100 megabit
packs so the other nice thing the
t-mobile has going for them is they've
already laid the hardware for those
updates
just matter of testing about getting
embattled devices on the network and
then flipping a switch to make it go
live so should be a lot faster rollout
for tmobile than it is for verizon who's
not even starting until next year and
then in patent news Apple had been
trying to replace a device in their
second case against Samsung with the
sgs4 previously the judge had ordered
them to limit the number of devices and
they scoped it down to a specific number
an apple is basically just trying to
bait and switch and pull one of these
devices that's not really on the market
anymore off the list in favor of the
sgs4 the administrative law judge on the
case said no to that that is not
complying with the order and apples
defense about it was basically oh this
is just going to force us to do more
litigation to which the administrative
law judge responded we've already forced
you to kick dozens of devices out of
this case that you're obviously going to
bring back to litigation anyway so just
add this to your next case and move on
so it's definitely a bit of a slap in
the face for Apple on that one but in
other patent nonsense the ITC had
granted a inch ocean on Apple products
the iphone 4 and below for Samsung and
Apple is appealing that to a different
governmental agency that basically is
answerable to the White House so
basically they're hoping that they can
get the White House and their newfound
anti patent troll you know
to strike it down yeah well enough that
happens is really anybody's guess really
though apples being the patent troll
here and has outright refused to pay a
royalty the ITC granted the injunction
not because of the Fran it's Fran
patents in question but Apple is
flat-out said we don't care what price
you put on these patents we will not pay
for them under any circumstances
whatsoever nothing the channeling my
house is going to strike that down is
pretty small because really apples
acting like the troll here yeah oh
definitely would act apple doesn't roll
dance yeah I mean these are standards
essentials patents these aren't bullshit
patents that should have been granted in
the first place these are standards
essential patents that led to the
creation of 3g standards that the entire
industry uses and has coalesced around
that apple simply refuses to pay for
everybody notes in the world pays for
them or contributes to them and gets
them by way of contributing Apple
refuses to contribute and refuses to pay
so they'll probably not be able to get
the head over turn but then again they
aren't selling hey those devices all
right so let's uh check out a few
questions here if you have anything
you'd like us to chat about for a few
seconds a minute don't let us know in
the comments here on google+ if you're
watching live on youtube if you're
watching live and uh we're gonna go
ahead and go through a few of these so
Jeremy wants to know about our contest
you know why do you have to log in this
Facebook this is google plus territory
well rafflecopter uses facebook for easy
entry if you don't want an easy entry
that's fine don't have to use google or
don't have to use facebook but if you
would like to get an easy extra chance
to win good news facebook i won't tell
anybody um I will us option it should it
should and so Alvin wants to know the
link to the context I shared the link to
contest on Google+ so go ahead and go to
Android authorities
Plus page and checked out check that out
the contest link is there in the
comments lucious night is actually a
friend of ours he is now an Android
enthusiast him he's watching an Android
podcast and he recently owned an iphone
so welcome to the galaxy s4 version of
Android to freedom well it's that it's
not true freedom yet Danny working the
more options well could have more
options on your Samsung device
congratulations you in the you and
Stacey I'm glad to have you aboard um
Joe met said earlier we talked about the
Ouya I said isn't the yeah actually we
are talking about the h 2 G 2 and he
said isn't the Ouya an android gaming
console why yes yes it is I actually own
this piece of shit oh and he lost
absolutely loves it oh my dick so so
that's my only net pay for so that's my
two-second review I'm but wait Oh your
son likes it my son is four years old
and he loves the Ouya he play he plays
on it all the time he loves it so that's
it I mean potentially a cheap
alternative to buy it you know I'm not
gonna lie I it allows you to install a
rom emulator for playing old like
nintendo super nintendo games my wife is
excited to play Super Mario Brothers 3
yeah teaching so now today I had a
really I don't see anything wrong with
it I know I know so Sammy says what do
you expect the price be the Xperia Z
ultra you know 626 50 I'll gonna say I
think it's actually more than that I
think was uh in the sixth it was six
hundred and something euros which I
can't remember that translation but
devices of similar price in similar
stature or they're all about 650 700
dollars sep you know I it's gonna be a
flagship device pricing you know
I mean we don't really know it's going
to be precious and in the States but uh
or even international I would say the
same price as the note to when it first
came out or the same price as the LG
optimus pro you know those type of big
devices they're all going to be roughly
the same a few dollars euros here and
there um yes Scott was in the doghouse
and you know it we're gonna pick up
Scott so now that Scott is at his
girlfriend's he doesn't have to make his
bed he has to make the couch he's got
the major cash you need to make this
couch you made that couch right so
speaking of weird just mentioned the
note 2 so a YouTube commenter says he
heard the note 3 will be 5.7 inch in it
was going to be 6.3 but there was too
many complaints about a fitting in
pockets well that very well mean very
well may be the case you know this
device is going to be available for a
few months chances are we don't have a
lot of information on and who knows how
big it's going to be all the other yet
up on that very well may be the case
John you have a note to it's 5.5 inches
plus some bezel it fits in your pocket
write the note 2 yeah I mean uh let's
see the bezel itself could be if you can
see the edges of it it does fit my
pocket pretty well I mean it depends on
I'm a guy being guys have bigger pockets
and girls so I mean whose pocket are you
talking about earlier than HTC
incredible oh gee would not fit in a lot
of girls pocket exactly i mean it's all
relative i think they could keep the
same form factor and maybe bump it up
you know maybe a fractions of an inch
but not that much um you know are they
going to jump on the magnet I think the
mega is kind of a testing bed for that
but I don't I don't see it going so big
that they because they were pretty
successful with the note 2 I don't see
any reason for them to branch too far
from that mega mega to be a little bit
bigger it'll retain the stylus
capability and the software is most
likely going to be exactly the same as
the s4 you know plus pin features I
don't expect it
to be you know the the rumor mill tends
to boost it up to be bigger than it is
it's going to be a super-sized galaxy s4
with a pen mega I so a few episodes ago
and the the mega devices were launched
that was a thing um it's probably still
thing so anyways God mega let us know
