Android Authority comm and today we'll
be checking out super hexagon it's a
very difficult game available right now
in the Google Play Store for $2.99
we're gonna check out the menus first
because the entire thing is right here
super hexagon has three difficulties to
start from hexagon is considered hard
hexagons er is considered harder
hexagons nest is considered hardest if
you're looking for something easy to
play here's a heads up you're not gonna
like super hexagon when it comes to
gameplay super hexagon is the epitome of
the phrase easy to learn difficult to
master
players touch the left and right sides
of the screen to move the arrow around
the hexagon the point of the game is to
prevent the arrow from colliding with
solid walls as the walls move toward the
hexagon in the center it may seem really
simple but it really isn't the game
screen rotates as you try to avoid these
obstacles every few seconds it'll switch
and rotate in the opposite direction
that paired with the constantly shifting
colors makes disorientation and
inevitability with this game which only
adds to the difficulty in terms of sound
there is a computer woman who talks to
you sometimes and the music is a mix
between techno and classic video game
it's pretty enjoyable but players won't
miss out on much if they play it on mute
the game is fun because of the challenge
and the easy controls however the
constant stopping is starting due to
that very same challenge can prevent
gamers from really getting into a groove
and enjoying the game when it's all
added up we gave gameplay a 3.5 out of 5
stars
the graphics are very minimalist and
that was intentional according to the
game developers the colors are vibrant
everything fits together pretty well
that said just about anyone can recreate
the graphics in this game in GIMP or
Photoshop in a relatively short period
of time due to the overwhelmingly simple
nature of the graphics we gave this a
2.5 out of 5 stars the replay value is
where this game really shines it's so
difficult that rounds can end in fewer
than two seconds on the harder settings
there's no quirky animations between
rounds you tap the screen play lose tap
the screen play and lose again it's
possible to play round after round for
15 minutes and play dozens of times like
Pringles you can't play just once in
addition to the difficult and generally
addictive nature of the game there are
actually new levels to unlock if you
achieve the improbable and beat one of
these levels you'll unlock a new level
this can be done once for each
difficulty when you take into account
that super hexagon was designed and
built around the idea of try try again
we have no choice but to give its replay
value a full 5 out of 5 stars
super hexagon is a very very hard game
fortunately it also happens to be a very
fun and addictive game despite only
having a few things to unlock there is
no doubt that will take gamers a very
long time to unlock them due to the
minimalist nature super hexagon has a
quality where you can literally open it
play for five seconds close it and say
that you finished a full round of play
this unique quality makes this game
playable everywhere the graphics are
impressive
if you live in 1981 but if you take into
account the premise of the game it's
actually a good thing that the graphics
are so simple so don't let the low
graphics score fool you they're just
shapes of color on top of a semi solid
background but anything else would
probably render the game unplayable
there is no doubt in our mind that most
would get their three dollars worth out
of super hexagon however those with a
penchant for ragequitting when games get
frustrating definitely will not enjoy
this title if you manage to meet all
three difficulties and all three
unlockable levels you deserve a plaque
or a hug or something all in all we gave
super hexagon a value of 4 out of 5
stars
