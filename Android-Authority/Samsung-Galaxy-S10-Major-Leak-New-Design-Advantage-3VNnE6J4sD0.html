Claus has come to town being pulled by
many red-nosed rumors
now before we divulge these leaks we
should talk about the fact that it came
from an anonymous reindeer and as such
should be viewed with some scrutiny
according to the Gizmodo leaker the
Samsung Galaxy S 10 will allegedly
launch before the Mobile World Congress
in 2019 usually Samsung launches the S
series devices at the Mobile World
Congress itself but this leaker claims
the company could hold its own event on
February 20th five days before the
Congress begins now after the launch the
devices would officially be on sale as
soon as March 8th now as we've already
suspected and this leaker confirms that
there will be three variants of the
Samsung Galaxy S 10 let's talk about the
alleged specs the S 10 is expected to
have a 6.1 inch display be curved have
128 gigabytes or 512 gigabytes of
internal storage be approximately one
thousand or twelve hundred and sixty
dollars in US currency and the Samsung
Galaxy S 10 plus is alleged to have a
six point four inch display also be
curved have 128 or 512 gigabytes or a
whopping one terabyte of internal
storage prices come at approximately
eleven thirty six thirteen eighty eight
or 1767 in u.s. dollars and finally the
Samsung Galaxy S ten light is alleged to
be a 5.8 inch display b-phlat have 128
gigabytes of internal storage and cost
around eight hundred and forty five
dollars in US currency now I'm quoting
those weird US numbers because the
original leak came in UK pounds so they
may convert those over to US dollars or
they just may transfer them over which i
think is probably more likely because
even for samsung those are some hefty
prices or it could be that samsung is
going to try its hand at an apple
strategy where you raise your overall
top-tier product prices and then
introduce an entry-level low cost option
to give consumers a broader set of
choices but that doesn't seem to be
working too well for Apple this past
year so we'll see what old Sammy's gonna
do now something is pretty interesting
here potential
not that I think that Samsung is going
to overtake Apple but Samsung is
confirmed to be selling Apple some of
their display technology that said
technology where they are able to merge
the two previous layers of the splay
technology into one where there was two
layers before now there's just one and
thereby the phone becomes thinner and
lighter and at scale even cheaper but if
Samsung smart and I think they really
are they would choose this year to do a
major redesign of the Galaxy S series do
something to really stand out get ahead
of Apple
so to please the geeks like you and me
that would be pretty exciting what do
you think let me know in the comments
below what Sam so I'm gonna do we know
they're gonna sell that technology could
they come up with something bigger and
better to just a tiny leapfrog would be
fantastic we've said that before and
hope for it and Samsung came out with
roughly the same design of smartphones
let me know in the comments below or on
Twitter you know what software starts do
things it's not supposed to do who
solves those problems
