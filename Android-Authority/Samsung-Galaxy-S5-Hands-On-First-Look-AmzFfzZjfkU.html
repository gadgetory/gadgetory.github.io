by bitdefender mobile security the next
flagship samsung galaxy s device is
finally here and we have your first look
at it hey it's Josh regard from Android
30 what's going on everybody and here is
your first look at the Samsung Galaxy s5
when it comes to design we have the same
plastic build that we already know n
either love or hate from Samsung devices
but now the back has soft touch material
and it is better than glossy plastic as
many people will pause it but it may or
may not be better than the faux leather
that we've had on the galaxy note 3 in
the end it still feels pretty nice in
the hand and those small perforations on
the back though it will be your opinion
of whether or not those look good do
help a little bit with the feel the
shape of this phone is very similar to
the galaxy s4 however we do have much
flatter sides and also the more rounded
corners that were reminiscent of the
Galaxy Note 3 as far as the button
layout goes you do have an added twist
here that the home button now includes a
fingerprint scanner underneath that
layer and also the Menu button has been
replaced by a recent apps button as far
as the feel in the hand goes we are
dealing with a 5.1 inch display here so
the phone is just a little bit bigger
all the way around then the galaxy s4 we
are dealing with a slightly larger
screen here at 5.1 inches but it is a
1080p display despite rumors of even
more resolution being available on the
s5 as far as the quality goes however
the AMOLED screen on the s5 is still
very great and is very reminiscent of
the galaxy s4 from last year both
perform beautifully with highly vibrant
colors and they might be perhaps
oversaturated at times but in the end
the display is still very enjoyable
unfortunately at the time of this
recording we've been unable to confirm
exactly which SOC is going to appear in
the galaxy s5 but what we do know is
it's a quad-core 2.5 gigahertz processor
that should bring a lot of boosts in
performance so stay tuned for an
annotation that will confirm which
processing package will be found in here
as far as Hardware goes we do see
Samsung return to the general trope that
they have of adding in basically
everything about the kitchen sink
we'll start off with the 16 or 32
gigabytes of on-board storage that can
be bolstered by a my
SD card slots as far as the battery goes
a 2800 remove milliamp-hour removable
battery is available which it's capacity
may not be a largely for Samsung but
they did look to give great power saving
options one in particular is an ultra
power saving option which not only gives
you a very minimalistic home screen but
also makes everything completely
grayscale all the bits and pieces that
were originally introduced in the galaxy
s4 do come back here on the galaxy s5
but there are some new and very specific
additions that we will go through and
the first one that that was already
mentioned is the fingerprint scanner
under that home button is a fingerprint
scanner that allows you to swipe a
finger down in order to unlock the phone
but after that you do still have to turn
on the phone and then swipe your finger
in order to get into your phone the
other very interesting addition in the
galaxy s5 is the inclusion of a heart
rate monitor which is located right
below the camera optics on the back
essentially what happens is you can open
up s health start the heart rate monitor
and when you lay a finger on top of the
unit it will read your heart rate and
display it for you it is good for all of
those health fanatics out there but is
also a bit questionable in terms of
whether or not it's going to be
ultimately useful for everybody
perhaps the biggest development here is
the inclusion of an ISO cell 16
megapixel sensor camera now this camera
is capable of some great shots as
Samsung claims and as far as the video
capabilities go 4k recording is
available but it is limited at five
minutes because of the sheer size of the
files now the camera app has been redone
and it is very setting centric as when
you hit the Settings button you'll see a
lot of different settings for all of the
different tweaks you can make your
smartphone photography a few new modes
are available now as well like a
selective focus shooting mode and also
full HDR live HDR rather that will allow
you to get some really nice photos and
finally make it over to software and if
you are looking for a very big update to
the TouchWiz UI due to the teasers that
were coming out very recently for the
unpacked event you might be a little
disappointed after all the very things
that make TouchWiz well TouchWiz have
remained largely the same and it might
be hard to tell what really is different
well the toggles in the notification
drop-down are now similar to the ones
that were found in the no pro tablet
series as everything
comprised of circles the same goes for
the settings pages as far as
multitasking goes it does take on a
somewhat different approach now that the
menu button has been replaced with a
recent apps button you will be able to
get some simple multitasking done by
just using that button to go in and out
of apps as far as the home screens go it
is largely the same experience but
perhaps taking a page out of stock
Android's book the my magazine UI has
been brought to the forefront and is now
a second screen that you are able to
swipe to from the right ultimately if
you are looking for an upheaval of the
general TouchWiz UI you probably aren't
getting it here in the galaxy s5 however
all of the features that were introduced
in previous galaxy s devices and even
though devices do make it over here and
should provide a very full-featured
experience and so their habits for this
first look at the Samsung Galaxy s5 much
like Samsung has done with previous
Galaxy devices they're really looking to
put as much as they can into this one
phone thankfully it is put into a screen
that is very enjoyable to use and after
that it does pack a lot of power with
that new processing package in the end
whether or not all of the features are
useful for you as something you're gonna
have to find out when this phone comes
out onto the market well until then stay
tuned to android authority for all of
the best coverage from the Mobile World
Congress here in Barcelona Spain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
