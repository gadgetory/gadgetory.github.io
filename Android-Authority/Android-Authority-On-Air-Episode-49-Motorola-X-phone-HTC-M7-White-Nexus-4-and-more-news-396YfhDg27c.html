guests and returning long time guest dan
Charlton what's up guys how you doing
good to be here thanks for having us
yeah well not everyone how's it going
nowicki I love your backdrop I mean I

guitars in the back like you're doing it
right you know what I mean like that is
like that is a backdrop to have I love
it it's actually just the background of
my office like any of the videos i do on
youtube it's just the cameras there and
facing the other way and then everyone
here is like you have an office that's
that's where the magic comes from his
video reviews in his articles that he
writes and and Josh we see your
backdrops you're you're a new camera you
got for your going to Mobile World
Congress aren't you yes I am I decided
you know I needed to up my game because
it's gonna be just three days of madness
so I picked up picked up in your camera
for the trip very nice very nice and uh
as you guys can see Scott is not joining
us this evening he's m.i.a hope all is
well anyway so it's what we're gonna
talk about this we go we normally go
into app reviews talk about you know
what's popular the past week when new
apps and came out apps got updated all
the same old dance every week but since
the Super Bowl is tomorrow we're gonna
start out by talking about you know some
apps on Android to help you stay up to
date with the Super Bowl if you're not
able to watch your out in and out or if
you need something to do while you're
watching the Super Bowl although we're
gonna hit some rumors because this this
week had all sorts of rumors all over
the place for various upcoming devices
rumored devices it may or may not be
illegal to do certain things with your
mobile devices in the US
now and we're going to talk about some
ecosystem stuff little bit of root and
rom and as usual and Dan's going to yell
about something about patents as usual
because Dan does and we love them for
that so super bowl well what are you
guys doing for the super bowl ban you
have any big plans uh not really no I'm
gonna go watch games and friends i don't
know that i really call it a super bowl
party just me and several friends i have
that all live in one house together so
just hang it out really alright how
about you John any big of foosball plans
Oh for the first part of the Super Bowl
i'll actually be partaking in some of
these apps because i have to work until
eight o'clock and then i'll catch the
rest of it when i get to the house
alright how about you Josh any big super
bowl plans for tomorrow I'm mostly
staying home but aside from watching the
game just two words wing stop so gonna
probably get like a 50 pack and just go
nuts on the food don't put the Atomics
um maybe like flies yeah I have we don't
you gotta have wings of wit is super
bowl you know I'm a big fan of wings how
about you wookie what he doin eating
wings um maybe I literally actually
didn't know these super bowl those are
until you just said that was playing at
rutecki you know what I will have to
agree well since we had to reschedule
the show from our normal night Thursday
night I was talking to the guys say hey
sh-sh-sh we do it you know Friday night
Saturday Sunday night and my boy Johnny
Frank here he's like well sunday is a
super bowl was like huh I guess it is so
yeah i'm not a huge super bowl fan I I
always you know you gotta watch you know
for the commercials right I love the
super bowl commercials um yeah I'm not a
big football fan and never have been i
always played other sports in the fall
such as soccer so I never really got
into football but uh football i will i
will pay attention a little bit you know
so i can be a man and talk about it from
time to time um so uh so let's get into
some some apps that those of you that
care about the superbowl well what can
you do
with you the mobile apps John well in my
case I work on Sunday and used to work
on saturday so a lot of kind of laugh a
lot of times I had to improvise and kind
of keep track of the games from apps so
you really got a lot of good apps out
there that lets you set up your own
favorite teams and watch live feeds kind
of on the go and the first one
definitely the most popular one is going
to be ESPN scorecenter and of course if
you got a ESPN account it's going to
sync up all of your teams and give you
customized alerts and from there you can
watch any kind of life you know game
feed like you wouldn't a web browser
directly from the application and you
can get a notification straight from the
app and you know get it on a widget too
if that's your thing and uh they it was
not long ago that I've got completely
redesigned so it's pretty nice the
second one is a CBS or caster and it's
pretty similar to ESPN and that you can
customize your own news feeds and your
sports teens but you'll also pull in a
Twitter feed of relevant commentators
during the game that you can kind of
keep track of the if you're not in a
place where you can listen to it through
radio or watch it any kind of way than
uh do the commentators pretty much stay
on top of the game in a sec to eat at
hmm that sounds like you're pretty neat
app so you it's just a feed of
commentators people on Twitter you know
talking about talking about the game you
know that gives you both sides to and it
gives you their opinions on even if a
penalty is about to be overturned their
their whining about it so it's always
kinda gunfighter you keep you right in
action right with them ah there's
another one called throughs th uuz
sports and you know all these apps can I
have a common theme where you can
customize your teams and get push
notifications but uh this one's a little
bit different in that it ranks your
games by the level of excitement so if
you got a team is just getting destroyed
and blown out that it's going to rank
pretty low and it's going to tell you
that's a pretty boring game to watch
a really close match of really exciting
games going to get boosted up to the top
and you know it's gonna John with it
with thew sports a on an interruption
here I actually talked to their app
developer recently on the Thieu sports
app comes on the Hisense pulse one of
the newer of Google TV set-top box
devices and whenever i wrote my review
on the on it for some reason i called it
the thews i call it thugs so they know
they're like you know you know we will
you know we're not entirely hardcore no
we're not thugs but you know thanks for
referring to us is that her he emailed
me saying something like that I to go
back and edit the article in the I'm
always caught I don't know it's been in
my head ever since I saw us all the app
you know long time ago I've always
called a thugs and apparently I was
wrong all this time felt kind of merit
but hey dream for them to yeah doe
flattering right I thought I thought you
guys were you know where Leo we're
hardcore yeah your thugs you know yeah
but the good thing about that does make
sense for Google TV because it does give
you a if you're on you know whatever
your network provider you can actually
put that into the app and they'll find a
game for you if it finds a exciting game
that's it's really good if you're kind
of a casual fan that just really likes
to see the really close matches and the
ones that kind of have those down to the
last second kind of finishes it's a good
at the kind really keep a heads up for
those kind of games does against it
since connecting the TV so you can jump
straight to like the live game if you
get that channel that's a good question
i haven't answered a question i will
actually try that out just to say that I
did it report back loaded in the
comments yeah yeah so what is there any
other is there an official app for the
superbowl John you know official NFL
sponsored to happen the official one is
just NFL 2012 it wasn't really one
better apps and most of these apps on
here also let you track in any kind of
sports that you could possibly want to
watch um there is
what used to be score mobile it's called
the score now and it's pretty similar to
the rest of it just got a holo UI update
and different Navigation but it's good
for lightweight there is one though
called a super bowl 47 guide and it's
provided by Verizon Wireless but you can
you know get it on anything and it's
actually for people that are touring in
New Orleans and let you find events and
local restaurants and nightlife and
points of interests and you can create
calendar events a book Arkham so it's
good for the people traveling there
alright alright so there there's a
handful of different ways to you know
find out get your sports information on
Android obviously so these are a few
choices uh if you have something else
that you use to stay in tune with you
know sports or the Super Bowl or
football whoa you know let us know in
the comments and I will be sure to add
it to the list this work one more thrown
in there just somebody wants to watch
the live stream this first row one you
because you can literally watch the
streaming video online ok first row 1
dot EU I put a comment so if anybody
wants to get it but ok I need you ever
used or I guess really even heard of
google's official sports app i remember
it it's called scoreboard i think we
pretty much never to use the team's you
want to follow and we'll keep you up to
date on it I don't know if anyways it's
not a particularly popular app from
Google considering some of their other
ones like you know maps no I'm so I'm
curious what Google now will do so let's
say you you had a couple different
football teams in your you know in your
Google now sports card configuration
even if one of your team's doesn't make
it to the Super Bowl will you get a
Super Bowl score just because it's
football it probably will okay i guess i
guess we'll find out tomorrow yeah i
guess with google now if you can sort of
pick sports that you care about right
like i don't necessarily follow one team
in football but I care about pro
football well in and actually google now
in sports related this week yeah random
Lee people started noticing that you can
actually put college sports teams in
there oh you can finally yeah yes
previously you were only able to put you
know pro pro teams in there so if you
were a you follow collegiate sports you
know you were at not so not so happy but
right now I have Penn State basketball
listed in there and I had the Ohio go
score pop up the other night so yeah I
was not now one thing is I couldn't
actually go into the sports car Dan
configuration and add my own team I had
to do you remember when Google now first
came out you actually had to search for
your team and then it became a card so
that's how you have to do it now I tried
to add it by the card earned by the card
set up under settings and I searched for
Penn State and it didn't work but so
then I went to a google search i typed
in penn state basketball and then i
looked at my phone and huh it says the
iowa games tonight you know so it okay
to try the old-fashioned way that that
worked for me so there must have been a
server-side patch update in the past
week but so those of you that like I
said like collegiate sports
congratulations you are now able to get
those card notifications because Spartan
basketball there you go so let's talk
about some device rumors we had a lot
this week and more about more rumors
about the galaxy s4 from Samsung now the
HTC m7 some more information about that
Motorola X phone and Qualcomm and all
sorts of stuff so uh let's talk about
the big guy I mean they're all big but I
think what a lot of people are excited
for the upcoming samsung galaxy s4 um
the most recent tidbit of information
about this phone says that an internal
contest by a mobile retailer in New
Zealand but one of their flyers from
their contest got out and it said that
the winner of this contest is what is
going to get there a galaxy s4 and the
contest just happens to end on april
eight so if the contest ends on a 48 and
it says the winner is going to
at a handset chances are it's going to
be launched right around then and that
kind of corresponds of the previous
rumors saying that it was going to be
available April fifteenth the week of
april fifteenth so somewhere around
there so i would definitely put that as
you know second week of of april it's
definitely gonna be available just
because you know we've seen that a few
different times now yeah i got like i
said premio previous leaks said that
there's going to be a mobile unpacked
event here in the united states in march
which one ounce the phone coming out a
few weeks later sometime in april i
don't know i think there's reason to
doubt the advertisement that was dropped
as well just given the language didn't
even say galaxy s4 just said samsung s4
well I call it the s3 right now in the
s2 right but there's an implied G in
front of that you don't write it like
that I don't know i right sgs3 or sgs2
or samsung gs2 i hope yeah but i hear
people all the time say hey what phone
he'll all I've the s3 you know it's just
yeah you also hear people say they have
a droid when they're holding it I don't
know LG something Detroit ever well
mostly obviously would happen the next
few weeks but I'd like to think that
because it's a mobile a flyer that
people that are in the know you know the
new they it was implied oh I think the
timing is realistic I'm just questioning
whether or not the people who wrote the
advertisement earn the No or whether or
not people who wrote the advertisement
or just guessing that that's when it's
going to come out because that's the
else is saying it's going to come out
that's sort of what it is to be honest
because probably the timing corresponds
yes and then in April we should be
seeing something like a galaxy s4 or
something big from Samsung coming up but
whoever made that advertisement just
knew nothing probably yes that's what I
think yeah I just have this this isn't
corroboration this is just everybody
else's speculation leading to more stuff
based on that speculation you know what
that does make sense because I've seen
people give away devices that aren't
even announced when they are coming now
yet you know hey we're gonna give us
away you know I call you know but we
have ever we can get our hands on one
yeah yeah so so that that's entirely
possible i will give you that they are
just playing along with the rumor saying
you know what we are going to give one
away but i'd like to think with the
amount of rumors we've been hearing
about such as the screen size you know
and the processor yeah but this time
last year we heard a ton of absurd
rumors about how the galaxy s3 was gonna
have a transparent and flexible display
it was gonna be edgeless and it was
gonna be magnificent it was gloomy the
most extraordinary thing since sliced
bread and you know what they sold a
whole how a lot of fun not saying it's a
bad phone I'm just saying that we heard
all of these ridiculous rumors and
everybody got their hopes up but that it
was gonna be this like magnificent manna
from heaven and of course it was just
you know a cell phone there's a point
where it's just a cell phone well my
argument a year ago was that they didn't
sell us the specs day and they sold us
the S package they sold us software
their marketing was all about yes this
ask that as this and as that yeah maybe
and I think they're building their brand
that way and I think they're they're
gonna do that even further with the s4
they're gonna come out there and you
know move more towards know there s
platform if you want to call it that
that's my thought so moving on to more
rumors HTC is going to have a event here
februari 19th interesting enough they're
going to have one in London and in New
York City usually you don't see two
events happening on the same day in
different cities different continents
you know announcing the same device so
maybe I don't know well what I mean
there's the m7 as well as two other new
devices right Dan yeah they also have
built an m4 and ag2
um the m7 has been pretty well leaked in
terms of what it's supposed to look like
the m4 though is looking more like the
1s or a placement the sort of the middle
of the road one it's supposed to have a
4.3 inch 720 display which is still
extremely pixel density and on the map
but it's probably pretty close to the
1085 inch ones in terms of density so
you aren't losing a whole lot on that
other than just physical real estate I
suppose have a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core
Qualcomm what I would soon is an s4 pro
processor so that would be a dual core
Krait not quite second generation but
almost they are paired with the audrina
320 GPU so the same GPU that's in the
quad cores but that's I mean that's
speculation at this point and then a 13
megapixel camera that's supposed to also
be an am-7 paired with the image sent
sense chip I would assume and then the
g2 is supposed to be the small or the
you know the smaller one the budget end
at three and a half inch hvga screen on
a wonder your processor so certainly a
very budget levels on there you know
what in you know that does make sense to
have additional phones out there besides
just the m7 because you know there was
three versions of the you know the one
series initially so sure in these all
and unlike save certain other platform
manufacturers HTC wanted to compete
every where they want to be able to sell
phones in China they want to be able to
sell phones in india they want to be
able to sell phones in africa where
people aren't going to pay six hundred
and fifty dollars for the phone they're
going to pay fifty dollars for phone and
they're going to get whatever features
you can get for fifty dollars for phone
because that's what they can afford yeah
the least if that's true with the
mid-range i mean i've had a chance now
to look at those dual core s fours
that's not dragons a few times oh yeah
they actually they do really well oh
sure they're great processors the new
the new budget crate processors
great processors but we had sloshes
rightly call comes just going to eat up
the low-end market with those so I'm
still I'm still a little confused about
this the m7 you know we've seen pictures
of it it looks like a droid DNA exactly
what it looks like the DNA and there's a
rumor still that it might come to
verizon that just does not make i don't
i don't believe that rumor that just
doesn't make any sense to me no i
totally agree i don't think that verizon
is going to have to funds that clothes
from the same manufacturer because they
don't want to confuse people more than
they already have with everything else i
don't know i could see them going for it
just because HTC might want to sever
itself from that droid line so to speak
just to roll out an m7 on every US
carrier what if verizon has it on the
slate to do essentially what they did
with the DNA where AT&amp;amp;T and i'll get the
one eggs and then verizon wants to
rebadge it with a you know basically a
version two it's slightly better
hardware and throw it out at Christmas
times they can make a ton of money on
yeah I can see Verizon holding off and
doing a droid sort of offset from the
end that their primary line of ones or
ms or what I call it the droid DNA to
maybe it'll be the m7 I think the
Thunderbolt has pretty much lost its
legacy at this point you know what we're
gonna talk about that right now cuz you
brought it up John the Thunderbolt 16
months after ICS release this past week
verizon rolled out the android 4.0 for
update for that ancient beast you know
android 4.1 has been out for 15 16
months verizon doesn't care they're
getting it to the Thunderbolt you know a
year and a half they're you know they're
rolling it out where's my jelly bean
burger I just want to point out Derek
that I supported Android 4.1 Thunderbolt
before Santa Jamaat did
I probably long before HTC in verizon
dead on your uh your team it ROM team at
Colonel kernels yeah all right what's a
16 month old phone that's I mean if
people got it when it first 16 months
old I was it work both yeah yeah I was
just saying 16 months ago android 4.0
was announced oh there yet the
Thunderbolt is actually verizon's very
first LTE film yep it's about oh yeah
right so it's it's what two years old on
I love you more mugs ish yeah so it is
 in so you know right around now
is the time where people were getting
upgrades anyway so they're gonna be
getting a jellybean phone but hey you
you got ice if you're not eligible yet
you're getting ice cream sandwich on
that Thun alright so back back to rumors
sorry about that uh I want to talk about
the motorola x phone because we had we
had some juicy tidbits info come out
about this phone this week so for those
of you that aren't aware the X phone was
originally brought up from The Wall
Street Journal am going to say two
months ago or so saying that Google was
going to be working on an X phone and
I'm sorry not it is google motorola /
google was working on it an X phone and
an X tablet and immediately everyone was
like oh my god shut up and take my money
so uh any time we hear rumors about this
it makes us android fans a little giddy
inside um so a little background on this
before we get to the rumor on the q4
earnings call last week Larry Page said
that phones shouldn't go splat when you
drop them and he also said that phones
should last through the entire day so
what does that mean well phone should be
you know not break easily and they
should have a big-ass battery so
following up what he said this past week
we had some new rumors about the X phone
we heard rumors saying that it's going
to have a Kevlar chassis which obviously
would help it not go splat um there's
been previous rumors that Google is
looking into like ceramics or something
with a bender a bendable we're flexible
type display so you know we didn't hear
anything about that this week we didn't
hear about a Kevlar chassis arm and we
also heard that it's gonna have a huge
battery think you know like razr maxx
style here I got a huge battery
interesting enough it's going to have a
really good camera supposedly we heard
that it's going to have a sony camera
and a four point eight inch screen a
micro SD card quad core processor and
stock android now that that's the
coolest thing you know and why paint
stock android so my question to you guys
is is is it is this a shut up and take
my money device you know do you believe
these rumors to be true what you know
what are your thoughts on this if these
rumors become I'd say rumors that they
are going to become true today I would
say yes because I've been waiting for a
long time ever since of Google got
acquired motorola i should say motorola
mobility mobility and what I've been
looking to see out of them just hasn't
materialized until now and everything
that you said like coming from like save
me know okay we know that people hate it
when there's a great phone out there and
it's missing key features like batteries
expandable memory something stuff like
that Motorola's proven already that they
can have all of that the razr maxx to me
was a great phone that thing could last
for gates and if that's gonna be in this
phone expandable memory big screen stock
Android I think that's a really big deal
plus people go nuts for those sony
camera sensors people young loves sony
cameras yeah they make really good
cameras I think the nexus can assess the
software bar is a reference design and
to me motorola needs to be google's way
of showing OEMs that you can be
competitive without making the software
look like garbage
basically you need to shut though a
premium hardware device on the market
that says look we'll give you everything
that the s4 has will give you everything
that HTC has to put out and we're going
to do it with better looking software
with faster updates and with a better
overall user experience and just blow
them out of the water and force them to
catch up yeah I mean I think it's still
important to note that there's a
difference between releasing the device
running stock Android and releasing a
device that is part of a OSP yeah you
can release a device that has customized
proprietary hardware or software on it
that is still running stock Android you
put a customized camera app that still
runs against the stock frame work you
put in a customized calendar or email or
whatever other applications you want
that's still run against the stock
framework and you have an advice that
you can pretty much support from any
Android based platform with easy updates
where all you have to do is just roll
out app updates quite quick question if
I you guys sorry um yeah if Motorola is
coming out with this or rather let's say
motor rugal is coming out with criminals
blood or something weekend um what did
what were you guys have thoughts on
motoblur do you think this is going to
be the death of motoblur if this is the
trend from now on with motorola and
google keeping up i think it will depend
on the market if this gives traction in
a way that Motorola really hasn't been
able to outside of the razor series on
verizon then I think yeah it'll start a
trend that they'll don't stick with but
I don't think if it doesn't get traction
I think they'll continue to explore
other opportunities hmm they've been
moving closer to stock as far as to look
and feel anyway and I don't think it's
that big of a change for them to really
go all out stopped because they really
haven't put a ton of customizations on
top of it aside from some image assets
you're here nothing really really major
and they did they do have some useful
stuff like Smart Actions no I I'm hoping
that this does come to fruition I hope
it comes to motorola's long time
friend verizon uh I hope that it comes
with an unlocked bootloader if not I'm
sure somebody in the android community
you know we'll make that that that
problem go away but but I'm hoping that
the you know we have to deal with that
um I I'm excited i will buy it the
moment that it's announced if these
features are true if some people are
saying oh it's a four point eight inch
screen and you know the trend today is
five inches well you know what two
tenths of an inch with no bezel or in a
very very small bezel is gonna be fine
uh you're not gonna you're not gonna
hate you nothing so so we'll see
obviously I'll in a few months rumors
you know may come true they may not
we'll find out come google i/o I assume
that's when this is supposed to be
targeted now i'm going to one more thing
to the rumor mill that I think the X
phone is real and something back it up
is this past week motorola mobility
posted a job opening on linkedin for a
manager a product manager for the
motorola x film and then and then the
job posting went away so either someone
at motorola is trolling the hell out of
everybody in you know posting a job a
job for an unannounced device and then
taking it down or the phone is
definitely real and it's coming so i
would highly doubt them to be trolling
the world i think that would be great
though if they were yes that would be
hilarious yeah right now right now
they're sitting there you know it's a
Saturday night they're all out you know
reading all the android blogs and you
know a news blogs all over the world
toasting and laughing and then we told
them it was an actual job position you
know oh yeah yeah that can happen but
but i doubt it yeah so I'm vibing on the
razr maxx so so what do I know so wiki
you have a variety on verizon up yes um
you're on verizon and john you on
verizon is it if these things come out
you you you buying it at a contract
right away oh I don't know if I want to
be tied down to a contract right away at
that point to be honest I'm saying out
of contract like it you know if it's
whatever the you know retail price is
yeah would you would you if you're not
ready for an upgrade or you know what
would you buy it do you my with verizon
or to switch carriers well Josh well
Josh was already on verizon and I'm
saying as well yeah exactly so the phone
comes out on verizon you aren't ready
for an upgrade yet year you know would
you spend 600 bucks if it costs 600
bucks off contract on it I usually never
buy phones off contract to be honest the
only one that I would would be the next
explore for obvious reasons but yeah if
if it was that good though I might try
to find the deal maybe find someone on
ebay who used it for a week and then
grabbed it that way yeah well I have the
DNA right here I would get rid of that
in a heartbeat for the motorola x phone
if these specs and features are all true
and you know motorola makes great radios
and great hardware that's already proven
fact so I I'm excited i and i hope i
hope it has strictly gonna be running
qualcomm radio what's that Dan I said
it's almost certainly gonna be running
on a clock on radio so what you're
saying is AOSP support for custom roms
is going to be a big pain in the butt
but you know what run stock Android I
don't need a custom wrong the good thing
with motorola's just antenna design well
they did get in times long there AOSP
give me that difficult because the nexus
4 also runs a qualcomm hey all right so
same processor probably clocked up to
1.7 acres so since we're talking about
qualcomm dan your your favorite chipset
developer let's talk about a leak from
them this past week so somebody got
ahold of
some documents they weren't supposed to
and then Qualcomm said hey take those
down and so there's there's nothing like
you know to confirm a rumor when
takedown requests are served so anything
interesting from their roadmap Wow mean
things that we can kind of already guess
they say they said they would have a
test device in q2 2013 for the unveiling
of Android key lime pie that kind of
makes sense because Google i/o is going
to be in q2 chances are a new version of
Android will be announced k is the next
letter in the alphabet it's already been
rumored to be key lime pie multiple
times so having it come out of google
i/o all those stars align correctly it
looks like it's going to happen so what
I'm most intrigued about is they said
they were going they were going to have
a device running key lime pie so is that
just their internal test device or are
they going to be testing a new device to
launch on their new processor running
key lime pie so what the lights are they
talking about they talk about a new
Nexus device or you know um I'm uh I'm
interested I suspect they're talking
about dozens of devices could they be
talking about the motorola x phone damn
i think that's possible i think they're
probably talking about that and tons of
other devices because the new Snapdragon
six and eight hundred are supposed to be
in the market around that time so and
they've already said they've got what
like 150 partners like devices lined up
for those something ridiculous like that
so yeah I'm sure they're talking about
not just one device but tons of them I'm
sure they'll probably also update their
mobile phone reference I came up with a
weird acronym they use for their phone
reference device it recently updated
their tablet and they usually do their
phone in the spring yeah what what's the
time frame for the PDK now three months
ahead of the final software release I
think when they get they basically
giving vendors like Qualcomm time to get
platform developer kit yeah it's usually
between
in one and a half in three months
between when the job with her own phone
makers actually have a phone ready yeah
it probably would lose some form of code
for oh yeah no no they're seeing them
already out to to distribute their joels
all right so let's talk about another
another rumor speculation going oh it's
pretty much confirmed at this point a
white Nexus 4 showed up originally on
picasa because that's where android
phones go to leak all over the place
once they pretty much come to picasa you
know they're real I mean that
unfortunately that that's how it goes
but uh it was only one picture now then
two days later a Vietnamese website
posted a dozen Nexus 4 photos from
various angles close-ups and everything
so it's pretty it's real at this point
so my question is is why are we seeing a
white Nexus 4 when the black one can't
even stand stock yeah anybody have any
thoughts about that it's a little
ridiculous they can't keep the one that
got in stock and they're planning either
one on the other hand I think that it
shows that are planning on ramping up
their production it very least to bring
out another color means you no more
supply of some kind if nothing else
that's what I was thinking too I wonder
if LG is putting together just a massive
amount of devices black or white and
they're all just going to come out of
once at some point yeah you now I hate
and it wasn't just LG or Nexus devices
you know Samsung it did it before you
know almost every manufacturer does this
they released the standard color and
then a few months later they released
the cool colors you know the you know
they released the whites the blues the
reds or whatever so what the hell are
that you supposed to do for the people
that pre-ordered and bought it they won
you know what and what if they wanted a
cool color what if they wanted a white
Nexus you know what so what are they
supposed to do they supposed to try to
sell their black one you know on swapper
or ebay and then go out and buy a brand
new and in end up probably losing
money I mean why can't you released a
white one and a black one at the same
time I I don't understand great thing
about the white Nexus once you've got it
you can paint it any color you already
at home so they need to be selling a
nexus with it with a black paint kit or
red paint kit yeah they'll just know you
can buy the Paint separately for 75
expires you can change it every day
might be hard to paint all the sparkly
blast though well you know I'm sure you
could take it to a nexus customization
shop John and oh no get it done for that
that'll be a nice little glitter
sprinkle it on there though what is the
rookies gonna start this up in New York
he's gonna follow for articles of
incorporation tomorrow Nexus sparkle
it's already done it's already done well
do it right there for you in the subway
it took me like 20 bucks and maybe 15
minutes worth of work to replace the
entire outside shell of my galaxy nexus
to polish it up and why can't they just
sell an entire shell kit and be done
with it make it easy for the users of
swap it out and that is exactly that's
exactly what i was thinking am I I feel
like the only one sometimes that mrs.
those days when you would get phone and
you can go to like an Asian market
somewhere and they have like the entire
shell available in different colors and
you can customize your phone so easily I
missed that so much um honestly I'm
happy that this white Nexus is coming
out I honestly sometimes I prefer white
phones over the black ones in this case
not so much but I like that they have a
choice I would love to see them come out
with more colors but I kind of miss the
days when you would just be able to pop
the back off and then place it with
something else and also you have a
different looking phone yeah I mean I
get that you can't just pop it out and
change it but it does seem stupid that
they release them separately right like
look at Apple as everybody always does
right like they release white and black
at the same time in all the different
size variants all at once rolled out
done one shot right okay so that's
something apples I'm ready yeah with
Android you get the black 16 gigabyte
model and then three months later you
get the 32
my model and then 32 three months later
you get the white one and then three
months later you get the white 32
gigabyte one and then you get them to
max HD LTE 4G you know yeah yeah yeah
all right so so let's move on to some
devices that we actually know about
instead of just speculating uh you know
Dan you had an interesting tidbit about
the asus padfone 2 yeah so the asus
padfone 2 which isn't even on sale in
the United States it's only in I think
just Japan and Taiwan um has sold nearly
1 million units which is roughly the
same number of surface RT's that
Microsoft has sold to distributors not
to end-users just a distributor Wow yeah
yeah loves me loves me some surface RT
you know yes so how's that for a unified
mobile luffle compute platform microsoft
and it costs probably right around the
same mount get to buy the the tablet
like holding thing and the dock for it
and the phone i think is still less than
the surface alright so the Sprint Galaxy
Nexus it's not dead yet it received
android 4.2 point 1 the latest version
the up-to-date version of android this
past week arm yeah then we get to its
ugly cousin the verizon variant which
you didn't receive an update this past
week but the phone did reach end of life
on verizon you you can't buy it anymore
so that's that some news imma get it
brightly edit results wings verizon can
pretend it doesn't exist anymore yeah
exactly fries it doesn't have to update
it they can it'll kill it um i would
assume fingers crossed confidence high
then official over-the-air update would
be coming soon it generally sprint and
you know the verizon variants are not
too far off when it comes to updating
each other ah my breath yeah but yeah
don't go snorkeling the whole
like Dan said if Verizon forgets about
it just everyone just get routing
honestly just get get custom roms just
get going like honestly it's the best
one to do it for it and you're right you
look at it you know Josh you look at the
phone and it routes itself it's so easy
because there's an access device types
three words and you're done yep but but
not everybody can do that nor should
everybody do that you know what I mean
you shouldn't have to do that that's
where yet you chose to slave yourself to
verizon you know what I have to slave
myself to verizon dan i live in the
middle of nowhere we only have verizon
here or i could have to judge enters
they're usually interested in people
willing to privately host there yeah
okay yeah so what AT&amp;amp;T or t-mobile you
want to put a tower in my backyard
awesome awesome a good morning yeah I
will I will make for it too I know they
do forever he's pure fun yeah go ahead
and be going to put it you know get my
since I it'll be like a jungle gym for
my son to play on have you gonna climb
the tower you know exactly there's no
downside here yeah I know you know and
it never Minds me that Simpsons episode
from years ago when they put a cell
phone tower and lisas bedroom because
she liked technology guys remember that
episode but yeah I I used to like the
Simpsons a lot back in the day yeah uh
anyways um so Verizon like we said
updated the Thunderbolt this past week
and they they they sent out an update
for the three year old nearly three year
old HTC droid incredible coming August
I'm sorry coming up April 29th or April
27th I don't remember which the phone is
officially three years old so you know
another couple months verizon for yeah
well and not the incredible to or the
incredible 4G LTE the incredible yeah
you're celebrating over there I got
irritable that's it so Josh wired up and
get your own boobs or update your head
is as well the incredible over-the-air
update aims to get this
lesson random reboots which is not not
eliminate just lesson promises here guys
yeah yeah I'll pick it up you promised
but who'd okay I'm sorry who still uses
that they incredible as their i'm sure
some people do but got work that works
with me does so that mean they had their
obviously has to be a lot of people
still on the original incredib or that
cuz they pushed out an update for it
they're just look just a little bit
about me this is honestly one of my
favorite phones ever like this was one
of the most sturdy phones I've ever
owned oh so little hey i just sold one
on swap the other day it was actually my
wife's incredible while and i had an
incredible as well we loved those phones
yeah yeah they're great friends people
were still people stretched and i sold
mine for 40 bucks i think yeah until
like a week ago i was in use by
co-worker mine who had lost his phone
yeah the incredibles enough incredible
yeah my incredible didn't run danza team
at curl ever it wouldn't even boot with
his Colonel but my wife's a phone liked
his colonel though I don't know what
that means yeah I don't know what my I
think it had to do with annalynne vs s
LCD yeah that could have yeah that's
right because verizon for the original
ones came with mln right and then they
then they had the slc yeah all right so
uh let's move on to add an topic here
Dan a few days ago it became technically
illegal in the United States to carrier
unlock your phones yes you want so so
what does that mean we're talking about
about that yes so the digital millennium
copyright act basically says you can't
do much of anything that could
potentially lead to you illegally
downloading copyrighted material or
otherwise transcoding stealing
transferring the media format in any way
really in acquiring other than what the
mpaa and RIAA tell you is acceptable um
but because that's such a ridiculously
broad standard they allow the library of
congress to dictate exceptions every
year
or excuse me every three years and so
exceptions are for things like saying
it's okay to have books on tape for deaf
people because every three years the
lobbies for disabled people come and
remind the Library of Congress that deaf
people still can't hear right so they're
going to need to have something in
Braille and blind people can't see so
they need books on tape and every three
years everything else to go and lobby
for these things because every three
years they're still true three years ago
the Library of Congress open the door
for jailbreaking or rooting your device
seeing them from Apple Apple controls
the software Apple controls the hardware
and they can tell you what you can and
can't do with the software and hardware
so that's six hundred fifty dollars you
paid was just a nice tiny Brent yeah so
this has nothing to do with actually
like you know unlocking your bootloader
rooting your phone like some people
think it's no you know this doesn't
affect you putting a custom rom on your
phone this is going to affect you buying
a locked AT&amp;amp;T device and trying to
switch it to tmobile it's just confusing
for some people because a lot of people
say you know unlock a bootloader unlock
and unlocking the phone or carrier
unlock you know that because all you say
unlocked it's not technically the same
thing but yeah so it was a question of
what are you unlocking right you say
unlock do you in your car doors you mean
your house to mean your bootloader do
you mean your carrier blocking what do
you mean when you say I'm lock there's
lots of stuff to unlock and you can buy
unlocked phones such as the white Nexus
4 potentially assuming it's not just
sold by t-mobile yeah ocwen is only sold
by t mobile right now and then in other
usage case and you got like verizon
which you can move a verizon phone to
spread but it's gonna be limited by mean
what you're going to buy a verizon which
is the worst edition of any of the
phones that we come to any carriers with
a locked bootloader and move it
sprint me no I can see a lot of people
doing that so pain it's possible it's a
pain it's possible it's just not worth
it so I just don't see it being a huge
use you know to me no I don't think it's
going to affect a lot of people but it's
still the legislature itself is crap but
yeah you know speaking about the
legislature being crap the same week
that it became illegal to do this in the
United States Canada are cousins up
north decided that we should propose
legislature to have all carriers unlock
all devices for free if the users you
know suggested so Canada's doing it
right well obviously Canada just loves
piracy that's the other thing that's the
only explanation there there's steal our
prescription drugs and now they want on
movies and music to those kids and
upstairs American Junior America's pro
cap yeah actually as yes yeah that's you
know you for calling heard Canada
referred to as america's hat no it's
America's troll cap you know that that's
what it is all right so so let's talk
about a little bit of ecosystem news
here before we wrap up it's more along
lines of you know Samsung and HTC news
but it deals with Android as a whole so
Samsung was announced to be the top
mobile vendor in the US for 2012 they
sold more mobile phones then and the any
other manufacturer they actually
remained king of the market with a mass
of fifty-three percent market share so
fifty-three percent of all mobile phones
sold in 2012 world in the US or Samsung
devices that includes dumb phones that
does include dumb phones but still
samsung is king yeah i mean that's
massive I don't care mom sold in the
country were made by samsung yeah and
that includes dumb phones
low-end phones midgrade phones as well
as high-end phones and number two second
place was Apple at forty three point
seven percent so about a ten percent
difference but Apple only sells you know
high-end you know phones you know the
iphone so as the old iPhones and
pretends that they're low end phones up
there you go okay you're right it's
bigger they sell a crapload of those
older ones too oh yeah because they they
they knock the price down a lot when a
new one comes out yes and they forced
carriers to pick up the difference
because they still charge the carriers
the full price that they wear the day
they went on sale so Samsung likes the
stylist we know this because of the note
the note to the note 10.1 and the
rumored upcoming 8 the new the north 12
the hook fill in the blank number
basically they're nosing all the things
with a pen on and to continue their
stance on long live the stylus they
purchased five percent of wacom and
what's that welcome i think a welcome i
don't i said walk so walk home wacom
whatever they purchased five percent
them so so uh who is walk home might ask
well they're pretty much what's
considered the industry standard for
digital drawing tablets basically if
you're an artist and you draw digitally
chances are you have one of these
tablets yep linux you've seen a plugin
for Wacom tablets too because it's there
by default on ubuntu and several other
districts that is so they're they're
extremely useful actually it's a black
slave you have a pen and it's very
responsive so like you said drawing
tablets you you can draw with those but
they're also really good for really
quick usage if you need to do things
really quick like video edit so
interesting you know they they purchased
a five percent of the company obviously
they have some motive behind it I mean
they have tablets that you can draw on
you know that there has to be some
correlation there somebody was thinking
something along those lines you guys
have any thoughts on uh why they're
backing this at all just saute you guys
are doing it well we're gonna do it too
we're gonna help you out throw some
money your way it's the beginning of a
very tiny it's a tiny beginning of a
takeover mall steps okay yeah fine i
think it's it's an investment in their
future products they want to make sure
that welcome has money because they want
to make sure the tape have a reliable
supply of these beasts I lon yeah if
there's anybody that they could go to
for really good stylist technology it is
welcome it really is you know the thing
is I should really remember this better
because it was me who wrote a story on
it but uh somebody was patenting
basically what looked like an
alternative to the s-pen that had a ball
on the tip that would provide kind of
tactile feedback to give you more of a
feeling of writing on paper or I
remember one of the things they
mentioned in the patent was using it for
games to be able to provide resistance
from the stylist and maybe that could
have something to do with Samsung's and
dressed in a calm but I don't know about
the other way around what's in it for
them because they seem to be shooting
pretty well anyway cashflow me another
thing I think is who says no to billions
of dollars so um desktop computers are
going touch screen if not you know not
necessarily primarily touchscreen one
hundred percent yet but with Windows 8
you look at the all in ones and all of
them are touchscreen enabled if we ever
get to a world with us the standard you
know your stylus is going to be for
people using Photoshop that's going to
be your precision to where it used to be
a mouse so you know there's probably
still a future for the stylus even in
you know 10 years from now
forget stuff like that yeah it's all
speculation but I mean Samsung does have
a computing division and if they in the
future they make like yeah touch screens
on computers are still not that great
but if you have a good surface for a
stylist to go nuts on then yeah
something like this could lead to a
partnership that creates a device so oh
go ahead whoever was about to talk I was
just going to move on to the next topic
but you guys were still talk about Sammy
in there there styluses or anything
related that that's fine what I was
going to say is I just I don't really
see a list on a computer touchscreen
just because of 41 ergonomic inserm like
how hard is it to have a screen that you
can look at and also draw up and with a
pen that you can use for everyday work I
mean I know for example artists will
have a thing a display laid back well I
can't really imagine for example typing
or editing video on a display like that
and if you have it up right I'm having a
hard time imagining the stylist on that
as well I guess I was I guess I was
imagining like a yoga so good so it
flips all the way back and then you can
do what you need on it like kind of like
a tablet yeah I know they've tried it
before but it's not great so no that
would make sense hmm it's nice how the
second has come for a full circle back
from you know a decade ago when tablets
started being made now when the ipad
came out contrary to what Apple would
have you believe there were tablets
before that decade before that when they
all had styluses like this yep that was
that was the interface mechanism well
people criticized about the first note 2
is like wait a stylus again yeah good
technology never dies I guess so let's
move on and talk about another thing
from the Android ecosystem the android
community this week we had clarification
about last week's decent assists
takedown of HTC are you you calm and
basically what we speculated on the show
last week turns out to
that that's kind of truthful um HTC was
just protecting their name their
trademark that it wasn't because the
site in question provided custom roms or
even are you used it was because the
site had HTC in the domain name it used
HTC logos and it was made to look like
an official HTC site so they didn't want
to confuse customers I mean it makes
perfect sense i I'm okay with that
explanation they didn't attack the dev
community like so many people thought no
absolutely i mean from the outset I've
seen HTC are you calm before right like
I'm familiar with the website from the
outset when HTC one after them I wasn't
surprised it was obviously trademark
infringement yeah everyone is freaking
out about how they're going after the
deaf community they didn't care about
the guy distributing the are you use
they cared about the guy using their
logo and using their name great
distribute whatever you want it's freely
accessible they destroyed it on their
website and then making money off of
that or you want that's fine but don't
do it under their name that's illegal of
course they're going to go after you for
trademark infringement that's a lot of
work but like really try to make your
site look like an HTC official website
to like yeah yeah why waste your time
with that make it look like your own
thing make it obvious what you're doing
don't try and trade on their name I
agree all right so let's talk about rune
and ramen real quick so CM cyanogenmod
released two updates that this week to
existing apps the the phone app received
a major update if it now gets call logs
statistics a lot more than the stock
statistics up it's pretty neat you want
to check it out on latest nightly if
you've got anything in the past couple
days you probably actually have the new
night new the new phone app with
statistics of built-in and you also
probably have the new Chronos which is
the weather calendar clock widget all in
one it's not called Chronos anymore
it's called clock or seal off guys
however you want to call the background
on that is they got they were sent
cease-and-desist to stop using Chronos
because it was very similar to Cronus
which was a trademarked name and they
don't do anything similar they're not
related at all no they're spelled
similar and sound similar I thought that
it was the same name just not at all the
same thing no it was it was crowded
there was an H versus not an H
personally I think that should have just
changed to do Chronos with a que yeah
we're going Robbie's way not Greek but
but you know what it makes sense now
calling it clock or c-loc because it's
off yeah that's a clock on a lockscreen
it's kind of a play on words it's and
you know it doesn't really matter what
they call it in my opinion it's a it's a
very cool widget that starts out as a
clock if you expand it you know in you
know you can drag you know around the
screen and to expand the widget if you
expand it make it bigger boom here comes
whether you expand it even more boom
here comes upcoming calendar reminder so
it's a very cool widget you know what
who cares what it's called me the way
they got a new name I don't see why
anybody was upset in the first place
especially when you have 75 things
called carbon right now and all of it to
be getting along fine I know that
because somebody had a trademark and
wanted to feel special about them that's
pretty much although that's all it was
somebody somebody had a bad day and they
want to feel good about yourself no
different than Apple we're gonna whine
because you over there are more popular
than us and we feel sad and pathetic so
I'm gonna run my mouth about these
patents until you stop and you know
admit that I'm better than you because I
feel bad what myself somebody get
something to their Cheerios no oh and
last but not least on the root and rom
in front be verizon galaxy note 2 and
the Sprint Galaxy Note 2 now have
official cyanogenmod 10.1 nightlies
Johnathan Franklin are you running one
not currently I'm
a little bit more time to bake because
okay hi welcome other versions using
back and forth between 4.2 and 4.1 is
kind of a pain because of the multi-user
stuff so all right well let me know here
in the near future you'll eventually
flash it so let me know your number to
it pretties I'll just cut all right okay
all right so it's a Dan you want to wrap
up here with hating on patents and are
in our patent war segment as you always
love to talk about yeah so we remember
in ish alee there had been a preliminary
injunction issued against the Galaxy
Nexus and this is for the apple vs
samsung to trial the one that is just
starting now apple head had been issued
that injunction and then samsung
appealed the appeals court the way it
works is they don't actually like the
entire court doesn't hear every appeal
they'll issue some smaller group to hear
it and so the three-person panel that
heard the original appeal unanimously
decided to throw out the injunction
Apple then appealed that decision to the
full court basically asking for the
entire panel all I think its nine or
maybe 12 judges instead of just three to
hear their case and that was
resoundingly rejected they decided to
not hear it at all basically Apple was
suggesting that the appeals court was
creating new precedent and so that
deserved a further hearing and by
rejecting that argument the full panel
basically agreed with Samsung's view
that no apples just dumb and doesn't
understand the law here because the
appeals court didn't create any new
standards at all they just actually
applied them which the original judge
did not bother doing and that same
standard that was set by the appeals
court was used by that lesser that lower
court judge in the apple one later
post-trial bickering to uphold not
expanding the damages that
had to pay and to uphold not issuing
injunctions for their unfriend so
there's very sound legal ground it's
just that Apple apparently doesn't
understand the law you know I've thought
for a wild and that they don't
understand the law I'm not gonna lie
yeah i mean that's that's it's quickly
becoming that is that they just don't
understand the law i mean when you look
at google had to make this week deal
with the FCC to get out of FTC to get
out of potential antitrust stuff and
what they gave up was saying that we're
not going to seek infringement or seek
injunctions on people infringing fran
patents but there's still exceptions to
that for example people that refuse to
take a license at any fee you can still
seek an injunction against them because
they're refusing to take a license no
matter what that license is G what did
Apple say to the court just recently oh
that's right they said that they refuse
to take a license at any rate so Google
still free to seek injunctions against
apple for fran patents because apple
refuses to follow the law mean it's it's
just getting ridiculous and the crowd is
quickly falling out from underneath of
them as as they keep peeling these
decisions it just gets worse for them if
they try to peel this one again which
they do have the right to do they can
try and appeal it to the Supreme Court
but that's not going to go their way and
it's likely to go their way a lot more
harshly than just not being heard well I
I'm curious you know how that pans out
and then in the near future I'd like to
you know like to see Apple get to taste
their own medicine but things we are we
even on my time are even at all
surprised that that's happening that the
grounds kind of come out from under
honestly because they try so hard to do
something that everyone is honestly just
becoming tired of you know yeah and the
Supreme Court has a lot of leeway in
terms of sort of what they can do with
the case when they decide to hear it
yeah the appeals court is deciding a
relatively narrow
whether or not this this particular
injunction can stand for the particular
reasons there in front of them if Apple
appeals it to the Supreme Court and the
Supreme Court decides to pick it up pick
it very well expand that to a much
broader range of issues that are at hand
in these trials and you know start going
into patent validity questions and start
going into particular litigation
practices when it comes to patent cases
and do something like say force a USPTO
review on patents before allowing a
trial to be held on those patents
because otherwise you run into problems
like the apple vs samsung one case where
the jury or words you know nobody can
really figure out how much money based
on infringement on this particular
patent that after the trial we come to
find out was invalid in the first place
okay so I like to on a personal note
close up here by saying that wiki our
droid DNA now has a quote on quote
working cyanogenmod unofficial rom now
it's called working rom but i'm just
gonna say that means it boots nod yeah
it should really be called a booting
wrong because i'll give you a rundown of
what works the display good to know oh I
did I didn't freeze there that I know so
the real with the radio interface
library the radio radio doesn't work
which means no data arm there's no
sensors that work there's no Wi-Fi
basically you boot it up you're like
cool no no no that's about it but you
have to start somewhere I'm not knocking
the dev obviously you know drew drew X
to keep doing everything you're doing
and uh you and the everybody else
working on all the other devs working on
it keep doing everything you're doing I
can't wait to run signage mod on the DNA
on neither can I
just it's just funny that people were
flashing this and like hey I can't get
you know stuff to work you know but
you're right it means work-in-progress
it's a work-in-progress you know hey I
can't get Wi-Fi to work what do I need
to flash up you know that no nothing
nothing works yet like but give it
another two weeks or so and what you
know I'm sure they'll have everything
working at that fingers crossed you know
yeah I remember the first time I flashed
the first quasi working AOSP base Rob on
my EVO like two and a half years ago oh
and nothing worked no data no Wi-Fi this
play worried you could kind of get
touched to work sometimes everything was
broken that was like signed a pre
cyanogenmod six yeah so eventually devs
do what they do best no they get stuff
to work we just gotta give him time so
if you have the DNA you're watching this
you're listening to this just wait i'll
let you know trust me the moment it
becomes workable it teases a daily
driver I will scream from the heavens
and let everybody know that it is time
to flash it is time to have a senseless
an AOSP rom for an amazing piece of
hardware all right so where can you find
