handy from Android Authority comm and
it's nearing the end of 2018 and that
means it's time to round up the best new
Android apps that were released in 2018
this year we did things just a little
bit differently
we started our deliberations with a
reader poll on the site and then
narrowed down our final list from there
so some of this is influenced a little
bit by our readers votes also instead of
running through 15 apps in 30 seconds
apiece
we were decided to take a deeper dive at
our five favorite applications from 2018
and if you want to see the rest of them
we'll have the full list linked up in
the video description below alright then
let's get started our first pick is
Hyperion launcher it was one of a few
notable launcher releases in 2018 that
also included rootless launcher and lean
launcher we just kind of liked Hyperion
launcher the best out of the bunch
it features a buttery smooth UI plenty
of customization elements and an
optional Google feed plugin if you want
the whole experience
although the plug-in requires a little
extra work you can check the Play Store
listing for more details so what do you
get here well the customization options
are numerous and fun it includes support
for third-party icon packs as well as
custom fonts accent themes and the usual
array of little things like desktop dock
and app drawer grid sizes you also get
some simple but effective gesture
controls along with more advanced icon
customization and animations look here's
the thing folks there's nothing
particularly mind-blowing about Hyperion
launcher it just works really well with
just the right amount of customization
options to be enjoyable the developers
thought of little things like letting
you change the icon pack without diving
all the way into the settings and
automatically enabling some of the
gesture controls out of the box it's
just enjoyable to use and I honestly
couldn't find anything wrong with it
plus it reminds me a little bit of
borderlands keyboard launches are pretty
rare these days so it's nice when it
competently done keyboard arrives on the
Play Store grammarly keyboard was
technically a 2017 release but we cut
off our submission time sometime in
mid-december so this happens
occasionally anyway grammerly keyboard
is an outstanding keyboard and unless I
miss something
arguably the best one of 2018 this
keyboard does a lot of stuff right it's
an excellent smooth typing experience
that doesn't feel too bloated or
ridiculous that constantly working
grammar engine checks every sentence for
proper grammar as well as proper
spelling
it'll give
the reason for each grammar change as
well just in case the meaning isn't
clear and this is easily one of the best
autocorrect systems that I've used in a
long time
you do get some basic features out of
the box like a number row a keyboard
size option and a dark theme on the
other hand grammarly doesn't have a lot
of the mainstream features like gesture
typing predictions integrated searches
or anything like that it's just a nice
simple functional keyboard that keeps
you from typing the wrong version of
there we would like to see a few more
features in future releases but no other
keyboard does but this one does VPNs are
kind of a big deal these days people use
them to avoid issues at public Wi-Fi
hotspots like the airport or Starbucks
they encrypt your traffic they help keep
hackers away from your precious data and
keep your activities private from your
internet service provider most of the
time there were two good VPNs launched
in 2018 and they were proton VPN and of
course VPN hub from the venerable porn
hub but for this list we chose proton
VPN let's start with the good stuff
first proton VPN hits every check mark
for what makes a VPN good that includes
a strict no logging policy strong
encryption and it's based in Switzerland
which has some seriously good privacy
protection laws the UI is simple it's a
little boring and it has one of the best
free versions that I've ever seen you
don't get the maximum speeds but you do
get unlimited free bandwidth with no
advertising or anything to gum up the
works the pro version is inexpensive
compared to many of its competitors and
includes faster speeds and more servers
ok so look here's the thing security
apps are boring they just are there's
nothing fun or exciting about encrypting
your traffic over a virtual private
network however in 2018 these things are
fairly necessary for just about anybody
who uses public Wi-Fi in almost any
capacity proton VPN lets you safely
check your email at a Starbucks without
looping you into yet another
subscription and it's easy to turn on
and off this is the one that I recommend
to both people on Android authority and
in my personal life YouTube music the
application isn't actually new however
YouTube music the service is new and
it's actually pretty good in 2018 there
were dozens of music and video streaming
services out there but YouTube music is
one of the few that can do both
competently well of course it's still
quite new and it needs a lot of feature
updates
we like where it's headed you get a
surprisingly large amount of music with
YouTube music it has a collection of
songs like any other streaming service
however YouTube music adds almost all of
the music videos from YouTube as
playable tracks that puts it right up
there with SoundCloud as the streaming
service with the most possible songs we
also really like how you can add normal
songs to playlists right alongside those
rare gems that you can only find on
YouTube you want to add that post belong
song you like along with two cellos
cover of thunderstruck in that live song
you can't find on Spotify and that
really fun Japanese pop rock band that
no one's ever heard of do a playlist
YouTube music can do it nobody else can
now it'll never cater to the audiophile
crowd YouTube simply can't control the
quality of the music being uploaded to
its servers and that's fine the
audiophile peeps out there still have
title and other streaming services still
we're excited to see youtube music
expand its feature set more so that it
feels like a full music streaming
experience because the app is just the
little bare-bones right now in any case
it's damn good and it even took second
place in our reader poll yes friends
bouncer is our choice for the best new
Android app from 2018 its permission
management app in home-like goodness
that sounds so much more boring than it
actually is actually on second thought
it is a little boring this is more
security stuff and security stuff is
again we're usually pretty boring but
hey hear me out
so here's what this application does it
lets you enable permissions for any
application on a temporary basis for
instance you can give Facebook access to
your camera so you can post a picture on
your Facebook story or whatever and then
have bouncer disable that permission
later on that way you can use any
feature on basically any application
without worrying about digging into the
settings to disable the permission later
or otherwise committing to an
application having a permission
permanently it can also delete existing
permissions and you can have it
immediately withdraw a permission if you
didn't mean to grant an app access to it
the application can also blanket wipe
all of your permission preferences in
case you want to start fresh so my
question is why can't I just do this why
isn't this on stock Android you know
what this this should be on stock
Android it's a small thing but it's just
so nice to have the ability to
automatically remove permissions after a
set period of time seems like something
we should just be able to do on any
platform frankly I'd appreciate
something like this on Windows
i OS or her any other OS for that matter
we should be able to do this without an
application but we can't and now we have
this app so we can and it's nice anyway
aside from the occasionally clunky UI
this app really is that good
bouncer best of 2018 period and that
about does it for this one folks if you
liked the video you know what to do and
if not you still know what to do if you
want to check out the full list of 15
apps that's linked up in the video
description below along with the links
to all of the apps we talked about in
this video as always thanks for watching
everybody and have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
