Andhra Authority and apparently the race
for the thinnest smartphone in the world
is still a thing for some companies but
how thin is too thin well this is the
Oppo r5 and we're going to find out if
it strikes a perfect balance between
form and function or if it's sleek looks
isn't without sacrifices Oppo doesn't
have a huge presence in the US but
they've certainly been making headlines
the last couple of years by pushing
boundaries when it comes to smartphone
design they're also known for making
phones with some awesome build quality
and the r5 is no exception what the
design of the r5 you're looking at a
phone made of very premium materials the
front is entirely made of glass these
sides are wrapped in a metal frame and
the back is also metal with the
exception of the plastic inserts on the
top and bottom which are most likely
there to improve reception in the hand
the r5 feels extremely sleek and the
metal body gives it that really nice
cold feel when you first pick it up in
the morning it's also not slippery to
hold what you might think it would be
because of how much metal there is but
because these sides are flat it's really
easy to hold on to the biggest story
about the r5 S design though is how thin
it is the r5 comes in an insanely thin
4.85 millimeters making it one of the
thinnest smartphones if not the thinnest
in the world in fact the r5 is so thin
the camera protrudes quite a bit from
the body this could potentially cause
concern with durability for some people
because of how exposed it is but so far
I haven't had any problems also if you
like texting with your phone flat on the
table you might be annoyed by how it
rocks back and forth taking a tour
around the r5 you'll find the power and
volume keys on the right which are also
made of metal and they're very nice and
clicky and perfectly placed where my
thumb can easily reach them so no
problems there on the bottom is a
microUSB port with a microphone and
along the top you'll find nothing it's
completely blank same story goes with
the left side of the phone it's almost
entirely blank with the exception of
your SIM card slot towards the bottom at
this point you're probably wondering
where's the 3.5 millimeter headset jack
and where's the dedicated speaker
well the truth is with the r5 being so
thin there simply wasn't room to fit a
3.5 minute headset jack or a dedicated
speaker this is clearly a conscious
decision by Oppo to go with form over
function but that doesn't mean listening
to audio is not possible if you want to
listen to music using earbuds you can
still do so but you'll have to use the
proprietary earbuds included in the box
these proprietary earbuds plugged
directly into the micro USB port and
they work in sound just as if it was
plugged into a 3.5 millimeter headset
jack the biggest downside to this is
obviously the fact that you can't use
your own earbuds or headphones and while
these earbuds aren't going to give you
the best audio experience it's still
better than nothing at all if you'd like
to listen to audio without your buds you
can still do that too because the
earpiece on the r5 actually doubles as
an external speaker the quality is
pretty average and sounds about the same
as any other phone with a single speaker
but I did find it to be a little on the
quiet side
on the front of the r5 you're looking at
a 5.2 inch AMOLED display coming in at
1080p resolution and the display looks
just as good as the rest of the phone we
know at this point that quad HD is the
future of smartphone displays but you
won't find much to complain about what
the r5 s display colors are vibrant and
saturated viewing angles are great
whites look perfectly white and since
this is an AMOLED display you're going
to get those really deep blacks that you
just can't get with an LCD the display
is capable of getting really bright
which is great for outdoor visibility
but I noticed it also gets pretty dim so
you don't have to strain your eyes when
trying to read at night inside of the
Oppo r5 you're going to find a
Snapdragon 615 and two gigs of ram if
you're not familiar with these
Snapdragon 615 this is an octa-core
64-bit processor but don't be fooled by
the number of cores this is a mid tier
processor from Qualcomm and the r5 is
still running on 32-bit software so it's
not taking full advantage of the
processor at least not yet
regards to that it's still a great
performer apps open quickly animations
are smooth and high-end games run fine
without any lag or drop frames
multitasking is fine too but it is a
little slow due to the fact that you
have to long press the menu button every
time you want to switch between apps but
this really has more to do with poor
implementation than actual performance
the only real problem I've had with the
performance is the keyboard if you want
to use any other keyboard besides the
default keyboard you can't and if you
try to switch keyboards it causes the r5
to softboot every single time this can
most likely be fixed with a software
update so I won't be too harsh on it but
it's still annoying nonetheless taking a
closer look at the camera we have a 13
megapixel Sony sensor with an LED flash
and starting with the camera interface
you'll find that it's a very simple
clean and intuitive interface there
isn't much in terms of manual controls
outside of expert mode so taking photos
and videos is relatively straightforward
the camera settings are tucked away in
the bottom left corner and there's a
slide-out panel on the right for all
your different shooting modes with an
option to download
more than what comes pre-installed with
that being said the app can be a little
bit cumbersome to use at least when
shooting in landscape because not
everything rotates to landscape
orientation the camera settings for
example stay locked in portrait so every
time I wanted to change something in the
settings IR they had to deal with
reading everything sideways or flipping
the phone back to portrait the same
thing can be said with the beautify mode
you'll notice that none of the faces or
text rotates the landscape and it just
creates for a very inconsistent and
frustrating experience when you have to
constantly flip the phone back and forth
between portrait and landscape on the
plus side the camera does have a pretty
fast shutter so it's really easy to
rapidly fire off some shots in
succession but the picture quality isn't
so impressive with 13 megapixels the
camera is capable of capturing plenty of
detail but it has a tendency to
overexpose resulting in a lot of
overblown highlights indoors is
certainly better and you will get a
little more color in detail but it
definitely takes some practice to get
exactly what you're looking for shooting
in normal mode will also result in some
poor looking low-light shots with an
increase in noise levels and softer
details which is very surprising for you
lens with an F 2.0 aperture but Oppo has
included a slow shutter mode that keeps
the shutter open a lot longer to pull in
more light and it actually works quite
well
photos are brighter and sharper with a
lot less noise but you'll want to be
careful with this feature because if you
don't have a steady hand it will result
in a blurry photo Ultra HD mode which
has been a staple feature for Apple for
a while now also makes a return here on
the r5 allowing you to take 50 megapixel
photos it's really just a neat software
trick that stitches a series of images
together but it does work the images
definitely are sharper and more detailed
than the default 13 megapixel photos so
it is worth using but I wouldn't
recommend using it on anything other
than still objects because it does take
a little bit of time for the camera to
process the image the 50 megapixel shots
also weigh in at around 10 megabytes
apiece and with only 16 gigabytes
onboard and no microSD card expansion
you could run out of space before you
know it moving on to the battery you're
looking at a two thousand milliamp power
battery and in two
14 this is considered an extremely small
battery and earlier I mentioned that
Appa made a very conscious decision to
go with form over function and the
battery life really takes a hit because
of this this is the first phone that
I've used in a very long time where I
can literally describe the battery life
as being terrible I mean it is awful
battery life I'm getting between 10 to
12 hours off the charger and only one
and a half to two hours of screen on
time maybe two and a half hours if I'm
lucky and don't get me wrong I love the
thin and sleek design of the r5 it's
beautiful but I would not have minded if
the phone was just a little bit thicker
with a slightly larger battery because I
don't know about you but battery life is
not something that I'd be willing to
sacrifice just so I could have a thinner
phone the good news is the r5 supports
oppose Buch rapid charging technology
meaning you can get a 75% charge in 30
minutes time but I wasn't able to take
advantage of it due to the charging
brick not being a US charger but
considering it's only a two thousand
milliamp hour battery I was still able
to get a pretty fast charge by using a
1.5 to 2 amp charger in terms of
software the r5 is running on android
4.4 kitkat with Apple's own color OS its
color OS version 2.0 to be specific and
for the most part it hasn't changed much
in terms of aesthetics from previous
versions it's still very colorful as the
name suggests but the settings menu has
now taken on a much darker look with
colored icons and the gesture panel
which used to be accessible but they
swipe down on the top left corner of the
screen is now at the bottom I personally
like Lee move to the bottom because it's
much easier to get to and I don't have
to worry about accidentally swiping it
down every time I reach for the
notification shade the gesture panel
still works just like before with some
pre-made gestures for apps like the
camera and flash and you can also create
your own gestures for any application
you want you can even trigger these
gestures with the screen off so you can
access your apps much quicker Apple has
also built-in tapped awake and while the
power button is already really easy to
reach the tap to wake is still a handy
feature to have especially when it's
just sitting on a table and you just
want to quickly check the time there's
also some very Sam's
s features built-in like air gestures so
you can wave your hand over the phone to
scroll through home screens and photos
in your gallery but I found it to be
extremely sensitive so sensitive that
even if I were to just tilt the phone
the wrong way it would scroll so I just
kept it turned off the theme app is
probably one of my favorite features in
color OS it allows you to change the
look of the icons folders wallpaper and
lock screens so if you don't like the
way color OS looks by default you can
change that it's a very well fleshed out
app and there's a lot of beams to pick
from so you should be able to find at
least a few that suits your taste as of
this video Apple hasn't announced a
release date just yet but once it does
come out it'll be available for $500
just keep in mind that Oppo doesn't
release their phones in the US so if
you're inside the US and you want to
pick one up you'll have to import it
through sites like eBay it does have 3G
and LTE connectivity but according to
Oppo site there's a couple of different
versions with different band supports so
you'll want to make sure to grab the one
that works best with your carrier and
that is going to do it for the Oppo r5
the r5 is beautiful very well made and
one of the thinnest smartphones in the
world but having a phone this thin isn't
without its compromises and if you're
willing to live with those compromises
like a lack of a 3.5 millimeter headset
jack a dedicated speaker and
less-than-desirable battery life then
you will love the r5 but for me
personally the compromises are just too
great from the r5 s good looks to
overcome as always guys thanks so much
