and here we're taking a look at two
brand new tone headphones
LG's brought a couple of major updates
to their popular tone line of headphones
both of which take a different
perspective on personal audio what we
have to preface before we get started
here is that LG really didn't give us
much spec information the presentation
where we got some time to play with
these headphones basically focused on
how different and unique the concepts
are but no other detail was given to us
other than the fact that we had to try
them on for ourselves the first is the
tone free a pair of headphones which
probably most users are going to clamor
over around the neck design of the band
is similar and familiar but - there are
no controls on the body because the
earbuds literally detach that's right
these are LG's version of the truly
wireless earbud included with the
familiar part of this setup is a small
peripheral that the two earbuds easily
snap into while contacts on the back of
either bud sit in the case and make up
the charging process the small case is
quite discreet users can definitely use
the earbuds on their own and throughout
the band but then these want to be LG
tone headphones so to keep the band
relevant it also includes a battery to
charge the buds and they serve as a
simple and effective space to store them
when not in use the fit was a little
small in my ears for these earbuds but
we're sure that the fit can be
customized in the retail edition each
ear bud has designations for either side
but look like mere opposites of one
another the body is hanging out of the
ear just a little bit but with the
proper fit they really shouldn't slide
out otherwise the band japes around the
neck easily and brings back the familiar
yet somewhat conflicting feelings that
the tones tend to evoke unfortunately
we're unable to give opinions on the
sound quality because we were not able
to really pair them to anything the tone
fries themselves that we were able to
play with we're not paired to anything
and we could not even connect to them so
the tone platinum headphones if we look
back I had pretty good sound output so
we hope that the same experience will be
part of these when they come out of this
early production version the LG tone
studio is same same but different as I
mentioned already before the band design
returns but then the studio headphones
are incredibly large it's obvious why
after your first glance these are
speakers on both arms
LG calls these their personal speaker
solution meaning that these two speakers
set in the arms of the band
blast sound up to the users face and
ears people around the user can still
hear the sound but the secondhand audio
is a pale representation of the real
thing putting the tone studio around my
neck I turned on the rogue one trailer
and blasted it in all actuality they
sound like low to mid tier Bluetooth
headphones that are just around my neck
that said however the sound a pump is
actually quite loud I found it hard to
hear anyone that was trying to talk to
me while I was testing out the studios
the retractable earbuds sounds a lot
like previous tone headsets which is
good and then there is an aux input
where a wired connection aside from the
Bluetooth can channel sound a built-in
DAC will activate when something is
plugged in here so sound through
especially the earbuds could be even
better they are the largest tone
headphones LG has ever made and the
speakers are very interesting take on
personal audio for the most part we
expect the studio headset to be used in
home situations like when users want to
hear only the audio of their video game
without needing headphones on the other
hand or ear we are excited to see LG
take their already well-regarded tone
line into the future into the growing
trend of true wireless headphones keep
it tuned to Android Authority for even
more about the tone freeze or the tone
studio headphones and remember to keep
it tuned here for even more from CES
2017 because we are your source for all
things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
