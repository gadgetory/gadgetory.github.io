brings needed changes to the wearable
platform but the first showcase of these
enhancements comes courtesy of LG we did
an unboxing on social media where we
also asked you to give us your questions
and in this review we will pull a few
and answer them this is Joshua Vergara
what's going on everybody
and this is the LG watch sport now
before we get started this review
focuses on the LG watch sport because it
is the more feature have you watch but
we will still mention the watch style
where applicable the watch sport is
clearly the larger of the two and its
big size is sure to put up some users it
isn't too much of a surprise considering
how many bits and pieces there are two
programmable shortcut buttons flank the
rotating dial the back cover exposes the
heart rate sensor and right next to that
heart rate sensor is a SIM card tray
these are all features that don't come
on the LG watch style which makes its
smaller body a little more accessible to
the average user as a result the watch
sport is a bit too big for my wrist
though I don't mind the overall look too
much my biggest issue with this watch
however is the fixed watch strap there
is no changing this band so what you see
is what you get the style allows for
different watch straps which is probably
preferred because the locking mechanism
makes it feel a little too rigid and
angular the style perhaps expectedly
looks a little more generic overall
because of its lesser feature set the
rotating dials are very welcome upgrade
even if it isn't particularly new
enhancements in the Android wear
software leverage this new method of
navigation really well and reading
through notifications and scrolling in
pretty much any area is now an
unobstructed breeze the display for the
watch sport is a 1.3 8-inch 480 by 480
resolution screen compared to the 1.2
inch 3 60 by 360 resolution panel of the
style both protected by Gorilla Glass 3
the larger screen is definitely
appreciated for reading notifications
and other text elements and we had no
issues with responsiveness for either
device both of these LG watches leverage
the Snapdragon wear 2100 for power while
768 megabytes of RAM put the sport above
the 512 in the style 4 gigabytes of
storage is available for local music
playing but connectivity to Wi-Fi or
mobile networks allow for music
me speaking of mobile connectivity the
sport can use a nano SIM card for data
connections and for phone calls without
having to leverage the Bluetooth
connections it's really only something
we'd use in a pinch as the speaker and
microphone combo are basic at best all
that the watch sport is capable of comes
with an IP 68 certification that allows
it to handle 1.5 meters for 30 minutes
that said it's not supposed to be
continuously submerged so any swimmers
might not find the sport a good
companion for their laps that said the
sport does have GPS tracking for run
hikes and walks the heart rate sensor
can also stay on during these workouts
from google fit to help bolster the
fitness tracking data Android pay is new
to where 2.0 and the sport is the one
that can use it simply hit the bottom
button that opens pay at default and
hold the NFC enabled watch up to any
paid terminal to use registered credit
cards if you think paying with a phone
is fun paying very quickly using the
watch feels even more like the future
now battery life has not really been a
high point for the LG watch sport which
has a 430 milliamp hour unit compared to
the 240 in the watch style the included
charging cradle makes it work as a
landscape clock when charging but it
takes upwards of 2 hours for it to
charge which isn't ideal if you want a
top up real quick that said the style is
able to get up to a day and a half
without too much trouble
likely because it has less to power in
its lesser feature set our writer David
Amell was able to keep features like the
always-on display on and still make it
to bedtime without hitting single digits
the sport on the other hand needed more
due diligence and aod off to reach that
day and a half the new keyboard is just
one enhancement in Android wear 2.0 and
it's a wonderful addition replying to
messages from most applications allows
for the usual voice or canned responses
but there is a Google keyboard now
available for swiping text it works
really well but for some reason the
coulomb is oddly missing so I haven't
really been able to send smiley faces
though where 2.0 isn't really a drastic
change from the ground up it might feel
like it's a some notifications are no
longer cards that take up part of the
screen and then need to be swiped over
to find each option displayed one by
dam1 now each notification is its own
screen as you scroll up and tapping on
any of them shows you the full note and
every possible option this eliminates a
lot of swipes and taps leading to a very
positive move forward in the overall
quality of life apps have been given new
life on the watch itself as well as a
Play Store for just standalone apps is
now available many of the applications
you find in here are still companions to
the paired smartphone but as development
continues to support this new system
each Android wear 2.0 watch will be able
to do much more on their own Google
assistant has also made its way to the
wrist and it is a good way of getting
some quick answers and perform some
tasks this is another portion of wear
that will only get better as developers
increased assistance capabilities so
overall we're 2.0 has made a great step
forward for the wearable platform
putting it closer in competition to
other watches like the Samsung gear s 3
however that also means that it has a
price point to match the sport comes in
at $349 MB style starts at $249 which is
still a bit of a hard sell for anyone
that isn't already into smartwatches
we're 2.0 is also coming to the more
recent Android wear devices like the
Moto 360 2nd gen but it won't be coming
to first generation devices like the
first moto 360 so if you have an
original Android wear SmartWatch you
might want to go into an upgrade and
these are your first devices to choose
from all in all the LG watch sport is a
great showcase for wear 2.0 which is
itself an update that should make any
fans of Android wear really happy as
always thank you very much for watching
and I hope you enjoyed this review of
the LG watch sport and a little bit of
the watch style we do think it's a
pretty good SmartWatch and it's a great
showcase for wear 2.0 so if you are
looking for an upgrade this is one of
the watches you can choose from right
now there are a lot more coming out soon
and we might see them at MWC 2017 which
is where we are headed to right now so
keep it tuned to Andrew 30.com for that
and even more and head on over to our
YouTube channel once again to subscribe
