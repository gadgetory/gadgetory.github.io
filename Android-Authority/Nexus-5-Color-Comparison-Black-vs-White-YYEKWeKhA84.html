about the Nexus 5 is that you have a
choice between two different colors
black or white
especially when the nexus floors white
edition was really pretty short-lived
so it's Josh regard from Android thority
what's going on everybody and this is a
comparison between the two colors of the
Nexus 5 so obviously I've already had a
little bit of time with the white
version of the Nexus 5 after all it was
the one that I did a drop test for but
now that I have my hands on the black
version we're gonna take a look at it in
comparison to the white version however
before I get into that why don't you
just enjoy this little montage showing
you the two phones side-by-side
starting with the front you have the
black slate look so there's really no
change in the screen experience and
either phone however it is at the top of
these screens that there is a difference
one cool feature of either phone is that
the phone speaker grille is perforated
so it's got a nice kind of unique look
but it's even more unique on the white
version because it's white it's the only
white spot on there unless you're
looking at the notification LED that is
all the way down at the bottom and it's
almost as if the white version really
wants you to know that it's white hey yo
I'm the white version yeah we all know
that yeah just look I'm up front you can
even tell when you look at my front okay
it's when you make it over to the sides
that you begin to see more substantial
changes on the white version like I
mentioned before it uses a glossy
plastic so there might be some finger
printing that happens there and it may
be the only blemish in an otherwise nice
design of course when you're looking at
the black version of the Nexus 5 you get
the soft touch plastic that is also on
the sides as well as the back however I
do need to make another distinction here
I said in the drop test for the white
Nexus 5 that the back panel and the
glossy plastic sides have a separation
to them there's a separation in the
panel's that could make the back cover
sort of snap off and in the drop test it
kind of did luckily I was able to snap
it back in I did not think this was
going to be the case for the black
version I figured it was going to have a
soft touch plastic that would wrap
around the phone that's not the case
here so the back cover could still snap
off if you drop it the way that I did
with the white version of the phone and
finally we make it over to the back
where the most obvious changes are you
do still get the same large lens unit in
the camera and then of course the Nexus
logo in the middle that is in landscape
mode much like the Nexus 7 which is
something I really liked however it's
not just black or white there's actually
a bit of a material change here just
like you saw on the sides the black
version like we keep saying has that
soft touch plastic which is very
reminiscent of the Nexus 7 and it
actually feels really nice in the hand
not only is it soft touch it's nice and
smooth but it also provides a little bit
of grip when you have it in your hand
while it won't necessarily show
fingerprints to easily like glossy
plastic if your hands happen to be oily
they're definitely gonna show on on the
phone once we make it over to the white
version you'll notice that yes it's not
soft touch plastic but it's also a far
cry from glossy plastic it's really
somewhere in the middle the best way I
can put it is that it's a straight
plastic that is pretty reminiscent of
early HTC One S or X devices and also
the thing about the white plastic is
that even though it looks cleaner and it
won't take fingerprints nor will it take
the smudges that the soft touch plastic
might take if you track it on dirt or
something kind of dark and if it's kind
of scratches if you scrape it on a
surface it's definitely going to show a
lot easier on the white version so
that's a quick look at the white edition
versus the black edition of the Nexus 5
it is kind of hard to argue against
black soft touch plastic it just makes
the phone look really good it happens to
give it a little bit more grip and also
it's just a sleek look all around that
appeals to the all black everything that
I love on my devices however I have to
give props to the white edition because
to me it actually still looks really
nice there's a real contrast you look to
it with the black front and the white
back and even if the speaker grille on
the front is white and that is a little
weird it's still unique and I have to
give it credit for that but honestly if
the black edition was not available I
would still be happy getting the white
one instead as always thank you guys
