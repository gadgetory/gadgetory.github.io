only the Samsung Galaxy at eight but the
s8 plus TechnoBuffalo claims to have
received the hardware specs of the
samsung galaxy s 8 via an unnamed source
their leak seems to confirm most of the
rumors surrounding the phone it shows it
will have a five point eight inch Super
AMOLED quad HD display down to five
point six inches with its rounded
corners along with 64 gigabytes of
on-board storage 4 gigabytes of RAM a 12
megapixel dual pixel rear camera and an
8 megapixel front-facing shooter and an
iris scanner it also shows the phone
will have an IP 68 certification for
dust and water resistance Samsung Knox
software security Samsung pay and a
wireless charging very sweet looking
specs about what we've come to expect
now don't burn us sani now this leak
looks almost identical to the one for
the galaxy s 8 that was posted late
Wednesday by noted gadget leaker Evan
blast on his Twitter account the leak
shows that the only difference between
the s8 and the SI plus is the display
size the SI plus will have a much larger
6.2 inch screen down to 6.1 inches with
its rounded corners now we know what you
think in J's talk to me about the
battery and system-on-a-chip neither of
these two leaks talk about the two most
important parts of the s8 FA plus their
battery size and processor most
speculation says that the phones will
have the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 835
chip when sold in the US and some other
markets while Samsung's own newly
revealed Exynos 88-90 5 octa core chip
is expected to be inside the s8 and
that's a plus for the rest of the world
as far as the battery size some rumors
claim that define point 8 inch s8 will
sport a 3000 milliamp hour battery while
the SI plus will have a larger 35
hundred million power battery both
batteries will likely get a ton of
attention of both phones due to the
issues with the galaxy note 7 now
Samsung has stated that it will be
putting all phones in the future through
an eight-point battery test before
they're launched you know what I am
running out of jokes to make fun of
large
big ass bones see split to inches six
point two inches you can't even call
them fabulous anymore it's the normal
size big 5.5 inch at least now to be
considered a bona fide flagship
especially if you want to get the
respect of geeks but I get it I got
three teenagers at home and they will
spend 15 hours if I let them consuming
youtube videos and netflix on a 5-inch
phone quite comfortably no complaining I
don't know how you do that that would
feel so constrained to me I need I need
multiple tabs open at the same time I
need to use a mouse for more precision
you know I at least need a tablet for
long term media consumption educate me
explain to me how this is preferable to
you when you could have a much bigger
screen for cheaper than a flex your
phone I'm just getting old</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
