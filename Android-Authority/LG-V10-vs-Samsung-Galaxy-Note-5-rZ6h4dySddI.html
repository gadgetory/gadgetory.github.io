these two devices used to be very
similar in past years but in 2015 they
couldn't be any more different with the
v10 we have some more traditional
features that us in the android
community have come to love while the
note 5 totally refreshes these ideas to
help it compete in this market yes both
phones are great but each come with its
own huge trick up his sleeve so which is
a phone for you two contrasting designs
is probably going to be the area where
most users will immediately know which
phone is for them and now I'm not
talking about the beauty of each phone's
design more so the functionality that
each design provides samson's no 5 is
much different than his predecessor with
the battery now being sealed in and
unremovable thanks to his glass backing
this glass backing also makes for a
tougher time managing records the card
support so Samsung decided not to bother
and remove the Sitra as well now having
said all this the note 5 is a very
beautifully designed phone is much more
appealing to look at now and even feels
quite good when holding with pretty
small top and bottom bezels some almost
non-existent side bezels and the curved
glass backing the note 5 feels pretty
nice to hold even with this big 5.7 inch
screen however that glass can make the
phone feel very slippery making it even
more prone to drops and Falls but either
way you'll have to ask yourself if the
lack of removable battery and SD card
slot is worth this new beautiful design
however with the LG v10 you don't have
to worry about any of this
the v10 s backing is removable and home
to the 3000 milliamp hour battery you
can swap out for another when you're on
the go and without access to a wall
outlet also this removable backing
allows users to access a micro SD card
slot that supports up to 200 gigs of
storage so in terms of functionality and
the freedom each phone gives its users
the LG v10 is no doubt a winner and it's
going to give you a much more reliable
experience if you do indeed make use of
the SD card slot and stock up on
batteries but when it comes to the
appearance of the phone there is a price
to pay with phones that have removable
backings the LG v10 is a full millimeter
thicker than the note 5 and 21 grams
heavier but still both phones are quite
thin and light so this shouldn't make a
difference for most people usually
you would say phones with removable
backings will never compete
aesthetically with a phone that has
unibody design but with a v10 LG found a
way to keep this on versatile yet very
sleek looking you won't find any fake
leather or straight-up plastic but
instead a rubbery texture pattern that
is called dura skin this silicone like
material not only looks nice and feels
nice but it helps make the phone one of
the most comfortable phones to hold it's
very grippy and you shouldn't ever worry
about having the phone feeling secure in
your hand that's something you couldn't
say about the note 5 if this extra grip
added to the v10 isn't enough and you do
manage to drop the phone this skin helps
absorb the impact of a drop and can hold
up to most scratches on top of this the
v10 sports an SAE grade 316 L stainless
steel frame that also plays a big part
in keeping the phone from showing those
nasty scratches all of these features
come together to give the LG v10 a
military certified shock resistant
rating of 810 G its build quality is
very impressive to say the least
this 5.7 inch Sean definitely takes the
cake over the note 5 when it comes to
design even though aesthetically it's up
to personal preference both devices make
them most of the technology they use
when it comes to display you're not
going to find a better IPS display or a
better AMOLED display on the market
right now when it comes to smartphones
the LG v10 has a 5.7 inch quantum quad
HD IPS display while the note 5 has a
5.7 inch Super AMOLED quad HD display
both displays make for fantastic video
watching experience or any type of media
consumption for that matter but you're
going to love either display as they are
the best of their class while the v10
uses an IPS LCD panel where a single
back light shines through to light up
the screen then no 5 pixels individually
light up to allow for dark areas to shut
off creating true blacks for a more
immersive experience that being said the
v10 display is still quite good and
really outperforms most LCD panels when
it comes to displaying blacks they're
really dark here too but of course not
as much as a note 5s really the no 5s
display is no match for any smart phone
out there right now if you want the best
quad HD display in a smart phone you're
looking at the clear winner right here
sure the whites may be a little warmer
than the V tens but the colors are much
more vibrant and really pop almost too
much I would think for some people but
you can always change into settings and
when comparing photos side by side
you're most likely
prefer the more saturated colors on the
no.5 but is worth noting that the no.5
takes better advantage of his screen by
decreasing the DPI to 560 to fit more
onto the screen you'll notice the icons
and words appear larger on the v10
thanks to a CPI set at 640 which is a
little unfortunate I think as things
appearing on the screen unnecessarily
take up much more room while LG manages
to make the best IPS display Samsung
managed to make the best AMOLED display
and most will find AMOLED to be a clear
winner here now while we're talking
about displays let's talk about the
crazy tricks these two devices have up
their sleeves starting with the LG v10
yes this phone has two displays the one
we just talked about and thus much
smaller one this is at the top it's an
entirely separate screen and only takes
up about 70% of the width of the main
screen ending when it comes to the
front-facing cameras this little display
is great for displaying notifications in
full detail without taking away from the
main screen you can also set up app
shortcuts to launch very fast and are
accessible at any time within the
majority of apps it's a little strange
yet but it's definitely helpful also
while the main screen is off the second
display stays on displaying notification
icons so you can always see what you've
missed from a distance it kind of
reminds me of something similar to a
moto display but of course this may be a
little gimmicky to some people and so
far well I do think it's an interesting
idea I haven't been able to justify the
extra space it takes up over its
functionality when it comes to the note
5 we have the beloved S Pen this is
comfortably in its port on the bottom
right of the phone simply push in and
the pen will spring out with nice haptic
feedback if your screen is off and you
do this you'll be greeted with a black
drawing board where you can easily take
down notes or draw pictures this is
extremely helpful when you need to jot
down an idea on the fly without
unlocking your phone and going into an
app and when you're done with your note
simply push the pen back into its cradle
the correct way and your note will
automatically save and the screen will
shut off while the phone is on we can
have even more fun with the s-pen like
of course drawing on the screen which is
helpful for sending instructions users
can also crop areas of images to sent to
friends or coworkers and even capture
along images in one screenshot there's
all sorts of features like this when it
comes to the s-pen really making the no5
feel more like the go-to phone for
getting work done both phones have
fingerprint scanners
I'd say both work just as well as the
other the no flies is located on the
front which is great for trying to
unlock the phone one is sitting on a
desk but when holding the phone is going
to be a little more awkward than the v10
scanner this is on the back and while
they're both fast and reliable they're
not as fast and reliable as a scanner
that you'd find on the new Nexus phones
but they really work great though and
we're equally as well when it comes to
normal hardware features like speakers
both phones place tears on the bottom
right which makes them easy to cover up
but the LG v10 speaker is much louder
and although neither has fantastic sound
quality the v10 is able to offer better
highs making for an overall clearer and
brighter sound now when plugging in
headphones for real audio listening the
LG v10 is also the winner here since it
supports 32-bit hi-fi DAC audio from ESS
technology internally the LG v10 sports
a Snapdragon 808 processor while the
note 5 goes with an Exynos 7420 both
phones have 4 gigs of RAM and while the
v10 only comes in 64 gigs of storage the
note 5 has three storage options at 32
64 and 128 but remember you do not have
an option for expandable storage here
when throwing both devices through
Geekbench the note 5 performed with much
higher results at around four thousand
seven hundred points over the v10 3500
although antutu squared the v10 a little
higher by about a thousand points both
the v10 and no 5 are running Android
lollipop 5.1.1 with their own pretty
heavy skins on top visually they appear
to be very similar with simplified
notification pull downs and quick
shortcut so you can customize both are
capable of dual window support which is
great given the big 5.7 inch displays
found here and launching apps on either
device is quite fast although even with
4 gigs of ram found on both devices the
note 5 still seems to not be able to
manage its RAM as well as a V tens apps
in the recent apps screen seem to reload
much more often than the v10 or even
most phones I've used and on certain
occasions my note 5 was stutter or
freeze for a couple seconds when I'm not
using the phone for a while
however gaming on the note 5 does seem
to be a better experience in terms of
low times and frame rates but the v10 is
not too far behind that being said both
phones deliver unique and for the most
part good software experiences but I'll
lean a little more towards a v10 as it
seemed to be the most reliable in my
weeks of testing these two phones have
some of the best
cameras on the market right now so
whichever one you choose you're going to
fall in love with either camera but that
doesn't mean they take similar pictures
they're both great but in their own
unique ways both are 16 megapixels with
the lgb 10 having a slightly faster
aperture of 1.8 and both do have optical
image stabilization but the v10 has
laser autofocus and in testing actually
does focus faster than the no.5 so let's
get down to those pictures outdoors both
cameras perform exceptionally well with
little differences from each other the
note 5 has a bit more contrast and color
to the images which does come down to
personal preference but I think that
extra boost from the post-processing is
quite appealing in my opinion although
yes this does mean you will lose a lot
of information in the darker areas of
the photos colors are more towards a
warmer side with the no.5 while the v10
is a little cooler with less saturated
colors often capturing a more accurate
representation of the scene that doesn't
mean this camera is necessarily better
or worse than the no.5 it all depends on
how you're going to be using these
photos if you want to quickly snap a
beautiful photo without having to tinker
with any settings you're going to love
the vibrant colors higher contrast and
sharper images on the note 5 especially
since the no 5s camera launches much
faster than the v10 s and the picture is
immediately taken when you snap that
shutter button every single time the v10
s has trouble sometimes mostly in darker
areas and you may have to wait a good 2
to 3 seconds until it actually takes a
photo however if you want a more
accurate and realistic photo with lots
of room for editing the v10 is going to
be your best bet
with optical image stabilization your
videos will be a lot smoother than usual
with the note 5 having a bit more shake
to it the v10 decides it wants to focus
more often than the note 5 but when it
does it does it a lot faster with this
laser autofocus
however the V tens video is in a totally
different league than the note 5 or
really any phone for that matter with
this full manual controls is very
similar to the controls in manual photo
mode except of a few new additions
including a stereo sound level to view
audio and an audio controller where you
can tell the v10 if the audio is coming
from behind or in front of the phone to
help with some noise cancellation the
front-facing cameras on these two
devices are great in their own ways the
note 5 has a single white
lenz that helps are getting everything
in the shot while the v10 has to selfie
cams a wide-angle lens and another that
is able to get a closer shot and the V
tends wide-angle lens is super wide
angled which creates a more fish-eyed
look it's able to get a lot more in the
frame and really is incredible and fun
to have in a smartphone
once again the note 5 creates are much
more contrast the image with lots of
post-processing to reduce noise the v10
shows lots of artifacts even in the
brightest of light but still looks good
and in low-light the v10 is a clear
winner even with a lot more noise in a
darker photo the v10 creates a crisp
image with much more detail over the no
5s almost airbrushed look both cameras
are a close match but with the v10
having much better video quality video
features better front-facing camera and
more realistic photos that photographers
will love I would pick the v10 here just
by hair and really this will come down
to preference as they are just so close
finally when it comes to the end of the
day which phone is going to need a
charge first well both phones carry
three dozen million power batteries
inside of them however the note 5 seems
to last the longest which is no surprise
as the note 5 has some of the best
battery life for a battery of its size
out there right now for my normal usage
I minute to get around four and a half
hours of screen on time and for me
that's more than enough for a full day
the v10 lasts me a little less getting
very close to 4 hours but not quite
making it usually but still that can
last me an entire day most of the time
you do have to keep in mind though that
the v10 s battery is removable so you
could always have an already charged one
in your pocket to swap out on the go
however both phones are capable of fast
charging overall is going to be a tough
decision to make
like I said at the beginning of this
video you're probably going to be
convinced by one of these devices
depending on their design language are
you a person who takes advantage of
removable batteries and microSD card
slots if you are the LG v10 is
definitely the phone for you and if
you're not still the LG v10 seems to do
the majority of the things that they no
five can do a tiny bit better slightly
better camera slightly better
performance in RAM management much
better audio and much more durable and
of course the removable battery and
microSD card slot can help even for
those who don't perceive it as a main
selling point sure the note 5 screen is
slightly
and overall has a much more beautiful
and premium design but with the freedom
users can have with the lgb 10 it's most
likely going to be the one that most
people would enjoy more well there you
have it the v10 versus in note 5 thanks
for watching as always comment below and
let me know which of these two phones
you prefer also check out these other
cool videos on the side here and don't
forget to get our angular 30 app and the
