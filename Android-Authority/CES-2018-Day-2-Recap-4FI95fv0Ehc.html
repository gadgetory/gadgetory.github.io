we just got back from day two of CES
2018 and we wanted to share a few cool
things we saw at the show today now they
might not all be Android related but
this show is about a whole lot more than
that so buckle up and let's get started
vipro is a new headset from HTC which
takes the original concept and makes it
better than ever it bumps the resolution
up by 77% so you can see much more
clearly in your virtual world and it
improves the headphones to give you a
much more immersive experience even
announced a first-party wireless adapter
so you can go cable free look for it
later this year
DGI is probably best known for its
high-end drones and Ronin gibble the
Ronin s is a new handheld gimbal sitting
between the Ronin M and the Osmo mobile
it's quite obviously a DJI product even
though this is a one-handed gimbal it's
got tons of capabilities it can hold
even the heaviest consumer camera lens
combos and comes in a sleek all-black
package make sure to keep your eye out
if you don't know what tile is it's a
little Bluetooth tag that you stick on
things so you don't lose them uses mesh
networking technology to talk to other
tiles in a certain range and if you lose
things other tiles will let you know
that they saw them when they pass by
tile is now integrating this technology
into things like key fobs and headphones
so you'll be able to find things without
attaching one physically
the JBL link view is a new google
assistant powered speaker with a screen
it looks a little bit like you broke an
egg open to reveal its touched
capacitive capabilities but JBL has
always been known for its phenomenal
sound quality so this will probably fit
great in any home
Samsung showed off a ton of concept
products this year including micro LED
technology and even a modular TV system
they're calling the wall even though
this wasn't the Galaxy S nine we're
happy to see some other things that
Samsung's doing these days finally we
made sure to slide over to all the crazy
Google assistant boots at the show this
year Google turned up with an absolutely
massive presence in 2018 and we're glad
to see they're finally connecting with
the average consumer Google was
everywhere at CES</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
