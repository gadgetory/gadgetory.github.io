Youngberg here from Android authorities
calm your number one source for all
things Android and today we're gonna be
checking out the best screen protectors
for the samsung galaxy s4 smartphone so
today I've selected five different
brands of screen protectors each with
different qualities to show you the
broad range of protection options you
have for you Samsung Galaxy s4 the first
screen protector is the spigen SPG Stein
Hill series in the ultimate clarity
model this comes with two screen
protectors dust removing stickers a
squeegee and electronics cleaning cloth
the first step in installing the screen
protector is to clean the screen with
the included cloth you're gonna want to
do this with clean hands so you don't
get any oils or dust from your fingers
on the screen you can also use the
included dust removal stickers to remove
any large debris from the screen just so
you don't get any air bubbles or any
debris trapped under the new screen
protector next you're going to want to
remove one of the screen protectors from
the package next you'll want to remove
the plastic backing on the screen
protector to expose the adhesive side of
the protector you're going to put the
adhesive side down with the front
surface side facing upwards and then
smooth out any initial air bubbles with
your finger or the squeegee you can
usually get most of them with your
finger before you actually pull up the
front surface plastic next you'll grab
the front surface plastic and peel it
upwards you can see that there are still
some air bubbles but then you use your
squeegee to work them out gently working
towards the sides of the device towards
the bezel the steinhouse series comes in
four different models including the
ultra crystal ultra oleophobic ultra
fine and ultra optics models and as you
can see the ultra crystal is very very
true to its name although it does
capture some of the glare of the Sun it
is a very very lightweight and clear
screen protector that offers great
optimization for video viewing and all
of your beautiful 1080p display then the
ultra crystal model is available for $14
next up we have our screen where screen
protector for the GS 4 this is a very
basic screen protector and it comes with
a cleaning cloth a squeegee and one
screen protector just like with the
spigen you want to clean off your screen
before installing then you'll also want
to remove the backing plastic from the
adhesive
the screen protector after removing it i
used the home button to line up the
screen protector and then set it
facedown to install it was fairly easy
although the bottom did have a little
bit of lifting on the edges I worked out
the bubbles with my finger at first and
then I used the included squeegee after
pulling off the top layer of plastic so
you can see it sets a little bit more
firm after the top layer is gone using
the squeegee I just pushed out towards
the bezel to remove most of the air
bubbles although most of them came out
some of them did it remain under the
screen protector you can see on the
bottom right near the home button where
I could not remove one of the bubbles
but the screen protector does look
excellent on the gs4 and it provides a
very crystal clear viewing experience
even see right there I did remove it
just a little bit with my finger but it
did not come out all the way it's a
little extra work you can get all of
them anyways this is a very nice screen
protector that offers great protection
it is pretty dang thick in the hands and
you're not going to puncture it next up
we're checking out our case-mate HD
screen protector like the others it
comes with an installation card one
screen protector and a cleaning cloth I
use the cleaning cloth as I do at the
start of every installation and then I
was ready to install the protector now
this protector is an anti-glare
featuring screen protector so it does
protect against a lot of the sun's
glares and still gives you an HD viewing
panel you'll remove the top piece of
plastic to expose the adhesive side like
all of our other screen protectors so
far and line it up just like we did in
the past it's a little bit tricky but as
you can see you get the hang of it after
a few installations this had very
minimal amount of air bubbles after I
installed it and the squeegee is pretty
brittle it's made out of cardboard as
opposed to the plastic squeegees in the
other installations now as you can see
it looks very great installed it is
preventing a lot of the glare that's
coming in through the window of my house
here and as you can see I turn the phone
from left to right it does a great job
at protecting against the glare it's
available for around 15 dollars so pick
it up if you're looking for a great anti
glare screen protector next up we've got
our moon
screen protectors for the gs4 one is
glossy and one is the matte finish we
have our usual installation procedure
including these cleaning of the screen
usually don't power the device off
unless you have a wet application screen
protector which these are not anyways
we're gonna go ahead and install the
matte finish screen protector like most
in our lineup we just remove the front
plastic to expose the adhesive side and
line it up with the home button you can
also line it up with these sensors on
top or the speaker as well but I prefer
the home button and working out a few of
the bubbles you can see that I did apply
it just a little bit on the bezel so
we're not going to get a full nice
application of the screen protector but
it's still going to serve its purpose
and prevent glare from the screen of the
device it comes with a nice firm
installation card made out of durable
plastic which allows you to get the
bubbles out just perfectly and after
getting most of the bubbles out you can
see that it does work perfectly around
the edge there like I said my little
mishap occurred but it does look awesome
on the screen of a Galaxy s4 and to be
honest it looks a little bit better than
the case-mate HD screen protector in my
opinion you can see that is preventing
the glare and it does not have just as
pixely of a display when using the movie
protectors these are available for
$15.99 and the gloss finish looks
exactly like the others in the lineup
that do not offer the anti glare and
last but certainly not least we're
checking out our invisible shield screen
protector I opted to not use the full
body coverage because I just wanted to
focus on screen protection in this video
the first step in installing is powering
your device off because this is a wet
application screen protector we're going
to clean it off extra carefully using
our included cleaning cloth
and especially in this case we're going
to want to make sure we don't have any
oils on our fingers
next we spray some of the application
fluid directly onto the hand that we're
going to be holding and peeling up the
zag from its backing with just so we
don't get any fingerprints on the zag
before it's installed and we'll peel it
up from the edge
it is very malleable texture because it
is military-grade protection and it was
used to coat helicopter wings for the
military
next we grab our application solution
and we never spray it directly on the
face of the device but we will spray it
on the very backing of the zag invisible
shield here we don't need too much just
a few pumps and we're ready to install
the protector on the screen we're gonna
want to keep a clean surface and just
like any of the other screen protectors
we're going to line it up with the home
key or any of our other sensors or
landmark features of a device to get it
installed the strong rubber squeegee
bends perfectly to the zag invisible
shield and you can see we'll just start
to work out our solution onto the sides
and the bezel at the vise as we install
the screen protector we'll clean up the
excess application solution coming out
the edge with the included cleaning
cloth and as you can see after its
installed there is a bit of orange
peeling going on but that smooths out
after 72 hours you typically don't want
to turn your phone on for another 24
hours after installing but I did it just
for the sake of showing you what the
display is like underneath the zag as
you can see it is a bit orange peeling
and there are some blemishes where I use
the squeegee too hard but it offers the
greatest protection in my opinion out of
all of the screen protectors we've
checked out you can see it looks pretty
dang nice and it fits the entire top and
entire bezel of the device here covering
up the sensors and also exposing the
home button so you can still use it and
it's not getting stuck under the plastic
of the Zagg now it does not have any
anti glare properties but it's available
for $15.99 which is a great price for
this zag invisible shield protection and
that's it folks and spend our roundup of
our great screen protectors for the
samsung galaxy s4 we also want to give a
huge shout out to mobile phone comm for
providing us with all these protectors
check them out for all your screen
protector needs guys and as always this
is clay
