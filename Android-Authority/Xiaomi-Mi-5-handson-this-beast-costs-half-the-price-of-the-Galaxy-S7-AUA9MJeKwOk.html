and I'm coming to you live from mobile
Congress 2016 and we're taking a look at
the Xiaomi me5 this will be one of the
first devices to market with a
snapdragon 820 processor
it'll also come with three gigabytes of
RAM and 32 or 64 gigs of internal
storage there's also a pro version of
the phone that shipped with four gigs of
RAM 828 gigabytes of storage and a
ceramic backing inside of the me 5 is a
pretty hefty 3000 milliamp hour battery
that should provide for some decent
battery life and with support for USB
type-c on the bottom and a Snapdragon
820 on board the me 5 is capable of
taking advantage of Qualcomm quick
charge 3.0 the phone looks pretty
familiar to other Xiaomi devices like
the me note with glass on the front and
rear and metal that wraps around the
sides the back side has Shou meets 3d
glass which is just a fancy term for
glass that tapers down on the edges
similar to what we've seen on the galaxy
note 5 and previous Xiaomi phones like
mini glass made phones it's a big
fingerprint magnet but it feels quite
sturdy and has a relatively small
footprint compared to a lot of other
phones thanks to its 5.1 inch display
and thin side bezels on the left and
right the screen is a 1080p IPS LCD
panel so it's not quad HD like a lot of
other flagships that are getting ready
to hit the market but on first blush it
looks quite good colors are vibrant and
saturated viewing angles are nice and it
seems to get pretty bright below the
display you'll notice a physical home
button which is not typical for Xiaomi
but this added home button also brings a
fingerprint sensor to the me5 the camera
on the front comes in at 4 megapixels
while the main camera on the rear is a
16 megapixel sensor with phase detection
optical image stabilization and eff 2.0
aperture obviously we can't really judge
the quality of it just yet but the UI
looks simple enough and the shutter
speed was actually surprisingly fast the
software is Android 6.0 marshmallow with
shout means me why interface on top if
you're not familiar with it it's pretty
similar to other Chinese OEM skins with
colorful squared-off icons and the lack
of an app drawer but you will get all of
Xiaomi services and features like the
integrated theme store for changing up
the look and feel of the interface the
Xiaomi 5 is going
to be available in China starting March
1st and other countries like India
shortly after for $260 for the regular
model and $350 for the ceramic version
with such an affordable price tag top
and line specs and a solid design the me
5 is going to be quite the contender now
all we need is for this phone is somehow
make its way to the states and that's
going to do it for this quick hands-on
of the Xiaomi 5 for more in-depth
