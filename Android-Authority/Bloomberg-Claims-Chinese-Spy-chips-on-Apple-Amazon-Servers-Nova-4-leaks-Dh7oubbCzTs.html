being lied to
you don't know how and you may not know
why but you know something just
something just smells off then that's
how I kind of feel today and I wanted to
go back and cover news that's four or
five days old but my goodness we got a
clear summer bloomberg published a very
dangerous report regarding the security
of data centers belonging to both Amazon
and Apple the report alleges that the
data centers Hardware was purchased from
a Chinese company called Super Micro and
it included Chinese spy chips that put
the security of the networks at risk
including of course all the data flowing
through Amazon and Apple servers
according to the Bloomberg report
Chinese spies could have used the chips
to monitor the company's information as
it passed through its network this could
have included intellectual property
information trade secrets among other
things both Amazon and Apple vehemently
denied these reports Apple which issued
a strongly worded statement had this to
say we are deeply disappointed that in
their dealings with us Bloomberg
reporters have not been open to the
possibility that they or their sources
might be wrong or misinformed our best
guess is that they are confusing their
story whether previously reported 2016
incident in which we discovered an
infected driver on a single super micro
server in one of our labs this one time
event was determined to be accidental
and not a targeted attack against Apple
Amazon Web Services also strongly denied
these claims saying that they were
inaccurate saying that they found no
evidence to support these claims but
there has been an update to this and we
got to talk about it
according to Engadget a third party
security team found no evidence of
Chinese spy chips and super micro
servers used by Apple this seems to some
to nullify claims made in the Bloomberg
report that Chinese spy chips put the
security of Apple's and Amazon's servers
at risk you see this is what concerns me
so much and it really should I think
concern you too when we are talking
about potentially massive violations
that affects
billions of people half the planet at
least when you're talking about
potentially I'm not saying that they
actually did this but one country spying
on private enterprises that affect so
many people when this is reported on we
needs to be done in a way that's
transparent and verifiable transparent
and verifiable meaning that if I tell
you something as true as someone in the
tech news space
hopefully it's I'm saying it in such a
way or I'm giving you the information
that you can verify that you can check
up for yourself or that you can judge
for yourself but that's not what's
happening here we're being told that a
third party auditing team did an
investigation well who is that team I
had to dig for that information it turns
out to be NAR della and company which
lends some credibility to it because
they were willing to put their
reputation on the line so there is that
I got to give him that but we don't know
the terms of this audit how was it
investigated why is there no more talk
about it why isn't there a government
agency putting a team in there to
investigate that that would lend more
credibility to it because this is some
scary scary stuff these massive
companies like Apple and Amazon are
hugely incentivized and motivated to
hide information like this to fight it
I'm not saying this is actually
happening maybe it is maybe it is it
that's the problem we don't have enough
information to know if this is
legitimate or not and that is not
acceptable and when you look across the
news all over the place in tech news -
you get little bits of information and
you know what's happening when they do
that your narrative your thoughts your
views on a really important topic are
being manipulated you're not allowed to
judge for yourself what's really going
on because you're not given enough
information and that upsets me and it
should upset you - what do you think
about it let me know in the comments
below or on Twitter boom okay now that
I've calmed down a bit let's talk about
something totally frivolous leaks then
I'm talking about the huawei Nova four
and the leaks here show off the circular
camera cutout that we've come to know
and salivate over the cutter eliminates
the need for the dreaded notch though
you'll notice that the chins bezels are
still slightly larger than the side and
top
that's because the chin is presumably
where the sensors and the antennas live
there's room up top for an earpiece but
not much else around the back is a
triple camera setup and fingerprint
sensor the most expensive Nova for
reportedly features a 48 megapixel
primary camera the less expensive
variants reportedly make do with a 20
megapixel main sensor elsewhere the Nova
form reportedly features a six point
four inch display with Full HD plus
resolution and 19:25 9 aspect ratio a
twenty five megapixel selfie camera
Huawei is cure a 90-70 processor eight
gigabytes of RAM 128 gigabytes of
storage and a 3750 milliamp hour battery
the Nova four might support 18 watt
wired fast charging it is expected that
the Nova four will launch just a few
days from now on December 17th in China
you know what software starts do things
it's not supposed to do who solves those
problems
