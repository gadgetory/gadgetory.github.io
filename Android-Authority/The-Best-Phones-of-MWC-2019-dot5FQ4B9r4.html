all about phones there have been a ton
of new devices released this year and
this is actually a lot more exciting
than a lot of other em WCS that we've
been to before and that's mostly for a
couple of reasons and number one is
actually the first best phone on our
list that is the huawei mate X foldable
phone so here anybody see we saw it's a
bunch of foldable phones already we've
got the Galaxy fold we've got the huawei
mate X but the Huawei matrix really
stands out because of that massive 8
inch display that it shows we can
actually fold the device out when you
have it closed it still got a really
huge display so it's basically like a
large smartphone it folds out into a big
tablet and we thought this might be a
little gimmicky but after actually
playing with it for a little bit it
feels really premium and we're excited
for this to come out later this year
alright so next on our list is the
galaxy s 10 and S 10 plus and I know
technically these devices didn't
actually release at MWC 2019 they
released if Samsung unpacked which was
like two days before MBC 2019 actually
started however Samsung was clearly
trying to get everyone to want to
actually use these phones at MWC in
Barcelona I'm taking photos I'm testing
the device during this trade show and
honestly a trade show is the kind of
event that you'd want to test it at now
the Galaxy S 10 and Galaxy S 10 plus are
pretty much the apex of Samsung's phones
that they've made so far their design is
absolutely beautiful the camera system
is amazing and I'm still in the review
process but so far I can see this phone
as being one of the best phones of 2019
already so the third phone on this list
is the Nokia 9 PureView with those five
cameras that it's got on the back of the
phone and we see this phone leaked for
like months now but it's finally come
here now it does have a snapdragon 845
processor but the big thing about this
phone is those five cameras on the back
we've got these three monochrome sensors
that can capture 2.9 times as much light
as a regular camera sensor and it's got
to RGB sensors that actually really take
the image this results in a ton of
detail and are actually partnering with
the company lights who made the light
elf 16 to make this just insane extreme
camera phone system now we haven't set
the device in hand yet but we are really
excited to test this out I personally
love photography and I really want to
see what this phone can do
just a quick note that our MWC coverage
is brought to you by digit daily your
daily dose of tech straight to your
inbox check out the description below to
learn more next we've got these yummy
mix 3 5g and what's actually kind of
exciting about this phone is that it's
still relatively affordable now 5g is
another major thing that we've seen here
at MWC 2019 and all the 5g phones that
have been releasing so far at least
being announced are really really
expensive the huawei mate X foldable
phone is over $2,000 because it has 5g
and that's just crazy
but what Yummie is doing is just taking
the me mix three which we've seen
already adding a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855
downplaying the storage just a little
bit adding 5g and it's only about 150 to
180 dollars more than the traditional me
mix 3 which only released like four
months ago so it's gonna be a really
cool product we are stoked for this
device to come out in the coming months
alright and the last one on the list is
a company that we don't see on our best
list very often but this is Sony with
the Xperia one and this one just seems
really interesting from all angles a big
point about this phone is that Sony is
moving to this 21 by 9 aspect ratio
which is really a cinema aspect ratio
that you see in a lot of movies well
it's actually cool about this device is
it can also shoot video and photos in 20
mine by 9s as well and it can shoot in
4k HDR 10 now the screen is also a 4k
HDR 10 panel and so in that way you're
kind of able to take images from the
bravia team you're able to take this
prowess that they have from all
different aspects of Sony cram it into
one phone and make what is truly a Sony
phone and we still haven't really been
able to play with this phone yet we mess
with the body but couldn't get the
software working or really excited to
play with this in the next couple of
months we should be getting it around
April alright well that's been it for
our best phones of MWC 2019 there was a
ton more stuff released here so if you
want to see all the news make sure you
go to android authority comm make sure
you stay tuned to our youtube channel we
have got everything MWC 20-19 over there
and I will catch you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
