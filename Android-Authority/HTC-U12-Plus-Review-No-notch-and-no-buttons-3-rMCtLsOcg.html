smartphone manufacturer no matter how
big or how small is trying to find
different or unique ways to make their
products stand out from the competition
this is the you 12 plus it's HTC's take
on what that different or unique thing
should be and it has some pretty
interesting ideas but it doesn't
necessarily execute it flawlessly so I
want to start off this review by talking
about what makes the you 12 plus
different and there's a few different
things one is the design two is the edge
sense technology and three is the
cameras but let's start with the design
first at first glance the u12 plus looks
pretty similar to a lot of other
smartphones on the market it has glass
on the front glass on the back and a
metal frame that wraps around the sides
which is something that a ton of
manufacturers are doing but what makes
it you two a plus a little bit different
is that it has some unique color options
like this transparent blue version that
actually lets you see some of the
phone's internals on the backside which
is a pretty cool effect it kind of gives
the phone a little bit more of an
industrial look and the design is pretty
attractive overall it has rounded
corners and a curved backside that makes
it pretty comfortable to hold and the
build quality is excellent just like you
would expect from the HTC device at this
point the u2l plus has the edge Sense
technology that was first introduced on
the U 11 so you can still squeeze the
phone to access different shortcuts like
Google Assistant the camera the
flashlight or pretty much anything that
you want but now you can actually double
tap on either the left or right side to
access an additional shortcut by default
it's set to one handed mode and if you
like one handed mode it's there but if
you don't you can change it to whatever
you want I personally have mine set to
taking a screenshot which I find to be
much more useful but the real kicker
here is the buttons on the side of this
phone the buttons are no longer real
physical clicking buttons like you
normally expect on other Android
smartphones these buttons are solid
state buttons so they don't actually
move or depress and they're basically
just pressure-sensitive I like the idea
that HTC has behind these
pressure-sensitive buttons but the
execution isn't quite there yet
I assume that these buttons are meant to
feel natural and they're supposed to
mimic real physical clicking buttons but
they don't necessarily feel that way
it's not like apples forced touch where
the trackpad on a MacBook Pro feels like
a real clicking trackpad even though
nothing's actually moving these buttons
just feel like buttons that are
vibrating when you press on them and
they don't really feel natural hopefully
that's something that HTC can address
what they software update or maybe in
future versions of their smartphones the
biggest flaw with these buttons though
is that you can't actually register
multiple button presses at the same time
so pressing volume down and power to
take a screenshot like you normally
would on any other Android phone doesn't
work so that sort of ties back into why
I use the DoubleTap on the sides to take
a screenshot and so far that's really
the only workaround that I found like a
lot of other smart phones the Utah plus
has dual cameras but not only does it
have dual cameras on the rear it also
has dual cameras on the front and the
two front facing cameras are 8
megapixels @f 2.0 and because you have a
secondary sensor this allows for
portrait mode and equality of the
portrait mode doesn't really seem any
better or worse than other smartphones
with portrait mode on the front facing
camera but the dual sensors do allow you
to change the iboga before and after the
fact which is something that portrait
mode on other smartphones don't always
offer as far as the rear cameras are
concerned you have a primary 12
megapixel sensor at F 1.8 with optical
image stabilization and a secondary 16
megapixel sensor at F 2.6 and this
allows for 2 X optical zoom and of
course portrait mode because everybody
loves portrait mode picture quality from
the rear cameras low is actually pretty
good details are crisp and sharp colors
are nice and vibrant and dynamic range
is decent but it does have the tendency
to overexpose and you notice this a lot
when shooting in low-light you get a lot
of overexposed highlights with a lot of
blooming and lens flare effects but
generally low-light shots are well above
average I would say there's still a lot
of detail not a whole lot of noise and
white balance is also pretty good when
shooting
lowlight the Utah plus is a flagship
phone obviously so it has all these
specs that you would want out of a 20-18
flagship inside there's a Snapdragon 845
processor with six gigabytes of RAM
which provides for very fast performance
I haven't had any issues with lag it's
been a very fluid and responsive
smartphone it's also ip68 water and dust
resistance there's a fingerprint sensor
that's very conveniently placed on the
back side and it also has a micro SD
card slot for expandable storage
unfortunately there's no headphone jack
but the u11 didn't have a headphone jack
either so it's not really all that
surprising that the u12 plus doesn't
have a headphone jack but HTC does
include their USB type-c use sonic
earbuds included in the box and I
actually really like these earbuds I
enjoyed them quite a bit onto you 11
they sound fantastic and they're also
noise cancelling so I enjoy them just as
much on the you 12 plus I would say the
most disappointing thing about the you
12 plus is its battery life I'm only
averaging around 3 hours of screen on
time maybe 4 if I'm lucky and that's
pretty underwhelming considering it has
a decent size 3500 milliamp hour battery
and it also doesn't have wireless
charging even though it has that glass
back on the front that you 12 plus has a
6 inch 18 by 9 display with quad HD
resolution and it uses Super LCD 6
technology and the screen itself is very
colorful very vibrant it has fantastic
viewing angles and it gets plenty bright
that seeing it outdoors in direct
sunlight was not really an issue the
screen itself also has pretty thin
bezels on the sides and the top and
bottom bezels are not really that big
either and the best part is it doesn't
have a notch so if you really hate
notches the u12 plus is going to be one
of the few options that you have this
year without a notch on the software
side of things you're looking at android
8.0 Oreo with HTC Sense on top and I'm a
pretty big fan of cents I think it's one
of the better skins out there it's not
cartoony looking it has a very nice and
modern look to it it's simple and easy
to navigate and ever since HTC got rid
of a lot of the duke the applications
it's been a very clean experience one of
the newest features of sense that I
really appreciate if the smart rotate
and this will rotate your phone based on
how you hold the phone instead of the
phone's actual orientation so if you're
holding the phone in portrait it will
always stay in portrait but if you
change your grip to a more landscape
style grip then it will change to
landscape and this is a total lifesaver
if you're laying down in bed or laying
on the couch and you don't want your
phone to automatically rotate this is a
feature that I know a ton of people are
really gonna like if you want to buy the
Utah plus it's available as an unlock
device for 849 dollars which is a pretty
hefty flagship price but its competitive
to the galaxy s 9 and also the iPhone
and I think it has a lot of things going
for it to justify that price tag it has
fantastic build quality a really nice
screen dual cameras on the front and
rear and also some pretty cool stuff
with the edge Sense technology even
though it isn't quite perfect it's
probably going to be another smartphone
that gets swept under the radar because
it's not being sold through carrier
stores but if you're looking for a smart
phone with a modern design and a lot of
modern features and a display that
doesn't have a notch
the Utah plus is definitely worth the
look so that pretty much wraps up this
