what's going on everybody and this is
the Samsung gear s three larger than the
gear s2 this is a SmartWatch that is
actually a little bit hard to recommend
for people with smaller wrists that said
however this 46 millimeter body casing
is one of the best-looking smartwatches
in the market right now and it's
stainless steel construction is backed
by an IP certification and
military-grade protection to add to that
recognization the gear s three comes
with a silicon band that can be easily
changed to buttons on the right side
help navigate among the screens and the
various apps that can be installed via
the gear manager moving around in the
interface can be done via the full touch
screen however it takes a backseat to
the rotating cliquey bezel very little
effort is required to rotate it and it
Scrolls accurately and wonderfully
through all of the different Tizen
elements it's one of the most unique and
best tactile experiences and smart
wearables today the gear s3 frontier
Edition which we are sporting on this
review is actually able to fit in with
formal casual and fitness attire alike
though it pushes the boundary with some
streamlined
exercise outfits the 1.3 inch OLED
display is covered in Gorilla Glass sr+
and provides great colors and brightness
making Tizen accessible and easy on the
eyes turning the always-on display
toggle on allows for the selected watch
face to change to a darker less busy
version when the watch is in standby
this does cut into the battery life a
little bit but not so much thanks to the
OLED screen there simply no getting
around it
this is the best way to look at and read
notifications on any Smart Watch today
not just because of the good display but
because the rotating bezel makes it a
breeze to squirrel down the larger
blocks of text or even some pictures
that come through in messengers like
hangouts annex II no 72 70 powers the
device and despite some bugs that we
noticed in mostly third-party
applications downloaded in the gear
manager performance on the gear s 3 has
been snappy and reliable there's also
four gigabytes of on-board storage so
you can put some music into the watch
itself and use bluetooth headsets in
order to listen to it locally the
battery in the gear s3 frontier is a 380
million powered unit that can go for up
to two days but with enough rigorous
usage you can get more to the territory
of a day
1/2 the included wireless charger is
magnetic making it easy to dock the
watch at least once a day which plenty
of heavy users will probably have to do
we got to use a 4G enabled version of
the gear s3 frontier which requires a
$10 SmartWatch Wireless plan on 18 T or
t-mobile but we're not big fans are
paying more monthly it does add a few
more functions it's all like having a
walkie-talkie strapped on your wrist as
the watch is able to take calls via the
speaker and microphone combo but even in
semi loud environments it can be a bit
tough to hear the call and at that point
you're just yelling at your wrist
otherwise setting up the gear s3 and the
gear manager properly allows for syncing
of notifications between the two devices
whether or not you're on Wi-Fi somewhere
else with the gear s3 or using the
wireless plan that you buy every month
samsung pay is a big addition to the
gear s3 and essentially it takes the
setup from the phone and transfers the
data over to the watch which is enabled
for payments at various stations across
major stores it works well enough and is
a nice conversation starter finally we
have Tizen OS which has grown since the
gear s2 and now there are a lot of
applications available in the gear
manager however full third-party support
for apps that you might use on let's say
Android wear are still missing here some
apps that are in there happened to have
some bugs like for example sleep as
Android which was not able to track a
few nights of sleep the core experience
on the other hand has been optimized and
given some new functionality you can use
the rotating bezel to accept or to
dismiss certain parts of the Tizen OS
and this will be made available to the
gear s2 through software updates
s-health still gets a good amount of
focus on the gear s3 and the added tools
of a barometer and an altimeter are
available for those who might go hiking
or climb stairs for fitness s health is
still quite robust using the heart rate
sensor and GPS tracking to record a
myriad of exercises fitness enthusiasts
will find plenty to like with the gear
s3 even for small metrics like tracking
water or caffeine intake for each fault
that we would find with the gear s3
there were a few great aspects that made
up for it the gear s3 is some of the
best one we've had on a SmartWatch in a
while and most of it goes to that great
display and the unique rotating bezel
but the best part about Samsung's new
SmartWatch is that it tries to wear a
lot of hats at once
SmartWatch Notification Center health
monitor payment system GPS tracker audio
player voice caller and more and
actually manages to be at least decent
at basically every role there are a ton
of choices in terms of style for Android
wear devices and the gear s3 has to fall
back on the smaller and less inclined to
gear s2 but Samsung is still
successfully drawing the line in the
sand between it and Google's take on
smartwatches head on over to Android re
