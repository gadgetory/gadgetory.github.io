Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 181 so let's get
started one of the bigger announcements
at nwc 2017 was a Nokia 3310 yes the
remake of the famous phone with all of
those memes it comes with a revamped
version of the popular snake game as it
turns out you can play it without buying
be 3310 facebook Messenger has the game
built right into the application and you
can play it whenever you want to simply
launch the application tap the
controller icon find it and then play we
thought that was kind of cool google
announced that google assistant will be
coming to all devices running
marshmallow and nougat the good news is
that you won't have to wait for very
long the update will be coming through
google play services and it should be
rolling out right now the first stage of
rollouts are going to the United States
Australia Canada and the United Kingdom
along with Germany other countries and
languages will have to wait for rollouts
later this year researchers have found
132 android apps that are carrying
windows malware what makes that
interesting is that windows malware
can't do jack or squat on the android
platform and it gets a little bit
weirder the developers have no idea that
the malware was actually there the
malware finds HTML pages and then in
checks and malware into them
automatically even if they're in an
android app that means the malware was
already on their computer when they
developed the application the apps are
of course no longer available for
download niantic announced that they
would be bringing more large updates to
Pokemon go in 2017 the future updates
will include more Pokemon new gameplay
features and a whole lot more the
gameplay features that have been
confirmed include trading pokemon PvP
combat a new gym battle system and some
smaller stuff the updates should roll
out over the course of this year they
also announced a revamp for ingress at
Mobile World Congress 2017 and that
should be fun google officially
announced youtube TV this week it's a
lot like sling TV PlayStation view or
directv now it will include dozens of
cable channels local sports networks and
some other stuff it will even include a
cloud-based DVR with unlimited storage
which we think is freaking awesome of
course you'll have access to youtube
read original content as well from the
app also the company announced that
people check out over 1 billion hours of
videos per day
and that's really impressive unhappy
ever after was originally a Kickstarter
project obviously it got funded because
now it's out on Android it's a retro
style RPG with a decent storyline you'll
have a partially open world to explore
adult themes dungeons and a whole lot
more overall the developers boasts over
20 hours of content for you to play
through there is even a night and day
system that helps affect certain things
do beware though because this game isn't
great for kids you can pick up the demo
version for free and the full version
costs a scant two dollars and 49 cents
pics bar is a fun little customization
app the basic premise is that it helps
your navigation keys look like the ones
on the Google pixel you'll open the
application position the graphics
accordingly and then hit apply the
result should be filled in buttons like
you'd see on the pixel it works without
root and it's also intended for phones
running stock Android the application is
compatible with Android lollipop and
forward the developer has also stated
that some OEM scans will be supported in
future updates and it will run you 99
cents to check it out the frost room is
a first-person adventure game that also
features point-and-click mechanics the
game storyline follows Viking mythology
with some north culture sprinkled in for
good measure you'll find hand-painted
artwork various puzzles bizarre concepts
and a whole lot more each puzzle that
you solve will help you get one step
closer to the end of the game it focuses
a lot more on storytelling than most
games and that means it's a good option
for those who like following narratives
it's four dollars and ninety-nine cents
with no in-app purchases energy bar is
another Android customization app and
this one puts a battery meter above your
status bar the bar gets shorter as your
battery drains so you have a visual
representation to see how much you have
left the pro version of the applets you
completely replace your status bar with
a battery meter if you want to on top of
that you'll be able to customize the
colors the bar thickness and how the
color is shown it even has a selection
of animations for when you're charging
you can check it out the free version to
see if you like it what you'll need to
pay a dollar ninety-nine to get all of
the features the escapists was
originally released on PC and this week
it was officially ported to android the
game follows your main character who has
been thrown into prison and your job is
to figure out a way to break out the
game features a variety of ways to do so
and you'll be able to do things like
show up for roll call hide your
contraband and avoid being suspicious
until it's time to make your break pair
that with the retro graphics and
you have isn't instant classic it's
definitely one of the more unique
sandbox games that we've seen it's three
