live from Mobile World Congress 2016 I'm
here with two of my esteemed industry
colleagues two gentlemen I had
incredible amount of respect for we have
ian ferguson and James Bruce essentially
they they manage and handle all the
communications and marketing forearm on
a global basis and you know I had a
thought in taxi today guys and that's
that you know maybe a lot of you
actually don't even know what arm is and
so what is armed so thank if you look at
arm basically what it is is it's an
architecture that we then license to our
partners so it's really the building
blocks of innovation so it really allows
you to have great CPUs great GPUs put on
a wide range of soc s what's in slc
James system-on-a-chip so if you look
traditionally CPUs you would have a cpu
and then you'd have lots of chips around
it but what happens with an SOC is you
basically put a computer on a chip and
what that really means is that instead
of having a great big PCB as you used to
have years ago you can now start having
compute computers and really small form
factors like this and it really helps to
do you know innovative new products
absolutely so we actually have chips now
that as you fit into a dimple in a golf
ball would you believe that's all that
you're in fact I see yes just there we
saw was a sub 1 and I oh yes it's one
point yeah one point one point two
millimeters by two millimeter chip yeah
heat sensor yeah and we also had we also
had the world's smallest computer which
was even smaller and totally self
powered so I think that's a really good
proof point so and I know you're you're
into your mobile stuff but just to give
you an idea the sort of things that
might come down the path people have
been exploring actually using chips at
the back of the eye when she do a
corrective I work so you know you I
certainly with my eyes look I got these
right so over time they degrade the idea
is that technology could actually sort
of adjust your eyes over time and and
obviously has to get down to the sort of
size James is talking about a millimeter
by a militant I mean so everything's
healing smaller everything is gained
more power efficient we're talking about
sub 14 nanometer already being planned
you know 10 everything's kind of getting
a little bit crazy if you know what I
mean not only that in the press the pre
briefing with Samsung where we solve the
galaxy s7 it's still again 14 nanometer
for their
she knows 88 90 with a bit of
controversy behind that Molly and the
exhales 88 90 is faster and more power
efficient potentially than Snapdragon
820 and we're going to be exploring that
very soon with Gary Sims my question to
you is there's so many different
participants in there SSE ecosystem your
partner ecosystem hisilicon Qualcomm
xedos rock ship and so many others who's
doing the best right now us I think the
answer to that is it's very much who's
got the best handset for you as a
consumer because in the end it's not so
much about the benchmarks it's when you
as a consumer going there by the phone
that you really like and that's the
phone you should buy so you're basically
saying benchmarking is dead I'm not
saying that benchmarking said but what
I'm saying is the most important thing
to a consumer is you know what's the
phone that works for them you it can be
a combination obsolete cpu performance
GPU performance but also mechanics
quality of camera etc I think we're
gravitating a lot of way from specs and
more towards the user experience you
know yes Umar's demand instantaneous
camera exactly instantaneous web
browsing and so forth and incredibly
long battery Linda and of course
durability the hardware yum we're
talking about just the cure 920 and the
excess 88-90 I mean the 80 and 90 is a
really substantial improvement over the
74 20 so can we just talk about what
Samsung is doing about the excellence
well I think if you look at all our
partners you know every year they do
better associ√©s and I mean for example
if you look at the 88 90 it's got the
Marley graphics in there tht 880 so
we're really proud of that and you know
just the new graphical user experiences
that will deliver two percent more
powerful over the previous generation
that's right where's the anther you
rather I mean that's a really impressive
number if you think that's just one
years difference and your GPS humans has
gone up now I think the critical thing
is then to think about but what am I
going to do with that sort of increased
GPU performance and obviously it's going
to enable some great games you know for
example using the enlightened
technologies to get really nice lighting
effects or if you're someone like Ian
here who's really into VR
you know your VR experience is going to
get even better because the more
powerful GPU have means you can have a
higher frame rate to higher resolution
scrubland and that helps the overall
user experience talk about VR is it
really going to be the next platform so
I think the really interesting thing
about VRS that were very much at the
start and VR is definitely going to be
massive it's going to go somewhere the
thing is is that we don't actually know
where it is it's going to where it's
going to end up it's going to do
something really good if I could
actually predict what it was going to do
really good I would actually go and we
do a start-up and make lots of money
yeah but yeah yeah i'll say i actually
think over time this is my personal
opinion is that augmented reality is
going to be actually bigger than VR hmm
okay so actually seeing your real world
and then getting extra information you
know whether you got a phone and you're
holding it up in a new city and you're
getting information around that and
added to your experience obviously if
you're in a car and you're driving and
you're getting extra information in
addition to what you're seeing I
actually think that's going to have a
wider set of applications over time
compared you are clearly BR that's going
to be the ardent gamers and there's
going to be a lot of those applications
people in industrial applications
learning about a really tough task in a
virtual world before they go into a coal
mine as always it's a lot of things
there but I i I'm actually much more of
a fan of AR because I think that's going
to be wider over time personally I guess
the last two questions essentially are
what does the future look like and you
know what are the challenge what is the
next game changer in terms of how all
the processors from mobile and
everything you guys do
essentially so I think the future looks
like depends if you're wearing VR
goggles or not but assuming that you're
not wearing them I think really the
future is is we're at the stage now
where you're getting all this
intelligence connectivity I think the
critical thing is how did you actually
combine that all together and have
should just make it easy such that I
walk into my room it's got a arm power
TV it's got arm powered lighting systems
how does it make the right decisions you
know to turn on the light do the heating
rate and it's just easy such days I
don't have to do any work I don't have
to program while the software a lot of
software a lot a lot of intelligence
yeah and I think the real key thing is
really you're going to see all that
computing capability just disappear from
the typical consumer actors and it just
it just does what you want to do the
scary times yeah scary good that's very
good um no no no I know you guys are way
smarter than I am so well that's true um
so I mean I think on the direction i'm a
big fan of health care we've talked
about before salute I think you know
using the phone which is already as you
say becoming a primary platform for
compute I'm going to see I'm going to
want to see that really empowering
people with health care information and
be be better making better choices about
what they eat how they exercise and
clearly there's some pieces starting
with that we're going to see I think
that in spades in terms of giving people
a much more whether it's used for
clinical diagnosis is more of a debate
but actually empowering people so I
think we'll see that in the handset
we're going to see technology everywhere
around us and for it to be successful it
needs to be almost invisible right just
we're going to be able to drive through
cities easier because technology just
helps us find the weight the right way
through we'll find technology they're
working on smart yarn you'll be placed
in their yard yeah technology allowing
my yard yeah I love it already and I'm
sure sure yeah go get it now I'm sure
you sure you already got something there
but you know if you look at where you're
going to get heart rate information
you're gonna see stuff going
taking the setbacks I mean okay this
human incentive and then this financial
incentive and in terms of the health
care is sort of economy yeah prizes
babes basically about 28 to 32 percent
of the entire 115 trillion dollar a year
equal economy health is so important
because without health we're dead
investor and so in from an insurance
standpoint imagine you know you wear a
Fitbit you sure you're a non smoking or
non drinker you're exercising and eating
well and you know as a result you should
have to pay less yeah if any at all um
and the whole myriad of other situations
yeah it's almost limitless hmm but it
all starts to the heart of Technology
and like you say it does have to be
invisible so that's why I love talking
to you guys and you know that's why you
know we're such good friends but thank
you if you yes for you to come by and
you continued interested in arm Darcy's
right are you blow me away I just I
can't even stay on top of the embed and
the cortex you know just everything
you're doing around IOT m2m wearables
smart phones you know essentially making
low-power computing accessible to so
many billions of people and also all the
myriad other benefits for you know less
privileged economies that get to
participate like 10 you said last year
James about the twenty-dollar smartphone
but this year we already had a four
dollar smartphone you know so which a
bit controversial that's right and I I
think if you look at smartphones there's
a certain price where they can get down
to you know twenty dollars or so but
then you just beyond that it's really
hard to go below that I think what
you're going to see it's not so much a
reduction in price but just better
capabilities for that price oh yeah $20
smartphone in two or three years it's
going to be way ahead of the one that
you could get two years ago well you
know we could talk all day but yeah I've
been told by the Josh here that we gotta
go wrap it up so is there any final
thoughts you guys have on your mind look
forward to seeing you next year well I
took there uh was the skin testing
leader I was looking for it early this
little device you guys uh you put it on
your skin and it tells you they quality
an AGM skin and I'm 32 in it give me a
32 but in here is he's about 65 he got a
min went to the only point is she came
up and said I was dead so do is 42 and
I'm the same a almost the same age you
see in and then as I came up at 35 so
wonderful what your gentleman you know
thank you so much you know and we really
appreciate everything for coming by oh
thank you so much right thanks so much
guys it's arm our other Cambridge you
know they are a profound company if you
don't know who they are i really
recommend you do some research on them
because they are part of the evolution
of technology in a way that few
companies are thanks for uconn would
spank you gregarious you like ave
