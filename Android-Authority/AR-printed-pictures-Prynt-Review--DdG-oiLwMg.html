Authority what's going on everybody and
have kind of a really cool thing to show
you here this is a printer case that can
be used with Samsung Galaxy S devices in
particular the s5 the s6 and in a more
recent update the galaxy s7 has been
added on as well
it's called print and if you are a
photog your smartphone photographer and
you polish your pictures on Instagram on
Facebook or even just share them with
your friends this might be a cool and
fun way for you to share them in a
different way essentially print is a
case that latches on to a galaxy s
device when you're talking about Android
and it allows you to print out small
little photos that you can share with
your friends or keep for yourself but
there's a little bit of a cool
futuristic feel to these that I'll get
into in a little bit as I mentioned the
print case is compatible with samsung
galaxy s devices and it requires of a
specific bracket for you to put it on to
there but before you even get the phone
onto there using the proper bracket you
have to open up the middle and put in
some of the Zink paper now Zink is kind
of a really interesting technology in
that it doesn't use any ink to actually
print things out essentially the Zink
paper doesn't require any ink because
everything that's needed to create the
photo is embedded into the layers of the
paper and then the zinc printer simply
just makes all of that come out once
loaded you just put the phone into the
bracket and it connects via the micro
USB connection and then it looks a
little bit like this now I already know
what you're thinking it's kind of a
bulky accessory to have and you're
absolutely right but thankfully the
samsung galaxy s device doesn't have to
be mounted into the printer in order to
take photos and essentially the six
second videos that come after them you
can use the Print app which is
downloadable from the Google Play Store
and just use that on its own only to put
the phone into the case later if you
need to print out those prints there is
a hardware button on the print case
itself which is kind of nice to use as
it allows for focusing and for taking
the initial frame when taking that
initial picture however six seconds of
video will then be recorded after it so
that your subject can pretty much do
whatever that they want and those six
seconds of video will be uploaded to the
cloud and then brought back down
after the scanner in the print app scans
the photo that is created that photo
already can be given to friends or kept
for one's own keepsake but when you open
up the scanner in the print app you will
be able to scan that photo and via the
embedded code that is inside the photo
it will take the video and add in an
augmented reality style video playback
on top of that photo now this is the
futuristic part that is actually really
cool and everyone so far has really been
impressed by it and as I mentioned
before already the print app can be
downloaded onto any Android device as it
is available in the Google Play Store
which means that if you give these
photos to other people and they don't
have galaxy s devices at the very least
they will be able to have fun with the
augmented reality portion of the print
app by opening up the scanner and
scanning the photo that you give them
but that's where a small little problem
came to light the print case is only
compatible with specific portions of the
Android population which we think is a
bit of a travesty because the print case
could have been a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi
direct enabled printer one that would be
able to connect to pretty much any
Android device and then anyone would be
able to have this kind of fun using the
photos from the print app now personally
I think it's still really fun to use and
it sort of thinks outside of the box of
digital photography smartphone
photography rather and gives a new layer
of a way to share these memories with
other people or even to just have the
memories on our own but the print case
is available for $149 and the Zink paper
is at about 50 cents a pop which sounds
a little bit steep but polaroid photos
back in the day we're not--we're not
cheap at all either and we also want to
see more accessories I think in more
than just one direction in this case
print takes our digital smartphone
photography gives it that old-school
tangible feel and then adds in what
could only be described as our
undeniably cool future keep between 2
