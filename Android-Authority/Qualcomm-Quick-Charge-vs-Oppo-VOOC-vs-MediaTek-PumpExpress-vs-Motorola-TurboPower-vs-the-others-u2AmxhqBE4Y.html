authority now when it comes to fast
charging technologies it seems that the
different smartphone OMS are flicking
through their dictionaries trying to
find interesting words to describe their
technologies just saying fast charging
doesn't seem to be good enough we have
quick charging and we have turbo power
and we have smart power and we have a
whole range of actually different names
today I'm going to be looking at six
different charging technologies and
we're going to try to find out which one
is the best so what are these six
charging technologies we're going to be
looking at we're going to be looking at
quick charge 2.0 from cocom we're going
to be looking at VOC vo OC from Oppo
we're going to be looking at pump
Express from media tech we're going to
be looking at turbo power from Motorola
adaptive fast charging from Samsung and
smart power from Huawei and to do that
I've got a different phone that using
each of these different technologies and
I'm going to pit them against each other
in terms of charging times in charge of
temperatures in terms of how quickly
they get to fifty percent how quickly
they get to 80 percent and so on other
phones I'm using are as follows and use
the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 to test quick
charge 2.0 I'm going to use the oppo r7s
to test out luke I'm going to use the
vivo x6 to test out media techs
pump Express plus and then use the Moto
X force to look at Turbo Power and this
is galaxy note 5 to look at Samsung's
adaptive fast charging and I'm going to
use the mate 8 for huawei's smart power
so the tests were conducted like this
each phone was plugged into the adapter
that comes with it in the Box I
installed an app from the Play Store
that measures battery life and tells you
how long it took to charge the phone and
every 10 minutes I use an infrared gun
to measure the temperature on the back
of the device and then once I'd done
that for all the phones I've put
together some graphs and some numbers so
we can see which one performs the best
so before we go I just want to tell you
one quick thing about how batteries
charge in smart phones they actually
charge in two stages in the first stage
of charge you can put in a
lot of power right up until the battery
gets to about 80% and then from 80% to
100 less and less power is put into the
battery as it is topped up to its full
mark now because of that these quick
charging technologies always talk about
how quickly they can get to 80% some
even talk about how quickly they can get
to 50% but very rarely do you hear a
manufacturer omit how quickly can charge
the whole battery and that's because
that last 20% can sometimes take forty
five percent of the actual overall
charging time so when we look at these
results week actually look at how
quickly you can get to 80% but also how
quickly does it take to go that last 20%
until it gets full so let's start
looking at the results so I'm going to
go through the different phones and the
different charging systems as I've got
them written down here on my result
sheet there's no particular order to how
I've written them down here if you want
to see all the numbers and analyze them
in greater details and please do head on
over to the Android or first comm
website where you'll find the written
article that go to this video
I've got tables and graphs there that
show you in detail how each of these
phones and edge of these charging
systems worked now we're going to start
with the Galaxy Note 4 now the Galaxy
Note 4 takes one hour and 23 minutes to
charge up and it reaches 80% of its
charge cycle in 58.6 percent of its
overall charging time which is about 48
minutes it can get to about 50% full in
27 minutes and one interesting thing is
that it has a temperature rise of over
11 degrees during that charging cycle
next on my list is the note 5 now the
soap note 5 manages to charge up in 1
hour and 36 minutes and it manages to
reach 50% of its charge in 34% of its
overall charging time and it reaches 80%
in 60% of its overall charging time
which actually means that it takes 20
the last 20% takes 40% of the time hope
you're following that and interesting ly
it has a smaller temperature rise than
the note 4 it actually goes up only
eight point five degrees during that
whole charging cycle
next is a Moto X force and the Moto X
force measures to reach its full charge
in just one hour and 25 minutes it
manages to reach 50%
it's charged in 30 percent of the
overall charging cycle it manages to
reach 80 percent of its charge in just
53 percent of its overall charging cycle
which is some 45 minutes and it manages
to do that last 20 percent in an
additional 40 minutes so it's 45 minutes
up to 80 percent then another 40 minutes
until it gets to a hundred percent and
there we can see that 20 percent
actually does take quite a lot long time
to actually charge up and it also has a
very high temperature change during this
it goes up nineteen point nine degrees
from when it's charging from zero all
the way up to a hundred that's quite a
large temperature difference next on my
list is the Huawei mate 8 and the Huawei
mate 8 has a four thousand milliamp hour
battery now it manages to charge up in
two hours and ten minutes and it reaches
50% of its charge in 30 percent of the
overall charging cycle and it can get to
eighty percent of its charge in 50% of
its overall charging cycle which is just
over one hour and it has a relatively
good temperature difference
it goes up just eight point four degrees
while it's charging now the last two are
the oppo r7s and the vivo x6 now looking
at the oppo r7s we find that it charges
in one hour and 21 minutes it manages to
get to 50% of its charge in 31% of its
overall charging cycle 80% charging 53%
of its overall charging cycle which is
some 43 minutes and then it has a
temperature rise of just three degrees
during that charge that's actually
fantastic just three degrees really is
the lowest phone in our comparison here
that has the lowest temperature rise
across the charging cycles compare it to
the 19 degrees on the phone we just
mentioned a moment ago and finally the
vivo x6 now the XS measures reaches
charging time in 1 hour and 18 minutes
which actually makes it the fastest
phone in our group of course it only has
a 2400 milliamp hour battery it manages
to get to 50% of its charge in 30
percent of the charging cycle it manages
to get to 80 percent of its charge in 54
percent of the charging cycle which is
some 43 minutes if you want to get to
80% just need 43 minutes to do that
and it has a modest temperature rise of
point one degrees during its charging
cycle photos all this mean when in terms
of which phone charges the fast is
relative to its battery size that award
actually goes to the Moto X force
followed by the note 4 and then the oppo
r7s so which phone can get to 50% of its
charge quickest compared to its overall
charging cycle is the Moto X force which
uses just 29% of the charging cycle to
get to 50% and then a second place we
have the Huawei mate 8 which you can get
to 50% of its charge in just 30 percent
of the overall charging cycle so which
phone can get to 80 percent of the
battery charge in the relatively
shortest amount of time compared to the
whole charging cycle is the mate 8 which
actually just use its 50% of its charge
cycle to get to the 80% point the oppo
r7s comes in second place which uses 52%
of its overall charge cycle to get to
that 80 percent mark so in terms of
which phone stays the coolest during
charging that price goes to the oppo r7s
which has an amazing 3.3 degree
temperature rise during the charging
cycle in fact its closest rival the vivo
x6 has an eight point one degree rise
during its charging cycle as also does
the Mara while a mate eight and the note
five which have eight point four and
eight point five degrees respectively
so which phone is the overall winner
well that's actually quite hard to say
not one of these charging systems really
demonstrated itself to be much much
better than any of the others it's quite
an even playing field at this time if
you want that raw power just one that
gets that phone charge there quickest
then you have to go with the Moto X for
however that comes with a price in the
sense that he goes up nearly 20 degrees
during its charging cycle that's
actually quite warm on the back of the
phone if you are worried about how the
temperature affects battery life or how
it might damage the phone in the long
term then you really need to look at the
Oppo r7 and its VOC charging system
because that only went out just three
point three degrees and if you want a
phone that gets to 50% or 80% the
quickest then those prizes really do go
again to the Moto X force to the huawei
mate s
and the oppo r7s oh there you have it my
look at the different fast charging
systems my name's Gary Sims from Andhra
Authority and I hope you really enjoyed
this video if you did please do give it
a thumbs up also please use the comments
below to tell me what you think about
the different fast charging systems do
you have one that is a favorite of yours
also don't forget to subscribe to and
rathore --'tis youtube channel and as
for me i'll see you in my next video now
the state hits the end of the film I
just want to give you one quick tip if
you could develop a fast charging
technology there are three words that I
found in addiction that haven't yet been
used brisk charging warp charging and
lickety-split charging you heard it here
