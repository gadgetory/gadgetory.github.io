Android authority and this is the
Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and like a lot of
other Samsung phones the note 4 does not
have wireless charging built-in but that
does not mean that wireless charging
isn't possible in fact there's actually
several different ways that you can
wirelessly charge your Galaxy Note 4 so
we're going to go over some of them here
today and show you guys how you can
wirelessly charge your Samsung Galaxy
Note 4
so first up on the list is the S charger
cover and this is basically just a
replacement back for your Note 4 so in
order to install it you just pop off the
normal back on your note 4 and pop this
one on and boom you have wireless
charging the back itself looks and feels
pretty much the same as the standard
back it has the same faux leather
texture and everything like that the
only difference that you're going to
notice that is that it's a little bit
thicker than the normal note 4 back and
that's because of the wireless charging
it's so thick that it actually makes the
camera hump on the back of the note 4
flush with the body of the phone which
is kind of a good thing it protects the
camera a little bit better
the only drawback of this being thicker
is that you're not going to be able to
use cases you're not going to be able to
use any cases that you already own so
that's the downside of this but if you
don't use cases it's not going to be
that big of a deal I personally don't
use cases so it's not going to be it's
not a problem for me but if you like to
protect your phone a little bit more
that's where it's going to be a little
bit of an issue now as far as the actual
charging goes it's rated at eight
hundred milli amp power so obviously
it's going to be slower than physically
plugging your phone in but it's still
fast enough that you should be able to
charge your phone overnight and wake up
to a fully charged Note 4 next up on the
list is the S view flip cover with
wireless charging and this is another
official accessory from Samsung and it's
pretty much the same thing as the normal
su flip cover with the exception of
wireless charging obviously but you
still have all these same
functionalities built in like being able
to view the weather the time the date
your text messages and answer phone
calls all without having to open
of the case the only difference is the
thickness due to that wireless charging
so it is a little bit thicker than the
normal su slipcover but if you didn't
have them both side-by-side you wouldn't
really notice the difference between the
two now as far as installing it goes you
just pop off the back of your Note 4 and
just pop this one in place and you are
ready to wirelessly charge it is rated
at 800 milliamp hours just like the S
charger cover so it's not the fastest
thing in the world but it is fast enough
just for overnight charging now if you
want to be able to wirelessly charge or
no for without having to deal with any
added bulk then the Qi infinity qi
wireless charging receiver is the one
for you and this is actually my personal
favorite because it doesn't change the
look and feel of your note for
whatsoever and you still get wireless
charging and installing it is actually
really super simple you'll notice that
there's these little copper connectors
on the receiver itself that line up with
the copper connections on the inside of
the note 4 that you see to the left of
the battery and to the top of the
battery and once you line up those
copper connections you just place the
battery door back on and you should be
able to wirelessly charge your Note 4
and the best part about it is besides
not having to deal with any bolt is that
you can still use any case of your
choice the charging is a little bit
slower than the S charger cover and the
sv flip cover because it's only rated at
an output of 600 milliamp hours but to
me these slower charging speeds is
totally worth it to not have to deal
with any additional bulk once you have
enabled wireless charging on your note 4
you're going to need an actual wireless
charger and this is where the charger
pad WYD comes in and this is basically a
standard qi wireless charger that will
work with any Qi enabled device but it's
been made specifically to accommodate
the size of the note 4 so you can
actually fit the entire note 4 onto this
charging pad with plenty of room to
spare and you'll never have to question
that your Note 4 is actually charging
because there's actually a little LED
indicator light on there that lets you
know that the charging process has taken
place and the nice part about this
charger is that it has a rubbery
material underneath so it's not going to
slide all over the place when you're
trying to charge your phone and there
you have it guys those are some of the
best wireless charging options
for your Galaxy Note 4 if you want to
know a little bit more about them as far
as pricing and where you can buy them
