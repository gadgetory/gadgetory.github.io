Android authority and we are live here
at CES 2015
hanging out with ZTE taking a quick look
at the Nubia z7 and starting with the
design you're looking at a phone that is
pretty standard in appearance it does
however exude some really nice qualities
like the rounded corners and the soft
touch matte finish which gives it a very
comfortable feel in the hand the red
accents along the camera and the bright
red glowing home button on the front are
also a very nice touch giving this phone
a little bit of extra flare to what
would otherwise be a pretty standard
design also on the front is a very
gorgeous looking 5.5 inch display with
quad HD resolution and it looks just
about as good as you might expect with
fantastic viewing angles sharpness and
vibrant colors the screen might be
considered too large for some but even
with the 5.5 inch display the phone
still feels fairly manageable in one
hand the specs are also no slouch with a
Snapdragon 801 inside 32 gigs of
internal storage and a hefty three gigs
of RAM meaning you should get some
really great performance whether you're
gaming multitasking getting some work
done or just running through some fairly
average tasks with the camera you're
looking at a 13 megapixel shooter with
OAS built in which should help with
low-light performance and there's 4k
recording as well if you want to take
some really sharp looking videos the
camera interface will cater to a variety
of different users with the pro mode for
people who want to get really granular
with their photos in a fun or auto mode
for people who just want to enjoy their
camera and keep the picture-taking
experience as simple as possible the
nubia z7 comes backed with a fairly
large battery at 3000 milliamp hours so
battery life should not be an issue and
the OS running the show is 4.4 kitkat
with ZT ease custom skin as you can
probably tell it's extremely colorful
and bright and it also lacks the
standard app drawer that you can
typically find on most Android phones
but all in all it's a fairly simple and
straightforward experience availability
is limited to China markets as of right
now
but if that happens to change we will
definitely keep you posted this has been
a first look of the new BIA z7 from ZTE
and we're still here at CES 2015 so stay
tuned for the rest of our coverage
because we are your source for all
things Android and CES 2015</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
