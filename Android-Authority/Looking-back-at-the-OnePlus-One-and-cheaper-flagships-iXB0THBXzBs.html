basically makes it clear that oneplus
has a new device on its way however in
taking a look at that leak we also
wanted to reminisce on their first
attempt a just Joshin for gara what's
going on everybody and this is a look
back at the oneplus one just kind of
looking at its release cycle and also
remembering how this phone provided a
lot of great features and specifications
for a price that was pretty accessible
to everybody but in doing so we're also
going to ponder why our smartphones this
year are incredibly expensive I still
remember the original announcement event
there was a ton of buzz around it mainly
because of oneplus is great guerilla
marketing now wasn't without its
problems but ultimately a ton of
eyeballs were on oneplus when their
announcement happened and I was one of
the only members of the American media
that was there so I felt pretty
privileged to be a part of what could
have been
smartphone history now we wouldn't
really go as far to say that oneplus
completely changed the smartphone world
and of course oneplus is still around
making premium devices that have want
some accolades at Android authority but
at the time the oneplus one definitely
disrupted what was the flagship space
that year I mean just take a look at the
specifications we have the Snapdragon
801 which was the main processor at the
time we have 16 and then 64 gigabytes of
on-board storage as one of the main
options and then an update to three
gigabytes of RAM over the two that was
found in a lot of phones that year and
all of this came on a phone that
actually looked different granted I do
have the bamboo version here I changed
the shell from the baby's skin white
which is still kind of a weird name for
her a material on a device but there was
the baby skin wide the sandstone black
and then of course this bamboo one which
of course I would want to have the
bamboo backing so the phone was
different but still provided everything
that users would basically need
including a version of Android that was
reliable and also pretty much stock life
for all those people who were Android
purists but one of the reasons why we
wanted to bring up the oneplus one is
because while we're looking back we also
realize that this kind of device hasn't
happened since 2015 but we might be
inline over the next year or so for a
device that actually disrupts the space
the way that oneplus one did and that's
because the prices just seemed to be
rising and rising and rising plenty of
other phones are still about $600 or
more
and it seems like in the flagship game
you have to pay a lot or else you're
going to have to settle for a mid-range
phone I'm gonna point you to a couple of
articles over at Android authority comm
that talk about this phenomenon of super
expensive flagship smartphones Scott
Gordon's article over at Android
authority basically states that a study
found a 7% increase in the average
smartphone sale price now that's average
smartphone that doesn't just include the
flagships it includes every tier below
it as well and similar percent might not
sound like a whole lot but remember that
$1000 is getting closer and closer to
being the norm when it comes to flagship
prices and then there's Robert Riggs
article basically stating that there's a
dichotomy between innovation and
commoditization yes the smartphone
manufacturers are constantly trying to
find the bleeding edge features to put
in their phones but until then we still
get rising costs which basically tell
the consumer that they are paying for
the premium even if when you dive deep
in there there actually isn't a whole
lot differentiating many of these
smartphones from one another we're at
the point now that a phone that hits the
18 by 9 aspect ratio the Snapdragon 835
maybe four plus gigabytes of RAM and
good storage options that hits the $600
price point might actually be one of the
best things we've seen all year
and according to the leaks the next one
plus device might just be able to hit
that mark but it's still $600 when we
don't have too many great smartphones
that hit a decent price point of $350 or
less and that's exactly what the oneplus
one did at its time those prices were
$2.99 for the 16 gigabyte model and 349
for the 64 gigabyte model and let's not
even forget the time when it came down
by even 50 more dollars and you can get
the original oneplus one in the baby
skin white for 249 those prices are
simply unheard of these days and it kind
of sucks that we don't really have that
in the smartphone mid-range game either
after all Android one devices that have
recently been announced are still going
over the $300 price point even though
they're supposed to be phones that are
incredibly minimalistic yet reliable if
you want a reliable smart phone then you
could still go to the mid to your game
but even then those are the
specifications that a lot of people are
actually clamoring for there's nothing
wrong with being hopeful that another
one plus one will arrive
to disrupt the flagship market but as it
stands right now we're probably going to
be seeing even more increases in
flagship prices and it's going to be a
bummer every time you see that price at
the end of the announcement events and
that's why we and probably a lot of you
out there look back fondly at the 1+1 it
was a phone that at its time was one of
the most desired devices of the year
mainly because with its accessible price
point you still got the best and
sometimes even better specifications
than the rest so as always thank you
guys very much for watching and I hope
you enjoyed this quick look back at the
1+1 but the main thing I wanted to do in
bringing up this old device was to bring
up the conversation how do you feel
about the prices of flagship phones
these days and let us know what your
opinions are in the comments down below
keep it tuned to Android authority for
all of the best including discussions
like we've had just now and also a look
at what might be the next one plus
device we don't really know when exactly
it's going to be but it feels like it's
going to be pretty soon keep it tuned to
you for that and even more in the
flagship mid-range and all the different
games of the smartphone market and

you haven't already because we are of
