time to do a follow up to last year's
project around up here's some of our
favorite portable projectors of 2016
first we have the JM go smart portable
projector and this was actually first
seen on IndieGoGo or JM go was able to
raise two hundred and fifty six thousand
dollars over their $100,000 goal and now
we have one of the best thought-out
portable projectors we've seen it's
design is unlike any other portable
projector and at first this totally
rounded body would make you think isn't
this the worst possible design you could
have for a projector because it's just
going to roll around everywhere well
this round body allows this magnetic
projector to work perfectly with this
magnetic stand strip the body of the
projector can easily be tilted up and
down at any angle positioning the image
perfectly onto a wall now most of the
time most of them use a little stand
system that props the projector up at a
fixed angle and then I find myself
usually putting anything I can
underneath it to angle it decently but
with this setup there's no problem we
also have keystoning here like all the
projectors in this video which prevents
the image from warping even without
holding it directly in front of the wall
but what really makes this projector
special is that it's running Android
4.4.4 and it's heavily skinned obviously
in order to create a really beautiful
and simple experience while navigating
through its apps like YouTube Netflix
and some other apps aren't on there and
you can control this with a little
remote it comes with which is something
that all portable projectors should have
you can load videos with a USB flash
drive via the USB port on the back or
use HDMI and you can even stream videos
from your phone so when it comes to the
actual quality of the projector it's
really great it's not the best quality
image we've seen from a portable
projector but it gets very close it gets
brighter than 80
the portable projectors around its price
range at 250 lumens and caps out at a
720p resolution and there's colors are
really nice too but the contrast could
be a little less extreme now a good
movie watching experience is nothing
without good sound and in this apartment
the JM go is miles ahead of his
competition on each side of the
projector you'll find a large pair of
speakers and these speakers sound
fantastic for a portable projector they
don't sound to me at all and they even
have a good amount of bass to them
lastly there's one final trick the JM go
features and that's its 3d video
capabilities if you have access to a 3d
movie or video you can pair the JM go 3d
glasses with a projector to have an even
more immersive experience this will come
at a price though it'll set you at about
$600 our next projector is half the
price and it's from Sony and at first
glance you would think is this a new
phone from Sony
it's definitely intentional and just
like a phone it can easily slip into a
pocket and it's so light and thin that
you'll forget it's even there it's
called the sony MP CL one and it's
pretty interesting because it projects
using its laser technology so this means
it'll behave a little differently it's
only 32 lumens which compared to the JM
gos 250 it sounds like you'd be barely
able to see it but the human eye
perceives Laser projections a little
brighter than your standard LED
projections at the same lumen count but
still that being said it is a lot darker
than the JM go but it's still bright
enough to enjoy at any distance less
than 40 inches away the MPC l1 doesn't
need to be very far away to project a
huge image though and only being 40
inches away will create a 120 inch image
at a 16 to 9 aspect ratio
it also features keystoning but
strangely enough no focusing
capabilities nope no manual controls and
it doesn't even focus automatically but
thanks to this being a laser based
projection system the image will always
remain pretty clear no matter how close
or far you are the plastics and that
comes with seems a little cheap but it
gets the job done and it can clip onto
the front or back at a fixed position so
you may need to use some extra books or
something to get it perfect like most
actors you'll be able to stream media
via miracast hook of a mini HDMI or MHL
cable and also plug in a USB stick the
speakers on here are pretty weak though
you're definitely not going to want to
be using these speakers while watching a
movie even a short YouTube video is kind
of a stretch but thankfully we have an
auxilary jack for external speakers and
no it doesn't run Android or come with a
remote but it's priced pretty well at
around three hundred and fifty dollars
which isn't too bad especially given its
extremely small size if you want a
little more bang for your buck the asus
zenui one is probably the projector for
you it's the lowest price projector here
at only two hundred and forty nine
dollars and this led bass just like that
JM go and although it's not as bright at
150 lumens it's much brighter than the
Sony MP CL one
the Zen beam is a very small projector
at 83 by 29 by 110 millimeters and it
only weighs 307 grams so that might be a
little too thick to fit into a pocket
but it's still very easy to just throw
into a back there's no special features
here it just projects an image via
miracast HDMI or USB Drive but that
makes it very simple you have some
picture settings easily accessible with
this menu button volume up and down
input selection and a physical focus
style on the side there's nothing like a
physical focus dial that allows you to
be 100% accurate with your focus and of
course we have keystoning a must-have
feature when it comes to portable
projectors but you don't get any type of
stand here so those books are going to
be a necessity the speakers on here are
what you would expect similar to what
you'd find on your average smartphone
but we do have an auxilary jack and the
colors it projects are very nice
although darker scenes will only be
viewable in a pitch-black room
the only problem here with this
projector is that it's only 480p
and that's going to really limit you on
how big the projected image can get
before it looks like you're looking for
a window screen so because of this
you're only going to want to use this
projector solely for things like
presentations or something like that but
still giving us ultra portable size and
its price the asus zenui one is very
impressive
so overall the JM go is definitely the
best projector
of quality and features but it's by far
the most expensive and if you don't mind
that step down in picture quality the
Asus and Sony projectors are really good
deals so in the comments below let me
know what you guys think is the best
projector in this roundup and be sure to
check out that full variant article at
android authority comm for more coverage
and details thank you very much for
watching guys and I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
