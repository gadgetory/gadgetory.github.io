seven and it's battery while according
to Samsung in an official statement they
have found at least 35 incidences where
the Galaxy Note sevens battery has
dangerously overheated caught fire while
charging or soon after charging now as a
precaution they have recalled all galaxy
note 7 devices all of them that may
sound like a good thing but Consumer
Reports is criticizing them for not
doing enough
now the problem is estimated to affect
one device in every 42 thousand units
according to Samsung they shipped around
2.5 million galaxy note 7 units so far
so if the estimate is correct only a few
dozen phones worldwide are at risk now
that sounds scary right should you be
worried well you should be cautious but
that doesn't stop some people from
poking fun at our tendency to sometimes
overreact although we like to make fun I
don't want to make light of the
situation that might happen to a very
very small number of people we're
talking about point zero zero two
percent of people who buy the device
will actually have it catch fire but
that is a very serious error and could
you know set your whole house aflame so
what I recommend if you do have a galaxy
note 7 and its new that you charge it a
couple times and monitor it while it's
charging I mean be there monitor the
device if it starts to get unnecessarily
hot yes stop it unplug it turn it off
and get it replaced as soon as possible
but if you have monitored a charging
cycle a couple times and there's been no
problem I wouldn't go through the hassle
so let's talk about the numbers if the
one in every 42 thousand units
estimation is correct by Samsung the
risk of your note 7 being defective is
very very low while it is good to be
cautious there is little reason to be
worried about your phone exploding
catching fire or even breaking so you
might want to know why do phones catch
fire or even explode smartphones and
other modern electronics from all
manufacturers have known to catch fire
usually while charging often through a
third-party cable or charger these
incidences are relatively rare but with
hundreds of millions of units being sold
every year these things are bound to
happen occasionally remember one of the
real concerns is third-party chargers
and cables or charges and cables that
look faulty so what is Samsung actually
doing about it
well Samsung is we're calling all note 7
ships so far worldwide this includes
devices that are already in customers
hands and devices that have been shipped
to carriers and retailers but haven't
been sold to the end-user just yet the
total number of recalled note 7 units
are round 2
five million according to Samsung
Samsung sent an email to all note 7
customers and I quote we are in the
process of finalizing the details of a
US product exchange program and will
contact you directly within the next few
days to provide you with additional
information you'll need in order to
exchange your Galaxy Note 7 if you
decide this is the course you want to
take customers will be able to get a
note 7 replacement from as soon as next
week or receive a Galaxy s7 or s7 edge
plus the price difference if you want to
switch to the s7 or s7 edge Samsung will
refund the price of any notes of an
accessory you may have bought now that
may sound all well and good but Consumer
Reports is not happy with Samsung at all
no they're criticizing s√°mi for selling
Note sevens at all Consumer Reports says
that a Consumer Product Safety
Commission sanctioned recall would have
made it illegal to sell the note 7 in
the United States at all and tell the
remediation of the problem the consumer
rights group said that it identified
stores that still had the note 7 on sale
at least last Friday quote Samsung
should immediately initiate an official
recall with the Consumer Product Safety
Commission given the serious nature of
the safety problem it identified in the
note 7 we are particularly concerned
that phones continued to be available
for sale as of today so this is one
thing I wasn't able to exactly clarify
but if Samsung is conducting a full
recall of all note 7s worldwide why
would you not stop selling those devices
wouldn't you want to stop selling the
devices first and then conduct the full
recall now they may have done just that
but they haven't clarified that and
Consumer Reports clearly thinks that
they're still selling some node 7s so
the article that is linked below will be
updated on a regular basis at the time
of publishing and shooting this video we
didn't know that detail so if we know it
when we know it it's going to be linked
up and that article below so the next
question for you if you have a note 7 is
how do you initiate a recall if you
choose to do so to initiate the exchange
customers are asked to contact the
retailer they bought the note 7 from or
call Samsung at one eight hundred seven
they said they will replace your note 7
with a new unit of the exact same model
they will also throw in a $25 gift card
for every customer as a gesture of
appreciation now what if you just want
to complete refund well say
help you out there Samsung did not
specify anything regarding refunds but
your retailer or carrier may give you
the option to ask for a full refund
since the note 7 only launched two weeks
ago your purchase may be protected by
your local consumer protection laws so
all you new note 7 owners out there I
know you're out there you commented on
the show in the past please conduct that
test if you have not already done so
charge your device at least twice like
from 5 or 10 percent right to 100%
does it get hot does it get
unnecessarily warm warmer than another
device would if it does please recall
your device exchange your device and let
me know in the comments below
you guys remember from like 15 years ago
when people were making money hand over
fist in the.com bubble
remember we didn't call it a dotnet
bubble or dot org bubble we didn't call
them dot biz billionaires we called them
dot-com billionaires because that's the
power of a.com now why is that because
no domain name extension tells your
story with the same degree of trust as a
dot-com or dotnet domain name.com and
dotnet domain name extensions inject
credibility into your online presence
