Clayton young we're coming at you from
your number one source for all things
android android authority com today I've
got a review of the otterbox defender
series case for the Samsung Galaxy s3
this is one of the most popular cases
available for the galaxy s3 because it's
really well known for its protective
qualities we've got a drop at impact
protection this also protects from dust
and debris 'he's with little plugs over
all the ports we've got three layers of
protection and it comes with a screen
protector in a holster clip let's just
take it out of the box throw it on our
samsung galaxy s3 and see how well it
fits you can see when we open the box we
have our nice little user manual down
here tells our holster and our two-piece
case well that's three piece inside we
just have our installation instructions
and a nice little greeting we've bought
a great case more than a great case and
then all this cool stuff here set that
aside we'll also set the holster sides
you can see that it can swivel complete
360 degrees anyways this is our case
I've got a nice raised bezel to protect
from a front facing impact they're also
nice screen protector on there to do the
same and now how we take this off we
just peel this a soft rubber plastic off
of here this is really thick it's going
to protect its a lot about damage I can
just feel the thickness in this and then
we have our two-piece case that just
clamps together as you can see here we
just get our finger under there and we
just pull open to release the case you
do that at all its little edges there we
have our two layers here we have some
nice foam padding here to protect from
shock even more and then we can simply
set our phone in this piece we see we
have our nice cutouts and we can put the
screen protector on top now I've already
gotten invisible shield on here which
I'm not going to take off just because
I'm you know I paid for the invisible
shield but I will still put this on it
still works with the two screen
protectors it just looks a little more
distorted but it still works just fine
you do get some air bubbles in there
though if you're running two of them
just a warning anyways you just pop this
in and you work your rubber around the
edges here make sure we just get it over
the hump
they're shut my power off for now over
that this shut off so you can see we
have our nice little plugs covering up
the microUSB we've got our small Mike
exposed to now for dust protection we
can simply put this in and situate it so
no dust can get into the micro USB same
thing for a 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack just simply put the plug down in we
have our nice a mic right there all of
our cutouts for the LED camera and
speaker nice OtterBox branding here now
this is really going to protect against
coroner's side front or back impact it's
just an awesome case now so you can see
I'm getting a few air bubbles but like I
said earlier that's because i'm running
the two screen protectors I didn't want
to take the other one off it usually
looks perfect now this is just a nice
screen protector that comes on this and
it makes the phone just seem like a
whole new phone its way up stronger it's
bulkier it looks more rugged go ahead
and pop it in our clip our holster here
really quick she just fits in there
nicely it's not going to fall out at all
then we've got our swiveling clip just
to keep this on your pants or something
while you're working in those tough
conditions or you might be mountain
biking or something you don't want the
phone to fall off it is our great raised
bezel here it's hard plastic too it is
not the soft plastic so if it falls down
there's really no give you've got a nice
a little bit of space in between the
screen and the ground anyways I screen
protector does not cover our sensors or
our camera the front-facing camera it
also doesn't cover the home button home
button still really accessible the power
buttons are easy to press there's a nice
raised piece of rubber same with the
volume rocker works awesome i love this
case the otterbox defender series is a
great line of cases for any phone it
just really adds that extra a bit of
protection a lot of people may need i
know i need a lot because i'm often
dropping my phone but yeah guys we can
do a drop test with this or you know
we're doing a giveaway we're going to be
rallying all of our cases up given away
in batches to you guys so stay tuned
with android authority calm we've always
got plenty more and we always
