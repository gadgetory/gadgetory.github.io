Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to another episode of
Android apps weekly let's start out by
jumping into some headlines the swiftkey
keyboard will come his bundled software
on the oneplus one in their next update
this doesn't make much sense since the
keyboard is free anyway but hey there it
is a new cartoon network themed humble
bundle is out right now you can pay
whatever you want and get four games
beat these six dollars and thirteen
cents average to get at least four more
games and pay eight dollars to get the
entire 11 game package this last week
was super bowl sunday and the super
popular clash of clans had a commercial
it starred Liam Neeson threatening to
kill big buffet boy 85 after big buffet
boy 85 laid waste to Neeson's base
whatsapp is apparently rolling out a new
voice calling feature the interesting
part about that is that you need to
receive a call from someone before it's
active on your accounts so good luck
finding a way to do that to see all the
headlines app updates and app releases
we have a brand new Android apps weekly
newsletter that you can sign up for
right now we send one email a week on
Fridays and there's no spam or anything
ridiculous the link is in the video

releases from this last week ppsspp at
PSP emulator is the best PSP emulator
available on Android and I dare any of
you to say that three or four times fast
this last week it received a huge update
to version 1 point 0 it comes with a ton
of glitch and bug fixes which result in
the most competent and enjoyable PSP
emulator experience yet there is a free
version and a paid version so you can
try it before you buy it smart weather
wallpaper is a live wallpaper
application that changes your wallpaper
based on what the weather is doing the
season of the year and the time of day
that means if it's raining at night
you'll have a nice night time raining
picture it comes with mood say support
and you can even search for non weather
wallpapers if you so choose transformers
battle tactics is a fighting game
released earlier this week the game
contains no storyline which some players
didn't like but it does have online PvP
battles and you can play as both
Decepticons and Autobot simultaneously
if you so choose it's a fun little
online time waster and it's free to play
with microsoft released picturesque
lockscreen earlier this week it's a lock
screen replacement application that
updates daily with new wallpapers and it
also gives you access to
like news weather notifications and even
some specific features for you folks in
India is totally free with no in-app
purchases which is a nice touch as well
it's refreshing to see when a sports
news outlet takes to new sporting
platform seriously and that's what the
score has done this last week with their
new eSports app you can view news on
games like dota 2 call of duty
hearthstone and a whole lot more will be
added soon it's a solid app for Yui
