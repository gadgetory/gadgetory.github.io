a lot of people are going to be asking
themselves some interesting questions
like should I sell my note too and
getting us four or which should I buy
the note 2 or the s4 the answer to
either of those questions may be more
interesting than you think hey everybody
I'm Chris look now there are a lot of
factors that might help you decide which
is the better phone for you but first
let's take a look at the specs I'll come
right out and say it
the galaxy s4 wins hands down when it
comes to specs it's not that the note 2
has low end or even mid-range specs when
it comes to what's around it's just that
the s4 has upgraded Hardware all around
it doesn't matter which version of the
s4 you get the note 2's Exynos processor
is slower and even where the specs do
match up the s4 never gets the short end
of the stick
looking at the s4 in the note 2
side-by-side they look well pretty much
the same except one is bigger yeah there
are minor differences mainly size and
camera placement but stack them together
and even the button layout is the same
because the design for both phones is so
similar this all comes down to personal
preferences so with that in mind I'm
calling this one a tie taking a look at
the display you have two options bigger
or better pick one because you can't
have both
the s4 clearly has the sharper display
and the adaptive display feature like it
or not is nice to have around as an
option on the other hand there are
plenty of people who prefer a larger
screen even if it doesn't have the best
resolution available that said I've got
to give this one to the s4 despite the
s4 having better specs I expected this
category to be fairly close I had
already seen the benchmarks compared
before so I wasn't surprised
to see the s4 get an average and to to
score of around 24,000 compared to the
note two's a verge of around 17,500 that
said I actually thought the note tube
might win when it came to Epic Citadel
because of its lower res screen instead
the s4 got an average frame rate of
around 58 frames per second to the note
twos average of around 45 the galaxy s4
runs Android 4.2.2
while the Galaxy Note 2 runs 4.1.2 at
least at the time of this writing so if
you want the newest version of Android
right now and don't already own either
phone well you know what to do when it
comes to other software it's a close
call
the s4 has a lot more features but
whether you'll use them or not is a
different question the note 2 has the S
Pen and related apps which may or may
not be important to you because of the
sheer number of new features the s4 gets
a slight win in this category but it is
a very close call while neither phone
has a bad camera I've got to give the
nod here to the s4 not only does it have
a higher megapixel count and I know
that's not everything but it also seems
to have better color reproduction
generally more rich images and a whole
lot of extra features to boot not to
mention all those other more gimmicky
features that other people may not use
but they're still nice to have if you
want to use them before I started
testing I honestly figured that this
category would be a lock for the note 2
after all it's a bigger battery powering
less demanding hardware what I found
instead is that the note 2 in the s4 are
surprisingly close when it comes to
battery life I had both devices fully
charged when I began testing and
benchmarking and after about 6 and a
half hours the note 2 held the lead but
only barely now at the end of the day
the difference
did show a little more but either of
these devices should offer good battery
life that said the note 2 does have
enough of an edge here to win this round
easily basically for a lot of people the
Galaxy s4 is the winner here if you want
a larger display larger battery or S Pen
functionality then you should go for the
note 2 otherwise go for the s4 here's
the thing a lot of you might be yelling
your screen right now and that's fine
either by the phone you want or be happy
with the one you have that my friends is
