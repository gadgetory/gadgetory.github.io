a dread authority we're reporting live
from Hong Kong and we've come on we've
come here from none other than the Apple
iPhone 5 obviously a brand new device it
features a longer display a thinner
profile and lots of architectural
improvements inside as well as the
latest version of iOS iOS 6 and we're
looking at today at the lg optimus 4x HD
versus iPhone 5 so let's do the
Smackdown guys so getting started with
the size for the lg optimus 4x HD which
I'm just going to call maybe the 4x HD
if you don't mind from here on in we
have a size of 5.2 inches tall by 2.6 8
inches wide and we have a thickness or
thinness of 0.35 inches iPhone 5 is four
point eight seven inches tall 2.3 1
inches wide and it's only 0.3 inches in
making it one of the thinnest devices on
the market today so Fitness goes to the
iPhone and 0.3 inches versus the optimus
4x HD which comes in at 0.35 inches so
let's move on to the weight now for the
optimus 4x HD we have a total weight of
141 grams making it not very heavy but
obviously a little bit heavier compared
to the iPhone 5 iPhone 5 weighs 112
grams making a remarkably thin and
lighter than the hand and obviously due
to its 4-inch screen accessible for
one-handed operation making it nice for
people who want to have one-handed
typing while walking hopefully know
while driving because it's illegal in
many places and it's dangerous but also
just for people who want a slimmer
device that's more profitable now the
optimus 4x HD obviously it's going to be
a little heavier because of its large
display moving onto the processor both
are very powerful devices we have a quad
core Tegra 3 and 1.5 gigahertz with the
optimus 4x HD whereas with the Apple
iPhone 5 we have a a6 dual core 1
gigahertz processor so we have dual core
1 gigahertz a 6 vs arm 9 tiger 31.5
it's quad-core now in terms of the
benchmarks and everything though but the
iPhone 5 is actually slightly more
powerful than the 4x HD and that's just
simply because Apple designed their own
processor which incorporated reference
designs from arm for the next generation
of their SOC technology which powers
roughly over a billion mobile devices as
we made this video moving on to the RAM
both devices feature one gigabyte of RAM
and are highly responsive in their
operation very very fluid obviously no
lag whatsoever
very comfortable now moving on to the
screen size like I've said we have a 4.7
inch screen with true HD IPS LCD with
the option is 4x HD it should be known
just a little bit of background that LG
is one of the finest display makers in
the world and was recently sourced to
create the retina MacBook Pro display
the highest resolution display of any
laptop on the market today and so these
companies are all really embedded with
each other so we have a 1280 by 720 inch
excuse-me 1280 by 720 pixel display on
the 4x HD 4.7 inches giving it a pixel
count of 313 on the iPhone 5 we have the
irregular pixel ray count of 11 36 inch
by 640 giving a pixel count of 326 so we
have 326 PPI for the iPhone 5 and we
have 313 PPI for the 4x HD moving on to
storage the optimus 4x HD has 16
gigabytes but we have expandable memory
so we can have up to 48 gigabytes
within there on the iPhone 5 we have 16
32 and 64 gigabyte iterations depending
on how much you can afford but no
expandable memory so obviously you take
and sometimes you lose
some people they love the idea that they
can just expand their memory they can
just throw an extra memory card in maybe
they have a memory card for music from
videos it's very very convenient anyway
that's just an important feature I
thought I'd mentioned now moving on to
the battery the optimus 4x HD has a 2150
milliamp battery which should power its
screen long way through the day on the
iPhone 5 we have a fourteen hundred
million battery but due to the fact that
the display is so much smaller should
put it in a comparable territory it
should be known to than on both
obviously the iPhone 5 has been designed
so that it cannot be open unless you
have some very exact tools and a desire
to damage your iPhone so the battery
cannot be changed whatsoever and in fact
after 500 charges you will be losing a
lot of battery time so what a year a
year and a half for the 4x HD it is
removable so you can have expandable
memory you can get a large room
excuse me expandable battery you can
have a larger battery pack and have a
larger case or you can simply buy a new
battery if it that's necessary something
nice to think about for down the road
and something that a lot of our visitors
and a lot of other mobile enthusiasts
haven't demonstrated a strong preference
towards now getting into the cameras
both feature 8 so rear cameras with LED
flash now the LG features Sony's quarter
inch IM x11 1pq BSI image sensor with F
204 LED flash as I said obviously
autofocus and is capable of 1080p video
the iPhone 5 just like the optimus 4x HD
is capable of 1080p video as well
it features F 2.4 has a B is back
illuminated sensor obviously autofocus
so they're very very comfortable what
really makes the difference at the end
of the day is the software so front
camera on the optimus 4x HD is 1.3
megapixel giving it a slight edge over
the iPhone 5 which is 1.2 megapixel both
still capable of 720p so for Skype or
FaceTime conversely both are capable of
high res stuff NFC which stands for near
field communication for Google Wallet
for other short-range communication
technology
is on the 4x HD whereas on the iPhone 5
it is omitted it is a technology that
has Apple is chosen not to incorporate
for reasons that they'll probably keep
to themselves in terms of connectivity
the optimus 4x HD features HSDPA plus
Wi-Fi and bluetooth 4 for the iPhone 5
we have LTE HSPA gsm and cdma
equivalents Wi-Fi obviously on bluetooth
for now the availability the optimus 4x
HD is on the market for a price of
around five hundred ninety dollars and
as of today that's for excuse me that's
for an unlock version as well and the
iPhone 5 if you're going to have a
carrier subsidized or new contract
purchase it will be $1.99 $2.99
or 399 so for 16 32 and 64 gigabyte now
obviously we're looking at an Android
device here for the optimus 4x HD kind
of cool one of the latest versions of
Android with jellybean to come LG does
seem to have demonstrated a better
capacity to have prompt updates and we
know the architectural improvements
inherent within Android make it so that
manufacturers will be able to update
their devices in a much more timely
fashion obviously with the iPhone it's
directly controlled by Apple and so
they're able to update and push updates
up to the device quickly and this one
features the latest version of iOS which
is iOS 6 now iOS 6 is interesting people
hate it and they love it generally
people love the iPhone and they all have
iOS except for iTunes for the most part
but there's one big omission here and
that's maps they are no longer using
Google Maps one on the iPhone 5 and from
what I've heard so far and from what I'm
seeing it is vastly inferior to Google's
latest and greatest first time we've
booted up this device we actually just
completely did a factory reset I want to
give you a stock experience so it'll be
the first time that this is coming up
anyway that's not important for the
purposes of this comparison
now this is a UI 3.0 and it's LG's
latest and they dubbed it uninsured
unobtrusive simple to use and it is it's
very intuitive
it's very nice now in terms of the
iPhone 5 this is likely to be probably
one of the best-selling devices of 2012
and beyond they've already sold out
worldwide on their pre-orders they
probably can't even make these things
fast enough
pretty much anything Apple pumps out its
gonna be like that
that's just the way it works and you
can't talk about mobile without
comparing is how iPhone but things are
changing there is a reason why they made
the screen so much larger and when you
consider how large Android devices are
getting for some people that's a good
thing and for others that's the bad
thing but obviously they had to react
and they had to increase the screen size
while still maintaining the same width
and that's for reasons due to the fact
that there's so much third-party
peripherals available for the iPhone be
it speaker docks or you know working in
the car connecting to your stereo and so
forth
other than that the architectural
improvements that they did for the
processor the a6 processor make the
device blazing fast so what we're gonna
do now is we're actually just going to
bring up Android Authority comm I say
hopefully you all know and love and
we're just gonna do a speed test to see
which one's faster okay I cleared the
cache on both so this is a true
legitimate comparison so here we go
three two one go alright so the up Wow
really fast okay so it's refreshing here
we go alright so the iPhone 5 pays to
have the lead here smooth operation
right off the bat pinch to zoom no lag
whatsoever but as we know there is no
flash on the iPhone and we don't have
Flash installed here either so it's
interesting to see it's already
completed on the iPhone very very very
quick very impressive still smooth
operation with the LG obviously
pinch-to-zoom
we know from Android and with taker 3
sometimes if it's not finished loading
it won't be quite as smooth so let's
just continue to wait we have quite a
bit image and data intensive website as
a sense right now and we're fixing it in
the very near future but it this is just
a real-world comparison another thing
that's really interesting to do is just
to turn the device and see how smooth
the operation is very very nice probably
50 60 frames per second on the iPhone 5
very very smooth and let's see it on the
optimus 4x HD there we go ok pretty
smooth
not bad a little bit of light there
either way very comfortable but I have
to hand it to the iPhone in this
particular instance so other than that
iOS 6 does have some improvements to
Siri some people love it some people
don't
it's just that Siri a question
Siri what's the best Android site in the
world
Oh Android phone
hmm I bet you don't like answering that
question do you Seri Seri is Android
better than iPhone 5
Siri does Google make a better mobile
operating system than Apple
does the lawmakers you're on today no I
don't think they've made any
improvements or whatsoever now we don't
have Google now on this because we don't
have jellybeans but from what we've seen
with the latest version of Android that
is could be coming on the lg optimus 4x
HD and other living Android devices it
is the best voice-to-text
solution out there as it stands right
now it isn't only options for X HD so
it's irrelevant for the purposes of this
review what really matters this stuff
like build quality how it feels in the
hand and we really have to hand it to
Apple in this case they really do they
really have created an engineering
marvel we did a drop test on this device
we dropped it four times the screen
didn't crack all that was sustained was
a few dents to the periphery they've
made massive strides the compared to the
iPhone for us it's lighter its thinner
the screen has better resolution display
another thing that's really interesting
to do is let's just do a comparison on
the cameras see how quick they are yeah
we'll just bring them up here just focus
on let's say this s3 here ok good ok
iPhone go okay so let's just focus
okay so we have the flash on so the
purpose is this let's just turn the
flash off because that tends to slow
things down considerably
yeah let's go to our settings
gosh we're gonna turn it off now on this
one yes okay over here we're gonna turn
it off as well okay here we go this is
not easy to do guys I can assure you
okay focus both are focused let's see
so basically iPhone 5 is about twice as
fast as the Optimus 4xh team this
particular use case scenario and just
seeing which pictures are smooth and
high-resolution okay
the lettings get a little dark here but
both are actually really really clear so
these are two of the leading devices in
the world featuring some of the latest
technology on board both are very
impressive pieces that get no question
about that anyway guys this is the first
look hopefully a detailed enough
comparison for you on the lg optimus 4x
HD versus iPhone 5 this is Darcy like a
very reporter in live here from Hong
Kong with Android Authority thanks for
checking in guys we hope you like our
vs. we're going to follow up with the
nice detailed article for you thanks for
