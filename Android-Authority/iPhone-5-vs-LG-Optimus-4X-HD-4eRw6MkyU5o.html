dread authority we're reporting live
from Hong Kong and we've come on we've
come here from none other than the apple
iphone 5 obviously a brand new device it
features a longer display a thinner
profile and lots of architectural
improvements inside as well as the
latest version of iOS iOS 6 and we're
looking at today at the LG optimus 4x HD
vs iphone 5 so let's do the Smackdown
guys so getting started with the size
for the LG optimus 4x HD which I'm just
going to call maybe the 4x HD if you
don't mind from here on in we have a
size of 5.2 inches tall by two point six
eight inches wide and we have a
thickness or thickness of 0.35 inches
iphone 5 is 4.8 seven inches tall 2.31
inches wide and it's only 0.3 inches
thin making one of the thinnest devices
on the markets name so Fitness goes to
the iphone and 0.3 inches versus the
optimus 4x HD which comes in at 0.35
inches so let's move on to the weight
now for the optimus 4x HD we have total
weight of 141 grams making it not very
heavy but obviously a little bit heavier
compared to the iphone 5 iphone 5 ways
112 grams making a remarkably thin and
light in the hand and obviously due to
its four-inch screen accessible for
one-handed operation making it nice for
people who want to have one handed
typing while walking hopefully no while
driving because it's illegal in many
places and it's dangerous but also just
for people who want a slimmer device
that's more profitable now the optimus
4x HD obviously it's going to be a
little heavier because of its large
display moving on to the processor both
are very powerful devices we have a
quad-core tegra 3 and 1.5 gigahertz with
the optimus 4x HD whereas with the apple
iphone 5 we have an a6 dual-core one
gigahertz processor so we have dual core
one-year your hurts a 6 vs arm9 Tegra 3
1.5
its quad-core now in terms of the
benchmarks and everything Dell the
iPhone 5 is actually slightly more
powerful than the 4x HD and that's just
simply because apple design their own
processor which incorporated reference
designs from arm for the next generation
of their SOC technology which powers
roughly over a billion mobile devices as
we make this video moving on to the RAM
both devices feature one gigabyte of RAM
and are highly responsive in their
operation very very fluid obviously no
lag whatsoever very comparable now
moving on to the screen size like I've
said we have a 4.7 inch screen with true
HD IPS LCD with the optimus 4x HD it
should be known just a little bit of
background that LG is one of the finest
display makers in the world and was
recently source to create the retina
macbook pro display the highest
resolution display of any laptop on the
market today and so these companies are
all really embedded with each other so
we have a 1280 by 720 inch excuse me
1280 by 720 pixel display on the 4x HD
4.7 inches giving it a pixel count of
313 on the iphone 5 we have the
irregular pixel count of 11 36 inch x
640 giving a pixel count of 326 so we
have 326 ppi for the iphone 5 and we
have 313 ppi for the 4x HD moving on to
storage the optimus 4x HD has 16
gigabytes but we have expandable memory
so we can have up to forty eight
gigabytes within there on the iphone 5
we have 16 32 and 64 gigabyte iterations
depending on how much you can afford but
no expandable memory so obviously you
take and sometimes you lose
some people they love the idea that they
can just expand their memory they can
just throw an extra memory card in maybe
they have memory card for music from
videos it's very very convenient anyway
that's just an important feature I
thought I'd mentioned now moving on to
the battery the optimus 4x HD has a 2150
mill a battery which should power its
screen long way through the day on the
iPhone 5 we have a fourteen hundred
million battery but do the fact that the
display is so much smaller should put it
in a comparable territory it should be
known to than on both obviously the
iPhone 5 has been designed so that it
cannot be open unless you have some very
exact tools and a desire to damage your
iPhone so the battery cannot be changed
whatsoever and in fact after 500 charges
you will be losing a lot of battery time
so what a year a year and a half for the
4x HD it is removable so you can have
expandable memory you can get a large
room excuse me expandable battery you
can have a larger battery pack and have
a larger case or you can simply buy a
new battery if it that's necessary
something nice to think about for down
the road and something that a lot of our
visitors and a lot of other mobile
enthusiasts haven't demonstrated a
strong preference towards now getting
into the cameras both feature 8 cyl rear
cameras with LED flash now the LG
features Sony's quarter-inch IM x 111 PQ
BSI image sensor with f 204 LED flash as
i said obviously autofocus and is
capable of 1080p video the iphone 5 just
like the optimus 4x HD is capable of
1080p video as well it features f 2.4
has a vis back illuminated sensor
obviously autofocus so they're very very
comfortable what really makes the
difference at the end of the day is the
software so front camera on the optimus
4x HD is 1.3 megapixel giving it a
slight edge over the iphone 5 which is 1
point 2 megapixel both still capable of
720p so for skype or facetime conversely
both are capable of high res stop NFC
which stands for Near Field
Communication for Google Wallet for
other short-range communication
technology
is on the 4x HD whereas on the iPhone 5
it is omitted it is a technology that as
Apple its chosen not to incorporate for
reasons that they'll probably keep to
themselves in terms of connectivity the
optimus 4x HD features hsdpa plus Wi-Fi
and bluetooth for for the iphone 5 we
have LTE HSPA gsm and cdma equivalents
Wi-Fi obviously on bluetooth for now the
availability the optimus 4x HD is on the
market for a price of around five
hundred ninety dollars and as of today
that's for excuse me that's for an
unlocked version as well and the iphone
five if you're going to have a carrier
subsidized or new contract purchase it
will be 199 299 or 399 so for 16 32 and
64 gigabyte now obviously we're looking
at an Android device here for the
optimus 4x HD kind of cool one of the
latest versions of Android with
jellybean to come LG does seem to have
demonstrated better capacity to have
prompt updates and we know the
architectural improvements inherent
within Android make it so that
manufacturers will be able to update the
devices in a much more timely fashion
obviously with iphone it's directly
controlled by Apple and so they're able
to update and push up its up to the
device quickly and this one features the
latest version of iOS which is iOS 6 now
iOS 6 is interesting people hate it and
they love it generally people love the
iphone and they all have iOS except for
itunes for the most part but there's one
big omission here and that's maps they
are no longer using google maps one on
the iphone 5 and from what I've heard so
far and from what I'm seeing it is
vastly inferior to Google's latest and
greatest first time we booted up this
device we actually just completely did a
factory reset I want to give you a stock
experience so it'll be the first time
that this is coming out anyway that's
not important for the purposes of this
comparison
now this is a UI three-point oh and it's
LG's latest and they dubbed it uninsured
unobtrusive simple to use and it is it's
very intuitive it's very nice now in
terms of the iphone 5 this is likely to
be probably one of the best selling
devices of 2012 and beyond they've
already sold out worldwide on their
pre-orders they probably can't even make
these things fast enough pretty much
anything Apple pumps out is going to be
like that that's just the way it works
and you can't talk about mobile without
comparing its how I phone but things are
changing there is a reason why they made
the screen so much larger when you
consider how large Android devices are
getting for some people that's a good
thing and for others that's the bad
thing but obviously they had to react
and they had to increase the screen size
while still maintaining the same width
and that's for reasons due to the fact
that there's so much third-party
peripherals available for the iPhone be
its speaker docks or you know working in
the car connecting to your stereo and so
forth other than that the architectural
improvements that they did for the
processor the a6 processor make the
device blazing fast so what we're going
to do now is we're actually just going
to bring a band road authority calm I
say hopefully you all know and love and
we're just going to do a speed test to
see which one's faster okay I cleared
the cache on Bo so this is a true
legitimate comparison so here we go
three two one go all right so they up
wow really fast ok so it's refreshing
here we go alright so the iphone 5 pays
to have the lead here smooth operation
right off the bat pinch zoom no lag
whatsoever but as we know there is no
flash on the iphone and we don't have
flash installed here either so it's
interesting to see it's already
completed on the iphone very very very
quick very impressive still smooth
operation with the LG obviously pinch to
zoom
we know from Android and with taker 3
sometimes if is not finished loading it
won't be quite as smooth so let's just
continue to wait we have a credible
image and data-intensive website as it
stands right now and we're fixing that
in the very near future but it this is
just a real-world comparison another
thing that's really interesting to do is
just to turn the device and see how
smooth the operation is very very nice
probably 50 60 frames a second on the
iphone 5 very very smooth and let's see
it on the opportunist 4x HD there we go
okay pretty smooth not bad a little bit
of like that either way very comparable
but I have to hand it to the iphone in
this particular instance so other than
that iOS 6 does have some improvements
to Siri some people love it some people
don't it's just that Syria question
Siri what's the best Android site in the
world
Oh android phone I bet you don't like
answering that question do you Siri Siri
is Android better than iphone 5
you like me to search for it
Siri does Google make a better mobile
operating system than Apple
does the lawmakers you're on today no I
don't think they've made any
improvements to it whatsoever now we
don't have Google now on this because we
don't have jelly bean but from what
we've seen with the latest version of
Android that is could be coming on the
lg optimus 4x HD and other living
Android devices it is the best voice to
text solution out there as it stands
right now it isn't only opportunity for
X HD so it's irrelevant for the purposes
of this review what really matters this
stuff like build quality how it feels in
the hand and we really have to hand at
Apple in this case they really do they
really have created an engineering
marvel we did a drop test on this device
we dropped at four times the screen
didn't crack all that was sustained was
a few dents to the periphery they've
made massive strides compared to the
iphone 4s it's lighter it's thinner the
screen has better resolution display
another thing that's really interesting
to do is let's just do a comparison on
the cameras see how quick they are okay
we'll just bring them up here just focus
on let's say this s3 here okay very good
okay
iphone go okay so let's just focus
okay so we have the flash on so the
purpose is this let's just turn the
flash off because that tends to slow
things down considerably
yeah let's go to our settings
gosh we're gonna turn it off now on this
one okay run all over here we're
going to turn it off as well okay here
we go this is not easy to do guys I can
assure you okay focus both are focused
let's see so basically iPhone 5 is about
twice as fast as the opportunist 4x HD
in this particular use case scenario and
just seeing which pictures are smooth
and high resolution okay the lettings
get a little dark here but both are
actually really really clear so these
are two of the leading devices in the
world featuring some the latest
technology on board both are very
impressive pieces to get no question
about that anyway guys this is the first
look hopefully a detailed enough
compared serve you on the lg optimus 4x
HD vs iphone 5 this is Darcy like a very
reporting live here from Hong Kong with
android authority thanks for checking in
