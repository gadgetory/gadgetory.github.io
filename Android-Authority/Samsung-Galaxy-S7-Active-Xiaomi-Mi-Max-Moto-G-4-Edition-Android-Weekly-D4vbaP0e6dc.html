leaky boat let's check it out the
existence of the Samsung Galaxy s7
active is hardly a secret with Samsung
itself no leaking in the name a while
back but this is the first time we've
caught multiple photos of it in the wild
the latest batch of photo shows the ETD
Galaxy s7 in all its rugged rubberized
glory and oh boy the thing is built like
a tank the plastic back panel is also
removable but there's no word yet on a
removable battery according to the
source of the leak Samsung VN the chunky
mix of polycarbonate and rubber encasing
the s7 active meets military standards
for drop damage as was the previous
active variants the capacitive keys are
gone replaced by waterproof physical
buttons the same shape as the home
button the IP rating is still ip68
meaning it is dustproof and water
resistance for up to 30 minutes and up
to a meter of water although we've seen
multiple emergent tests that show it
working perfectly fine a lot longer than
that now the Samsung Galaxy s7 active is
reportedly powered by a Snapdragon 820
with 4 gigabytes of ram 80 should
announce the phone any day now which
shouldn't cost more than the regular
Galaxy s7 thoughts on the Galaxy s7
active is the regular s7 in a bumper
case any better let me know and the
xiaomi me max is set to be unveiled on
Tuesday May tenth tomorrow and to mark
the upcoming event the company has
released a series of videos as a tribute
to the event countdown and the launch of
the me max with a six point four four
inch display at 1080p resolution Demi
max is in clear phablet territory but at
an affordable price which Xiaomi has
become renowned for the device is widely
expected to be powered by a Snapdragon
650 system-on-a-chip two gigabytes of
ram 4500 million power battery a 15
megapixel camera and 16 gigabytes of
storage with a super thin profile with
what appears to be a curved metal back
similar to recently released Xiaomi
devices although the me max is slated to
be unveiled soon it likely won't see a
US release date anytime soon if at all
now let's talk about the ever-popular
Moto G particularly the Moto
for last week Motorola gave us these
cryptic images regarding an upcoming
device they use a series of somewhat odd
missing-person style tweets to hint that
this upcoming phone will be focused on
improved battery life security
performance and a camera but more recent
links from Roland quant tell us the
following number one the Moto G fourth
edition is allegedly being called a
themed internally number two that will
apparently be two configurations of the
Moto G fourth edition I retail low-end
model with two gigabytes of RAM and 16
gigabytes of on-board storage and a
higher end model with three gigabytes of
RAM and 32 gigabytes of on-board storage
number three the lower end model will
have a 13 megapixel rear camera with
laser focus and autofocus and the higher
end model will have a 16 megapixel
camera with laser focus and autofocus
also for both models will have a 5
megapixel front-facing camera and last
up we learn that mobile phones actually
don't cause brain cancer after all we've
all been told a lot of things that may
or may not be true over the course of
our lives don't swim an hour after
eating drink water upside down to cure
hiccups and cell phones cause brain
cancer however a new 30 year study out
of Australia claims that there is no
correlation between cell phone usage and
incidences of brain cancer you guys
remember from like 15 years ago when
people were making money hand over fist
in the.com bubble remember we didn't
call it a dotnet bubble or dot-org
bubble we didn't call them dot biz
billionaires we called them dot-com
billionaires because that's the power of
a dot-com now why is that because no
