original android hang out chill on
google+ i'm derek ross and i'm scott
anderson this week we're joined by
returning gasps Johnathan Franklin John
thanks for coming again we appreciate it
good say everybody and what's that well
what's that new device you get with you
I have received today about lunchtime a
verizon version of the galaxy note 2 so
yeah we'll talk a little bit later cool
alright so this week on the agenda we
have some app updates uh ingress just
got an update moments ago so wow you're
listening or watching to us go ahead and
download your angers update google drive
did some stuff chrome netflix and amazon
is big in japan for device updates we're
going to talk about in the droid DNA the
galaxy note 2 on verizon that John has
actually we're gonna talk about some
leaks and of course written in ramen
with some Nexus devices patent wars we
always talk about and though we're going
to be giving some stuff away we're going
to give it away to ingress codes and
we're going to be giving away a code to
enter on our website for a chance to win
a nexus 10 because who wouldn't want a
free Nexus 10 right and then we're gonna
close up with some Derek whiny time is
Dan you can't be here this evening uh
likes to call where I'm going to talk
about how i sold my nexus for today and
why I know it's a sad sad day but it but
we'll get to that later so so uh Android
ecosystem stuff we're gonna get to as
well so Scott app updates I Apple tits
uh ingress just pushed an app updates uh
no changelog so we don't really know
what's in it so download with caution
um I guess because this other week
posting updates with no changelog data
we did oh no I installed it in my game
didn't like blow up or anything so yeah
but shame on them for no changelog and I
will assume that they're gonna update it
very soon with a all change log um good
yeah so no changelog on Google Drive got
updated this is a pretty big update you
can edit google spreadsheets in the new
native editor that's a native editor
which is awesome um it's really really
nice it's on tablets on the Nexus 7 it
is a lot better and it's getting to be a
full-fledged pc interface for google
drive it's really cool um you can edit
contents of tables in Google Docs editor
you can also formatting is maintained
when copying pasting within Google Docs
that was kind of an annoyance you can
also single tap to enter edit mode in
google docs and you can add a shortcut
to drive files or folders to your home
screen that's a nice addition and you
can also send a link that supports
copying link to the clipboard now this
is a new introduction let's say you were
going to share a link from a website um
in your share options you have copy link
to clipboard or shared a clipboard so
that was kind of a new interesting
addition um I think that they should
have had that in stock Android not just
drive but it actually came in the drive
update so that's kind of cool I'm going
to be using that and i have been using
that a lot chrome got updated and a very
short change log this version includes a
number of stability fixes and
performance improvements for me
personally it was a great update a lot
of performance improvements and
stability fixes definitely deserves a
bigger changelog than what they gave you
because it it's a lot better yeah i
actually knows it
it was a lot faster on my Nexus 4 that
is in a box now and my Nexus 7 and
Galaxy Nexus I I open it up on all the
devices and it seemed like it actually
did perform a little bit better and I
was actually a topic last week we were
talking about how chrome is not doing
yeah it's not what we would like it to
be at on Android I mean it has all the
bells and whistles that we love and we
use daily you know it has you know cloud
sync it syncs your tabs I mean that's a
huge I use that every day going from
three different devices and computers
and everything that's great but every
once a while it just seems slow to me
yeah I use in love it you know I I don't
care but a lot of people don't like the
fact that it's a little choppy from time
to time so yeah it definitely improved
on the the choppiness when you open a
link and you start scrolling down you
know you get that you wait for it when
it Scrolls down and it's just very
choppy um it's improved some um so much
so that you actually notice it which is
it's really nice it's definitely a lot
quicker um but it's a good update I
think a big case scenario of what came
with the performance people knocking it
was especially with jellybean the stock
AOSP browser were so good so I mean
really just buttery smooth and you go
from that chrome and it's pretty
noticeable going back and forth between
the two even though chrome has a little
bit more what you'd like to see like
what Derek mentoring with sinking tabs
and sinking almost every you know having
the other bookmarks folders and
everything tied into it but it's good to
see get close to the AOSP browser
because it is more secure and it does
you know implements and boxing so there
wasn't an outfit on google+ that does
this week that chrome looks to more
align themselves with the desktop
version of chrome in terms of version
numbers and api levels in the in the
near future so that that's something to
look forward to to really the think that
they should just focus I mean for the
time being on parole
and get it up to stuff once it's an
performance then they can start adding
with whatever they want but for the time
being I want it to be able to be to
replace my you know another browser I
want that to be the elite browser like
it is on the desktop s'okay know since
we keep talking about browsers here
what's your browser a choice for your
android device you rock and dolphin you
know stock browser Chrome Firefox
something else aqua or let us let us
know in the comments it's a just for
just for the heck of it and ok let's
move on to another app update on netflix
got it kind of a complete redesign for
the player added some features and you
get a larger volume button you got um
easy scrubbing for longer videos and
scrubbing the scenes and you have
scrubbing screen stills kind of like on
YouTube that was recently introduced a
couple months ago and then added support
for android for not to and improve
stability and playback bug fixes which
haunted some devices that made people
very angry um but you know what my
sister was recently complaining that on
her nexus 7 the netflix app ever since
she got the android 4.2 update had been
junk so you know if you're a big netflix
user such as my sister you have a nexus
7 i'm sure these enhancements and fixes
will will be much appreciated um and
then the amazon appstore is now in japan
um the to our listeners in Japan I'm
sure I'm sure we have some you know what
time is that relation um yeah so that's
a kind of a big push for Amazon their
arm and also to add navigation is in
Mexico I'm self that fully launched out
so we're going to do an ingress invite
now
for those of people that don't have
invites that have never played it before
could you give a little bit of a
description on what ingresses because I
know that there's been a lot of media
buzz about it on google+ and people some
people don't know what it is all right
so before I talk about what ingress is
that's what we're going to do this week
is we're going to give the code away in
the comments of the post of the original
post something different than last week
so on the android authority google+ page
so if you're watching this on youtube or
somebody else's stream that shared this
post go to the original post and i'll
give you a minute while i talk about all
the good that is ingress so anyways I'm
gonna paste the code on that post and
you're gonna have to hit refresh you
have to be the first one to see it and
be the first one to enter it into the
application the app on your phone so
make sure you have the app open and
you're watching on the android authority
stream live right now from the Ender
thori thori megabyte file so if they're
on 2d or edge um you might want to give
them a little bit of time right so so
I'll give you at least two minutes here
right so so ingress is an augmented
reality game so what that means is I'm
gonna hold my phone up in front of me
and I look at it and I see something
different than I see in the real world
such as little orbs of blue floating
around or swirly portals or little
resonators the little metal metallic
objects on the ground they'll actually
see those in front of me but I see them
on my scanner also known as my ingress
app so you walk around your town your
city your area you collect energy and
you use that energy to fuel your scanner
to be able to perform tasks so forth
like a hack a portal on unity you try to
take over a new portal or an enemy
portal existing portal all that good
stuff yeah then we'll click on Scott's
here to show you what it looks like okay
so that's God he has some little blue
dots he needs to go get to get more
power um anyways so there's two factions
in the game you have the resistance and
the enlightened the enlightened thinks
this new energy source is good for you
it's
go to better the human race and the
resistance says oh no um the Energy's
bad it's going to ruin humanity f that's
there's a lot more into that there's a
huge backstory there's new information
in this conspiracy theories there's a
lot of backstory a lot of gang war you
know for lack of better words besides
just playing the games you can really
get into it it's really google google
nanak Labs is done don't have awesome
stuff to make this actually really fun
she can get as little involved as you
want anyways without further ado let's
get to the code he writes so I'm gonna
copy the code here I'm gonna paste it on
the stream right now so if I'm 5555 yeah
you got to remember the nexus the nexus
4 launch a f5 you might want to start
doing right now and then let us know
when you win just so we can say your
name and praise you and post comment
have at it refreshing go right so well
someone is getting very happy and while
many people are getting very mad that's
uh let's continue on with some android
news then will refresh that comment
stream there and see you the big bad
winner is so Android news this week
android 4.2 point 1 is rolling out to
devices now with more december and
depending on your device there's no
minor bug fixes a little bit of
bluetooth fixes to you know depending on
your device screen flicker so forth
actually uh people on Nexus 7 and
reporting it seeing around little
smoother for them so yeah good you know
updates are good but the biggest thing
that most people really notice is
December's there now the People app um
nexus for it just in time for December
their time it was good you know what I
didn't well that's we'll get to that
later ah no no we'll get to it now
actually so on my Nexus 7 I decided not
to a DBZ side load the update i wanted
to see how long until it pushed out to
me just just because i don't normally do
that normally a source of downloads
available i install it so
the update hasn't been pushed to me yet
and my birthday is in December ax my
birthday's in about 12 days so I better
get that update soon area not happy is
it a day before mine uh mine is the 11th
big guy when's yours Oh 14 14 there you
go all right you give me Fresno get you
a present start shopping now we needed
this update yeah exactly we do this up
something's actually for Scott night
anyways so yeah so the nexus 4 Nexus 7
Nexus 10 all got it a couple days ago
and now it's rolling out to the GSM
Galaxy Nexus as well is it rolling out
to the Sprint Galaxy Nexus or the
verizon galaxy nexus well no because it
there it's actually three updates now
behind it you know those devices don't
have four point one point to you
definitely don't have 4.2 and they
definitely don't have the one that just
came out so I happy happy cdma carriers
everyone Derek since you didn't get the
update i'm going to give my perspective
of getting the update uh the the
problems that i had with it before with
the four not to update arm seem to be
alleviated um a lot of the stability
issues that had um seem to be gone it's
not restarting anymore and it's not
doing things that it shouldn't do so I
think it's a good update so I'm
wondering now I'm wondering if the
people watching you know we do have a
little less viewers than we normally do
this week right now because there's
there's actually a Daria musk concert
going on right now and everybody in
their brothers watch next she's an
amazingly talented young lady and so I'm
sure people are watching that I mean
you're gonna watch you know Daria musk
sing you know you're gonna are you look
at you know my ugly face and Scott I
mean and John yeah it exactly right
don't look don't exclude me from that
club so so what we're fighting worried
about how about ten percent down than
what we're normally is you were wise but
hey that's okay so it's always that
codes out there I don't see anybody
saying they won yet you know so give it
to your friend your brother your sister
your whatever you make
in the jungle game should say it
verbally and say yeah well they can say
it verbally but we won't hear them so
comment anyways moving on before we uh
so yeah so you have those a nexus
devices that have the update you can go
in a tepee side load them if you don't
have them yet you can install the
factory images or you can wait for
Google to push it out to you we run a
custom rom that most of them already
have that enabled so let's talk about
some devices here now the HTC droid DNA
the kernel source was released for that
today and we know last week we talked
about on the show that the bootloader is
now unlocked via a nice exploit so
thanks to devs you can now have a
unlocked and rooted in custom recovery
droid DNA and this week I said as of
today the kernel source was released by
HTC which will lead to better smoother
faster more awesome custom roms and
custom kernels so why is this good well
it gives it gives you more choice if you
don't like sense and you want a more
pure AOSP experience so yeah this is
great it's great news for developers and
more importantly I'm excited because our
friend Dan Charlton is an HTC kernel
developer he has developed kernels for
probably about 40 different HTC devices
over the past couple years I'm gonna
hammer him until he makes a droid DNA
colonel just because he hasn't made a
colonel and improv and probably a year
he probably out now a public colonel
sorry Dan I don't mean to shut down he
makes his Colonels for himself he
doesn't publicly released them anymore
he's so anyway anyways I'm gonna you
know hammer on him to get a new kernel
out there alright so that big device
announcement this week the samsung
galaxy note 2 which officially launched
today on verizon for three hundred
dollars to 99 on a two-year contract and
for those of you that don't know the
note 2 is a beast it has android you
know 4.1 jellybean quad-core Exynos
processor 1.6 gigahertz two
gigs of ram 8 megapixel rear camera and
1.9 front-facing camera now the the
verizon edition has an additional add-on
that other carriers do not the verizon
logo is stamped right in the middle of
the home button so John our buddy here
actually snagged one of these devices
today did I did and I've been playing
around with it since i'm at one o'clock
today holy review here on brett has as
banded as expected samsung branded with
no 4G LTE plastered all over the back
just like though everyone you would ever
get um general overview is a very smooth
device of course every device feels
amazingly smooth and fast when you first
get it but um battery life is incredibly
good from what I've had from it because
setting the device up I had booted it up
on the battery and it never charged and
start about sixty four percent
downloaded all my applications and
synced up contacts and everything and I
had about five percent battery left I
had a little bit over five hours with
the screen on time and that was using it
the entire time obviously had this
screen on playing around with an old
babe um i guess if you want to
differentiate because there are so many
reviews on so many other carriers it
does come with the amazon software suite
like pretty much every verizon branded
carry hey that's a new good verizon's
doing now huh there there get there
coming with the fo amazon sweet honey
you can expect this on the DNA and
probably any device to have that's not a
pure you know Nexus or Google Experience
device in the future to be honest would
you know how many apps is that um yeah I
mean are you are you going to include
the samsung apps that you're not going
to use in this no no no just in the
Amazon sweet yeah um let me let me count
for you real quick like for now it's
more than four because it includes IMDb
and zappos com which actually doesn't
bother me that bad but
as imdb's useful we cannot shout all the
zappos too can you uninstall them know
you can disable them like ICS so yeah
you can expect the Amazon applications
they're locked in the system partition
it does come with the full suite of
Google applications too so if you google
books magazines music all that comes
loaded as well then you have the samsung
you know typical apps s voice and it
does come with a few verizon apps like
NFL mobile it does come with you know
the my verizon and back up a system is
built in theirs feels right until I wear
apps it's you know I guess it's not
quite as bad compared to the past where
you had a city ID and all that other
comes to ya then I love it still comes
with a lot of applications / just how
Verizon alright John so I guess I got a
question for obviously you opted to get
the note 2 over the DNA why is that
where you know right now you know
there's probably people watching or
listening that are up for a new phone
they couldn't get the nexus for that you
know they're they're on verizon you know
should they get the note to the the DNA
why did you make your choice um the
reason i leaned to the note 2 is after
playing with the nexus 7 for a little
while it wasn't really feasible for me
to use the nexus 7 that often because i
don't use Wi-Fi at work or anything like
that and i didn't for like tethering off
a phone so for me the screen size is a
bonus i enjoy the screen size if you're
debating on whether is this phone too
big for you i would say if you're in a
situation like I was where you had a
Galaxy Nexus and you moved to it it's
really not that much of a change if
you're up early this coming five inches
because there's a 5.5 inch display and
the DNA is a 5-inch so you gotta happen
that DNA is a little bit narrower I
would say if you're coming from a device
like a nexus or say a razor or something
that form factor it's not going to shock
you when you pick up the device it's
going to be
but it's not going to blow your mind or
anything um you know because the first
time I had a 4.7 inch phone I was like
oh my god this is way too much but now
it's yesterday i remember when i
whenever their marketing is working
they've conditioned us to it so so those
of you that are watching right now or
listening later in the week if you're on
verizon and you're gonna be getting a
new phone you know let us know in the
comments are you opt-in for the DNA are
you opt-in for the note 2 or something
else maybe you're going for you know
RAZR MAXX HD or sumthin listen you know
why did you choose which device or which
device would you choose if you were on
verizon i guess the question would be
and now's the time to get a device on
verizon because i always flood their
options around the holiday season so
that's when they always get their good
phone so they can make a ton of money
and be a happier carrier I wonder if I
have one last question so you just got
this device did you get it on a two-year
contract I did not I bought it at retail
to keep on limited because the way my
usage pattern worked out I would have
ended up paying more in the long run by
adopting the plans that they have
there's about it's not a
two-hundred-dollar difference over the
course of two years for me of course i'd
encourage anybody else to try out there
what was the food the retail price in
that 600 rich illness is 700 700 and i
still saved money compared to go into a
share plan so you're a big data user how
much data do you use a month hmm well if
i'm still unlimited don't really even
think about it anymore um I can go yeah
i've been using Wi-Fi more often because
my home Internet's gotten better but I
still stream a lot of music when I'm on
the road so that's probably my biggest
killer I could probably if I was frugal
about it I could probably cut myself
down to a 5 gigabyte a month or so pilot
and get away with that but I don't
really want to I don't want to have to
think about it every month when i'm on
my phone out where i'm just having the
hassle of it
alright so another device speaking of
notes had some news this week the
samsung galaxy note the original vog vog
note had a nice leak for android 4.1
point2 right now remember it's on not
ICS and it launched with with
Gingerbread so this will be the second
major update for the original note
besides you know project butter standard
jelly bean features google now it's also
going to get multi-view smart rotation
some widgets that the galaxy s3 has two
home screen modes and stuff like that
when is it gonna officially be out oh
yeah who knows um you know maybe by the
end of the year which is only a month or
sometime you know in 2013 nobody really
knows yet but soon you know once you
start seeing leaks generally generally
they come you know within a couple
months well they don't come at all it
depends on the device six months later
it's still leaking and you know what see
what's going on yeah let's talk about
some reasons and ramen so cm10 um 10 dot
one is out for the nexus 4 and nexus 10
it's doing the solo yeah soon to follow
um so do these devices need custom roms
i'm going to ask our viewers and if you
know you know what or why they need to
custom roms give your argument if they
don't need them give your argument and
we're gonna discuss in here while you
guys discuss in the comments and then
we're gonna reflect in the comments so
it's got you recently were a guide and
would not route all the things and do
too i'm gonna say myself i'm gonna take
full credit for it you know picking on
you week after week after week you
finally rooted your Galaxy Nexus and
you're in your nexus 7 too ok so I have
a view about tablets phones alright so
so so you're on both sides of the block
here you didn't root you eventually read
your phone
so the now you you're gonna be getting
the nexus for what do you what do you
plan on doing with that okay well that's
ordered I'm have a Galaxy Nexus right
now and it's rooted and it's added the
routing has added a lot more
functionality that I have that I you
know I have my phone wherever I am so
it's nice and I can have this a lot more
features and more control over my device
with Colonel settings and things like
that with regards to battery life um
that's a big thing too okay so so with
you know there's no argument here that
the Verizon Galaxy Nexus has
battery life okay it has it has LTE lt's
a battery hog and the battery just isn't
the greatest thing on the planet so now
the nexus 4 in my opinion has great
battery life compared to the Galaxy
Nexus and on tablet tablets have a great
battery life too so if you're not trying
to squeeze more juice out of you know
the nexus for the nexus 10 what would
you read either of them if either of ya
yeah i think you know it probably worth
differentiating because when we speak
about CM or AOKP we're talking about a
I'm really modified not you know not
heavily modified but a modified version
from what you would compile from source
from google um i do i would unlock the
device and keep some features related to
having root access but even with my
verizon galaxy nexus i really didnt
toward especially toward the end when
see them and this no knock it all to the
dev team because i know it's hard to
keep up with Google because Google is
moving so fast but if got to the point
where I felt like by the time they
finally kind of got it stable Google
would push another version of Android
where they have to start all over again
to merge all the changes back over again
and really really since ice cream
sandwich I haven't had as much of a need
or feel to have to modify the devices
edly its compared to back when it was
Gingerbread and there was something
sorely lacking and uh you know you might
miss the toggles or something but their
applications for and I just didn't have
as much of a need for a lot of the
custom features that and I know a lot of
other people appreciate it but I ran
bugless beast on my verizon the galaxy
nexus 4 that's over a point of four
months and I really didn't even flash
every update he posted cuz i'm so happy
with it and you know what john i tell
you my thoughts on that I'm he can say
it but but I'm really with you right now
I'm running mozzies Rama my verizon
galaxy nexus as soon as pure Alfonso
drops bugless beast I know it's going to
be faster than what I have right now I
know it's gonna be more stable even
though it's decently fast and there's no
problems I just know that that's his
track record because Iran jelly bean
bugless beast and compared it to you
know cm and i love the customizations on
CM that took me many months to actually
start running CM because you know out it
yeah there was lag you know it was a bit
was beta firmware of course it's not
gonna be up too far you know but yeah it
is yeah I didn't expect anything other
than that upper team but and it's a
different store when you're talking
about nexus one then when you're talking
about yeah when dogs s3 and you're
having a portal whole thing over and did
proprietaries compatible anyway so so me
my nexus 7 i've had since the day that
you could get it i pre-ordered it the
moment well actually i pre-ordered it
may be like a couple hours actually
before the pre-order was announced
because the link was hidden but but
anyways that's besides the point i've
had it since you could get it and i have
a new one now because i had an issue
with mine but i never rooted mine i ran
in mine stock there was no need for me
to root my tablet I mean am I gonna do
the I looked into it you know I asked
myself why do I want route like all
power toggles I need those those like
wait a second the only reason I want
power toggles on my phone is to try to
squeeze more battery life out of it
tablets have great battery life I don't
need power toggles and that's me you
know I mean everybody's different so I
kept my I didn't even unlock my
bootloader until I put ubuntu on on my
Nexus 7 you know uh
I didn't need it and you know I did and
that's weird to me because I'm the guy
that was flashing it you know a new rom
you know every week for a year with miui
know it flashed two different roms and
work on the clock just to have something
to do you know I know my galaxy nexus I
flash a lot of roms on there but now
it's really to the point where my nexus
for that I had for the past two weeks um
I didn't unlock the bootloader on I
didn't read it I wasn't going to i was
going to keep it completely stock for as
absolutely long as possible because i
couldn't the only thing i could think of
that i wanted was ad block that's you
know that's the only thing I wanted to
do is block ads and as I got I whatever
i'll go ahead and give the you know the
developers their their money you know
i'll support the devs i won't block
their ads and that's the only thing it
boiled down to I mean I don't do the
penetration testing zandt I anymore on
all my devices I you know I don't need
to do that I don't need to use any you
know Wi-Fi sniffers I don't need to do
all that stuff now and with with the
latest version of jelly bean you really
don't need some of the things now the
quick settings aren't power toggles
they're just not either they take the
same amount of taps so it's really
annoying i think that that's one of the
things that is lacking in would be nice
what Scott there's a custom rom rom I'm
running right now that let's say Oh for
those of you that are watching you don't
try to bring this up on my screen here
so all the power toggles are actually
like there there's a lot more as you can
see there's torch there there's uh
there's the vibration that you know
they've added everything that is
normally there in a toggle and I and
they actually work so if I any boy even
like a Wi-Fi driver hit Wi-Fi gosh I'm
not do Trevor for bringing that to you
what's up you might want to send a
shout-out to Trevor for bringing that
functionality to you in your custom
ramen no oh cuz I'm running in it that
to you yeah yeah that's a good you could
throw that one out there huh so anyways
uh we've even in the fur ly
about this when we move on here so well
we have
more thing those tiles the quick toggles
they need to make them smaller they take
up a obnoxious amount of space and they
can they are don't make them smaller
google make them smaller I'd so so let's
get it alright alright so those of you
the watch last week for the nexus 10
international giveaway and then watch it
again and then watched over the week
prior the previous two weeks prior for
the nexus for international giveaway you
notice that my man Scott Anderson is he
has some issues giving stuff away I mean
he must not want to give stuff away I
don't know he so the first week that he
announced the contest he he announced
the code is back door instead of back
order and a whole lot of you know sexual
innuendos happened and a lot of fun was
had on his expense so this week we're
gonna be kind enough to give him a fifth
try to give away a device I will not
fail alright alright so on the Nexus 10
international giveaway so all you people
in USA I can join the party with
overseas okay so in order to enter this
competition or this giveaway the link
we're posting the comments Derek can you
please post that link in the comment
toasted for you big guy thank you okay
uh this we're going to do is going to go
down on the bottom of that post so i
basically it's android authority calm
it's the first article link on the top
and you just follow the instructions for
the rafflecopter subscribe follow Like
Tweet to get entries +1 google+ right
and then there's a section that you can
enter a code for the code for this week
is the code is back door okay so i'm
going to work off my failure and the
code is actually going to be my failure
which was back door so if you just enter
back door knows
cases you will be good to go and you'll
get another engine and that is in said
no spaces if it's spelled back door as
in the back door of your house um or you
can yeah so moving on carrier news so
across the pond over in the UK e which
is the UK's only LTE service has
increased their data cap which young who
doesn't one more data customers there
that were on a 2 gigabyte allowance will
see that increased to three gig a little
bit more three gig users will get that
bumped up to five and five gigabyte
users will have their data cap increased
the whole way up to eight gig and all
that your monthly fees are going to
remain the same all i have to say with
that is AT&amp;amp;T Verizon are you paying
attention to what your friends are doing
across the pond that's what that's what
AT&amp;amp;T is at though all verizon's on no no
III know but I think AT&amp;amp;T found a plan
that I think a lot of carriers are gonna
go to UM whether it's good or bad is
it's not you know my perspective but um
I think they're gonna they found a good
way to do that but yeah more data
awesome and so let's let's talk about
little bit of patent wars there was two
notable things this week in the news
Oracle verse Google oracle dropped the
patent infringement claims against cool
um and they're only appealing on API
copyright issues so that's that that has
been an ongoing thing for how long yeah
and that that's you know that's good i
guess that they're just gonna focus on
the APR they're just gonna focus you
know on that but I I think that they're
still you know walking away with their
tail between their legs on this one so
they're just trying to save some face
yeah um and then
motorola verse immersion so motorola is
ending haptic feedback patent dispute
merchants CEO responded gleefully to the
agreement that both sides have reached
the successful resolution of this case
is a critical step in our overall
strategy of enforcing and monetizing our
intellectual property including basic
haptics and we're pleased to achieve a
settlement that is consistent with our
business model which is largely based on
per unit running royalties so when
there's a patent dispute that is agreed
upon and going to stop that's a good
thing yep we don't like the patent wars
and the baton wars have died down in the
news and i remember those months were it
was definitely blown out of proportion
and there was a lot of gifts about it
we'll just wait until March whenever the
next major round of apple vs samsung
comes to light in the courts here in the
US we go about three months of slower
times and then a little it'll pick back
up don't device list is like a long
grocery list so as our friend Dan
Charlton likes to say let's get into
derek's whiny time where I want to whine
about yeah you know Dan I don't like
that I'm not whining I'm informing our
viewers of things that I'm going through
the day may your one who themselves all
right so last week there's on last
week's with Adelaide show three days ago
or four days four days ago sorry so a
few days ago um I told everybody that on
Thanksgiving Day my nexus 7 my beloved
tablet that I used every day it died I'm
willing to get into what happened the
point is that it died in Google replaced
it and they sent me another one I got it
actually on Tuesday so you know from the
holiday weekend that was nice I mean I
had it I talked to them on Friday black
friday and I had it on Tuesday not bad I
was impressed I was happy and you know
what uh it was it was like it was like
taking the
off of a fine lady you know unboxing
that Nexus device no it keeps getting
sexier and sexier every time you do it
and in god I loved it you know i love it
i love this tablet so one thing that did
kind of annoy me know and i don't know
if it was because this is a replacement
unit i'll know if it's a refurbished
unit or not I don't know if didn't look
like one it didn't say that it was one
but anyways um it was kind of annoying
to go through the entire update process
for every single update that is
available I was kind of hoping that it
would start up with 4.1 and be like hey
look here's a massive update to 4.2 and
that's what I was expecting or I mean I
knew it was going to come with 4.2 or I
was hoping it would be something
different but no it booted up a 4.1 and
then after you know a few minutes I was
told to install four point one point one
like okay yeah maybe after I get four
point one point one that'll be straight
to 4.2 or straight to four point two
point one yes something like that note
it be rebooted after that update and
said hey here's four point one point two
it's very nice you were going with this
installs it reboots soon as the boots
back up within a few seconds of signing
on the Wi-Fi hey here's 4.2 chug chug
chug chug chug download that big update
install that update and reboot again and
yeah I didn't get the update for four
point two point one immediately I was I
was actually thinking I would get it but
i think i remember with my xoom tablet
it did the same thing and never thought
factory reset it back to you know pushed
bone stock like whenever the i can or
the first software if they update after
the LT hardware upgrades i had to run
through a couple of versions of
honeycomb and then run through the
versions of ice cream sandwich and then
go now being so so so apparently the
nexus 7 isn't the only one where they
don't
created upgrade path directly to the
most recent I mean so let's say a brand
new user that just got the nexus 7 this
you know round of maybe they wanted the
the 32 or the yet the 32 gate right and
they get the 32 gig and they're gonna
have to go through all these update
that's going to let's go upset you know
I think that's going to make somebody
mad maybe I'm reading too much into it
both I can picture somebody that's not
to tech-savvy you know waste in the
first half hour they have the tablet
just installing updates that's going to
be kind of annoying don't you think not
only can be annoying i mean i know a lot
of people that have both people that
have apple devices they don't update
their stow okay so i mean hi ladies
will definitely benefit the user and i
think they'll be okay though because
they don't want to lose google maps no
friend of a friend of mine oh they don't
have it up because they don't even know
how to do it yeah friend of Mines wife
updated to iOS 6 and is furious like
wanting to get rid of the phone because
of it because its applications force
closing all over the place and stuff
just not working out on iphone 4 and as
to the point that she's looking to get
another phone now and so and that saves
the bigger bigger complaint than
anything is that they'll upgrade you to
the newest software and it's slow or
it's laggy yards buggy and it's I've
seen a lot of people get mad about that
oh yeah I got a good question for me you
listener um been bagger Bagley asked do
you guys see any tablets beating the
nexus 7 at a similar price point anytime
soon I'm getting a refund for mine since
Google decided to replace my second
defective device with a third one
contemplating waiting for something new
or getting a 32 gigabyte version for a
from a brick-and-mortar store what do
you guys I think that the nexus 7 wow it
did just receive more storage space it's
five months old you know it came it came
out in the end of the end of june
beginning of july it's 51 so and that's
okay um CES
is in about six weeks I mean if you need
a tablet get a nexus 7 again if you can
wait till after I mean even closer to
the holidays you know when we start
seeing some leaks of so something's
gonna be announced at CES I agains a lot
of CES devices don't get launched until
the spring so you know that's another
you know for for what was that droid on
the droid phone that was like six months
after oh yeah the Bionic Oh remember
though that was ridiculous it's you know
who knows um it's a tough call ah if you
need to tag it if you need a tablet get
a tablet you know it there's nothing
worse than waiting for an unannounced
device and if you do wait for CES you
know that the price is most likely going
to go down where you can find a cheaper
one that's used so if you wait it's
going to get cheaper um a two things
anything samsung could capitalize on the
7-inch note device if they've ever put
it on the market I think they could I
really don't think if you like on I
think if you took a note and put it they
have to license the technology from way
comps let's say you put it a three
hundred dollar price range or so or less
and made a 7-inch tablet with good
hardware specifications it I think that
would sell extremely well so if you need
a tablet get a tablet if you don't need
one wait for CES and check out the
goodness of CES which is always fun to
do yeah that's what we're going to say I
think I'm gonna tempt with that alright
so are you can one more Derek whiny
segment and then we'll get into the boys
always said oh yeah yeah one more and
then we'll get into the the last
giveaway the scene they will give away
our second ingress ingress code and
we'll do the same way just uh just
because it's fun to paste in the
comments and and watched you guys fight
over it we're sadistic release time
statistics okay so it's my nexus 4 i
said earlier that i sold it um and how's
that was a very hard decision those of
you that know me or follow my my whiny
posts about the nexus 4
artemy actually getting it know that I
wanted that device very bad loves me
some Android right and if you know a new
Nexus device is gonna come out obviously
I'm gonna try to get it and I'm gonna
want it not gonna love it and it's gonna
be the best thing since sliced bread um
you know as Chris Rizzo said he's a
android duff fan he's you know he called
me an ace sheep instead of an i sheep
but I was okay with that call me an a
sheep I don't care so it will so I want
the nexus 4 it was the best thing since
sliced bread and it's a great device
absolutely loved it device is amazing it
feels great in your hand it's Finn it it
works great it's fast it's leaps and
bounds over the I mean it really is it
is that much better than the Galaxy
Nexus but unfortunately i live in the
middle of nowhere and verizon has a
strong hold on pretty much all of
pennsylvania especially central PA
verizon is the top dog here and 18t
hasn't done anything in this area for
like seven years I'm and I mean it's
still edge everywhere uh maybe seven
years as being a little too rough but
it's it's been it's been a long time
since edge has been upgraded and next
week they are releasing a large amount
of hspa+ to your location oh you know
what and and that's fine they do that
because at work which is about 35 miles
from where I live they have hspa+ there
and I thought yeah whatever when I'm at
work I can be on hspa+ and at home i'll
be on edge that's fine at home i'll use
Wi-Fi whenever I Mountain about but let
me tell you hspa+ and central PA is
horrible a couple times I saw three to
five megabit but during the day whenever
people were actually using it it I'm
getting one meg down I'm not I'm not
going back to one meg and I'm getting
like 800 900 pangs it's pathetic timo
who isn't an option for me t-mobile's
not here so what's a guy to do well I I
try
I didn't tried and tried to use edge you
know and it's slow arm I it takes
minutes like three minutes to post a
picture on google+ to refresh you know
in that next with four bars you have to
have for full bars to be able to do
anything with edge at least in my area
if you have three or two you can't do
anything connections timeout don't even
work and worst of all I can't make phone
calls when I have low signal and I have
on the Nexus 4 and also my phone i use
to test prior to getting the nexus 4
whenever i have one bar of signal which
is like i said i live in a rural area
that happens a lot I can't make phone
calls on the AT&amp;amp;T network with straight
talk but I can on my verizon galaxy
nexus like with one bar I can make a
phone call weak signal it works great I
talked with no signal sometimes so I I
couldn't do it and I sold the sold the
phone today on sois pas I had actually
never used swapper before I was you know
I've sold many phones over the years on
eBay I've always used ebay and I met the
owner of swap at the big Android BBQ
this year he actually sat beside me at
the BBQ the last night they're weird and
we ate and we be asked and everything
and I talked him about swap and I was
like you know what yeah yeah I'll give
it a try if I ever sell device and lo
and behold I was here to sell my nexus 4
and within minutes of me posting it and
with me you know I took a picture of it
today well that session a side story
that's not just my phone that's bad I
took a picture of my galaxy nexus with a
verification photo with a coworker's
AT&amp;amp;T skyrocket and we couldn't even send
the picture to my gmail it took five
minutes for the message kept timing out
and we were trying all sorts of ways and
finally decided to just go over Wi-Fi
because his phone couldn't send me a
picture that's how about eighteen t is
in my area Scott so anyways I saw it on
swap but it's sold within a few min
um I have it here in a box already and
the guy paid me the money it was
extremely easy so you know I don't like
to plug things that often but swap it
was great for me uh I look at you know
I'd say you guys if you're going to sell
a device look at someone swapo in the
future it it worked great for me in a
few minutes I had the cash well my
paypal account had the cash I'm gonna
send the device out tomorrow and the
best thing about it is you know they
cost ten bucks to sell it I didn't have
to go through ebay and and you know a
whole bunch of you know selling fees and
listing fees and paypal fees you know
all sorts of crap I didn't have to deal
with all that so this nice have a site
that's dedicated specifically to that
type of glass too yeah I mean yeah users
it's looking for kind of perspective
that woulda been I don't know how much
money I've been off the top of my head I
don't remember ebays fees but it would
definitely a lot more than ten bucks for
a four-hundred-dollar device no you know
or yeah so I I yeah I said for our box
being i sold it for what I paid for it I
I didn't gouge people people on their
listing it for 450 five hundred and
fifty dollars yeah and I'm not gonna do
that i paid three hundred eighty-seven
dollars for the device so i sold it for
three hundred and ninety dollars and i'm
gonna pay however much shipping is I'm
just gonna gas ten bucks or whatever
shipping is so I'll get out of them I'll
get out of the device would i spend on
it- my $45 of straight talk so this
little experiment cost me 45 bucks was
it worth it yes i got to find out if i
could actually use this device in my
area all right so enough Derek long time
I got to experience the nexus 4 while
people that actually have coverage yeah
so man so yeah yeah so if I was an ass I
could be i could say LOL i've already
used my next to somewhere and sold it
and you can't even buy yeah but i'm not
that and you can use it just you can use
it to its fullest potential like I can't
even do that I can't even I can only use
it on gsm and i used it for chooses yeah
but but but that's an asshole thing to
do and that Derek will not do that but i
will give away free ingress invite codes
