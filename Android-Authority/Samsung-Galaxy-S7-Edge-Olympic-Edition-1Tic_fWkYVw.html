Authority and today we're taking a look
at something a little bit special this
is the Olympic edition galaxy s7 edge
and this is basically to commemorate the
Rio 2016 games that took place this past
summer and yes we know the games are
well over at this point and that summer
itself is also over but we still thought
it'd be pretty cool to take a look at
this phone and this is the first time
that we've seen Samsung do this they
made the Iron Man Edition galaxy s6 edge
that came out a couple of years ago and
they also made the Batman Edition galaxy
s7 edge that came out earlier this year
and for those of you that don't know
Samsung has been a longtime sponsor of
the Olympic Games so that also had a lot
to do with why this phone was made so
let's go ahead and check it out the
first thing you'll notice about this
phone is that the packaging is quite
different it's in a big black box with
Rio 2016 printed on the front and it's a
much bigger box in the box that a
standard retail s7 edge typically comes
in inside of the box you get a nice
black carrying case with the Olympic
Games Edition logo and I'm not 100% sure
what the materials are but it does feel
like a nice high-quality case with a
couple pockets inside for storing
smaller items like maybe charging cables
and SD cards inside of this case you'll
of course find the phone itself which we
will get to last but underneath the
phone is a black pouch which also feels
very high quality and this holds all the
typical stuff that you get with an s7
edge like the user manual that nobody
reads earbuds wall adapter and micro USB
charging cable now everything about the
design and specs of this phone are
exactly the same as the regular s7 edge
so we're not going to focus too much on
that but it's everything that you would
expect snap during a 24 gigs of ram quad
HD display water resistance and a glass
and metal design to commemorate the
Olympics you'll notice different accent
colors for the buttons and ports that
represent all the colors of the Olympic
rings so you have red for the power
button yellow for the earpiece and home
button green for the volume buttons and
blue around the camera lens and heart
rate sensor there's also the Olympic
rings logo printed on the back along
with Rio 2016 Olympic Games Limited
Edition printed right below the FCC logo
it comes in Samsung's black onyx color
that you can also get on the regular s7
edge but instead of a silver frame the
metal has been treated with a dark
chrome finish
which i think looks much nicer and gives
the phone a much stealthier look like
previous special edition Samsung phones
the Olympic Edition comes with a custom
Olympic theme so you notice the icons
notification shade settings menu and
apps all have been themed again - the
color of the Olympic rings but otherwise
it's the same exact software experience
that you would get on any galaxy s7 edge
and if you don't really like this theme
you can simply change it back to the
normal default Samsung theme now even
though this is a special edition galaxy
s7 edge it's actually not that difficult
to buy you can find them through eBay
Amazon and even directly through Best
Buy if you want to get one for yourself
and the price is pretty much the same as
a regular s7 edge and with all the extra
goodies that you're getting it might be
worth it and it's always pretty cool to
have a special edition phone as always
thank you guys so much for watching I
hope you enjoyed this quick look of the
Olympic edition galaxy s7 edge and if
