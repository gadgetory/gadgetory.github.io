original android hangouts show on
google+ I'm Derek Ross i'm scott
anderson and this week we're joined with
returning guest dan Charlton of timett
kernels he hasn't developed one in a
while but once he's not busy anymore
he's going to start Colonel all the
things in the very near future and we
have a very special guest with us this
evening you may recognize him from
certain YouTube drop test videos he is
the co-owner of android authority
welcome Darcy lack of a Darcy pleasure
to be here thank you so so tell us about
these these YouTube drop test videos you
know we've seen you destroy beautiful
android phones and beautiful iphones uh
you know you're you're a you're pretty
popular guy getting millions and
millions and millions of views what that
drop test is like 15 million views alone
that's problems ii you know the demand
sort of went up crazy and at one point
it was doing almost two million views a
day and it kind of slowed down the stern
around 50,000 views a day people are
still interested I think you know
because the iphone 4s was and all
iphones previously in fact they just
were not durable you know just one drop
they would break but the iphone five
they improved on the build quality in
such a way that the device is probably
one of the most high quality devices
I've ever tested so we just went to Hong
Kong it was one of the first marks to be
available we bought on the grey market
they had a really really close
tight-knit thing you had to be a Hong
Kong resident to get it so we kind of
had to pay a little bit extra yeah that
were yakking on the black market center
my clothes but the black mark is like
illegal it's called the gray market
actually the grey market it's a little
bit more ethical I suppose so we just
like we went to the event and there was
just lineups the year previously there
are so many sculptures that is just
broken in a riot set like this high-end
mall in Hong Kong with the police get in
there and people punching each other and
stuff and the mall didn't like that so
they had a much more control thing this
time so we bought it off a guy and we
had a videographer there and we just
went to the the Bay of Hong Kong and we
decided to drop it and you know captured
in slow motion we're really curious to
see cuz we actually thought that it was
gonna break but it just it didn't break
he couldn't break
it's the merged it in a fish tank you
you drove over with a car you hit it
with a hammer yeah that's a damned
horrible phone I believe it got some
coffee at one point then we get some
coffee yeah we we dropped a whole big
cup of fresh android authority spinous
on that bad boy and it still kept
working see did you know the downfall of
it is that the battery wasn't removable
so we weren't able to power down quickly
enough after the fish tank test
essentially water tests so that that led
to its demise yeah I mean no phone could
withstand 15 seconds submerged that's
just a pause oh yeah and I'll actually
fujitsu and sharp and Sony they all have
waterproof devices now so I think it's
something that will catch on maybe now
out of all the devices you've been
testing you know dropped task for
viewing and so forth what you're you
know you did the note to you did
obviously not the galaxy s3 and then a
couple others what's your what's your
favorite one so far definitely the
Galaxy Note 2 is that is that your daily
driver now that's why the driver right
now and it was tough going from the s3
to it because the s3 to solve for such
intuitive one-handed operation and it's
just at the the breaking point of what a
one-handed device could be you know that
4.8 in but you know since I made the
transition I've really started to like
it you know jelly bean out-of-the-box so
it's just extremely fluid the
performance is fantastic and you know
for someone like me I can see why having
it yes 5 &amp;amp; a pinch me is a big phone it
feels ridiculous to put off to the side
of face and you one-handed at all oh you
can yeah actually if you kind of you
figure out what you do a lot of like
taking pictures or you know just
checking the side or whatever um if you
can put the the icons you know on the
launcher you can get it but even still
it requires a little bit of finesse in
terms of using like your pinky to
balance it you're pushing it yeah so
it's almost like we've gone back to the
the old Zack Morris phones yeah promise
yeah it's gonna be popular I love those
akash ganga more like a horse was being
up there in Canada uh not that I mean I
was a big fan of Saved by the Bell back
in the dog hell yeah man I'm 80s kid
like you brother
8bit all the way man I want to hear
everything in a pit I want I want to go
back I'm being told that our hangout is
echoing like crazy why are we acting I
don't you're in the echoing I don't hear
any equity well you know what I don't
hear any echoing so that we will try to
work on that and your monster will
continue on I mean we're all using these
new mics maybe it's a new Mike's fault I
don't know some people gain down there a
little bit all right so so any uh any
new big news over there that any new
bombs at the binders of Android binders
and Nexus devices like to be dropped on
us in the near future from my end like
what I'm seeing ya anything you see
coming over there you know I've been
thinking a lot about the nexus program
you know what Google's really trying to
do here you know what their talk to your
partners and for me you know just
looking forward the specs that are
coming out and the ones even of
yesteryear like a dual core Exynos of
1.2 gigs these are more than sufficient
to to run android 4.1 really really well
so i think a lot of manufacturers are
very concerned about be just being
commodity commoditize having their
devices you know not be able to command
a sort of pricing premium that they're
hoping for and we're seeing devices out
of China already with jelly bean on them
selling for like 200 bucks 200 bucks and
maybe they don't have like the best
build quality but it's only a matter of
time before we start seeing like really
good quality a droids for for two
hundred dollars unlocked like no carry
on I agree with that yeah I can't wait
to yeah what else we got in our plate
this week Scott well we got some Android
ecosystem stuff some events around
Google and we have a lot of app updates
we have device updates and some rumors
we also have some controversial carrier
news and some patent wars um Apple loses
again good news sites all right so uh
let's talk a little about a bit about
Android you know we've been hearing for
a few weeks now
that Google was going to be holding an
event scheduled for october 29th you
know that official date first came out
for me a French publication no like oh
you know they don't normally leaked
android news but you know it might be
might be um 29th the you know the few
reports start coming out that was going
to be the day that was going to be the
date and then this week Google sent out
an official invitation letting us know
that there was going to be an Android
event in new york city at ten a.m.
eastern time on october twenty ninth and
that the playground was open so is that
going to be you know the binders of
android or we're gonna have binders and
nexus devices release there i I don't
know well what we do know is there is a
new version of Android coming and we do
know that there are at least one
confirmed well unofficially confirmed
will say I mean if this nozzle nozzle
call confirmed knee here damn near
confirmed new Nexus phone coming so so
let's talk about possibly a new version
of Android they will be announced in the
near future as some of you know android
police recently obtained a system dump
from the LG Nexus 4 / LG optimus Nexus /
you know and no official name yet and on
their system dump they obtained they did
a little bit of a teardown you know a
little bit of looking into some some
strings and so forth to see exactly you
know what is going to be coming in the
near future with Android and there's
there's a few security enhancements for
those of you that are security conscious
those of you that you know hear the
rumors fly around the web the foot you
know the fear uncertainty and doubt that
Android is you know plagued with malware
or an unsecured well you know the media
eats that stuff up with Android and you
know it makes sense you always got
attacked a big guy you know you always
got to try to knock the big guy down so
Google's coming back and told them
basically to be quiet because they're
going to be implementing SMS shortcode
confirmation which right now let's say
you get well you get a
get an app and the app wants to send a
message to an SMS shortcode that ends up
costing you money we're going to get a
confirmation in the future if these
rumors a pan out to be true that will
let you know that hey this text message
you're going to be sending is going to
cost you money it's going to show up on
your bill do you want to do that and
you're going to be able to say yes I do
or no I do not so you know there have
been cases of malware in the past or
ornaments too much malware but apps that
are doing things they shouldn't be such
as sending those type of codes out there
and yeah so that's going to put a
hinderance on that um also there's going
to be a basically a VPN always on like
right now if you're on a VPN the VPN
disconnects or internet dies and entry
in USA you switch Wi-Fi you went from
maybe LTE Wi-Fi or so forth your VPN
dropped while did that maybe and you
keep browsing the web and while you're
browsing the web since you didn't know
you're in your network connection
dropped you could be browsing the web in
securely and that's going to be slightly
changed it looks like where it's going
to all the VPN is going to always try to
be connected or you're going to be able
to specify you know only always always
use a VPN for my connection those
details are a little bit fuzzy but
something along the lines of having a
VPN always for network access is in the
pipeline it looks like at this time and
the big thing is se Android which is
based off of selinux and selinux has
been around for a number of years now
security enhanced clinics was originally
developed by the NSA to harden linux to
to make it more secure it's a bunch of
user add-ons uh Colonel add-ons to
enforce security policies basically it
means that when the user runs a program
and you know system services apps so
forth they run with a bare minimum of
security privileges based on defined
security policies and permissions there
really is no true concept of a root user
being able to do every
and have you know full access to to
everything it's if it's there but it's
not there and the the system dump that
android police got said it was going to
come in in three modes you're going to
have it being on all the time so you
know security all the time not letting
anything run that shouldn't run or
logging which it's turned off but if you
have some type of you know breach you
could look back and look at the log and
see what could have been prevented and
then lastly you know you could turn it
completely off so that may still come
down the line with those three options
but earlier in the week there was some
new commits submitted to Android that
basically removed that functionality so
if it does come to Android 4.2 as of now
it might come fully enabled without the
ability to turn off meanness is all
still you know based on speculation who
really knows this is basically just
looking at the code and saying yep the
code that was submitted takes away that
option do we know how it's going to be
implemented no this is just me looking
at it and saying okay I know what that
means so your guess is really as good as
my on that but but the the bottom of
line here besides you know all the
technical you know geeky mumbo jumbo
stuff that some of you might not really
care about or understand it's basically
very secure and it's going to
drastically cut down on the amount of
potential malware that could run on the
system it you can't stop everything you
know a piece of malware could run in its
own context and have access to its own
its own files that are have the same
permissions but it won't be able to jump
from you know from context to context as
easily so it's very very very good i
mean servers uh you know linux
installations been using this for many
many years I've used selinux on you know
web servers and mail servers for years
hard in the system so it's tell you
what's confusing as hell for me but I
understand the baseline of it so it
makes it makes it all that much better I
mean it's good I mean who doesn't want
more security right and in the last
not excuse me last but not least two
layer notifications so right now you
pull down on the notification the status
bar for notifications all your
notifications are hitting their custom
roms and TouchWiz have toggles up there
well with jelly bean with expanded
notifications you know and then you have
you know toggles and then so forth you
put in landscape mode now your screen in
real estate has gone to nothing so
Google has an answer for that and also
the addition of their own power toggles
or notification toggles called quick
settings don't really know exactly what
that is going to entail but it looks
like it's two layered so you swipe down
one layer to pull down your normal
notifications and then once that windows
pull down you swipe down a second time
for your quick setting so that you know
is that can be Power toggles you
configure it who knows but the fact that
it's going to be baked into AOSP right
now without having to have a custom rom
or custom UI that's pretty damn cool I
know a lot of people that route just for
the fact that have toggles enough so
yeah that's very cool I don't know about
the double swipe I think they can
implement it better um such as my point
of view the double swipe seems like
something that is kind of unnecessary
and you know they had the expandable
notifications the first way that they
implemented it was not amazing and
that's why they changed it so I think
that'll change how they do that in the
future if that's even implemented and
you gotta remember that this is just a
placeholder when the more just basing
this off of a placeholder image so right
now if you swipe down the second time
you see a image that says future home of
quick settings so there's no actual
quick settings they're just an image is
so I mean it this is an alpha system
dump obviously so a lot of things can
happen in the future it could be not
implemented at all it could be something
that they couldn't get ready in time by
production
eight and decided okay that's common in
4.3 or 5.8 or something like that and
then get some more information about
malware yes so the FBI put out a warning
about Android malware um and when people
actually started looking into the
morning is based largely on two
applications one of which has been
installed on approximately 30 devices
anywhere in the world oh I don't be
weird I've million hundred devices 30
really not a big problem the other one
is not even really malware it's sort of
a gray area of malware where it's kind
of like um uh what was the carrier
tracking things that everybody went
crazy about yeah carrier ID yeah I like
you it's like you when it does so mean
yeah it is tracking you and doing stuff
you probably don't want it to do but in
the event that its installed it was
probably your local government that
installed it or character or company I'm
just gonna get my pimple that's not
something yeah well I mean part of the
problem and it's not entirely you know
their fault part of the problem is that
they can't really have a Google market
for it because they can't sell
applications there is that that for a
lot of Eastern Europe in Asia you know
most people go excuse these shady other
markets to pop up around it's pretty
easy to Reno reverse decompile some code
and just chuck in some stuff yeah yeah
but I mean realistically is it big
people think about malware in like in a
computer oh god I open that email and
follow the link and now I'm infected
it's not like that any Android you click
the link and it can't just install
something it's gonna have to pop up and
give you warning about you don't have
the permissions to turn on to to
sideload applications go through a
malware warning to enable that then it's
good you're gonna have to download a
file browser navigate to find this
application and install it go through
another warning about permissions and
that's installed like this isn't
something that just whoops I got Malware
maybe they're asleep at the wheel you
know yeah
I think a lot of people that are still
scared by system permissions you know
consumers that don't have a lot of
knowledge it could be a sort of a
daunting thing like you're giving up
your location and access to all your
contacts and and so forth right so we're
absolutely just the binder skater put on
up to a period of time yeah I mean
Google does a pretty good job of laying
out what nap can do um it's just not
everybody pays attention to it so I
guess people just don't happen without
what the same as you know that the
end-user license agreements people don't
really do but they don't want to make us
back yet past it tap past it get to the
thing they bought or the ravioli beta 5
cases that say that people really aren't
actually like legally bound to those
because nobody reads them exactly to
spec the box then I guess you know that
kind of plays along the lines of people
not actually looking at permissions well
with the new play store that's happen to
me it's in the code right now to say
Google doesn't think you should install
this app or this app permissions are you
know kind of interesting you might want
to double-check you know so it's going
to give it I'm assuming it's gonna be
another type of pop up when you click to
install it's going to say wait a second
you might not want to do that so if
you're not reading permissions Google's
gonna read them for you exactly okay so
let's move on to some new app updates
and new released apps first let's start
off with netflix i got updated and it is
now available in sweden denmark norway
and finland it has new subtitle support
improved subtitle support for android
version 4 and up and also it does fix at
least for me it fixed a lag issue that i
had with streaming on the next app
update is a google calendar it's
actually a new release they released it
to the place to look yeah Google
Calendar got released its for android
devices 403 and higher on this is big
because it allows android phones that
have skins let's say if i touch with i
have a different form of google calendar
and in order to get
a unified one exact experience over all
devices google has released a calendar
app that anybody can really download and
yet what you guys think about this is
this is a step in the right direction I
suppose it depends on how far they take
it if they release basically all of the
core applications calendar contacts
camera bulbs all of us put it all in the
Play Store and then the core android
code is just the platform no apps
nothing but in the past email used to be
you know gmail used to be an only google
app you know maps used to be an only
Google App YouTube all these apps you
couldn't get download from the Play
Store so that means they were they worth
getting updated on phones timely right
now the calendar is play app it can get
updated in a timely manner and but and
like what you said if you have a custom
rom or sorry well that too if you have a
custom nuts you know skin you I you can
you can actually have Google's direct
calendar you don't have to have a
third-party OEM made you manufacture
calendar or you don't have to if you're
on a custom rom you don't have to
install G apps to get calendar and
frankly if you did if you're running a G
apps version right now and you install
this you'll have two calendars so you
can go ahead and go into your system
directory and delete the calendar and
then install the one from the Play Store
now I did that just just an FYI yeah
yeah well I mean it also people don't
realize for a lot of the core
applications there are sort of extra
services running behind them beyond just
the application rates to look for
calendar there's a whole bunch of
calendar synchronization agents that
means that is sort of what is packaged
into gaps that's why it's so big right
it's got all of the the contact calendar
all the Google synchronization stuff fix
behind the scenes and then once you
flash it right you just get the market
you're the Play Store you don't get all
of those applications but you need all
that extra stuff to make contact and
calendar and everything else
work with Google and that's all stuff
that it was they used to be proprietary
and that's what you know you weren't a
loud kisser yeah and it's still
proprietary but this means they're
breaking it out instead of packing yet
yeah it's it's it's not propriety it's
not technically I mean in reality it's
borderline illegal to include that he
doesn't mean yeah that's why you know
saiyajin water you got in trouble for
you know years ago the year they won't
allow the pack package google apps with
with the rocks and it looks like
google's moving into that phase where
they're releasing more of their apps to
allow people to have the definitely know
anything not only that but it allows
them to basically say anybody on any
device with any skin from any OEM can
have the totally stock experience yeah
and a unified and doesn't change um okay
so moving on we have an update for nova
launcher um it's packaged with my realm
that i'm running so that's what i'm
talking about it busy oh good launch it
yeah um basically a lot of bug fixes a
lot of bug fixes and also notifications
for apps that got updated supporting
more apps like google voice and
different apps like that you can see how
many notifications you have on the icon
itself um that's nice well they also
emerged changes from android 4.1 22 as
well they update the launcher with the
the latest launcher code from AOSP
mm-hmm and then a chameleon launcher
updated to version 1 dot one on the
biggest updates for this was a the
native android widget support which was
kind of nice um chameleon the widget sdk
was released to 1.1 and twitter widget
and a improved calendar widget which i'm
certainly uses a little bit more for
those you don't know what chameleon
launcher is it is a app that was started
through kickstarter on was funded and
got a lot of funding how much funding is
they get again 50 grand but then they
had the whole controversy somebody and
then it lost it and it got more yeah
yeah okay and then we got a lot of
Google Play Store updates a lot arm
first we have wish lists which is now
available and wish list basically allows
you to go to a nap and add it to a wish
list or add a bookmark to it basically
how I look at it there's no way to sort
wish list like let's say i added a book
to a wish list and i added a android app
there's no way for me to decipher just
show me all of my wish list items that
are books or things like that so that's
kind of disappointing arm nor face to
see it what is there any way to see it
on the web portal I haven't checked it
on the web portal but I know that on the
intro damage this web portal I'll tell
you what while you're talking about that
I would just bring up my web browser
here to them now also notice you're on
the web portal credits are now available
to purchase directly from Google you can
buy five dollars $10 $15 twenty-five
dollars and fifty dollars from the place
first so that's cool too also developers
from India can now sell paid apps in the
Play Store and supporting more countries
is good and is it allows them to create
some stuff arm then Derek there was
something about google now on google
talk would yeah so was it yesterday
maybe today bunch android blogs covered
the fact that including ours so I'm
going to bust on ourselves because hey
you have to be you have to be you know
you have to be fair and balanced isn't
that what fox news's they are so bad so
so it's a fair and balanced I'm gonna
bust on us and I'm gonna bust on the
whole bunch of other Android blogs to
the covered this so about a year and a
half ago Google came out with
guru at the AG talk account it was the
google guru and you could send the
google guru messages you know say what's
the weather the movies sports scores you
could do Google searches you know and
since all android phones allow you to do
voice to text so you hit the Google Talk
contact and you say what's the weather
and it types it out and voice to text
you hit Send and in a few seconds you'll
get the weather that's actually been out
for about a year and a half um but bunch
Android blogs ran it is you know hey
look you can now get google now for nan
Chi jellybean phones you just have to
use a little hack with the google talk
well and this is this has been around
for year and a half like i said and and
also i gotta ran on this subject for a
second it's not google now because it's
google search google voice search we're
going to call it is not Google now
Google now pops up card notifications
this does not pop up card notifications
it's just google search but but yes that
functionality has been there for a year
and a half if you want to find out the
weather by using your voice and you want
to do it by google talk well you can
google talk if i push the search button
on my phone come on now then ask you to
message I it was going to go to a
browser and give me the answer exactly
exactly so it's just another avenue for
people to do it you can send it to the
Guru I mean everybody remember smarter
child from years and years ago with with
AOL Instant Messenger well when when the
Google guru came out that's what
everybody called and everybody said hey
look google is bringing back the smarter
child but it's always been there it's
that's nothing new but move along
nothing to see here no binders no
binders no binders Oh make me know maybe
we should do we should send the Guru a
question just ask the Guru binders and
women see what he says okay come back
with a wise response and so uh so it's a
lot of school stuff but still gotta got
some some ICS you know it's live been
out for a year now and some some jelly
bean updates this past week asus asus
is a company that updates their damn
tablets I mean they've updated nearly
every tablet they have we're still
waiting for the OG the original to get
to get jelly bean but besides that
they've been on the ball with all their
other flavors of the transformer line
they posted firmware for the transformer
pad infinity so if you didn't get the
OTA you can go ahead and snag that and
flash to your heart's content over there
updates on verizon will verizon the
other ICS and all the things a year
later the droid bionic is going to start
getting it as of tomorrow actually so if
you have a bionic first of all I'm sorry
and second of all things outdoors a.m.
and start spamming that update button
and you know it's gonna be available
tomorrow the LG Lucid the the cheap
favors you fudge as he was going on next
Wow yeah oh yeah it was what 80 bucks
and the loose it first came out I was it
was a decent deal for it you know a
cheap phone it's getting ICS finally huh
now and the droid razr HD and RAZR MAXX
HD they are announced and they are on
verizon and amazon for 199 with the
two-year contract so you can go ahead
and go ahead and place your pre-order
and get those devices now and then the
maxx HD is 299 on with a two-year
contract and off contract from verizon
649 and from amazon at 729 three nines
not for the non max what you should the
verizon process at the non max they
might be 646 4999 in yeah it's funny
that they can call it a max you know
when it has a smaller battery you know
from the original max ya know better it
battery looks as a more efficient
processor true yeah i mean
acknowledgment the dirty work out better
I don't know Gotye yes worth of extra
hundred dollars though oh it is to the
manufacturer that's really true I know
that it's worth it to the consumer well
now you know what if you can have a
phone that can last for days then
and yes it is in my opinion that's right
like I'm I hate to say it you know I'm
traveling tomorrow to the okay I'm sorry
I love to say I'm traveling to Mars to
the go the big Android BBQ but I am
literally scared to death that that my
phone is going to be dead by the end of
the day is that because I'm going to be
in an area with with 4G i'm gonna be
using 4g the whole time i'm there and my
phone is not going to make it to the end
of the day and that sucks I get great
battery life right now but that's
because 75% of my time is on Wi-Fi
honestly yeah you know what I do what's
up I got a nice little 7300 milliamp
little battery portable battery unit and
it has two USBs on an LED flashlights
and i just used so much data and i'm on
the device so much that i just keep it
in my pocket you know when I when I'm
rocking at the club yeah it feels like
it feels like selling back like one here
you happy see me it's like massively
that's like the size of like to a carton
of smokes in my pocket but yeah i mean
at least i can continue to pull down
data and I'll never have to be worried
you know it's twice the size of the
Galaxy Notes battery galaxy note 2 so no
matter what I always have juice on the
go you definitely want to get one well
it's um the note says reviewers if the
nexus 4 came out and was priced at let's
say six hundred dollars off contract
would you pay a hundred dollars extra
for a oversized battery or would you go
out and buy a cheaper one third party
style let us know in the Google+ page
comments because we're watching those so
while you're letting us know if you'd
spend a hundred bucks for a better
battery the HTC butterfly j yeah i i'm
not a fan of that name not gonna lie
yeah i mean it's it's basically the it's
the HTC dicks which we've talked about
on the phone a lot or the phone the show
a lot it's the HTC droid incredible x or
you know what are the you know the droid
x l I mean no one really knows what the
other names works they were all rumored
and speculated but but yeah so so that
phone is coming out in Japan arm is it
going to be rebranded and come out on
verizon as the HTC
droid x el the HTC di x is it going to
be the HTC nexus 5 there's all sorts of
rumors and speculations I personally
would love and I've said it before I
would love for the HTC nexus 5 rumors to
be true for to come out on verizon and
for me to buy it on the day that it's
released now i'm kinda i'm gonna have to
watch japan because the battery I don't
remember how many milliamp hours it has
the battery is kind of small in my
opinion in HD and that's basically what
HTC has done in the past HTC has a
history of under sizing their batteries
and in my opinion they always have done
that so you vote for Jenna yeah yeah oh
man I can cry live my evo 4g really yeah
that is that possible I was also running
a very highly tuned kernel for it yeah
will you I do this but how to turn
aligned in what you make it can imagine
yeah exactly like maybe she's hardly too
Curt I'll tell you what damn time I
think I said well the reason why I get
all the battery life out of my one axis
fun if your job baby trigger nice are
selling is the HTC nexus 5 turns out to
be true dan I better be running your
damn colonel within a week that's all
I'm saying yeah i won I don't don't work
the line i'll be your beta tester
developed for blowing your really real
colonel death I don't need no hardware
are you talking about you mean like the
what 97 x 30 plant form devices that
I've never haven't been yeah yeah you
don't own 30 HTC phones yet you make
kernels from you i'm sorry you used to
make kernels for every single damn HTC
phone out there so um i'm bringing you
back you know i'm bringing you back back
from the dead alright so let's talk
about some carrier info here huh Scott
so so Isis is coming out right yeah like
are rumored to come out the 22nd um this
is gonna be interesting to see how this
goes um I'm curious to see what the
reaction will be and I mean right now
it's just really a lot of unknowns
and it's a platform that's really knew
that has hindered a lot of other
platforms in adoption of NFC in general
I wish them the best of luck but I don't
know how the adoption is going to be if
they force it on people and that's kind
of what they're doing in the sense of
taking other apps and not allowing them
in the app store or not allowing people
to use other things and restricting them
so I don't like this walled garden
version of it but it is nice to have
more competition because then Google
will increase you know they'll innovate
with google wallet and add new features
and so I guess this is good in the end
but want to see how the success of Isis
is actually going to be and they're
doing a little different there do
nfc-enabled Sims mean after that's a
little different you know then the
current you know Google Wallet NFC
devices right now I mean it's actually a
piece of hardware on the actual device
versus you know you slap in a sin to use
it then that's interesting well see what
that does better uses lots of devices
very quickly mm-hmm that's better for
you in the city so much at stake with
regards to all of this you know there's
the fights going to continue raging on
you know and there's you know also when
you consider like the Geographic
limitations there's still a lot of
Industry incumbents you know in the
financial payments industry obviously
banks and others you know they're
investing a lot of resources into this
to try and get their piece of the pie
yeah yeah because they want people to
pay from something that they always have
um and make it you know less and less of
carrying a wallet and credit cards and
snow around and just hey I've my phone
out because I like looking at my phone
and I'm talking with people oh you make
so much like in Hong Kong or in Japan or
South Korea people don't even carry
women okay purses and then don't really
have wallets it's just all on their
phone so all you have to do is look to
these more mature sort of smartphone
economies that have had this technology
in place for a long time and to know it
is inevitable and that consumers are
comfortable with
there it's just there's still a lot of
fighting that has to be done in the West
thanks for related fighting or another
all is gonna play you know you know I
mean that that's basically going on
right now you know 80 who would have
thunk it is not impressed that that
remember the percentage but a very large
percentage of the u.s. spectrum is now
owned by one company because yeah sprint
sprint actually is now 50 point eight
percent so it basically based basically
you know almost 51% almost a controlling
majority of clearwire controlling
majority that is a controlling majority
it did well if the point point anything
percent is a controlling majority they
control more more shares than anybody
out a lot a lot of foreign ownership
surprisingly too well yeah seventy
percent owned by Japan yeah well some
thank you so thank you though so yeah
well not owns them yet it's obviously
not the FCC year your ft CEO let me well
you know that yes ma releases that
report saying Americans are paying like
what four to five times the rest of the
world is paying for per gigabyte on when
you milk will have some of the other
stuff and like just downed away your
anchor ltd it was only double with the
differences then they're really really
gouging Americans for texts and phone
calls whereas they are that everywhere
else well the ending up to right now
because I mean it's all going to be in
data they're trying to squeeze out all
of the things that they have left
because it you know eventually they're
gonna be you know obsolete and SMS will
be no longer and all those different
things will they won't its data yeah
they won't have to charge for them
because people won't want them at all so
it'll just be over data and it'll be
fast and it'll be nice but they're
trying to penny pinch people right now
the thing is is that so back to that
clearwire on there there oh they're a
wimax solution and if I'm out there not
I mean yes they are but because it take
part in our dinner art thing
they currently run a wimax network that
his sprint's 4g wimax they are also
currently building a net against tdd-lte
affinity ddm could use the only such
network in america and one of I don't
know why all of the sudden got the idea
that wasn't gonna buy out clearwire it
looked from the start like one of
softbank's conditions was sprint buys
out clearwire because clear what herb
softbank runs a TDD LTE network in Japan
so they want to be able to basically do
a massive economy of scale one device
that can run on their networks in the US
and in Japan and anywhere else that they
work with and now they're going to send
this yeah the thing about td-lte is that
infrastructure Lee it's a lot less
expensive like once they already have
the infrastructure path established look
you know it's not going to be expensive
for them to recoup their investment you
know and yeah and hopefully North
American carriers they stop doubting
people because it's gonna get pretty
cheap for them from here on it ya know
and especially with all the work this
print is done with their network vision
yeah with like to build out Clearwire's
TDD LTE network it's not going to be oh
god we have to wait forever for fewer
where to go put up tower put out our put
up tower they're just gonna roll into
the sprint towers add a box to the very
modular setup that they have exactly the
switch and it's up and they can put the
aggregate all of clearwire spectrum
holdings which are substantial on top of
sprint's so they can go from the five by
five LTE that they're running right now
which is why it's so slow and boosted
out to 10 by 10 or even 20 by 20 to go
up to what Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T hat or
further is no thank you i 5 10 by 10
that's spending hurt blocks okay gotcha
so it's the imagine it it's sort of the
width of the tube um data so it's more
data a very low diameter sort of amount
that can go through there's currently
which is why it's slow whereas 18 T and
Verizon running on 10 by 10 which is a
lot a lot bigger I have a question for
you Dan I mean obviously a lot of a lot
of news about huawei and ZTE and you
know those are the largest some of the
largest carrier telecom equipment
factures in the world and they produce
like pretty good stuff in his cheap but
uh you know this sort of politicized for
Porsche demonizing them you know saying
that there's a secret packets of data
going back to the Chinese government
would you think about all that I think
it's a lot of American political
 um I think that they're not for
the ziti devices that were actually
found to do the head but not phones
actually we're talking just the
attackers okay okay okay Justin yes
Carrie very device we're talking about
art like hard work not something that he
is you know number two in the world for
that kind of stuff yeah you're like into
all these other big players right ya
know the White House let leaked a report
basically saying there's absolutely no
evidence backing that up we there's no
problems with these things we don't know
what anybody's talkin about I think it's
reasonable to believe that there are
people in American politics who would
like to cast China and Chinese
manufacturers in America and a very
negative light mm-hmm I think it's an
interesting subject to bring up you know
what happens if some overseas company
tries to do that and it would be
detrimental to all of our data on
getting sent over and you know there are
extreme cases but I think it's a very
interesting topic uh yeah I mean I'm not
saying that it's not worthwhile to be
cautious but I be confident of anything
fun attractions to what your the White
House is it on your cyber warrior honest
yeah the State Department does said you
know no purchasing lenovo laptops no but
I mean we have to consider where all are
met Oh technology's made and we know why
you know cuz the cost of labor so
exactly on the political element and
it's like what are you guys doing you
know you're trying to bite the hand that
feeds yeah I think it has a lot more to
do with politics than any kind of
reality yeah maybe so uh we get a little
off topic here so let's bounce back here
so the last thing a care your news i
want to yell about for a second is in in
the Play Store billing is coming to
verizon which is almost shocking because
verizon doesn't like to do these type of
things but you'll be able to buy things
on from the play store content from the
store and have it be build up to a
certain amount directly to your verizon
bill no that's that's that's cool mom
and that's nice for four kids in my
opinion that you know don't have credit
cards their parents uh parents give them
a little allotment so you know which me
oh it was just hard blocked by verizon
don't go over you can set them out so
they can go ahead and buy a they can go
ahead and buy apps and music and songs
and everything don't have to worry about
it I think I've done just off a lot of
parents crazy but you know what for it's
gonna make verizon make money somehow
you know they're going oh yeah their
earnings came out saying they make more
money yet they're still finding ways to
screw their customers so um yeah why not
you know let's keep it up you know more
money money's good American why even
will get the american way it is American
Way um so so let's talk about some
miscellaneous news here so tomorrow is
the first day of the big Android BBQ in
hurst texas o yours truly yours truly
will be there definitely excited if you
have me paying attention and you're
watching or listening to this tonight or

night event where well you walked around
the bars more crawled it as a light coat
night goes on you may have actually
crawled a barge but uh the official bar
crawl has been officially canceled but

reason HTC and nvidia are here ah HTC is

them before vendor party
are great and they're going to be giving
away a whole bunch of stuff so let's see
it's going to be from 732 1130 on

i want to say i want to be there well um
there's going to be actually a whole
bunch of people live streaming this
event as well as the actual barbecue
folks themselves they're gonna be live
streaming a lot of the sessions and but
a lot of the the fun socializing from
what I hear I'm talking to various
people is going to be streamed via
hangout on air so there's going to be
you'll be able to tune in there's me
pictures posted videos posted yeah
you'll be able to you know see what
we're getting into down there for all
from the internet you're gonna have a
great time all the address osseous you
know when that part of the world are
gonna be there so you're gonna be able
to represent don't be there gorilla suit
to Dan did you touch on kittens at all
uh no there wasn't a whole lot of news
on that this week I just apples appeal
of the heat galaxy tab yeah united
kingdom uh they lost their appeal which
now means they're going to have to put
on their UK website and in the press in
the UK public apologies for
accusing samsung of being a copycat and
publicly acknowledging that Samsung is
not copying them in any way it's gonna
be really interesting to see how they
try and play that one their PR people
are the wheels are spinning in the mud I
can feel it yeah that's the top spin
then yeah I think that's a spectacular
like punishment for patent trolls oh man
one thing I do watch on um is the new
Chromebook it was really ever get some
questions about that from Stevie I sell
yea though neutral esta made by samsung
it is $249 and you get a hundred
gigabytes of free google drive storage
for two years arm that's awesome that is
all has two gigs of ram has a an ARM
processor that's actually how they're
able to get the pricing down a lot more
from the previous models it had the
previous models came with various Intel
CPUs and this has a Exynos processor
processor and it actually so it's a
little bit different that doesn't mean
it's not fast though I've seen you know
demo videos of it it's it's nice and
fast yeah I what's interesting no sorry
this is like an ideal device for
grandparents people that use you know
minimal stuff also people that watch
videos and things like that arm also if
you have more than one google device so
let's say you have a whole bunch of
android devices across your family or
whatever and want to share a google
account cingular one that's a hundred
gigabytes of free storage for two years
that's cheap yeah yeah I mean that's
really cool if you've because I have a
tablet phone may be getting another
tablet maybe get another phone here and
at some hundred gigabytes over all those
devices I can back up a lot of different
things you have fun with that you know
what's what's an interesting note about
this uh Russell Holly a former show
guests as well as a writer for geek calm
was talking about this earlier today
that you can buy a new Chromebook in the
the 250 Chromebook
and a nexus 7 android tablet for 450
bucks so to him for four hundred fifty
dollars and to get like oh that's a good
deal it does a similar functionality out
of the new microsoft surface tablets
that are coming out with a keyboard
that's 600 bucks so you get two devices
for the price of one and save $150 if
you look at it now it's ineffective I
mean in tellers intel has dominated the
space for a while you know they're
scrambling to get mobile and obviously
we're seeing really good performance out
of single core processors but just how
much they charge you know just for the
actual technology that they're giving
manufacturers you know arm has never
done that even Apple if you go really
deep into the supply line rumors even
Apple is uh apparently carrying out for
an arm-based arm-based notebook so yeah
it'll be interesting to see how things
shake up I mean we know that you can do
it if they just strip down the colonel
and they create something custom daddy
that's was there until just squeezed out
yes that's mean that's why I Apple is
starting to push their own architecture
the intersecting with this Chromebook is
actually exactly what arm chip is in it
it is the cortex a15 XE knows 5253 what
is they do dual core Exynos 5 oh it's
the big guy yeah yeah that's powerful
like I'm just beginning to see like the
future of how powerful these things are
that is the chip that is finally finally
Samsung's answer to the the Qualcomm has
for granted at yelling at the same time
as the s4 pro making it a little less
impressive but whatever but I mean a lot
of guys are saying though is you know
the spec wars is almost close to that I
mean 20 megapixel cameras you know
obviously more efficient architecture
but I mean really like for most people I
think that we're beginning is the
beginning of the end kind of thing yeah
I also do want to point out that with
regards to storage um it's 5988 for a
year of 100 gigabytes okay take that as
x 2 that's about 120 bucks and I'm 49
minus 120 is a keep device you got one
hundred and twenty nine dollars but
Google builds our own data centers man
you know I'm
they're an y mean ya better supported
yeah very minuscule cost to them but the
thing is 129 dollars for laptop yeah
yeah I'm gonna probably go pick one up I
mean after they get their advertising
well I made one for my wife for
christmas I'll tell you that right now
my wife used to use the cr-48 until her
husband decided to put android on the
cr-48 and I mean you know that was a fun
fun filled day for me I you know like
that points went up I had a lot of fun
but functionality went way down so so my
old uh you know my old demo chromebook i
got from google basically has been
sitting here on my desk for the past
three months just not doing a damn thing
and it's not mom my wife uses the tablet
she gets on my computer when she needs
to but i'm really i'm gonna be getting
her a Chromebook for christmas
definitely there is that price to fit
steel yeah how about uh viewers are you
gonna buy one or are you gonna wait for
another release because this is pretty
cheap and this is one hundred twenty
nine dollars i mean that's that's gay
people still have to pay to 49 but it's
very cheap for hit us packing and I mean
why review the notebook for most use
cases oh sure I just I don't see a need
for it in my life that's like I just
forgot skate another device so i have a
7-inch i have a cell phone I have a
7-inch tablet I have a 10 inch tablet
with a keyboard I have a laptop and a
desktop like I just don't see space for
another device in my life no I
