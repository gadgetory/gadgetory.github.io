authority now the galaxy s 9 and s 9
plus have been out for a little while
and one of the interesting features that
we're seeing on this phone that we don't
see on other phones yet is this idea of
a dual aperture and so the question I
want to look at today is is the dual
aperture feature a gimmick or is it
actually really useful well please let
me explain
so let's start with the basics what is
the aperture the aperture is the hole in
front of the sensor that's part of the
lens that determines how much light gets
through to the sensor now on a bigger
camera on a mirrorless camera or a DSLR
camera there are many many different
aperture setting you know 10 20
depending on the camera now it's
measured in what they call F stops now
f-stop is the ratio of the focal length
and the aperture size and reason it's a
ratio is because obviously if you've got
different format cameras different sized
sensors different types of lenses but
you need a way of measuring that
aperture relative to the rest of the set
up in the camera so on a bigger camera a
DSLR camera then if you've got a lens
with kind of F 1.8 maybe
f 1.4 then that is a really really fast
lens and maybe the kit lens that comes
with kind of standard with the camera
might be a 3.5 f/4
something along those lines now as I
said it's a ratio and the ratio works
opposite to what you might think if
something is f3 or f2 it means that the
aperture is wide it means there's lots
of light coming in and if the number is
larger if a f-16 f-22 then it means the
hole is smaller and less light is coming
in now the galaxy s 9 has the ability to
set the aperture to F 1.5 and F 2.4 now
to compare that to other cameras you're
kind of standard F number for a
smartphone is around F 1.7 the Galaxy
Note 8 has an F 1.7 the huawei mate 10
Pro has F 1.6 the pixel 2
has f 1.9 what they've done with the
galaxy s nice I've managed to open up
that aperture to F 1.5 but at the same
time that added in a second one which is
F 2.4 now when a camera takes a photo it
plays around with three different
settings to try to get the right
exposure one is the shutter speed how
long the shutter is open how long the
light is exposed to the sensor the
second is the ISO speed that's the
sensitivity of the sensor how sensitive
is it to light how quickly does it
register the amounts of light coming in
and thirdly naught the aperture now
normally on a smartphone that aperture
is fixed but on a bigger camera as I
said earlier there are loads and those
are different settings that you can use
now on the s 9 the camera software now
can choose not only between the ISO and
the shutter speed it also has two
aperture settings that it can choose
between and the idea is it chooses the
best one to give the best quality photo
now the biggest problem is when cameras
choose high ISO numbers lots of noise
comes in and when they choose long
shutter times that of course even minor
handshakes just as you're holding the
phone can actually bring blurred nurse
or a lack of clarity to the photo so
having that extra ability the idea is
that it can produce better pictures I
really hope you're enjoying this video
if you are it like to remind you there
is now a separate gary explained youtube
channel and there i cover lots of
technology outside of mobile so if
you're interested go over to youtube.com
slash gary explains and i'll see you
there
now there are two reasons you want a
large aperture one is that you want more
light to come in in low-light situations
so indoor photography nighttime
photography you want as big as aperture
as possible and then on bigger cameras
there's also you try to achieve this
depth of field effect the bokeh effect
but that's really quite hard to achieve
on a smartphone even when you've got an
F 1.5 aperture so we took some pictures
with the galaxy s 9 some at F 1.5 summer
f 2.4 to see what kind of differences we
can see in the quality of the pictures
that appear now as you look at these
pictures here you'll see actually it's
quite difficult to tell the difference
in an F 1.5 picture and an F 2.4 picture
they really isn't much
call between them the only time you can
really tell the difference is in a low
light situation and this very last
picture here is a kind of a picture
we've made and we deliberately control
the amount of light that was in this
setup and if you zoom in here to this
robots head and look at the color board
behind it you can see that actually
there is extra noise that comes in an
extra processing that has to go on when
you're using F 2.4 in this low-light
situation so f 1.5 performs much better
of course this is testing the two
aperture settings on the s 9 F 1 point 5
and F 2 point 4 but on a phone let's say
like the Note 8 it's already got F 1
point 7 so the difference here in the
quality would be much much smaller it
moves it is some scientific tests on
these photos take them with these two
different aperture settings and we found
that actually photo taken F 2 point 4
have a bit of clarity in the middle but
they do have less sharpness on the
corners
whereas the F 1.5 isn't quite so sharp
in the center but it tends to keep that
sharpness better across the whole photo
so when you pull this together what have
we got well we've got the Samsung Galaxy
S none with the 2 aperture settings 1.5
and 2.4 compared to a normal smartphone
which would have maybe one point 7 or
even one point 6 now when you actually
take some photographs with this what do
you see well what you see is that in
low-light F 1.5 can be a better help
than F 1.7 or even F 1.9 and we can also
see that there does seem to be some
sharpness better at F 2 point 4 but does
that make a huge difference well as you
saw from the pictures I show not really
so me personally when I'm looking at
this now am I going to call it gimmick
or feature
I'm gonna call gimmick
now I'm sure as soon as I've done that
there's some were already typing down
the comments saying you've been paid by
wile where you've been paid by LG come
on people grow up I've studied the
photos I've looked at the technology and
this is my opinion it's as simple as
that okay my name is Gary Sims and this
is Andrew authority I really do hope you
enjoyed this video if you did please do
give it a thumbs up you know what I'm
going to ask please subscribe please

please leave a comment below and well
that's it I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
