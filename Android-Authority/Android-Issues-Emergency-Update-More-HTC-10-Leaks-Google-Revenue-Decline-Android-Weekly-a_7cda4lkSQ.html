brought to you by full sail university
yes as you've probably heard google has
announced an emergency security update
for all Nexus devices but don't worry
it's not quite as bad as it sounds
Google's just announced that they are
releasing a mid-month security patch due
to the discovery of an exploit that
could potentially bring harm to some
devices namely the Nexus 5 and the Nexus
6 the issue arose after Google found out
about a routing application using a
unpatched local elevation of privilege
vulnerability in the kernel now what
that means is that there is a malicious
application that could have power to
affect the code within the software and
the only way to fix the handset then
would be to reflash the whole operating
system massive pain in the button google
does protect you from such apps in the
Google Play Store and even uses verify
apps to keep external threats away the
only way to have been affected is if you
were convinced to manually install the
routing app in Google's own words they
say this this advisory applies to all
unpatched Android devices on kernel
versions 3.43 point 10 and 3 point 14
including all Nexus devices Android
devices using Linux kernel version 3.8
een or higher are not vulnerable now for
those of you looking for news on the HTC
10 it's all becoming a little bit
clearer these details come courtesy of
evleaks the source that revealed many of
the other specs that surfaced around the
HTC flagship including its commercial
name the HTC 10 according to evleaks the
10 will feature a super LCD 5 panel the
leaker didn't confirm the screen
dimensions but we know from an old
report that we should expect a 5.1 5
inch quad HD panel a slight increase
over the 5 inch panel of the m9 super
LCD is a marketing term used by HTC to
denote a display where the liquid
crystal layer is laminated to the utter
glass which reduces glare improves
clarity and makes the panel thinner the
one m9 features a super lcd3 display but
it's not clear what improvements a super
LCD 5 will bring to the HTC 10
as for the battery we're looking at a
small increase in capacity over the two
thousand eight hundred and forty million
power battery unit inside the One m9 to
recap we expect the HTC tender feature
at 5.15 inch quad HD display at Qualcomm
Snapdragon 820 processor and an Adreno
530 GPU four gigabytes of RAM and USB
type-c HTC will allegedly have the quote
world's first world class camera on
front and back we look forward to seeing
that knows everyone knows mother Google
makes billions and billions of dollars
every quarter but it looks like trouble
is ahead new figures released by
statistic is to google the search giant
officially earned one third of all
digital advertising revenue globally in
2015 that's 33.3 on the nose want to
know how much money that actually is a
cool sixty seven billion dollars but
beneath the shiny surface the facts tell
a slightly different story looking at
the data released by statistic an see
that Google's online advertising revenue
is growing at an increasingly slower
rate up 16.9 percent in 2013-14 percent
in 2014 and only eleven percent in 2015
given its current rate of decline
Google's revenue growth will flat line
with in just four years while the
revenue graph still looks pretty great
Google's slice of the global market is
also on the slide so who else is making
money hand over fist and are they doing
better than Google well Facebook is one
good example while Facebook isn't making
anywhere near the same amount of money
as Google the social platform is
enjoying fantastic growth with four
times the revenue in 2015 as it made in
2014 compared growth to growth
Facebook's advertising revenue grew
thirty-eight percent in 2013 thirty-nine
percent in 2014 and thirty-two percent
in 2015 that's three times the rate of
growth Google enjoyed last year now you
long-term viewers will know that I've
interviewed scores of web developers
also people from hacker schools and one
of the biggest indications of success is
having a portfolio that can demonstrate
your worth and your skill set and our
sponsor Full Sail University can help
you build just that the software
development undergraduate
program can teach you how to create your
own programs and applications the web
