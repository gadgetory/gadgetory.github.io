brought to you by Norton security hey
what is going on guys long hear from
Andrew Authority and the Sony Xperia z3
is Sony's latest flagship and it has
come to the United States for anyone on
Verizon as the Xperia z3 V but is it
better is it worse well that's what
we're here to find out with the Sony
Xperia z3 V usually when Verizon picks
up a flagship phone they're known for
altering the design of the phone in one
way or another and they've done the same
thing here with the Xperia z3 v the
front and back are still solid pieces of
glass but gone are the all-metal curved
frame and sides from the original z3
instead the frame is plastic with metal
inserts and they are now flat which
makes it more reminiscent of the Xperia
z2 and other previous Sony devices and
not so much like the z3 Verizon's change
on the design feels like a step
backwards but I guess if you prefer the
flat sides then you might look at it as
a good thing it's a little bit thicker
and heavier than the z3 but not by much
and it's still pretty thin at 8.9
millimeters and overall it has the same
build quality that you expect from Sony
other than the flat sides everything
else about the hardware has remained
intact it's IP 68 so it's dust and water
resistant and you still get front-facing
stereo speakers which makes Sony one of
the few OEMs that can give HTC zone
boomsound speakers
a run for its money when it comes to
audio quality you still get the same 5.2
inch 1080p display on the front with
Sony's triluminos technology and even
though 2k displays are starting to
become a new standard on smartphones the
1080p panel on the z3 v is no slouch
it's very sharp bright beautiful and
vivid with great viewing angles so
unless you absolutely have to have a 2k
screen you're not going to find much
that's wrong with the z3 V's display
also like the Xperia z3 the z3 V is
packing the Snapdragon 801 processor
clocked at 2.5 gigahertz with three gigs
of RAM just like many other flagships
powered by the Snapdragon 801 the z3 v
will deliver a very fast and responsive
experience and with three gigs of RAM on
we're switching back and forth between
apps and multitasking will be a much
more seamless experience while it's a
step behind the Snapdragon 805 the
Snapdragon 801 will still provide more
than enough power and performance for
even the most demanding users there's
also no surprises here when it comes to
the camera the 20 point seven megapixel
sensor makes its return on the z3v
and the software as you would expect
remains unchanged Sony's camera app is
packed with a ton of features some are
useful and some are sort of just for fun
but with all the different levels of
control that Sony's camera UI provides
this will satisfy both the casual and
the serious smartphone photographer the
only quirk with the camera and this
isn't specific to just the Xperia z3 V
but Sony phones in general is the fact
that you can only take advantage of all
20.7 megapixels in manual mode which
also limits you to shooting in a four by
three aspect ratio one minor difference
with the camera on the z3v is the iso
caps out at 6400 which is a step less
than what the z3 is capable of but with
an aperture of f28 to capture some
decent looking low-light shots with a
minimal amount of noise other than that
you can expect pretty much the same
level of picture quality with very sharp
and detailed images with a great amount
of color so I mentioned a little bit
earlier that the z3 V is actually a
little bit thicker than the z3 and this
is for a couple of reasons one is the
battery so it's a 3200 milliamp hour
battery versus the 3100 milliamp hour
battery in the z3 so it's slightly
larger but you probably won't notice too
much of a difference in battery life
between the two one thing is for sure
though is that the z3 v will easily get
you through a full day on a single
charge and possibly even into the better
part of a second day depending on your
usage
reason number two is wireless charging
so the z3 v has qi wireless charging
built in so it's compatible with any qi
wireless charger so this is a definite
plus if you enjoy the benefits of
wireless charging taking a look at the
software the experience is practically
the same as many other Sony phones
looking at android 4.4 kitkat with
Sony's Xperia U I and just as a side
note the Easter Egg actually shows a -
instead of a three so it kind of makes
you wonder if this was really supposed
to be a z2 variant and they maybe just
slapped on the z3 name at the last
minute
either way the expiry why if you don't
already know preserves a somewhat stock
looking feel of Android which is great
because it keeps things relatively
lightweight and fast there are a few
customizations from Sony built-in like
these small apps in the recent apps menu
that give you some extra multitasking
capabilities and you also get an entire
suite of Sony applications like Walkman
movies and places your mobile for
integrating your experience agent
console since this is a Verizon phone
there's also no shortage of Verizon
bloatware pre-installed so on top of
dealing with Sony's own apps you're
going to have to put up with Verizon's
which really takes away from what would
otherwise be a very clean Android
experience you can pick up the Xperia z3
be right now on Verizon for $200 on a
two-year contract or $600 if you want to
buy the phone outright and if you're
looking for that Sony flagship
experience on Verizon the Xperia z3 V is
going to be your best bet
and there you have it for the sony
xperia z3 v sony's flagship has finally
hit another carrier in the United States
on Verizon and even though the z3 v is
an extremely solid smartphone in its own
right it feels a little bit more like a
beefed up z2 than it does a z3 but with
that being said it's almost just as good
as the original anyways guys hopefully
