Android Authority my name is Darrell
doke and this is our review for the
Google Nexus S 4G on Sprint it's
physically identical a t-mobile version
of the phone that launched approximately
six months ago except for this one has
support for Sprint's optional 4G WiMAX
network the Nexus S phones are based on
the Samsung Galaxy S phones so there are
some physical similarities here like the
volume rocker being located on the top
left the power button being located here
on the top right but there is some
changes where they took the power port
and the headphone jack and relocated
them to the bottom and they've also
added a concave screen and taken away
the Gorilla Glass the only complaint I
have about the physical side of the
device are the rearranged capacitive
touch buttons in comparison here's a
samsung epic see the brightness
difference of the buttons and so in the
daylight you cannot see these buttons at
all and you'll have to remember which
order they're in except for they are
different than any other set em Android
phone out there on the market right now
so that's one frustration the only other
thing I would complain about on the
physical side of the device is this
plastic back cover is very glossy
gathers fingerprints and really feels
kind of cheap in comparison to something
like a soft touch back when it comes to
the software the phone everything is
really really smooth it is really nice
to use
there's no hiccups anywhere in here
there's no lag and everything runs very
smoothly there's really only two
complaints that I have when it comes to
the software first one is the inability
to do more than 160 characters in an SMS
the way you resolve that is by using a
third-party application like Hansson SMS
the only other complaint that I have is
the inability to activate 4G
through a widget there's no widget
support in this one so the only way to
do it is by going into the settings
going to wireless and networks 4G
settings and enabling it right here but
when you're browsing the web and you
want to download something you want to
jump on the
or G network there's no quick way to do
it there's no way to do a drop down and
doing like quick settings or somebody at
that quick settings can't control the 4G
and so there was some frustration on
there as well as doing something like
widgets o√≠dos not able to control the 4G
in this phone either when it comes to
bonuses of the Nexus S one of the only
things I could really think of except
for the fact that this is vanilla
Gingerbread is the Netflix application
where you're able to stream video
directly to the handset which not a lot
of Android devices are able to do these
days Sprint does offer a couple
different applications that I found
interesting one of them was the total
equipment protection application which
makes it to where you can sync contacts
and do a location on a lost phone and
TeleNav navigator which if you do not
like the Google Navigation they do offer
you a free navigation program that does
work pretty good when it when you look
at touch tests they just like the other
Samsung Galaxy S phones it supports up
to five touches at a single time another
aspect of the phone that actually seemed
pretty disappointing was the camera
quality when doing still shots there was
still quite a bit of noise in the
pictures even though there was enough
lighting you know it does have its LED
flash right here but that really didn't
help anything when it came to the shots
they were still pretty grainy even in
the in the bright daylight when I came
to video quality it was pretty
disappointing because it's limited of
only a 480p where Galaxy S phones are
normally limited to a 720p so I found
that pretty disappointing and then
during a quick video call quick chat
using the front-facing video camera had
a pretty poor time where it was even on
wine even on Wi-Fi it was sending a
pretty poor quality of call to an Evo
and so I was pretty disappointed overall
with the camera quality over over the
whole device whether it was a still or
the video or the front-facing camera had
a pretty much pretty bad experience
overall overall the Google Nexus S 4G
was a pretty enjoyable device however
there were two glaring problems that I
could not actually get past one of them
was a data connection issue
we're on a WiMAX connection I would
often only get about a one megabit
connection and on a 3G connection I
would only get about a 100 to a 200
kilobit connection and so these are
areas that normally I would see on an
Evo a six to a seven megabit connection
on WiMAX or
a seven eight to 800 kilobit connection
on 3G and so that was a big problem the
other issue was the the battery uptime I
there was one point I only saw about a
little over six hours on a battery from
a hundred percent down to zero which it
was pretty unacceptable for a device
that is running vanilla Gingerbread and
really there's not a lot of stuff that
was running in the background so I was
pretty disappointed with that and
overall those two issues would make it
to where I just could not have this
device on a daily basis thanks for
tuning in to android authority and
definitely check back with us in the
future on future handset reviews</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
