brought to you by domain.com
so snapchat in an effort to win the
ongoing mobile video battle is looking
for gold at the end of the rainbow and
if that didn't look terrifying enough
try this but the really big news and the
latest snapchat update is the ability to
purchase extra replays previously if
you've watched a snap and wanted to
access it one more time
snapchat would allow you to replay it
but normally only one time per day the
latest update lets you replace snaps
over and over again if you're willing to
pay you can now purchase three extra
replays for $0.99 10 for $2.99 or 20
extra for $4.99 you'll still be able to
replay any app you receive for free but
only one time along with this new update
are some fun new camera features that
can be used while taking selfies once
you pull up the front-facing camera
you'll press and hold on your face and
snapchat will prompt you to select a few
new items you can choose from any of
these options that will replace your
eyes with hearts turn your face old and
wrinkly or you can make yourself puke
rainbows and if you want to see more of
that nonsense you can follow me on
snapchat at Jace Broda now we got news
on something that's gonna make a lot of
you happy and that's improved battery
life Purdue University researchers have
created a tool dubbed hush an essence
hush is a software tool that learns from
your smartphone habits in order to
improve battery life without sacrificing
your experience
it handles background processes more
efficiently so to speak hush closes
applications that may hurt your battery
life while the screen is off but it
won't kill every app it will keep your
most frequently used services alive so
that your favorite software always runs
at its fullest of course that also
allows necessary processes to operate
including a Wi-Fi beacon and cellular
paging which are essential to your
communications hush is now available for
download if you're up for the challenge
the involved Purdue researchers have
made the software available on github
for free so
have at it and don't forget to come back
and share your results I want to hear it
and I know many of you are hungry for
more news on the Nexus 5x and here it is
in our exclusive report on the LG maid
Nexus X we stated that one of the color
options would likely be light blue but
our source wasn't sure about the
official name but this most recent leak
is from a trusted Korean website under
kg and they clarify it that the color
will apparently be mint two images are
being offered as proof and they look
pretty credible the first one shows the
Nexus 5x is back with the LG logo at the
bottom and the familiar vertical Nexus
logo the image quality isn't that great
so the actual color of the device may
differ quite a lot from the washed out
blue we can see here in the image and in
recent Sony News it turns out that the
Xperia line is an exactly waterproof or
it is waterproof but it's not waterproof
who wrote that the new policy change
from Sony was actually first scene with
the Xperia z3 and Zed for leading some
to believe that this change was specific
to those models now the Sony website has
similar wording and reference to the
experience at 5-series the experience
that v is waterproof and protected
against dust so don't worry if you get
caught on the rain or want to wash off
dirt under the tap but remember all
ports and attach covers should be firmly
closed you should not put the device
completely underwater or expose it to
seawater salt water chlorinated water or
liquids such as drinks abuse and
improper use of the device will
invalidate the warranty so now Sony is
talking about their IP rating and the IP
rating is a measurement of just how
waterproof that device is it turns out
that waterproofing devices are not all
created equal and there are real
limitations with that especially when a
device has to have ports that have to
open and close so know the limitations
and be aware of it now I do read the
comments and I know that some of you are
saying you got your club guru info
domain name extensions and those are
great and they have their place but
a.com domain name extension will always
be premium real estate why because no
