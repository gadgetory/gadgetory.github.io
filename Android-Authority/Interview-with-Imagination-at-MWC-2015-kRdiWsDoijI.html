authority reporting live from Mobile
World Congress 2015 I'm here with Alex
loike is a technology PR specialist with
imagination and imagination in case
you're not familiar is imagination is a
company that designs IP technology and
when we have a power of your graphics
and video we have MIPS CPUs and we have
and segment connectivity so Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth so a whole range of IP
designed for mobile and embedded devices
it's pretty smooth so I mean a lot of
people probably realize the fact that
Apple continues to license your GPU
technology year after year and you're
very confident so we spoke to you a year
ago what kind of performance gains are
we talking about in the GPU space yes so
in n power VR GPUs we're now at the
series 7 family last year we're talking
about series 6 and 360 this year were
talking about series 7 which includes
two families one targeting the entry
level and as the series 7 XC and one
targeting the mid-range and high-end and
SS 37 XC just before the event actually
we introduced a super GPU it's a 16
cluster GPU with 512 ALU cores
especially designed for the android
gaming console market so really really
high performance you know up there to
compete with you know consoles and
desktop GPUs but also very ultra low
power so delivering very high
performance but but at something that
you know fits in a very slim game
console so in terms of the kind of
performance anthropol we're talking
about and you have a lot of ways to be
able to measure how powerful your GPUs
are so what are the things you look at
when you're measuring performance yes
the way we measure performance we try to
offer consumers you know a feel for how
their devices with power VR will you
know perform in the real world so what
we do is we use a combination of
benchmarks no popular benchmarks that
consumers actually
run under devices and also some of our
own code some of you know real world
applications as well so the way we
measure it is we run on the current
generation and then we run on the
previous generation and we give people a
feel for how fast those GPUs are so
right now for example 37 xt we expect a
sixty percent increase over you know six
XE which was the the previous generation
and I stuff so now we're looking at the
partner ecosystem you've been working
with a lot of different manufacturers
yeah now we have dell back here we have
lenovo obviously apple continues to be a
really great partner and also we have
our very own android we call him the
butcher because he's butchering our
competition but yeah we have our own
android robot here from courtesy of
google so yeah we work closely with all
of the major suppliers whether it's a
software or hardware a very close
relationship with with google because a
lot of the android devices today use
reduced power vr and a range of other
technologies that we deliver so a year
ago most people you know within the
android space weren't talking about mips
but now android 5.1 lollipop and beyond
will support mips yeah and you'd
mentioned perform we were talking that
you guys have shipped 800 million CPC
views in 2014's oh that's really that's
really incredible actually last year was
the most successful year in the history
of MIPS we have shipped over 800 million
mips cpus and we predict that the number
will continue to grow and you were
correct android 5.0 has now support for
64-bit and 32-bit myth cpus and we
introduced just last year a new 64-bit
high-performance cpu called the I 6400
and we are really excited about how the
CPU is going to change landscape of
mobile and embedded computing it has
things like hyper threading so the same
technology that you have in desktop PCs
will now be available in mobile and
embedded devices it
virtualization so again things that you
would normally have in a server now and
in your pocket in the near future so all
these technologies that you know were
previously available only in the desktop
space we brought them over into mobile
but also there's a lot of power
efficiency improvements to make sure
that you know you don't run out of
battery in a day so a lot of our
strengths are actually in delivering
very high performance at at low power
consumption so I mean imagination is a
lot of different things so we have in
wearables you mentioned before game
consoles you know Nvidia and others are
you know investing them quite heavily
you know we had in car can you know
connected experience I guess what I'm
trying to say is you know we have Molly
in terms of GPU for mobile yeah we have
Molly no we have adrenal through call
come we have a lot of different
offerings and how competitive do you
think imagination is to this day
relative to your competitors yeah so if
if you look at some of the public
information out there there is gfxbench
for example has been really good in
implementing these long-term performance
modes and benchmarks where you can run a
device for about 30 minutes because
everybody could look good in a
one-minute benchmark you know you can
just increase the frequency and run
really really fast for a minute but that
is not how people use mobile devices
people tend to use mobile devices for
you know tens of minutes sometimes even
hours you now have these virtual pat you
know handsets with VR that you put right
in your face so if you're running that
for about two hours to know watch a
movie or watch a game or something if
that device gets really hot it's well in
your face so it can become quite
uncomfortable so for example I said Jeff
Jeff X bench has this mode but they do
long term performance and what we've
seen is that over over time we sustained
performance so we deliver you know
between nineteen ninety-five percent of
the original peak performance whereas
some of the competition drops to know
forty percent of fifty percent of their
original peak performance so there's a
big gap there between ninety percent and
you know forty or fifty percent good
stuff and there was a whole fiasco by
benchmarking last year but yeah and
they've done a lot of things to improve
that including it's like said adding
these long-term performance modes where
you can actually see how your device
will will perform over a long period of
time good stuff well keep it competitive
keep it fast and keep improving so we
can all have desktop class experiences
on our phones and tablets in the future
is there anything else that you think
that's relevant to adding yeah sure we
we also have some very cool MIPS devices
running Android Gary again did a
wonderful job covering or creator CI 20
board that runs linux and android as
well but we also have a very cool
SmartWatch that has a mitzvah core cpu
and runs android as a very interesting
dual screen technology where when the
device is turned off you have an e-ink
display that consumes almost zero
battery and when the device is turned on
you know if you want to check your
notifications and so on you then have a
LCD display that you know lights up and
you have a very beautiful looking
display that you can you can use so this
combination of very low power MIPS
dual-core CPU but also a dual screen
technology for for optimizing battery
consumption is I think a very unique
combination that hopefully more
manufacturers will adopt in the future
do you think it's likely in twenty
fifteen or twenty sixteen will see a
mips powered smartphone yeah I mean I
sure hope so because they will it's a
way for people to differentiate right
it's a way for them to show again all
these wonderful technologies that
consumers get excited about in the
desktop space like hyper threading or
like four
realization making their way into
devices and finally you have you know a
technology that you can actually promote
consumers and consumers understand
because they've used it on their PCs and
laptops so yeah very high performance
and and also very low power so so I
really hope that you know we're going to
see some MIPS based mobile devices
coming in the future me too actually
well thank you very much for your time
sir is a real pleasure all right you
starts lack of a signing off your
imagination 2015 Mobile World Congress</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
