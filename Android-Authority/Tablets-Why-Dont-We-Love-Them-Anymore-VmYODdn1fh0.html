brought to you by domain.com you know
there was a time on here where I claimed
that tablets would truly take off when
they could become a laptop replacement
but I think I was missing the point
here's why
so while why having tablets taken off
like smartphones have they're certainly
cool job unlike phones which people
carry with them and use daily tablets
are often seen as a luxury that extends
only to the home and travel obviously
this doesn't apply to everyone but
compared with the forced acceptance that
carrying a phone means having it on you
at all times
owning a tablet is something you need
not go with 24/7 it's surprising to see
how quickly tablets have vanished from
visibility on subways and trains in the
past few years at one point the iPad and
iPad Mini could be seen virtually
everywhere and even the Nexus 7 was
pretty popular these days it's almost
strange when someone uses a tablet on
the train if only for the fact that it's
so large compared to our average devices
the largest may indeed be a sizable
reason why tablet sales are slagging
once upon a time when quote big Android
phones we're a scandalous 4.3 inches
there's prospect of a seven-inch tablet
or especially a 10.1 inch product we're
especially enticing this was all the
more true with something like the asus
ii transformer prime
remember that beast it was amazing the
first android tablet to feature 1080p
screen resolution the experience was
truly much more grandiose with a product
that was potentially over twice as big
as the phone you were carrying around in
a daily basis but then the phablet
debuted and brought on what I call tabla
apathy
the reality is phablets are good enough
they meet that need where it's small
enough to be a phone for texting and
phone calling and it's big enough to
consume most of your day-to-day media
most of you are probably watching this
on your tablets which is a bit of a
misnomer right I mean that's the most
common phone right now
you and your 5.2 plus H phones but you
know me I like my small phone my big
tablet my phones for consuming audio
podcasts and audiobooks and
staying and calling and my tablet is for
gaming and watching videos and stuff
like that but clearly I am in the
minority there lies another motivational
problem differentiation tablets released
constantly yet how much change are we
seeing from product a product perhaps
nowhere can this be seen best then
looking at Cupertino small sized
embarrassment from 2014 there was almost
no difference between the iPad Mini 2 &amp;amp;
3 save for the addition of touch ID and
a gold color scheme with Android there
tends to be a slight better inner
upgrades see the Galaxy Tab 3 versus the
Galaxy Tab 4 for example but even then
it's more of a spec sheet situation than
anything truly tangible to the masses
for someone who has paid 400 to 600
dollars for a tablet specs don't really
matter when the thing is just going to
sit on the sofa all day now for my own
personal take here and I'm differing
from the article but I think it's about
apps we're not talking about apps there
are so few apps that are optimized for
tablets how many games really take
advantage of a tablet form factor how
many media devices take advantage of the
large screen not many and that's really
why you have a tablet to consume media
to watch videos to play you know much
more immersive games but still yet be
super super portable we just don't have
those so we need a more compelling
reason to consume our media on that you
know 7:00 to 10:00 or soon 12 inch form
factor without a keyboard what do you
think
now I'm also famous for saying that
tablets only take off when they can
become true laptop replacements but I
think I was sort of missing the point
the point is that there will always be a
certain small segment of the population
that needs a truck of a device right
people who do heavy-duty work like I do
lots of video editing and lots of
writing and I need a keyboard for a long
period of time so I'm always going to
need a laptop or a desktop that can
process all those large files yeah I
think many of you are like that too but
as tablets get better at becoming media
devices and task managers there's going
to be you know very little need for a
need a 9% of population to go to a
laptop what do you think about that all
right new t-shirt contest for anyone who
can come up with the most creative

someone comment below on how they were
unsub inform the channel because they
heard I have an iPad as a tablet the sky
is falling but you sort of sound like a
guy who is a hard-line right winger or
hardline left winger and they will even
support their candidate when their
candidate is clearly incompetent the
reality is if you want the best tablet
right now it's an iPad it's an iPad air
2 it's just the reality
you know Android manufacturers just
haven't caught up when they do I can buy
