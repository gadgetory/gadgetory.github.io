handy the Android authority app guide in
this video we're going to take a quick
look at the best emulators for Android
c64 is a great emulator for anyone
wanting to get into Commodore 64 gaming
it can handle a variety of games in a
variety of formats and it's even
reasonably priced classic boy is an
all-in-one emulator that allows you to
play SNES PlayStation Game Boy Advance
Game Boy Color NES and Sega games it's
not as stable as a single console
emulator but it's still really good for
those who want multiple games drastic
DSM you later is about the only Nintendo
DS emulator worth talking about right
now it has high compatibility smooth
gameplay and it works very well the only
downside is the $7.99 price tag fpse for
android is a very popular and highly
customizable playstation emulator with a
ton of features and a reasonable price
it's very powerful but it does have a
bit of a learning curve John GBC is a
Game Boy and Game Boy Color emulator for
you retro fans out there it's highly
stable reasonably priced and has a
superior game compatibility with only a
few bugs here and there
MD EMU is an emulator for Sega Genesis
Sega CD and Master System it's a
relatively newer application on this
list but it has solid features the only
downside is the free version doesn't get
updated very often mega n64 is a branch
off of the popular movement 64 emulator
with a few tweaks for performance it's
far from perfect but it's the best
option out right now and moopan 64 is
always waiting if this doesn't work my
boy is the highest rated gameboy advance
emulator out there and for good reason
it is very stable with a ton of awesome
features it's a tad pricey at $4.99 but
worth every penny for the stability
nostalgia NES Pro is an original
Nintendo emulator for those who really
liked the old days it provides a stable
experience and a high game compatibility
it also comes with a rewind feature
which is really awesome ppsspp has been
struggling with stability since the day
it came out but recent updates have
really helped patch things up it's the
best PSP emulator hands down and the
only one you should be considering retro
arches another all-in-one emulator that
has compatibility for a range of systems
it also takes a harsh stance against
advertising and it's also open source it
does have some bugs but otherwise it's
pretty good Super legacy 16 is a Super
Nintendo emulator it features cloud
storage support a high game
compatibility and it's very stable far
and away the best SNES emulator out
