seen a couple of times before bringing a
large tablet with a kickstand in two
places like the kitchen and in this case
Alcatel is looking to create one that it
not only looks really great but provides
great functionality it's Josh of regard
from Android authority what's going on
everybody and this is Alcatel x' XS
these somewhat aptly named XS on here
sports a 17.3 inch full HD display that
provides a large slate in order to look
at everything from webpages to even
sometimes games if you so fancy but of
course the X s is being used as a way
for you to really get to your recipes
and to cooking and media while in the
kitchen 1.5 gigahertz 64-bit octa-core
processor made by mediatek underneath
the surface 2 gigabytes of RAM and 32
gigabytes of on-board storage are
available with a micro SD card expansion
slot available as well there is a front
facing camera if you do wish to take
some pictures while you are working with
the XS and then in order to power all of
this we do have a 10,000 milliamp hour
battery underneath that one unplugs
should be able to provide quite a bit of
life in the XS if you need to really
just move it around in your house and
that is something you can definitely do
as you can see in this shot the
kickstand and also the handle on the top
that allows for you to easily prop up
the excess can be used in conjunction in
order to really make this tablet pretty
portable inside of a household that's it
however the very large screen and also
some of the bulkier ends of this
particular device do make it less than
ideal for anything more than just
propping it up in a place like the
kitchen there are some nice features on
the back here as you can see propping up
or rather popping up the Alcatel
OneTouch button on the back there are
two USB ports on either side and then
underneath there we have JBL speakers 2
JBL speakers at 3 watts that do provide
quite a bit of good sound but it is
lacking in the bass Department but we'll
get to that in a little bit as well
after that a built-in stylus is also
used in order to navigate across the
interfaces if you so wish to use it for
that but of course as a touchscreen it
works just fine using your hands now we
can get into the
interface this particular tablet does
use a regular Android iteration but
there is going to be a different home
application that can be used in order to
not only leverage the large screen but
also just provide some tools for the
kitchen goer in particular over on the
right side there is one about 1/2 of the
panel that can be used for a full
webpage and in this example we saw a
recipe on one particular website and
then - it's right there were two 1/4
areas of the screen that were dedicated
on one media was available and we were
able to watch a YouTube video on there
as you can see and then beneath that
just find even more things that we might
be able to look at like Pinterest so you
are able to segment the screen in a very
nice way in order to really multitask
especially if you're looking at a recipe
but you still want to have some media at
your fingertips we only have a projected
price for the Alcatel OneTouch
access and right now it seems to be 499
dollars but they might be able to
sweeten the pot a little bit by
providing a JBL speaker with the tablet
still at the 499 price point which we
think is a pretty nice deal especially
when you consider that the JBL speaker
is something that might be able to
provide the base that the speakers on
the back of the actual tablet cannot
provide and with that we have this the
Alcatel OneTouch excess and it's
basically the large tablet by Alcatel
that is looking to enhance one
particular aspect of the household and
that is in this case the kitchen but of
course it is still a nice device to use
for media consumption if you so wish to
move it from the kitchen to other places
of the home keep it tuned to Android 34
even more on this tablet and even more
from Alcatel as we are here on the show
floor at CES 2016 bringing you all of
the best coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
