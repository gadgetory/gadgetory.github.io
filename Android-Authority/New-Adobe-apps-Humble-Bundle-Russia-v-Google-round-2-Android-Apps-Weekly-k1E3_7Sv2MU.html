show is brought to you by cloud Cal
hello again ladies and gentlemen I'm Joe
Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to android apps weekly this
is episode 110 and let's get right into
those headlines in an effort to help
websites load faster on mobile browsers
google has announced the accelerated
mobile pages project partners for this
project include twitter wordpress
linkedin pinterest and more than 20
others here's hoping this works because
loading web pages on mobile browsers is
really slow Facebook has announced an
interesting new thing called the network
connection class using this Facebook
will determine your network speed and
show you stuff in your newsfeed based on
what your network can handle resulting
in faster load times for your newsfeed
the latest humble bundle is now live and
includes six games with more to come
soon some titles include hunk the house
terror town jelly defense and fearless
fantasy you can get three games for one
dollar or pay the average which is just
around four dollars right now and grab
all of them this is also a great way to
give to charity earlier this week it was
announced that Spotify is now compatible
with rocks Scout which is an application
you can use to control car stereos
equipped with mirror link this gives you
a far more user-friendly way to control
Spotify while you're in the car a couple
of weeks ago we talked about how Russia
was thinking of ordering Google to
unbundle google apps from all of their
devices well this week they went ahead
and did exactly that the idea being that
Google's pre-loaded applications cause
an unfair disadvantage for third-party
software google has about a month to
comply or to respond for even more
Android apps and games headlines updates
and new releases don't forget to check
out this week's newsletter which is
linked in the video description below
there we have a complete list of all the
things that happened this last week and
it includes all the stuff we didn't have
time for here if you're so inclined you
can send up using your email address and
we'll send you our newsletter every
Friday to keep you up to date well
you're at it don't forget to check out
our twitch channel it's been a couple of
weeks since we've rocked out on some
video games but that's going to change
very very soon hit the follow button and
then come join us for our next stream
session for some video games and fun
chit chats okay folks let's take a look
at the applications that made a big
splash this week as usual if you want to
check any of these applications out you
can find those links in the video
description below first up this week is
auto dash this is a custom launcher
designed to be used while you're in the
car the premise is simple as the app
allows you to create a customized
control panel full of widgets for
easy access to applications navigation
and media wire in the car it also has a
few smaller features like voice
recording ifttt integration and song
recognition it's a little rough around
the edges right now so do keep that in
mind otherwise it's totally free and it
could be fun to use meter is a fun
minimal live wallpaper that displays
various system information right on your
home screen some options include your
battery your notifications your Wi-Fi
signal strength and a whole lot more it
uses minimal shapes to visually
represent the data so it's easy to see
what's going on at a glance you can also
manipulate the wallpaper by tilting the
phone like auto dash this one is a bit
rough around the edges so your mileage
may vary but hey at least it's free Zen
watch face designer is a new application
from a sous that allows you to design
your own android wear watch faces for
your asus and watch this is actually
pretty fun because it's not every day
that this kind of customization is
offered by an OEM for their devices and
we hope it becomes a trend that other
OEMs follow using this application you
can design pretty much whatever kind of
watch face that you want do note that
it's only compatible with the zen watch
so everyone else will have to keep using
alternatives it's true that showtime and
HBO now aren't really new applications
but this last week they were released on
Google Play for Android TV if you happen
to have an Android TV device you can
easily search for these applications
download them and start watching their
content their designs are both pretty
decent considering that they'll be on
the television and both services appear
to work relatively well Android TV just
got a whole lot better thanks to these
two apps last up this week or two new
applications from Adobe the first is
called capture CC in this application
lets you create a variety of design
assets by extracting information from
various images you can also turn these
shapes into vector graphics brushes and
shapes to make your design work easier
illustrator draw allows you to well draw
things this complex drawing application
lets you draw with layers and has
integration with a few of Adobe's
desktop applications both of these apps
are powerful and will get better as time
goes on they're also both free to
download this week's Android apps weekly
show is sponsored by cloud cow last week
you may remember that we showed you an
application called cloud tasks well
cloud Cal is done by the same developers
and the two apps actually work together
by singing your to-do lists from cloud
tasks into cloud cow cloud Cal has an
awesome set of features all on its own
and includes a unique month view
calendar that shows your days as Clark
bases so you can see just how busy you
are that day it also sings with
Microsoft Outlook in exchange along
google calendar it also comes with a
unique design that includes
drag-and-drop events and a slew of
standard features like inviting
colleagues to events and other
productivity and klein features it's
totally free to use so give it a shot
