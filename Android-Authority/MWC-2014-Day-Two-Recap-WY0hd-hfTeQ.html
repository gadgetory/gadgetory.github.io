by bitdefender mobile security hey Josh
regard from android authority what's
going on everybody and no I am NOT
standing in the fira gran vía of the
Mobile World Congress here in Barcelona
Spain but i do want to bring you our
recap of day two at the Mobile World
Congress but we're back in our apartment
it's been a long long day and you might
be able to hear in my voice that we're
all just like really tired but that is
the nature of the kind of job that we
have nonetheless we had a lot of fun
today and i'm going to recount just a
couple stories of the day itself but
first let's talk about the products we
did have a couple interviews with arm
and imagination who are the developers
for in case of arm they make the
processing packages for a lot of devices
out there and imagination works on the
power svr graphics that you find on some
of the devices as well great interviews
that Darcy had with them and you'll see
them here at the channel so for those of
you who are really into the the more
deep end of the tech spectrum you guys
are going to love those interviews we
also looked with Huawei today and we
spent a lot of time with them to see
their new devices in particular on all
of them our phones is the one thing that
you should remember even though the
sizes range from a very small handset
all the way up to a very large 8-inch
tablet but they can all take calls
however we'll start with the small
offering with the sng sixth is a more
budget minded version of the p6 that
came out earlier last year and it was a
very nifty little phone and the person
that we were talking to who was
showcasing the phone to us showed us a
nice little demonstration of how to take
a quick selfie with it so it's really
just one of those phones that is
accessible to a lot of people and then
we come up to the one that I think we
really liked which was the MediaPad x1
that is the 7-inch tablet that is pretty
much a phablet because it is able to
take calls so it might be one of the
biggest smartphones you've ever seen but
as a 7-inch tablet that's where we think
the money really is there because it's a
great little tablet at seven inches with
a wonderful form factor small bezels and
it is capable of quite a bit with nice
specifications underneath now the m1 is
not quite as powerful as the x1 but it
is bigger and
a very nice experience on that screen
and the finish on it did kind of remind
us of one particular source of
inspiration that we weren't sure you
know what to think of it but nonetheless
it still looks like a great tablet at
its size and is still very stylish even
if you look at it and it might make you
think of one other phone in particular
what I will tell you about that we're
really excited about however is the HTC
Desire 816 now this is a mid-range
device that kind of has a little bit of
an identity crisis because it has
flagship specs underneath that 5.5 inch
screen it's kind of somewhere in the
middle and they're not there's not
really a term to describe what kind of
phone this is in terms of the market
space but in the end it is just a very
nice device now as you probably saw in
the video we weren't able to turn on the
phone itself primarily because the next
version of sense is on here and they
want to keep that under wraps for the
moment but as far as the fuel of the
phone goes I really loved the rounded
sides and it's just a really attractive
device all around I'm not even going i'm
just gonna show the footage of the HTC
Desire 816 right now I'm not even gonna
show you me right now cuz I just really
think this is a very attractive device
okay so the second day of the show
itself basically what that meant was
everyone was trying to get to the show
more as the fira gran vía was filled
with just let's say the press on the
first day working on all of the
announcements and whatnot this was when
a lot of the sort of more industry
minded people maybe the people who are
actually in the trenches are actually
there and there's a ton of them when you
walk around there's nothing but suits
and unfortunately they all have to get
there in one way or another so all the
tunnels all of the highways all of the
roadways getting to the fira are
absolutely backed up and we were in the
thick of it our taxi cab driver god
bless him took a lot of back roads to
get us to the fira and it was a nice
scenic route but once we got near the
Pharaoh we saw just how far it was
backed up so trying to get there you
might be expecting let's say google maps
will tell you it's like a 15 minute
drive that is definitely not going to be
the case on the day of the Mobile World
Congress itself but one of the nice
things about and this is me being a
little bit cathartic with everything is
I you'll see the video right now
this was what it looks like coming home
this was the the tunnel that we went
through and during the day at the
beginning of the day this is this place
is just a nightmare full of all of these
cars and all of these taxicab drivers
everyone's a little bit angry because
there's really no way you're going to
move for a while but on the way home
once everything is done once you're on
the way back to where essentially you're
gonna rest after gating you know
whatever work done you have left it was
just nice to grill in that really long
tunnel and just you know you got to take
some moments to just remember that you
know we're in a very nice place like
Barcelona and we're really happy to be
here to bring you all of this content
and to to really report for you and to
show our passion for this kind of work
so being in that nice little cathartic
like you know let's call it tunnel
vision because we were literally in a
tunnel it was just really really nice so
the ups and downs of a show like Mobile
World Congress are very important to not
only ask but we feel to you and we
wanted to share with your experiences
here but you know what we're having a
lot of fun and we hope you enjoy all the
content here at Android authority
especially our coverage here at the
Mobile World Congress so make sure you
stay tuned because we are your source
for all things Android we also want you
to come along for the ride and we hope
you're enjoying it with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
