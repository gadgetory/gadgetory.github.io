can be a very powerful app but unlike a
lot of apps out there it's not going to
do a whole lot for you unless you invest
some time getting it properly set up so
in this video we're gonna show you how
to get more out of Google now now if
you've only played around with Google
now for a little while it's safe to
assume it probably didn't do a whole lot
that's because while it can pull
information from your phone and your
Google account
assuming you let it the real power comes
when you use it more and it starts to
learn your habits let's find out what we
can do to really unlock the power of
Google now I'm going to start with what
is probably the most important tip of
this entire video if you want to get the
most out of Google now you're going to
have to feed it a lot of information I
give Google now access to my email
location calendar read history
everything you don't have to do this but
you should know that the less
information you give Google now the less
it's going to give you back
one of the easiest and most effective
things you can do to help Google now
give you better information is set your
home and work locations Google now is
usually smart enough to figure out where
you travel just by studying your habits
but entering these manually will ensure
that it always uses the right locations
now here's one reason that can be handy
right now I'm on the way home
Google now says we'll be there in about
16 minutes let's see if it's right
I just walked in the door and it has
been 17 minutes not that Google now a
lot of Google now features aren't
especially impressive but are great as
time savers for example for quick math I
find it easier to launch Google now and
ask what 15% of 565 is for example than
it is to open up the calculator and do
the same other little features like
being able to simply ask how many
centimeters are in a foot or just say
what you want to search for rather than
typing it in turn out to be handier than
you might think a major plus compared to
other apps is that you can type your
question instead of speaking which is a
lifesaver and crowd of places sure you
can ask it questions like other virtual
assistant apps Google now is actually
very good with this but that becomes
easy to forget about once you see it's
cooler more contextual features now
there were a lot of Google now features
that only really become available when
you're traveling and they are some of
the most handy translation becomes
available ads does currency conversion
it's easy to Scout the weather at your
destination so you pack appropriately
plus if you want to know what time it is
back home all you need to do is ask
speaking of time this is an incredibly
useful feature no matter where you are
at Android Authority our team is
scattered around the world so it's handy
to know what time it is in a given place
before you send someone a google talk
message Google now is time aware so you
can ask it to remind you to do something
in 10 minutes or 2 hours which helps a
lot when you need a reminder but don't
want to open your calendar or set an
alarm
Google now isn't just about work and
serious information either if you're a
sports buff Google now has a great
sports card to keep you up on the scores
and game schedules of your favorite
teams with a recent update and even
added college teams but like a lot of
cards this isn't available everywhere
you can add teams manually if you like
but if you search for a team often
enough they'll start showing up in your
updates automatically
that is probably Google now's biggest
strength most of the time it figures out
on its own what you need to know without
you ever needing to tell it anything
hopefully you're now on the way to
training Google now to give you exactly
the right information at exactly the
right time just remember the more you
use it the better it gets now this is
kind of a lengthy subject so if you want
to know more we have a full article on
our website you can find the link in the
description of this very video we have
new videos going up all the time so if
you want to make sure you don't miss a
thing be sure to subscribe to our
Channel I'm Chris wolf for Android

time for dinner
Google I'm hungry for pizza
