by bitdefender mobile security last year
the Sony Xperia tablet Z was one of our
favorite devices of the Mobile World
Congress and this year it's update just
might take the crown once again hey it's
Josh of a guard from android authority
what's going on everybody and this is
the Sony Xperia tablet Z to the original
Xperia tablet Z was very impressively
thin and made it one of the best black
slate devices available but then Sony
even upped the ante again with the
second generation which is a
mind-boggling 6.4 millimeters thick and
not only that the tablet z 2 is actually
even lighter at 426 grams for the Wi-Fi
model the design is largely unchanged
from the first generation but with a
design that's so good there's actually a
little room for improvement you have the
same glass finish the sturdy aluminum
frame and the waterproof construction
that we've come to expect from so many
devices the specs of the display of the
tablet Z to remain the same compared to
the previous generation and we would
have liked to see Sony adopt an even
higher resolution but still it is a
great looking display that provides a
great media consumption experience now
one new feature of the display is the
live color LED which is a technology
that combines a blue LED backlight with
red or green phosphoric pixels for what
sony claims to be the world's deepest
and most intense colors on a display
like this much like the Xperia z2
smartphone that sony also launched at
mwc the tablet z 2 is powered by the
snapdragon 801 processor and 3 gigabytes
of ram now these are really top of the
line specs for a top-of-the-line device
and the performance shows it's a
pleasure to swipe through the Xperia U I
browse the web or even play a quick game
on this device you do get storage
options of 16 or 32 gigabytes along with
that micro SD card slot to extend it to
up to 64 gigabytes Tony rapes the tablet
Z 2 for 10 hours of battery life which
is the standard for 10 inch devices
these days and in a pinch the 8.1
megapixel Exmor RS camera on the back
should serve as a decent shooter the
Xperia tablet Z 2 runs KitKat android
4.4 and incorporate some of the new
features that sony introduced on the z2
some flagship smartphone there are also
slight redesigns throughout the
operating system with some aesthetics
changed here and there but for the most
part the Xperia Timescape UI
tains it's generally stock like look
with a fairly simplistic navigation
system to boot and Sony will pack the
tablet Z 2 with several blockbuster
movies so you can get started enjoying
the great screen on this tablet when it
comes to the great offering that was
already available in the Xperia tablet Z
from last year apparently there was only
one way to go and that was up and Sony
definitely did that with their updated
version of what was one of our favorite
tablets of last year so stay tuned to
android authority for our upcoming
review of this tablet and also for all
of our coverage here at the Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona Spain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
