weekly show is sponsored by pander the
hello again ladies and gentlemen I'm Joe
Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to android apps weekly this
is episode number 132 so let's get
started Google is tinkering with the
idea of adding in-app purchases to
Google cardboard content despite the
fact that people hate them in-app
purchases account for over ninety
percent of revenue in the Google Play
Store and Google wants to entice more
developers for cardboard what's holding
Google back is that they want it to be
as intuitive as possible so that it
makes less people angry late last week
some new research came to light that
seventy-seven percent of people never
use an application again 72 hours after
installing it the study found that the
most successful applications were ones
that users engaged in regularly as
opposed to ones that had specific
functions of course Google Apps were not
included in the study since you can't
really uninstall them anymore supercell
developers of clash of clans and clash
Royale released an advertisement to
announce that they have over 100 million
people who play their games every day
that's quite an achievement especially
considering that supercell has only four
games along with 14 games that they axed
before release the advertisement is also
pretty funny the Android and developer
preview is live and one of the more
exciting features is dual window support
for applications this includes a fun
feature where you can drag and drop text
between windows for easy copy and
pasting it all looks like a bunch of fun
but it is a little buggy for right now
another app related feature of android n
will be faster app optimization google
plans on removing that annoying app
optimization box after a system update
and will instead perform that process in
the background after the phone boots
apps will open a little bit slower for a
little while but eventually it'll all
work as it did before this is a welcome
improvement that should vastly improve
boot times for even more Android apps
and games news releases and updates

which is also linked in the video
description below okay folks let's take
a look at the apps and games that made a
big splash this week as usual if you
want to check out any of these apps or
games you can find those links in the
video description below VHS camcorder is
a fun little video recording application
that takes you back to the early 1990s
it does this by adding filters and stuff
to the screen to make it seem as though
you recorded your video on an old-school
camcorder fans of the retro stuff will
likely enjoy it but you won't get the
kind of crisp beautiful video you're
used to getting out of this one it's two
dollars and ninety-nine cents but there
are no in-app purchases and it seems to
work pretty well the time knots is a new
freemium game where you must collect a
variety of time NAS which are the good
guys and then do battle against the bad
guys it features a variety of settings
that span time and includes some unique
and funny characters including Gabriel
Iglesias yes as in the comedian it is a
freemium game which means it has the
classic freemium issues but it is goofy
and plays pretty well it's fun as long
as you can get around those in-app
purchases rohde is kind of like a
mixture of craigslist and uber you put
up jobs for people to do that involve
shipping cargo from point A to point B
drivers can then accept the jobs if
they've liked the money or continue on
to the next job if they don't the app
allows you to manage both sides of the
fence so drivers can accept jobs and
communicate while regular people can
post jobs of stuff they want ships
somewhere else it's a nifty idea and
we'll see how it turns out legacy quest
is a new game that features voxel
graphics and hack and slash mechanics
despite its cartoon appearance the game
is actually rather dark you are to craft
your family legacy using the souls of
the people that you kill you'll get to
travel through 70 dungeons across six
regions along with seven levels of
difficulty it plays well includes boss
fights and a whole lot more it is
suffering from some early release date
bugs so do beware of that stream is a
new live video streaming service where
you can watch people live or broadcast
yourself it aims to take on the likes of
things like twitch periscope or
Facebook's new live video feature and
other streaming sites it seems to work
rather well and it works across a
variety of interests you can use your
camera and stream what's going on around
you or broadcast yourself playing games
on your device it has some early bugs
but it's definitely worth a shot this
week's episode of the android apps
