weekly show is sponsored by pander hello
again ladies and gentlemen I'm Joe handy
the Android a30 app guy and welcome back
to Android apps weekly this is episode
number 132 so let's get started Google
is tinkering with the idea of adding
in-app purchases to Google cardboard
content despite the fact that people
hate them in-app purchases account for
over 90% of revenue in the Google Play
Store and Google wants to entice more
developers for cardboard
what's holding Google back is that they
want it to be as intuitive as possible
so that it makes less people angry late
last week some new research came to
light that 77% of people never use an
application again 72 hours after
installing it the study found that the
most successful applications were ones
that users engaged in regularly as
opposed to ones that had specific
functions of course Google apps were not
included in the study since you can't
really uninstall them any more supercell
developers of clash of clans and clash
Royale released an advertisement to
announce that they have over 100 million
people who play their games every day
that's quite an achievement especially
considering that supercell has only four
games along with 14 games that they axed
before release the advertisement is also
pretty funny the Android n Developer
Preview is live and one of the more
exciting features is dual windows
support for applications this includes a
fun feature where you can drag and drop
text between windows for easy copy and
pasting it all looks like a bunch of fun
but it is a little buggy for right now
another app related feature of Android n
will be faster app optimization google
plans on removing that annoying app
optimization box after a system update
and will instead perform that process in
the background after the phone boots
apps will open a little bit slower for a
little while but eventually it'll all
work as it did before this is a welcome
improvement that should vastly improve
boot times for even more Android apps
and games news releases and updates
don't forget to check out this week's
newsletter which is linked in the video
description below there we'll have all
of the awesome stuff we didn't have time
for here if you'd like you can subscribe
using the forum which is in the written
companion which is also in the video
description below and we'll send it to
you every Sunday for even more awesome
Android and coverage check out the
diving into Android and series right now
which is also linked in the video
description below okay folks let's take
a look at the apps and games that made a
big splash this week as usual if you
want to check out any of these apps or
games you can find those links in the
video description below
VHS camcorder is a fun little video
recording application that takes you
back to the early 1990s it does this by
adding filters and stuff to the screen
to make it seem as though you recorded
your video on an old-school camcorder
fans of the retro stuff will likely
enjoy it but you won't get the kind of
crisp beautiful video you're used to
getting out of this one it's $2.99 but
there are no in-app purchases and it
seems to work pretty well the time knots
is a new freemium game where you must
collect a variety of time notes which
are the good guys and then do battle
against the bad guys it features a
variety of settings that span time and
includes some unique and funny
characters including gabriel iglesias
yes as in the comedian it is a freemium
game which means it has the classic
freemium issues but it is goofy and
plays pretty well it's fun as long as
you can get around those in-app
purchases rody is kind of like a mixture
of Craigslist and uber you put up jobs
for people to do that involves shipping
cargo from point A to point B drivers
can then accept the jobs if they've like
the money or continue on to the next job
if they don't the app allows you to
manage both sides of the fence so
drivers can accept jobs and communicate
while regular people can post jobs of
stuff they want ships somewhere else
it's a nifty idea and we'll see how it
turns out Legacy Quest is a new game
that features voxel graphics and hack
and slash mechanics
despite its cartoon appearance the game
is actually rather dark you are to craft
your family legacy using the souls of
the people that you kill you'll get to
travel through 70 dungeons across six
regions along with seven levels of
difficulty it plays well includes boss
fights and a whole lot more it is
suffering from some early release date
bugs so do be aware of that dream is a
new live video streaming service where
you can watch people live or broadcast
yourself
it aims to take on the likes of things
like twitch periscope or Facebook's new
live video feature and other streaming
sites it seems to work rather well and
it works across a variety of interests
you can use your camera and stream
what's going on around you or broadcast
yourself playing games on your device it
has some early bugs but it's definitely
worth a shot this week's episode of the
Android apps weekly show is sponsored by
pander pander is an up-and-coming
delivery service that brings food
straight to your door it starts by
asking you questions about what kind of
food you like and then delivers
recommendations based on your individual
tastes as you order and use the
application panda will improve its
suggestions to you the application uses
a very attractive card based interface
that is both colorful and efficient
ordering stuff and then checking out is
pretty easy and the application tells
you before you do anything whether or
not their service is available in your
area it's entirely free to download so
give it a shot and show your support for
the Android apps weekly show once again
