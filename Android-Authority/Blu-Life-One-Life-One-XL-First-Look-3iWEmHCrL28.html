Android Authority and we are still here
at CES 2015 hanging out at the blue
booth and this is the life one and the
life one excel now before I get started
with this quick hands-on they're both
they're both basically the same phone
here with the exception of the size so
I'm gonna focus more specifically on the
life one excel here so I'm gonna set
this off to the side really quick and
starting off with the design here it has
some nice curvature to it on the top and
the bottom and it's also relatively thin
and it feels great in the hand it is a
big phone obviously the life one is the
one you're gonna want to get if you want
a smaller device but even with the XL it
still feels really great in the hand
despite being how large it is and the
reason why it's as big as it is is
because of the display you're looking at
a 5.5 inch display here on the XL within
in comparison to the five inch display
on the regular life one both displays
come and come in at 720p resolution and
obviously you're gonna get a little bit
better pixel density on the smaller life
one but even on the larger life one XL
here it still looks pretty good that's
very colorful very bright the viewing
angles are good and overall it actually
still looks pretty sharp a melodias only
720p now just to go over some of the
other specs real quick here it is
running on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 410
which is a 64-bit processor it's clocked
at 1.2 gigahertz and it is a quad core
processor as well and then along the
back here you're looking at a 13
megapixel camera with a flash and then
along the front you'll find the 5
megapixel camera which should allow you
to take some pretty decent looking
selfies if you're into that sort of
stuff the phone does come with eight
gigabytes of internal memory and one
gigabyte of RAM but if you if eight
gigabytes is not enough for you it does
come with microSD card for up to 64
gigabytes of additional storage now as
far as the operating system goes you're
looking at Android 4.4 KitKat
and as you can tell here it's very
lightly skinned yours there's not a
whole lot a whole lot of stuff going on
here as far as customization so it's
relatively stock Android experience and
I'll go ahead and show you that it is
indeed android 4.4 kitkat and as you can
see there's not too many things here
that blue has added with this phone here
and you can see right there it's running
on 4.4.4 kitkat and hopefully we'll see
an update to lollipop relatively soon
now as far as connectivity you're
looking at LTE and it will be compatible
on all GSM carriers so you can use this
on t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T and as far as
availability goes you're looking at a
March timeframe for one $79.99 for the
smaller life one and one $99.99 for the
larger life one excel here and it'll
it'll be available directly through
Amazon so you'll be able to purchase
this fairly easily but this has been a
quick hands-on of the life one and life
one excel by blue we're still here at
CES hanging out it's the last day so
stay tuned for the rest of the coverage
that we have coming and as always keep
it locked here on Android authority
because we are your source for all
things Android and CES 2015</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
