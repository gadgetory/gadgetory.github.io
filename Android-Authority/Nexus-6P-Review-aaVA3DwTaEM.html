has established itself as the place
where you can get the essential Android
experience but it fell short of actually
taking on all of the established
flagships of those particular years is
this the year that the Nexus finally
puts the pieces together well we're
about to find out because it is Josh of
agar from Android Authority and here it
is the Nexus 6p design takes on a whole
new outlook as Huawei is now at the helm
of creating the premium of the two Nexus
devices we start off with the metal body
which already makes this phone feel
sturdier and has a higher build quality
than plenty of other phones out there
and over on the sides they are flat
which makes this one pretty easy to grip
over on the right side are all of the
buttons including a textured power
button that makes it pretty easy to find
and up top is a headphone jack that is
opposite the USB type-c port now this
port is still taking some getting used
to for us here at Android authority
because when you're trying to charge
this phone whether at home or on the go
you just have to make sure that you
actually have the correct cord moving to
the front we have the 5.7 inch AMOLED
display that is flanked by dual
front-facing speakers which also perform
really well and give the phone a bit of
symmetry for the front but now we can
finally get to the back where some of
the new additions are truly found first
off though we have the Nexus logo which
is dead center in landscape and it has
been painted right into the body and we
still love it above that is the
fingerprint reader that is lined with a
shiny circle and then finally this black
bar up top now in the actual product
renders of this device it might not look
at that great but when you get it in the
flesh it actually kind of grows on you
this bar is where the camera the laser
autofocus and the flash can be found and
the best part about it is that it
doesn't really protrude out that much so
it really isn't that much of an eyesore
one-handed usage will take a bit of a
hit because of how large the screen is
and that's the body but the sides are
flat which means you'll be able to keep
a pretty good grip on this phone and
also the metal body allows for this to
have a sturdiness to it that is
definitely felt and it just screams high
build quality previous Nexus devices
have taken cues from that manufacturers
past offerings but Huawei has managed to
not only create a phone that is uniquely
exquisite but they also benefit from a
lesser-known
identity here in the state
so not too many people know what Huawei
is capable of and the Nexus 6p is a
wonderful showcase for them quality
continues to reign as the Nexus 6p
brings a very great display at 5.7
inches in the size you also get quad HD
resolution that's 2560 by 1440 now the
AMOLED display also brings higher
saturation in the colors along with
better black levels so the contrast is
very good as well in practice we don't
have any problems no matter what we're
doing on this display the text is
definitely very sharp whether you're
doing work or play and the colors really
benefit especially when you're using
media the only real problem we had here
was with the ambient display now there
is a feature where a small but very
effective window will show up showing
you your current notifications and with
an AMOLED display it is quite power
saving but it's kind of hard to actually
trigger it you can pretty much just pick
up the phone and it will turn on but
there are no other ways to turn it on
and it doesn't stay on for very long
once we get underneath that surface
however we get the processing package
we've kind of come to know really well
this year this time dragon 810 with
three gigabytes of RAM now three
gigabytes of RAM is the main thing here
as you'll be able to load a lot of
applications many at the same time but
ultimately we give a lot of credit to
the stock and thus not so feature-rich
version of Android you're getting here
in marshmallow going through all the
home screens and all the applications
and even incessant switching through the
recent apps screen really went through
just swimmingly and gaming has been
really fun on here as well for
everything from sprite based gaming to
3d gaming we have really no problems on
here and has been a treat so once again
the nexus proves that it isn't just
sheer power that allows for great
performance but a marriage of that power
with the optimizations in the software
that are needed to properly take
advantage of it
Hardware additions are big focus for the
Nexus this year and it all starts with
Nexus imprint that rear-mounted
fingerprint reader works really well on
here and if you have any memory of good
Huawei fingerprint readers it shows once
again here in the Nexus 6p setting up a
fingerprint is really easy and it's even
easier to just unlock and wake the
device by using usually your index
finger the best part about it is that
you're going to just get straight into
the home screen you're not going to get
a lock screen and then the animation to
get into the home screens you just put
your finger on the back and you're ready
to go now we return to the front-facing
speakers which have been really great
for
everything from media to gaming now
what's great about them is that they
provide a little bit of body while
having very loud sound but the best part
is that you can just use these for
mostly gaming which was our experience
and you don't really have to have
headphones on all the time anymore
speaking of sound call quality was
really good on the Nexus 6p about as
good as it should be and we tested it on
the t-mobile and project find networks
there were really any dropped calls and
there were no complaints on either end
of the call
also when speaking of those networks
this phone will work on all of the major
carriers in the US so that kind of takes
the guesswork out of making sure you
have the right version for your
particular cellular network
unfortunately storage options don't
include expandability which can be a
bummer for a lot of people but at least
the 32 gigabyte base model is up to
today's standards if you are able to
shell out a little bit more for the 64
gigabytes however we would definitely
recommend you do that and finally in
battery we get a huge boost not just in
the capacity of the unit inside of this
phone but also because of a new feature
in Android marshmallow called doze now
dough is pretty much requires you to
have the phone on a flat surface it's
not going to work in your pocket because
the sensors are still being triggered
when all the sensors are left
untrue then apps are put into a deep
sleep mode where the only notifications
you'll get is based upon higher priority
apps and as you can see in this graph
right here I have some flatter lines in
the graph which was basically Windows
was working it basically means that the
standby time is going to be really high
because the battery won't be draining a
whole lot due to these deep sleep modes
at the apps are going through there's
kind of a lesson here for all phone
users if you want good battery life out
of your phone then pretty much the main
thing you have to do is well not use it
but thankfully doze is able to leverage
those times when you're not using it and
make it so that this phone can
definitely go the distance even
considering my music and podcast
listening I was able to get about four
and a half hours on average of screen on
time which I still think is pretty great
considering my usage but the best part
about this is that the battery is really
easy to charge up but there's one
problem with it you're not going to use
Qualcomm quick charging on here anymore
so if you happen to have any batteries
external batteries or chargers that are
supposed to use that you're not going to
be able to use it with the Nexus 6p by
using the included USB type-c cord and
the plug adapter that leverages the
higher
our current that USB type-c supports you
will be able to charge this from zero to
a hundred in under 90 minutes now if you
have like 10 or 15 minutes in the middle
of your day to just plug this thing in
you'll get just enough battery to get
through the bigger portion of the rest
of your day so really there's no problem
when it comes to power on here
especially when the battery already goes
for a long time now if there's one place
where the Nexus devices tended to kind
of fall short it was in the camera but
this year the Nexus has to contend with
what has been a pretty incredible year
for smartphone cameras and this year
they have risen to the challenge a 12
point three megapixel shooter on the
back there also comes in at one point
five microns now that sounds a little
bit miniscule but what that basically
means is that the sensor on this phone
is bigger than most of the ones found
out there and unfortunately that means
there is no optical image stabilization
on here but that's something you'll
mostly see in videos with jittery
footage then you'll see in photos that
said the app doesn't really provide too
many options unfortunately it's a pretty
good auto app but you don't get a whole
lot of manual controls and as far as
modes go for photo you can get hdr+
on auto and then you have panorama Lens
Blur and photosphere and not a whole lot
else after that in video you do get 4k
video recording but we had more fun with
the slow-motion recording at 120 or 240
frames per second at 720 reason now
image quality was actually pretty great
what details captured quite well despite
there being a noticeable but very small
amounts of noise reduction still at play
low-light situations to require at least
a little bit of light so you can
differentiate the subject from the rest
of the surroundings but at least here in
the Nexus 6p they don't just show up as
a big ball of fuzz over all photos
benefit from a noticeable but somewhat
subtle amount of saturation so the
colors are punched out a little bit but
the Nexus 6p does cheat a little bit
because it has that AMOLED display that
provides even more saturation to the eye
basically the results are just that
little bit different when you get them
on a computer screen panoramas were
stitched together without too many
problems and HDR plus was a mode that we
were pretty happy to use most of the
time but we did find it to be a little
bit moody in some pictures it would
raise the shadows and in other pictures
it would lower the highlights and we
could never really tell when we were
shooting it what was going to happen but
there's one thing for sure hdr+
definitely punches
the colors even more overall we're
really happy with the Nexus cameras
mostly because now you don't have to
feel like you're settling for these
cameras when you compare them to the
other flagships available in android
today and finally we have Android
marshmallow which brings the crux of the
nexus experience the latest and greatest
of Android with updates for the
foreseeable future for what it is right
now Android is essentially everything
that you know right now about Android
has the home screens Google now is over
on the side and of course you have the
app drawer which is the first place you
see a change it's now of a vertical
scroll but it also has a line up top for
your four most used applications we
would have liked an extra line up there
but that one line is still pretty useful
now this new version of Android doesn't
bring that many super flashy new
features but there is one that is kind
of flashing and that is Google now on
tap now on tap doesn't really replace
Google now but it does allow you to
search for anything that is currently
displayed on the screen by just holding
the home button and what you're
searching for should be in text and very
plainly seen on the screen now it is
kind of Moody also because now on tap
might not pull the information that
you're expecting it to pull but at the
same time it's just sort of a feature
that works really well when it does the
rest of the features are less flashy but
are just as important we already
featured doze earlier in the battery
section and then after that you have app
permissions now app permissions can be
found in the settings area where all of
the different features of the phone that
applications my access are listed and
you can change whether you want any apps
to do so or not but when you first fire
up an app and the first time it tries to
access a feature of the phone the app
permissions will ask you if you do
actually want it to do so if there's
anybody out there who really wants some
extra security when it comes to Android
all of the app permissions in the new
version of Android should be able to
bring that little bit of peace of mind
for you of course the main reason to get
the Nexus in software is to get the
latest and most optimised version of
Android and it really shows here small
tweaks of the animations make Android
feel that much smoother but overall the
experience is still incredibly snappy
and users will be able to enjoy the best
that Android has to offer as it is being
released the Nexus 6p starts at $499
which is less than typical flagships but
is definitely a premium price for a
nexus phone it might be a pretty penny
but at least you're getting a pretty
great experience in a properly premium
pretty body now some people might scoff
at the price saying that the Nexus was
supposed to be an affordable flagship
device but that was kind of broken last
year when we had the Nexus 6 which
brought a really high price despite not
necessarily meeting that level of value
but this year the 6p is like finding a
middle ground a phone that truly looks
and feels high-end but has enough to
boast about underneath that shell
including a camera that finally does
justice to the word flagship if you want
Android at its absolute purest state
either of these Nexus phones will give
you what you want but when you're
thinking of a truly high-end flagship
your Android phone then the Nexus 6p is
the one that takes that crown and thus
our accolades when it's as good at
running a marathon as it is at running a
sprint we pay attention and as an
Android phone fully capable of
satisfying just about anyone this one is
definitely worthy of your consideration
as always thank you guys very much for
watching and hope you enjoyed this full
review of the Nexus 6p it is a Nexus
device through and through but it also
manages to be a flagship a true flagship
through and through and that might be
what we love most about it keep it tuned
