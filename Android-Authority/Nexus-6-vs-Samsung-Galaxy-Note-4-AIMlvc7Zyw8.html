into the large form factor market a
space that has been more or less
dominated by Samsung and finally they
can go head-to-head this is the Nexus 6
versus the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 size is
the name of the game here as the Nexus 6
brings the Google flagship line into the
realm Samsung basically started with the
note line the current arguable champion
of the large smartphone space the Galaxy
Note 4 brings a new metallic frame to
hold together the 2.5 D glass front with
the removable back cover made of
textured plastic Samsung's signature
button layout returns with the tactile
home button flanked by back and recent
apps buttons along with the power button
and volume rockers on the sides and the
S Pen is nestled in the bottom right
slot easily tucked away until you need
it the more rigid lines of the Galaxy
Note 4 go up against Motorola's curved
design language in the Nexus 6 a
metallic frame also helps keep a 2.5 D
glass front connected to the Nexus 6
backing made of a curved constructed of
hard plastic the five point nine six
inch screen makes the entire device a
bit larger all around as it quite
literally covers up the note floor and
two fun facing speaker grilles are found
centered in the top and bottom bezels
size certainly makes a difference with
either phone but materials play a pretty
big role as well the almost point
three-inch increase in the Nexus 6
screen size is also found in its height
and width and the note 4 flat sides and
the textured backing help keep the grip
pretty secure which is contrasted by the
Nexus 6 who's backing slips around in
the hand not to mention the curved side
to make it more difficult to keep an
easy grip that you might not already
have aesthetically we don't fault either
of these phones for their looks
Samsung has finally gotten designed
right on one of their flagship phones
and Google has turned to the steady
design hand of Motorola to create one of
the most exquisite Nexus devices yet and
while the note 4 might eventually feel
normal to a user not quite used to large
form factors the learning curve might
just tend to be a little bit steeper in
the Nexus 6 an increase of nearly two
tenths of an inch for the Nexus 6 screen
over the note 4 pretty much sums up the
display differences here as both bring
quad HD resolution to the Android fold
quad HD is the new weapon in today's
spec Wars and while we don't quite feel
huge difference from 1080p we also
aren't complaining much about the change
both of these screens are also
constructed of AMOLED technology with
Samsung once again employing their
tried-and-true Super AMOLED displays to
bring the high saturation and contrast
you may come to expect from Samsung
flagship devices now AMOLED is utilized
by the Nexus 6 in similar fashion as its
colors have some of that saturation and
very comparable sharpness though its
main advantage is the activation of
certain pixels for the ambient display
either screen will bring high fidelity
viewing and only at the steepest of
angles does the Nexus 6 lose a little of
it though the Nexus 6 displays a bit
larger the experience of media and
gaming is largely the same between the
two in a word they're fun it's worth
noting that if the high saturation of
Samsung's display isn't your thing the
color profile can be altered accordingly
the Nexus 6 doesn't have the same level
of adjustments available but it's AMOLED
iteration is certainly not as gross an
offender to begin with performance
differences on these devices will have
less to do about the processing packages
and more to do with the software
implementations primarily because both
sport the Snapdragon 805 with the
adrenal 420 and 3 gigabytes of RAM as
the highest performer in the current
spec race the Snapdragon 805 does well
to keep everything performing as well as
they should so if you choose samsung's
touchwiz it's more bubbly aesthetic and
multitasking capabilities will help you
get a lot done even sometimes at once
but the newest version of Android
lollipop has arrived on the Nexus 6 and
brings its own flowing transitions and
animations pleasing the Android purist I
cannot stress enough how the software
plays into the experience that you will
have as these flagship devices pack the
same amount of capable power and it's in
hardware that we find some real
separation between these two devices
with the obvious point being the
inclusion of Samsung's S Pen in the note
4 for all of the functionality that
TouchWiz already brings the stylus
experience greatly adds to the note 4
you can use it like a pen like a mouse
to click and drag items and as a means
to record just about anything you need
when removed the S Pen opens up the air
command menu to give you choices use S
note for recording nodes in a variety of
ways clip out the screen if you need to
save it or just write some text down for
contextual actions even if you don't use
the s-pen normally the click and drag
enhancement of the note 4 is one of
most compelling reasons to start the
Nexus 6 on the other hand keeps things
pretty bare-bones providing all of the
essentials but nothing too extra namely
the lack of a removable battery or
expandable storage both features that
are found on the note 4 what it does
excel in is the sound experience because
the dual front-facing speakers simply do
a much finer job than the rear-facing
speaker of its Samsung competitor but in
battery I have a harder time
recommending the Nexus 6 because it's
screen off power consumption in my
experience was simply not as frugal as
the note 4 both are certainly capable of
going for close to four or five hours
and screen on time but I haven't been
able to get close to the two full days
of general usage on the Nexus 6 that I
would hope in camera the biggest story
is the improvement in the Nexus 6 camera
experience simply put this is the best
Nexus camera available but Samsung's
latest cameras are among the best in the
business we'll start with the Nexus 6
whose 13 megapixel camera now provides
better colors very decent detail and
it's camera app simplicity makes
shooting pretty easy hdr+ is definitely
the big performer here doing the job
properly in brightening shadows
darkening highlights and overall
providing the compelling image that it
should panorama and photosphere aren't
often used features but are available
and the 4k video recording tends to
yield some great looking large clips the
note 4 has the high number of features
in its camera you might expect Samsung
to throw in hitting the Settings button
yields a rather daunting list of toggles
HDR is available here as well though it
doesn't quite have the profound effect
that you might find in the Nexus 6
photos but that's ok because the general
photo quality is already quite great
higher saturation levels in the
processing or sure to please the general
user while the large 16 megapixel photos
capture plenty of detail and video
including 4k benefits from the same
coloration low-light situations make the
quality taper off but this is pretty
much expected optical image
stabilization arrives in both of these
phones and does help a little bit
despite the higher saturation levels of
the note for pictures I can see people
having a more reliable time with the
Samsung camera the Nexus 6 misses the
mark a bit more but it can't be
emphasized enough how much of an
improvement this is for the Nexus line
and finally we have the age-old debate
of stock Android vs. TouchWiz that we
are expecting an update to lollipop on
the note 4 we can still make this
person because TouchWiz will add so much
on top of the stock experience that you
can find on the Nexus 6 the second home
screen experience returns on both of
these phones but it should come as no
surprise that Google now is a much
better alternative to the highly curated
pretty much non customizable fullscreen
widget for Flipboard on the note 4
TouchWiz has gone through a number of
changes recently bringing a more refined
design and better access to multitasking
capabilities the recent apps screen is
one of the main areas of change where a
multi window button has been added to
easily create the dual application setup
floating windows have also been added to
the mix and the ability to seamlessly
switch between all of these modes
further helps those looking to get many
tasks done for example when in an app
dragging from a top corner will shrink
and down to a floating window which
provides buttons to expand it again or
create a minimized icon for later use
stack these apps or fire up the multi
window from here to your heart's content
now multitasking is a compelling reason
to pick the note 4 as the recent apps
screen is still the main way that users
perform tasks in stock Android even in
lollipop though the recent apps screen
has been enhanced to include chrome tabs
in its stacked card design the list can
get quite enormous and slipping in and
out of apps though still quick and easy
doesn't hold a candle to using two or
more at once with the multi window but
what stock Android brings to the table
is an overhauled version of Android
providing a newly attractive flat design
full of easy clues to what features lie
underneath the surface the animations
and transitions make for a very seamless
feel and for the Android purist and this
is simply the best that the interface
has ever been it ultimately comes down
to how many features you're willing to
sift through in stock lollipop the
recent apps screen might be daunting but
so are all of the different ways you can
navigate the multitasking abilities of
the note 4 if you need to do many things
at once the note 4 is the more
compelling choice but stock lollipop is
one of the smoothest and most beautiful
iterations of Android yet what has been
a little disconcerting to users wanting
the Nexus 6 is how much more expensive
it is from previous Nexus releases but
when you factor in how much Google and
Motorola have packed into this powerful
device it does make some sense after all
the note 4 is still more expensive at
over $700 definitely keeping the premium
both of these phones are available under
subsidies and payment plans however so
the entry points actually aren't too far
from one
another and so there you have it both of
these phones have received our Editors
Choice Awards and for good reason
either these devices will bring you the
best that their respective lines offer
when pitting one against the other
however the choice isn't quite so simple
fundamentally both phones provide power
and large form factors capable of making
everything underneath run smoothly it's
just a matter of how you want to perform
your general tasks the note 4 tries very
hard to be everything to the user
providing multitasking abilities atop a
one-of-a-kind stylus experience you can
certainly do all of your tasks on the
Nexus 6 still but its methods are vastly
different just by getting the all-around
upgrade that any Android purist will
enjoy unless you don't want a big phone
you're looking at the two phones that
arguably can offer the most for the most
people in either case you'll get a
powerful highly capable phone that won't
disappoint keep it tuned to Android
authority for all of the best coverage
and on the side there you can see our
full reviews for both of these devices
