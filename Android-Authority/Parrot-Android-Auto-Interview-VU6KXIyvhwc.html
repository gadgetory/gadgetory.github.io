2015
we're here with Andrea thority and we
are fortunate to be in the parrot booth
checking out their wonderful products
I'm here with dr. whale Morelli he's a
project manager a parent and they're
gonna show us their latest Android in
the car okay high five thank you good so
here is the power of nb6
the most connected the new generation of
alpha tainment system
it's an aftermarket product which makes
a media so you can have a USB stick and
control the media of your system you can
make phone calls also so the other is
running completely on yes the operating
system is based powered by Android 5.0
it's enjoyed lollipop so then you have
applications you guys see under
Authority right there so it's connected
to the car so you can control your
private
very nice I saw a lot of custom
development went into this to adapt it
for this car yeah yeah it's come to it
will be compatible with 90% of the cars
on the market nice so in in terms of a
person connecting to the device if they
have their smartphone and they want to
access music would they do a Bluetooth
connection or could they do a USB yeah a
native mod and when they are used on v6
mode they can connect through USB a
fabulous little different and then they
connect on USB they have the protected
mode of Android auto so you can share
they or see you back there Auto runs is
an application yes so they have here the
music you have the music on your phone
that's Google Play Music yes that's a
good song let's play some music
and then you also have the applications
mark you install everything on the phone
you configure yahoo account your
playlist you arrive in the car you just
plug in then you have everything
displayed on the main screen you also
have Google Maps with turn-by-turn
navigation you can show us where we are
find the nearest best buy we talk about
pricing and release the release would be
this year later this year the price is
not yet community and ok I understand
what the base display wonderful
so parrot has a lot of experience making
double date displays yes you've been in
this place for a long time and you one
of the earliest adopters of Android in
the car you had a your own customers
before but what do you view as the
potential look what do you see things
going you know the consumer demand you
know are you selling a lot of these
types of units yes yes the idea is to
provide to be compatible with Android
auto and also carplay in order to bring
technology a smartphone technology in
the car we also have a Altoid phone but
we adjust the user experience to the car
using word you drive you don't text and
drive so we bring many many vocal
systems many vocal commands many many
vocal commands here you have the dash
camera which will be provided with it so
yeah Eiffel Tower let's talk about
what's on the rear of the unit so what
are we looking at here so here you have
a you have a 4 a 4 channel amplifier
yeah and you have a GPS GLONASS they
have the radio Diaby digital audio
broadcasting they have also the video
audio video input for the rear camera
display the video input and output it's
compatible with a machine also so we can
have multiple displays in the car yeah
for a seat entertainment yeah so you can
connect with a HDMI or also with an
Ethernet is this is the port to connect
your frontal camera it will be connected
to the OBD port well into the wire
yeah will be connected with a while
directly to the car nice and he will be
a Ethernet for the future and you have
two USB stick to connect sure there's
also NHL or USB this for the development
aid in order to develop applications
because we were released an SDK for the
developers station developers read my
mind
yeah and the last one is in vehicle
networking is to interface with the car
to communicate with the canvas through
canvas in order to retain the steering
wheel commands so in terms of the output
of the amplifier what are we looking at
in terms of for channel yeah it's for
channel and the up footage in terms of
wattage is like 50 watts RMS per channel
or do you know the output the power yeah
62 okay 62 yeah exactly
sounds good means better than wonderful
okay what's pretty straightforward so
and what is the product called pirate
island e6 okay will be released this
year it'll become available in the
United States and worldwide okay
fantastic I want to say big thank you
for your time thank you alright well it
starts like cavae reporting live from
