watching the android authority channel
on youtube HTC has been fighting a long
and hard battle of the Android ways
though a few months back the company
vowed to stay closer to the high-end
phones market that in means staying out
of the mid-range phone's market in fact
I have here a new mid-range HTC phone
the HTC Desire X is it desirable as its
name suggests it to be find out in the
rest of this video review the HTC Desire
X looks pretty much like the HTC One X
as you can see it is a small phone the
screen diagonal is only four inches it
is a very pocketable phone and it's also
very easy on the hand because it is very
light the Desire X follows the
minimalistic design of the HTC One
series with the HTC logo over here and
the capacitive buttons here the LED
notification light is right here and
just like most mid-range Android phones
there's no front camera this trimming
here is aluminum it runs along the top
and bottom of the front and the left and
right sides it adds an air of elegance
to the phone actually I really love how
I can easily reach the physical buttons
with one hand the width and height are
just right the power button is over here
on top and on the left is the headphone
jack the volume keys are here on the
right a quick note about the volume keys
they are a bit unresponsive to light
tapping you'll need to press harder to
lower or increase the volume it's
probably a good thing it can guard
against accidentally increasing or
decreasing the volume as you use the
phone the microUSB port is found here on
the left side the microphones over here
at the bottom at the back is a very
beautiful matte white cover it's not
glossy so it doesn't catch fingerprints
easily this was the 5 megapixel camera
accented by a metallic blue green border
this phone also has Beats Audio as
indicated by its logo down here this
back cover appears non removable because
you don't find any notch or lock
anywhere but if you take your fingernail
like this here and pull gently the cover
can be removed
let's see what's underneath
here's the removable battery it has a
capacity of 1650 mAh but should give
about 10 hours of talktime on a 3G
connection here's the SIM tray and
here's the micro SD card slot for up to
32 gigabytes of additional storage this
phone has only 4 gigabytes of internal
storage and only about one gigabyte of
it can be used let's return the battery
and cover now so we can fire up this
phone as you can see the back cover
snaps into place so make sure you snap
all locks firmly
now let's check the display here's the
familiar HTC logo and moto with the
Beats Audio logo at the bottom as you
can see here the phone is still booting
up now here's the lockscreen with HTC
signature lock ring
this phone runs the latest version of
Ice Cream Sandwich Android 4.0 point
four with HTC Sense 4.1 the same user
interface as that on the HTC One X sadly
no jellybean for this phone yet drag the
rain tail unlock the phone here's the
home screen here's the HTC standard
clock and weather widget it's actually
one of the most beautiful we've ever
seen this home screen is pretty much a
smaller version of the HTC One X home
screen as you can see swiping between
home screens is very smooth and fluid
but I noticed that the capacitive button
sometimes takes some time before
responding to touch input the display
itself is very sharp as I've mentioned
the screen diagonal is four inches
display resolution is 800 by 480 of 233
pixels per inch with such density that
displays very sharp and crisp as you can
see here the contrast is also great
however I noticed a bluish tint on the
display regardless it's an amazing
display for a phone that's considered
mid-range the Desire X is powered by a
Qualcomm Snapdragon MNZM 8 to 25 chipset
with a dual-core 1 gigahertz CPU it
comes with 768 megabytes of RAM and 4
gigabytes of internal storage storage
expansion is possible up to 32 gigabytes
more courtesy of the microSD card slot
underneath the backplate as for the
camera it surprisingly is snappy I
particularly love how fast it out of
focuses on the subject though there's
some slight delay after you press the
shutter photo and video quality is quite
ok - especially those taken outdoors
though it cannot record HD videos
neither can it stock media player play
HD videos
as for sound quality Beats Audio does
make a difference especially when you
plug in your headphones sound from the
loudspeaker is loud enough though a bit
too high on the trouble as for the rest
of the interface it's pretty much stock
HTC Sense 4.1 with it's very beautiful
themes lots of personalization features
and eye candy and some the HTC Desire X
is a great mid-range phone it has a
decent build with a touch of classy
design the HTC has become known for well
it doesn't have super powerful hardware
after all this is just mid-range it
gives you sharp display on a 4-inch
screen acceptable performance for
everyday use a fast-enough camera with
acceptable photo and video output
quality and an overall fast and
responsive user interface most of all
its size is perfect for the pocket and
for easy grip what do you think of the
HTC Desire X does it have the X Factor
that makes you want to desire it share
