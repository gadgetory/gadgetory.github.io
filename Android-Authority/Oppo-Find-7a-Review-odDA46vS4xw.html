oppo the Chinese manufacturer that made
a splash last year by offering the first
grade 1080p display experience with the
fly in five and then by making us turn
our heads for the rotating camera of the
n1 but now they are looking to be ahead
of the curve again with the phone that
sports a quad HD display but we don't
have that version of the phone not yet
as the way continues we can at least
look at its more conventional offering
that sports a 1080p display instead but
still has a lot to offer
hey it's Josh Vergara from Android
Authority and this is the Opel find 7a
yes you heard right this is the Opel
find 7a the version of OPOs new flagship
that does not support the 2k or quad HD
display but in just about every other
aspect this is pretty much the same
device when it comes to the design you
get an aesthetic that is actually very
similar to the Opel fine 5 that came
before it except this time around it has
been blown up to a 5.5 inch display
capacitive keys lined a lower portion of
the front while the very nice skyline
LED notification light adorns the very
bottom around the sides the button
layout consists of a mirrored setup
denim generally used to with the power
Bund being on the left and the volume
rockers found on the right and while
they are really squishy to the touch I
didn't have any problem with their
responsiveness thankfully once you make
it around the back you'll find that the
cover is actually removable and it gives
you access to the removable battery and
the microSD and SIM trays these covers
can be replaced though the version that
we were hoping to use the carbon fiber
backing is only available on the premium
version of the fine 7 overall Elbo
continues to put the good looks into
their devices and the find 7a is
definitely in line with all of the good
built call you that we've come to expect
from Oppo as there is a bit of a heft to
this phone and it is felt all throughout
handling is primarily predicated by the
larger screen size at 5.5 inches this is
not the kind of screen you'll be able to
maneuver around easily in one hand flat
sides allow for a pretty good grip but
otherwise you'll be performing plenty of
hand gymnastics to at least reach the
top of the display ultimately we have a
phone here that does tow the line
between aesthetic and
especially considering that that back
cover is removable and then you have
some extra freedom given the features
that are available underneath that hood
coming in at 5.5 inches the screen on
the Oppo find 7 a is more conventional
in the sense that it is a 1080p display
and not the quad HD one found in the
premium edition but don't let that
dissuade you from looking at this device
as a viable option when we did get our
first hands-on with the two versions of
the Oppo find 7 we initially concluded
that the general user won't really
notice that bump up or down in
resolution depending on the version you
end up getting so standing alone this
IPS display brings great colors and
brightness to the aptly-named color OS
which does shine through the screen
quite well pretty much any task you
throw out this vibrant display will look
and perform greatly from text to gaming
and all in all there are no complaints
with this display and it is even
enhanced by the ability to register a
myriad of gestures which we'll get into
a little bit later and as has been the
trend of Oppo devices the fine 7 comes
with the best processing package readily
available the Snapdragon 801 clocked in
at 2.3 gigahertz backed by the adrenal
330 and 2 gigabytes of RAM so many
flagship devices these days come with
this very package so the performance
aspect should yield no surprises you get
the speed you probably come to expect
and pretty much any tasks available
multitasking doesn't bog down the system
by any means as going in and out of
different applications is easy using the
recent apps screen and using Chrome in
this case for web browsing works a treat
as all the websites loaded snappily and
without any issues so you can rest
assured that even if this is not the
considered the premium version of oboes
flagship it still packs the same amount
of punch underneath the hood and it is
in the hardware department that the oval
find 7a can actually pull away from many
flagship devices I just put up against
with a couple of aces that do well to
differentiate it
the first Hardware aspect that is pretty
easy to see off the bat is the skyline
notification light that is nestled at
the bottom curve of the phone's face it
is a light that permeates through its
curved line and it just looks really
slick now while the light does tell you
if there are notifications and actually
does tell you if the device is indeed
charging the only real gripe with it is
that it only shines blue if we were able
to maybe customize the
color of the LED that would have really
put it over the top all connectivity was
touted to be available here from
Bluetooth to NFC but there was a problem
with the mobile network connections that
has been pretty well documented by now
anyone looking for LTE connectivity on
the t-mobile network might have some
trouble as I did because I just couldn't
get this phone to work on the LTE 4G
network of t-mobile I did finally
managed to get LTE on a u.s. network
using AT&amp;amp;T but it required me to do some
sleuthing with customer support to
provide the IMEI number and some extra
information in the end it was a bit of a
pain to finally get the full mobile
network experience on my version of the
Opel find 7a so for a lot of people out
there that may not have been the case
I'm just letting you know that if you're
going to get this phone you should be
worried that that might happen call
quality yielded no problems however as
the call sounded crisp and clear on
either side and I would put the
loudspeaker in the above-average
category as while it might not be the
loudest that I've ever used the sound
did have a noticeable fullness to it and
it provided a more than decent
experience onboard storage on this
device came in at 16 gigabytes but is
bolstered by the inclusion of a microSD
card slot that is found underneath that
removable cover and finally in battery
we have to talk about that Buch fast
charger I already did a feature focus
video on it basically outlining how it
simply works wonders and has become a
great asset to have essentially a 4.5
amp charger is outfitted with a little
extra tech along with two extra pins and
the actual micro USB connector to
provide a charging time of nought to 100
in about an hour no matter how you slice
it that's an incredible feature to have
and has definitely saved many morning's
often when I forget to plug in the night
before unfortunately there is a bit of a
trade-off because the 2800 milliamp hour
battery unit found in the opal find 7a
actually does get select up pretty
easily and on plenty instances I did
find myself scared of running out of
juice before the end of my day so in
that sense it is nice to have the book
fast charger to save you in those
particular situations but if you really
want to maximize your power consumption
your power experience then it might be a
good idea to carry a spare which is a
nice feature to have on this the opal
find 7a the camera of the Oppo find 7
is powered by Sony Exmor and brings 13
megapixels to the party as we start off
with the app however we find quite a few
different features available for some
fun smartphone photography slow shutter
capture that was originally introduced
in the Oppo n1 allows you to do some
light magic with a properly structured
scene shooting in RAW format is
available and while that was an exciting
prospect I unfortunately found it more
or less unusable because the amount of
time needed to process the file after
snapping was simply way too long to make
it a viable tool HDR scene modes and of
course the Ultra HD
50 megapixel shooting modes are thus
available after that the 50 megapixel
shots do require some extra processing
time too but the resulting images are
actually quite good they are just below
the sharpness level of normal shots but
that's actually kind of ok because I
believe the takeaway is that if you
wanted to use the software built
pictures you actually don't lose that
much fidelity at all in the final
products after that the general picture
quality of the rear camera yielded good
photos not oversaturated by any means
but also not dull with sharpness levels
definitely where they should be in
proper situations it's not hard to get a
good shot out of this camera the video
capture did bring about some nice 4k
clips in my testing so the only real
disappointment in my testing was the
quality of the video shot by the
front-facing camera
and finally in software the experience
on the Oppo find 7a is handled by color
OS an interface that has pretty distinct
character but also nice functionality
what might strike you first is the
ethereal look as I've been describing it
that the home screens tend to take on
with its overtly earth tones but
otherwise you still get the typical slew
of icons and widgets to be able to
customize it the way you want scroll all
the way to the right and you'll find
media pages that either give you an easy
way of using your camera or controlling
your local music quite a bit of
customization can be had here we even
with the ability to set a weather effect
based upon the current conditions in
your area all of this can be further
catered to your liking with the pretty
powerful theme engine which can
drastically change the look of your
experience even to one more stock like
in color and icon set now get further
beneath the surface and you'll get a
pretty standard fare with the app drawer
which once wasn't a part of the color OS
lexicon and the settings menu that is
pretty
easy-to-navigate the only gripes here
include the quick settings which you can
pull down in the notification drop-down
but the thing is the pull down
eliminates the ability to see expanded
versions of your notifications which is
something I tend to always use so this
was rather annoying after that the other
issues are mainly in the translations
which is a common trope of Asian
operating systems sometimes the
description that you see there doesn't
really easily tell you what the
underlying setting is what color OS does
greatly deal with is gestures you can
swipe down from the left of the
notification bar and you'll get a canvas
to draw any number of programmable
traces to do a myriad of tasks I find
this area pretty useful but the gestures
I far use more often are the ones drawn
on a turned off screen for example draw
a circle to easily get to the camera or
do the all-too-familiar double tap to
simply turn the screen on now color OS
is definitely unique but it is also
definitely workable and I do realize
that for some people out there it might
not necessarily be your cup of tea but
thankfully OBO devices tend to come with
built-in recovery so you can always put
on a custom ROM or if you want to keep
it simple you can always just install a
custom launcher to change the experience
to what you want at $499 the Oppo find
7a is not as steep as the mainstream
flagship devices we already have but it
is still somewhat steep nonetheless one
put up against the likes of the samsung
galaxy s5 and the HTC One m8 for example
opals main claim to fame is a reliable
fast charging solution that in my
opinion does make that high price pill
easier to swallow and of course the main
device that is uttered in the same
breath as Oppo is the oneplus one a
phone that comes in at 299 but has a
fixed battery fixed storage and does not
come with the vogue charger all features
that I actually do believe justify the
extra 200 bucks if you really need those
features and so there you have it the
Oppo find 7 a the a in this phones name
might act like something of an asterisk
the part of the Oppo find 7 experience
that is more of a footnote compared to
the premium quad HD flagship but that
certainly isn't the case when the one we
can readily have right now is the 7a and
to its point to this
is capable of standing up to the more
widely known flagship devices especially
when considered have $200 less unlocked
on average Oppo made a splash with the
fine 5 outfitting it with one of the
first 1080p displays of the time and
with the fine 7 it has done so again
with the first quad HD screen but with
the find 7a we can argue that they have
found a way to alleviate the common
power issue by providing a fast charging
solution so if you look at it that way
the Oppo find 7 a has that as its ace up
its sleeve elbow continues to push the
envelope which should be appreciated
because generally the features that they
introduce in each new iteration they
actually tend to land pretty well so
what you get in the Oppo find 7 a is an
alternative yet again to the galaxies
the ones the Xperia sout there that
definitely deserves more attention so as
always thank you guys very much for
watching and I hope you enjoyed this
review of the Oppo find 7 a we're still
waiting on the quad HD version the
premium version that also has that
carbon fiber backing we really liked but
until that comes we still have this
version of the Oppo find 7 that is still
a viable alternative to all of the
flagships that are currently out today
