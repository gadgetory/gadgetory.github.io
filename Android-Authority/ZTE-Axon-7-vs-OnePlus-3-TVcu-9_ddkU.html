with Android authority let's say you
have four hundred dollars to spend on
one of the two hottest affordable
flagships so which one do you buy well
let's answer that question in our video
comparison between the one plus three
and ZTE axon seven both phones share a
number of design elements starting with
the aluminum unibody x' well the one
plus three is slightly thinner and
lighter than the axon seven it's not
really noticeable in the hand thanks to
the accent seven slightly more dramatic
curve which also helps reduce the size
of a camera bump you can purchase one of
the many style swap covers to not only
eliminate the one plus is slightly
larger but still minor camera bump but
also to make the oneplus easier to grip
while it's light edges do help with grip
when using the phone without a case the
result in some pretty sharp corners
which iPhone to uncomfortably dig into
my hands the exon 7 is much more
comfortable and elegant looking because
of ZG ease no edge philosophy but the
trade-off is that it's even more
slippery than the oneplus one of the one
plus three is more unique features is
its alert slider which is a handy visual
indicator of your phone's ring our
status in regards to the navigation keys
both devices allow you to swap the back
and multitasking buttons which is
certainly a great option to have it's
worth mentioning that the one plusses
buttons are both illuminated and spread
out more than the Exxon sevens keys
which makes them easier to find
I also wish that ZTE would have included
an option to enable on-screen keys like
the oneplus has both displays are 5.5
inch AMOLED panels but the axon 7 is of
a higher quad HD resolution compared to
the 1 plus 3 1080p resolution
interestingly the exon 7 still has
better battery life than the 1 plus 3
but I'll talk about that in just a
moment I have to agree that you don't
really need a quad HD display for daily
use as the difference compared to a full
HD display isn't all that noticeable if
you don't plan on using a VR headset in
the future the 1 plus 3s display will be
absolutely fine and as a plus it is a
bit
brighter so sunlight readability is also
slightly better one other thing though I
noticed that the 1 plus 3s display tends
to scratch more easily than the axe on
sevens despite both being coated in
Corning Gorilla Glass 4 it might just be
me but do be aware that you might want
to pick up a screen protector
since both phones are being powered by
the high end Qualcomm Snapdragon 820
with the audrina 530 GPU performance is
identical I didn't notice a discernible
difference when launching or using apps
despite the 1 plus 3s display
theoretically being less of a burden on
the GPU the oneplus 3 does include a
whopping 6 gigabytes of RAM compared to
the accent sevens 4 gigabytes and yes
I'm aware that there's also a 6 gigabyte
xn7 variant but it's not available in
the u.s. at least not yet and when it
does launch it's very likely going to be
more expensive than the 1 plus 3 anyway
6 gigabytes is definitely good for
future proofing but for the time being
this isn't a major advantage at least in
my opinion one of the advantages that
both the oneplus 3 and axon 7 offer is
unlocked dual SIM support unlike the one
plus 3 which is only fully compatible
with AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile the xn7 works on
all major US carriers you can also
insert a microSD card into one of the
sim card slots on the xn7
to expand its 64 gigabytes of internal
storage up to an additional 256
gigabytes the oneplus 3 does also
include 64 gigabytes of storage but it
doesn't offer any expansion options
unfortunately for the fingerprint
readers the oneplus threes is embedded
in its home button on the front whereas
the exon 7 is slightly recessed on the
back below the camera both readers are
very fast and accurate and although the
oneplus 3 seems very slightly faster
side-by-side the difference isn't really
noticeable day-to-day the accent 7 also
has a major advantage with its dual
stereo front-facing speakers one plus
three single bottom firing speaker is
loud sure but it sounds distorted and is
only overall of average quality the axon
7 setup is a
optional with Dolby Atmos around some
technology this is perhaps the best
mobile audio experience I also found the
exon 7 battery life to be about 15
percent better in a Geekbench battery
life test and about 25 percent better in
daily use likely thanks to better power
management in ZTE
software the sizes are three thousand
two hundred fifty milliamp hours for the
axon seven and three thousand milliamp
hours for the one plus three you can
expect about five hours of screen on
time with the axon and about four with
the oneplus for fast charging each
company has taken a different approach
the exon 7 has Qualcomm quick charge 3.0
for a 50% charge in 30 minutes while the
1 plus 3 has - charging for a 60% charge
in 30 minutes which despite the
difference in percentages is about the
same amount of usage time I do like how
- charging keeps the heat in the charger
rather than the phone but I personally
prefer quick charge 3.0 for tube acuity
and compatibility with more than just
designated oneplus cables the one plus 3
is camera is 16 megapixels with an app
2.0 aperture and the xn7 is 20
megapixels with an F 1.8 aperture both
cameras have oh is and PB AF in good
lighting I slightly prefer the xn sevens
images more and here's why
well the oneplus three offers more
accurate color reproduction it seems to
prefer a cooler color tone compared to
the exon sevens warmer tone which is
something that I personally think looks
more natural
despite the exon 7 sometimes unnatural
looking color reproduction the colors
are more saturated with the axon 7 -
which can make certain parts of an image
pop with that said both cameras lack
vividness in some shots and I notice
that the oneplus 3 like to bring up the
shadows which sometimes led to flat
looking images for low-light images
neither did well at all unfortunately
both cameras produce soft and noisy
images with subpar color reproduction
although I will say that the 1 plus 3
doesn't much better job at distributing
light across the image allowing for
oftentimes sharper and more detailed
shots it doesn't go crazy with noise
reduction like the
son seven does either so images don't
look as bad as they do with the axon
seven in low-light environments both
phones support 4k video recording but
it's sort of a toss-up as to which image
is better
many of the things I noticed when
looking at daytime images are also
visible here if you look closely the
exon 7 does appear to have more
artifacts but it's less noisy than the
oneplus Three's image Ã³as seems a bit
wonky on the 1 plus 3 as well and there
is some minor corner warping here and
there generally speaking the exon 7
seems to do better in good lighting and
during video while the oneplus three
offers slightly less disappointing
low-light images the Exxon 7s camera app
offers a bit more in pure functionality
but outside of those features the
experience is mostly the same each app
is easy to use while still offering
comprehensive manual modes for software
both include android 6.0.1 marshmallow
but the oneplus 3 includes oxygen OS
3.22 on top of android well the x m7
includes me favor UI 4.0 whereas oneplus
conforms fairly closely the stock
Android while still adding a few useful
features and settings ZTE takes a more
interventionist approach with a good
number of UI tweaks and unique features
there's nothing really wrong with that
on its own but it's worth mentioning
that oxygen OS does feel more polish
while some of ZTE s additions are clever
there are still some fairly rough edges
for example you have to press the
notification bell on the lockscreen
every time you want to see your
notifications and unlike stock Android
there's no option to change this if
you're interested in things like custom
roms the 1+3 will likely be a better
match thanks to its better developer
support mostly due to its unlocked
bootloader the X on sevens bootloader is
locked out of the box and currently
cannot be unlocked so it's difficult to
say whether we'll ever see that sort of
variety come to the axon 7 you can
purchase either phone unlocked
neither grey or gold for $400 the xn7 is
available from various retailers
well the oneplus 3 can be purchased from
the oneplus website do keep in mind that
ZTE offers much better after sale
support with its premium two-year
warranty exxon passport 2.0 although
oneplus offers a standard one-year
warranty their customer support has been
notoriously lousy so you'd likely have a
better experience with ZTE if you ever
need help
both the oneplus 3 and ZTE axon 7
deliver excellent smartphone experiences
at very affordable prices
to be clear you'll be very happy with
either option you go with however if
you'd like an alert slider 6 gigabytes
of RAM better camera for low-light and a
more polished software experience you
should take a closer look at the oneplus
3 on the other hand if you'd rather have
a higher resolution display support for
all major US carriers microSD card
expansion a killer audio setup better
battery life and a two-year premium
warranty you can't go wrong with the
axon 7 thank you so much for watching
