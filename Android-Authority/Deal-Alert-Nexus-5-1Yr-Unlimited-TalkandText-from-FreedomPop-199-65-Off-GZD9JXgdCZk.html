Hindy from android authority and in this
quick video we're gonna talk about a
pretty decent deal going on right now so
over in the android authority deals
store freedompop is offering up a white
carrier unlock 16 gigabyte Nexus 5 with
a year of unlimited talk and text for a
hundred and ninety-nine dollars this is
a fantastic price for a new Nexus 5
anyway but the added benefit of a year
of free service really makes it stand
out here are the specifics of the deal
you'll get the 16 gigabyte Nexus 5 that
is white in color with unlimited talk
and text over freedompop's service
you'll also get 500 megabytes of data
over 3g and 4g connections it's not
unlimited so don't go over but it should
be enough for people who don't use much
data or who are around Wi-Fi connections
fairly often along with that you'll get
a year of voicemail service tethering
and usage alerts which generally costs a
little bit extra on freedompop service
overall it's a pretty good deal
obviously people who have newer
flagships and her already on carriers
may not need it so much but if you or
someone you know is looking for
something on the cheap this is a great
way to get connected and you can always
take the unlocked Nexus 5 with you if
you switch carriers at the end of your
free year I know we don't do these kinds
of videos very often but I thought you
guys would like it it's one of the few
ways left to get a brand new Nexus 5 and
one of the only ways to get free cell
service period if you're interested
we'll have the link in the video
description below if you haven't already

authority on youtube and follow us on
social media as always thanks for
watching everybody and have a wonderful
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
