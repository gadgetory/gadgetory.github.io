know what your best Android smartphone
options are well I'm your huckleberry
and first up no surprise number one
option have got to be the Samsung Galaxy
s8 or si plus for this year's flagship
Samsung included a curved screen on both
the s8 n f8 plus as well as a unique
1859 aspect ratio that allows for a more
comfortable in hand feel the company
even ditched its famous physical home
button and included on-screen navigation
under the hood these devices come with
the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor or
Exynos 88-90 5 depending on the region
you live in 4 gigabytes of RAM 64
gigabytes of on-board storage and one of
the latest versions of android 7.0
nougat samsung also launched a few extra
accessories alongside the s8 that you
might want to consider the new Samsung
Dex doc lets you use your s8 as a
desktop computer and there's also a new
gear 360 camera that allows for shooting
video and 4k and live-streaming to
YouTube of course there's also the new
Galaxy S a compatible gear VR headset
complete with a controller for easier
navigation for many the Samsung Galaxy
series sets the bar for Android so if
you have the budget consider those two
devices and next up is the LG g 6
certainly the most standout feature of
the G 6 is its 5.7 inch quad HD display
with this interesting aspect ratio of 18
9 and rounded corners it also comes with
a Snapdragon 820 1 processor 4 gigabytes
of RAM plenty of on-board storage and
ip68 rating for dust and water
resistance and dual 13 megapixel rear
cameras it's worth noting that not all G
sixes are created equal
for example the g6 that's coming to the
u.s. is the only variant that supports
wireless charging while the hi-fi quad
DAC is exclusive to South Korea and
certain markets in Asia once more the g6
with 64 gigabytes of storage is only
available in a handful of markets
personally I haven't met anyone who has
the g6 who doesn't love it the g6 is it
great geeks
and while we're talking about geeks
favorites we got to talk about the LGV
20 the V 20 is basically the phone for
power users it has a big quad HD display
Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor plenty
of RAM and onboard storage dual 16
megapixel rear facing cameras and a
removable 3200 million power battery of
course the unique second screen makes a
return this year along with the addition
of quad DAC military standard durability
and it's already running Android 7.0
nougat personally if I wanted a big
phone I would go for the V 20 sweet that
last up we've got to leave room for the
pixel and pixel XL now not only are
these the first phones to ship with
Google assistant on board they also come
with plenty of exclusive software
features and some of the best smartphone
cameras in existence under the hood they
support some killer specs too both
devices have AMOLED displays a
Snapdragon 820 1 processor 4 gigabytes
of RAM plenty of on-board storage and
long lasting batteries the overall
design of these phones may not be the
most unique but they do feel premium
through and through now there are a few
things about these phones that some will
not like at all for starters they only
support an IP 53 rating for dust and
water resistance meaning they're not
nearly as waterproof as the galaxy s7 or
s7 edge plus these phones don't have the
most durable build ever so you may want
to buy a case if you're prone to
dropping your phone now personally I
think that the regular sized pixel is
really the way to go until such time the
new generation of pixels come out so if
you're a t-mobile user what would be at
the top of your list let me know in the
comments below meet Jeremy shoemaker
otherwise known as shoe money and he
became famous for this photo where he
showed off a cheque that he made from
Google Adsense and he's become so good
at making online businesses that he made
an announcement that he does not start a
new business unless he can secure the
businesses name in a.com now why is that
exactly
well no domain name extension tells your
story with the same degree of trust as a
dot-com or dotnet domain
I'm calm and dotnet domain name
extensions and jet credibility and your
online presence and who doesn't want to
be credible and don't forget you get 15%
