is red curtains with this yellow PL who
got the idea of painting a house yellow
man on the inside yellow is a great
color it's a color of my cards me hungry
mints the color half of my job to notice
that I'm always eating because I'm here
hasn't not because I'm a glut more than
you really need to explain to us why the
color yellow makes you want to eat I
don't know it's science did McDonald
does it wait I believe it goes that
shit's bananas let's just been a
b-a-n-a-n-a-s yeah well thank you guys
for watching the YouTube version and we
in the reason why I'm bringing up the
background is because it's not the best
it's not what I would be picking
obviously but it is officially 1245 a.m.
where's your gears to I left over there
alright so a lot of devices came in like
okay so a lot of devices that we have at
the company we tend to pull them all
together because you know when we don't
need them anymore we either sell them
out or we sell them to ourselves the
moment this guy saw the gear s2 was like
that's mine yeah it's gorgeous he opened
it up he put it on and then never took
it off again until right now yeah it's
charging right now but yeah garrus to to
this guy and then a bunch of devices
like going in and out of place otro to
no pro number 12 no I said to us in as
well o the oprah i am no pro pro two hey
it's amazing yeah you guys in serious in
the review you guys didn't see that
announcement at the at the press
conference the initiation without doing
our jobs no pro two is what they've
attached to the fridge so that's it so
you didn't realize that that was what
they were happy because I mean the
Chromebook 3 is alright nevermind yeah
well yeah it's a sort of really really
long day I mean there's there's been a
lot of stuff going on it's the first
official day of CES and we've been
kicking it at our booth which has been
awesome amazing right okay described
described for our podcast listeners oh
by the way I understand that one
I say that there's a youtube version of
the podcast half of you are going to hit
stop on soundcloud and on your podcast
things and go straight to the video but
let me tell you right now before you do
that there's not a whole lot to look at
this time spoiler alert the curtains on
the Left do not match the curtains on
the right yeah exactly oh my god they
don't yeah it's all it's awesome and
awful at the same time honestly but you
know what this has been a great house
for like 12 people 12 it's a very
diverse crowd yes very diverse crowd as
you can see here curtains speaking of
our crowds I have okay to rectify a
wrong to right or wrong that happened
yesterday on what was a the only word I
can use as a raucous podcast we had a
lot of fun on that podcast and hopefully
you guys really enjoyed it but I didn't
want to right or wrong when we had Edgar
on there and then when Adam Dowd and
Stephen Schneck came by from from pocket
now Edgar left I went to get drinks he
did go to the UN I got stuck at the city
booth oh okay which is which is fine you
know the reasons were perfectly fine but
I still felt like yeah it was supposed
to be a well I'm here now yes exactly
you're here for our second of what looks
to be maybe four episodes I mean
obviously that's how long CES is our
second of four episodes that we're doing
for the entirety of CES I should another
think if it's five because we did to
tell you the first day well officially
of the show the convention yeah so who
knows who knows what's going to happen
on the actual final day of CES if we're
actually going to do a podcast at that
point you know you never know but I
wanted to make sure that we did a
podcast a day it was just something that
I wanted to be ambitious about so
hopefully you guys are enjoying it this
is number two and then we have a
returning host from yesterday you
weren't able to join in yesterday was I
in know you were enough I to play the
invited car come on they do that this
has happened more than once already over
the last day no you were totally invited
it's just I don't know I i put a shout
out that everybody would be able to like
come on whenever they wanted to and for
the most part that's kind of what
happened I mean Adam doubt even left to
go see a vendor then came back and gave
us the rundown on what it was but
Jonathan fights or as we know him feisty
on the podcast but now I want everyone
to call him Johnny Feist yeah the
smoothest pipes in android authority
there you go guys if you haven't seen my
video on tap x that's what this guy
looks like and this is what he sounds
like if you don't know already actually
yeah this should be a better mic than
the one I normally use so I think the
one you have a joy I've seen the one you
have it's in the Yeti but no no actually
I use the zoom you just resumed a trance
I could have sworn I saw you on our like
on our hangouts call before we came here
and it was like a Yeti you hear me in
our internal call on on the snowball Oh
snowballs but I actually record on yeah
okay well that works out alright so we
have the two that the two of you here
alright so what I wanted to do and
unfortunately I wasn't able to get a
wrap on this one for the deferred for
this one because there one particular
reason is because um yeah this is first
CES he's been to plenty of trade shows
before but this is his first AES and I
really and he was able to talk about
that yesterday so but I'm gonna go more
in depth with this because first of all
Edgard you have been to plenty of shows
already right okay how many have you
been to are you see yes yes although
actually all together let's sail
together man yeah I don't know this is
my 50s fitting yeah it's mr. 6 yeah okay
that's more than I thought I thought it
was like three or something like that
okay I've been here plenty of time so if
that you're fit CES then that means that
you've been to mwc to Eva and all that
stuff so you a very seasoned trade
shipping around person right into and uh
and around and the thing is you know now
he's here with us here at Android
Authority obvious and he's wrapping it
look at this and let me just say it for
shows i tailed this guy yesterday and
everywhere we went they were like hey
it's edgert get in here yeah you guys
close sorry everybody Oh Edgar come on
yeah well I'm good at networking well
you didn't see that one no I was
impressed people wait but then the
networking gets even better yeah of
course yeah well you they love you more
if you guys didn't already see
at the the second vlog that I put out
for our time here at CES there's a great
clip of you with your arm around Jaime
Rivera and he doesn't know it's you yet
and then he looks over at you gives you
the biggest hug it's the best clip is
that that babe that pretty much ends the
vlog right there which is really awesome
just a little love around here yeah for
sure that's the best part of anything so
like what what fits es what does it look
like now to you um things have certainly
changed it was the first time I came
over it was a android was barely growing
and really you know the boom of Android
pretty much there were phones they were
tablets there was like everything and
things have slowed down you know
manufacturers now have their own little
events that they hold you know out in
Hong Kong and stuff so they don't
announce much anymore it is I'm sorry
that that happened oh yeah that's that
that looked like it takes it really good
we bought some tacos el gordo before we
came on to the podcast I just have some
fries on the side please keep going yes
so yeah it's in the morning it's it's
changed a lot and I think it's it's part
of the evolution of a mobile not only
android yeah but things are merging
there's a lot of other products there's
you know BR there's smoke there's drones
there's a vehicle's you know all kinds
of smart purpose of fridges you know
drones that's probably there's a flying
car yeah oh yeah flying car man oh yeah
sorry oh sorry yeah we had that veteran
talk about it now I want to hear from
Johnny Feist over here there was a
flying car and use the only one who's
like yeah that is almost true yet
seriously there's a flying car it's can
you test it I don't think so but they
say show someone you open it it's in the
drone section which is huge by the way
so many drones in there this year I say
that like a scene CS before but and it
was a timeless true it's true but yeah
there's this single seater little
vehicle and and it's a quadcopter and
say it it appears as though it would fly
appears as though it appeared and now
they have a video in the background and
it all the mechanics are there now of
course I've got a mechanical background
I'm not saying I'm any good at it but I
looking at it it's got the gearing it's
got the motors there's no reason it
can't fly well this is gonna be like the
Lexus hoverboard though we're like like
oh look it's a hoverboard and then and
then you realize you have to literally
risa meant your entire area just a habit
with the magnets under the ground this
is well no no this is totally just a
quadcopter it's just a big I just have
no idea how that any of those things are
gonna be able to lift me and 220 pounds
I mean I like you can do it trust ya and
now mounted for the tap x fan mounted on
the dashboard is a surface pro 3 just
saying that's kind of cool but if you
can lift that I'm sure can alright so to
answer your question okay then nobody's
gonna be redoing their driveways or
anything to make this happen seriously
at the end result in my opinion is gonna
be like bumper cars this isn't going
anywhere the FAA is not gonna let us
have cars on them that's why okay yeah
and well I hope that bumper car park
seriously i mean the the whole theory of
it is that is that like it has a big
military purpose right education yeah
they want to be able to go through rough
terrain and like you know no that makes
perfect sense but they have it equipped
right now now we've seen also at CES and
some of the other events there's been
you're a fan of these correct me i
cannot remember the names of them but
hey they're like little motorcycle type
vehicles three-wheel kind of deals and
some of them are two seaters most over
one seater just a little dome with the
kind of a steering wheel and off you go
so you know you need your motorcycle
license Edgar's gonna tell us more about
it later because I believe he's gone for
a test drive and I will go for a couple
of tooth rights I love I the networking
has been amazing here because not only
are you talking about the flying car
you're about to test out what some space
age a TV i guess like yeah it's the
three wheel motorcycle car hybrid I got
a are they have old so let's imagine the
motorcycle that's much bigger and has
two wheels on the front instead of a one
so it's a stable you know when if you're
if you're a writer you'll know that like
it's very easy to slide in the rain and
stuff and this kind of solves that and
if it rains that they sell discovers
that you know you put around it and
you're pretty much enclosed in this
little car okay and it's pretty dope all
right so take that thing remove the
wheels and put for blaze out on and on
the four corners nothing now here's the
biggest problem with this thing a lot of
the quadcopter designs have the blades
up high and helicopter same kind of
thing is big enough the blades are up
high this thing you run into it too
close it's taking out your kneecaps and
if it's got divorced to lift the car in
the air this thing is totally doing it
off but there is a freaking flying car
at the show guys yeah and yeah and you
have to use it because your legs are
gone like I think that case I think
that's the takeaway we're really talking
about her but you know what you can
already see it the the the eyes of
wonderment that to be fair Edgar still
has you know and when you heard about a
flying car thought about a super excited
about it but now we live exactly we're
now we have Johnny Feist over here who's
talking about you know talking about it
with all of this passion and everything
and I just feel like for those of us who
have been here at least a few years yeah
it's hard to have that kind of
enthusiasm now and granted we're talking
about android android authority of
course and stuff like that there's not a
whole lot going on in the world of
android at CES that is you know we hear
a lot of stuff that's coming down the
pipe you know so you know but it's very
interesting because a lot of these
things that are so innovative or you
know special different because those are
the things that color attention right
because we used to seeing all this one
so yeah quad-core process or whatever
yeah 45 gives around put 10 I don't care
you know like it's all the same you know
they're all fast but when you see these
things they're so different like you
know when I first saw that Yoda phone
for example like that was my favorite of
the show I mobile congress back in two
years ago I think and but at the end
that they don't really succeed you know
a lot of this project system take off
yeah if creativity is not backed by it
as much money as freaking possible yeah
and you know that might be the reason
why but even then there are a few things
to be really excited about but the worst
part about the CES this year is that all
the things that we really
we can't talk about and we're not gonna
talk about it obviously but I'm just
telling you I'm just telling you guys
that trust me there's some amazing stuff
in the world of mobile you're gonna have
to wait for it that's all I'm saying
graphic designers very tiny hint yeah we
are not breaking we're not breaking any
NDA's by telling you that but yeah so
how such a doofus who has not only first
trade show now at CES your first trade
show hopefully hopefully not your last
how's it other than the flying car how
does it really been for you there's
nothing else no I'm kidding it's been
awesome you know I'm 50 people out some
people came for nothing yeah just for
nothing just a gliding car they all just
came to get sick that's pretty much what
it was they came to see the android
authority booth yes that's part of yeah
yeah and we already have a lot of it
well not a lot but we have like
interviews there and they're
substantially interviews Israel which is
why i use the word a lot because that's
the first thing that comes to mind but
yeah we've already done a lot of stuff
at the booth it is great to have a home
base at CES or any trade show for that
matter so it's making a world of
difference I've been to trade shows
before obviously not mobile ones but
having this caliber of booth is has been
great I mean there's a lot of us here
we've got I almost want to say the
majority of our team is here and we all
fit and and we work well together and
that's you know getting to meet each and
every one of you this is amongst all of
the first you know we talk which had we
communicate every day but we get some
actual face time and that's pretty cool
but the show itself I mean I'm not gonna
lie I've been dreaming of CES for the
last many years okay many many years so
that mean i mean i followed the news
before I my watch you know the footage I
had an idea what I was getting myself
into but to be honest it's huge I had no
idea was gonna cover like half of Las
Vegas just to see all of the events and
contain yeah Oliver media it's it's a
monster what would we consider something
worse like Eva would even be like
considered bigger it's bigger in terms
of what the
announcements but I feel like in terms
of crown you know like how much stuff
there is and how much you have to walk
to get to anywhere or you know sometimes
go out of the convention center in a cab
or whatever I think Vegas is definitely
the biggest yeah because all of the
manufacturers or a lot of companies end
up doing stuff in hotels one of my
favorite examples would be lenovo
whoo-hoo go to the hotel that's right
next to the convention center the
Renaissance and they have this entire
setup they literally take up the entire
top floor just to show off their booth
and that is their booth you know we saw
some cool stuff there lil an oval link I
thought the link was really cool I
layers really though yeah the thing is
this really cool but like is there a lot
of usage out of that ultimately let me
speak to the event again here it is so
big that I haven't seen what you're
talking about that because I was else
we're dealing with other companies yeah
oh well fair enough so basically what
we're talking about here is a little
it's a it looks like a USB thumb drive
okay and then one side just sort of like
slides down and reveals the USB port
that got no USB plug that goes into the
port on your computer the other side has
a port for your USB cord that goes into
your Android phone now android phone
five-point own above and pretty much any
piece you can do this as long as you can
download the link application onto both
devices and then literally what's going
on on your phone becomes a window or
full screen on your computer I mean I'm
sold yeah it's do it pretty much mirrors
that yeah there is your phone up to your
screen now we know that we've seen a lot
of iterations this before Samsung
sidesync for example and I don't want us
a continuum Continuum's not the right
one but but you said Samsung side saying
for sure so it's been done before it
could be done wirelessly I suppose if
you get the right applications and root
your device blah blah blah this is a
forty-dollar little thing that does it
all and does it kind of seamlessly yeah
and I think that's a big benefit of
having an actual cable because I've
tried to think through Wi-Fi and
whatever you know other sort of other
methods and it's nice there's always lag
and there's always all these issues that
you run into and yeah this thing we
seamlessly myself and we tried it so
Johnny Five shirt in right you're in so
so so were or are so are we but a couple
of our commenters you know like I give I
give our commenters a lot credit on that
video they were like this is really cool
but what would you use it for it and I'm
still struggling to find out something
that you have to be really lazy like me
you know like I had their only reason
why I like wearables you know smart
watches ones because like I well I guess
this line of work kind of messes with us
because we got like at least a hundred
emails a day so like when I didn't have
a wearable I was just like checking my
phone all day pulling it out for no
reasons and spam PR thing that I don't
know an iphone case or some stupid thing
and then uh so it's kind of like that
you know when you want to do something
and you're on your computer and you're
working and you want to do something
like I don't know send your friend a
text or you know you got an email you
got a notification and you don't want
that like really grab the phone all the
time okay and I hate I hate to be the
devil's advocate for a video that i
gushed over when his product but its
true like you know once the once the
trade show sort of like hi let's say
kind of wears off letting you realize
you know I loved in that was great it's
great that I loved it but now I'm
realizing you know do I really love it
like that's kind of the thing because if
you can use you if you could virtualize
your android phone to your desktop
that's awesome maybe play a mobile game
that isn't otherwise available on PC or
something like that but you're going to
like answer a text or answer an email i
just opened the browser right right yeah
that is one thing is go ahead Johnny but
yeah that's gonna say for a lot of
employees and offices or students that
are not allowed to pick up their phones
if it's connected your I'm not condoning
using your phone through your computer
while you're in school but hey it'll
work yeah that is that is one
application didn't think oh that's true
cheating or not cheating well it is
cheating like you are using your phone
yeah yeah yeahs in class and i wanna
thinking of breaking rules and you know
cheating on tests or anything i'm just
thinking of I've never
ever played video games during any of my
college classes never never it was Ken
doll counter-strike Scotty counter
strike counter in was counter yeah there
you go that requires a lot we never ever
as a group had land counter parties
during any of the super fast network at
whatever college she went to yeah yeah
we didn't do that too often in class
well what we did used to get when i was
in college was a cease and desist
notices for bittorrent in oh oh oh man
that was so bad and then they finally
found a way to block one tyrants I
downloaded the skeleton key the movie it
was horrible Jorge hated it and I got it
I got a letter like a week later like
all you broke the law and whatnot and I
had to go through all this ass why would
you even the next week they had it on
the cable TV that they are like offered
in college I was so pissed why the
skeleton key I was just I was
downloading a lot of stuff a lot of
movies man so I was just like that's the
one I got caught yeah that's the one
that I want yeah The Hurt Locker
shameful shallows gunky I was young and
stupid and I didn't work creating
content so I didn't value it as much
like well it was it was nice knowing you
Edgar and I think the was at the mpaa
then I got they're sending over a cop
car right now oh man they're gonna get
half of their money just from suing you
know so I want to bring it back to this
device so do you think it is the price
tag that's done wrong you said it was
forty dollars count now I'm looking at a
lot of my devices I love that I'm
willing to spend ten maybe fifteen
dollars to hook my current Nexus device
to an external monitor but you know like
but if it was 40 there's no way i'd buy
that cable really when I won't you
thought you already have the cable just
issued by the dongle yeah yes will you
get it yeah I got you ready have again
it's like cable like what you won the
cable did you already have a cable why
would you pay for yeah exactly well of
course i wouldn't pay forty dollars for
cable already have you know
as a Joe Hindy some time he's always
having to connect his device to his
computer so that he can do his
recordings for his shows this could be a
way it could be away and but you know
he's struggling to find newer better
phones and you know upgrading his
devices that can still let him do his
work and this was totally bypasses I
mean all of the new phones I correct me
if I'm wrong the new necklace phones no
longer have external monitor support oh
I I heard something about this but I
can't confirm it myself I've had you're
having a 6p I can't come from that for
myself yet which if you watch the vlog
we are all going to be able to confirm
that sick yeah very soon they got from
Huawei sort of guy oh okay so um kind of
inside baseball here when it comes to
the industry we do we did show it and
I'm sure everyone is talking about it
you know if you go on any other you'd
like tech YouTube site yeah you go to
huawei during certain events and if they
did announce a phone you are going to
get it you know and that was most of the
time most of the time which is awesome
and it gives not only the art it makes
the guesswork and all of the work to get
a review unit like null and void and it
also makes everybody happy the I've
heard this term so much ever since the
huawei van de roi is amazing the return
on investment and yeah it's it's i mean
i have i think i have mine over here
like so they uh they were announced the
huawei they wanted to use to send
anymore right they huawei mate and also
a gold nexus p which right there if you
haven't been reading the news there's a
new gold lexus like totally though the
outside of japan revolutionary yes now
that the gold nexus p is available the
nexus p is back in the news yeah but
yeah here's the here's the mate 8 and i
have to say as we were already fans you
know andrew grush can attest to us we
talked about on the pockets a lot he
loves him 87 he loved done mate 7 i
should say nope sorry he did but oh you
i had this in hand for about five
minutes oh yeah I gave you traded it in
cuz we recently mostly the software does
but you can put like a Google now
launcher on it mostly the software x
it's the rest of it honestly it's the
back end the settings menu is ok I
that's traditional taste totally
personal taste is nothing wrong there's
0 and coming from the guy who use used
media pads though like you got to be
used to it by now used to it yes but
that doesn't mean unlike so I mean that
was the easiest thing is that I booted
up the phone i was able to see that it's
essentially the same software is the
MediaPad and i know that's not what I
wanted especially for a daily driver ok
I can handle it on the tablet because
you know it's just a different use case
but not my daily driver yeah well ok so
back to Edgar here like you took out
your gold Nexus 6p you know thank God
that every ok you could there are two
lines after the event everyone had you
know whatever whatever the procedure was
to like claim something and it was
pretty much all the media that and that
was able to get this um gold Nexus 6p
all the Nexus 6p is recalled what made
you pick tonight the 6p over the made
eight um it was mostly software come on
it was mostly software I mean that the
thing is the the Nexus 6p is just more
it's made for the American consumer
right we like our stock Android we like
her you know the build quality is
different and just everything about it
is different it's something we just were
used to and a chance and gently you're
gonna break that back class it'll be
fine ok um we no one we know has done
that yet right no broken oh yeah just
the yeah um yeah the top pump no one and
i know i will get you know timely
updates and all that so it's a big deal
I think there's a tiny bit of
interference coming from the phones but
yeah the okay so also there's a
difference in the processor there's a
difference in the screen there's a
different that's a few differences yeah
there are a few differences you know but
the Kirin 950 yeah it's a great
processor I haven't been able to slow
down the mate eight of them be it yet I
said a 72 processor or chips in there
isn't it I think that's what I'm yeah
sure I saw I've got the pictures right
here but I can't remember yeah that's
why you pull out your computer yeah yeah
there we were joking about that before
the show having the
computer here supposed to make me look
smarter when the time come right back
like don't get me wrong I did the 6p is
a spectacular phone I I actually was
giving lon who's over there editing
videos right now um I usually gave long
a little bit grief because I sent him my
Nexus 6p in order to do a second opinion
video after I did my review and then I
was like alright cool so just remember
send it back to me because all my
pictures are on there and all my stuff
is on there still and he goes now I'm
gonna hold on to it forbid i think i saw
those pictures on Instagram isn't that
what he did well yeah the we all came
here for the show obviously and then
there was this box with foot 6 me on it
i guess i'm so happy and then the may
eight came and now i haven't even
touched a 6p everything well you know
like I was kind of in the fence between
both alone and the main reason why was
considering that the may date was the
battery that's a four thousand million
power battery and while microSD card
also and microSD card my Christian now
this is the exact same size and type of
battery as the MediaPad x2 and i get 10
hours screen on time with that this is a
smaller screen so theoretically yes
saving them yeah there aren't that many
phones out there word you look at the
battery and you look at the battery
percentage rather up in the notification
area you see 49-percent you're like yeah
I'm good yeah no doubt i'm good until
tomorrow night and all right i got the
specs here for anybody interested so
we're gonna octa-core processor that's
for a 72 chips and for a 50 threes gpo
is mal ET 880 it somalia the molly
little boys are find out the model is up
yeah yeah they're good but yeah i i'm
really happy with it you know and I have
to admit you know obviously I picked
them a day because i read have a6p but
i'm very happy with my investment my
free investment would you have made
another choice if you didn't have a6p
that's a really good question like if i
had if I had given up if lon like left
it at home you know and just never
brought it land yeah probably i would
have gone for the 6p but now that it but
but okay here's where i'm going to come
in on this i'm not convinced by this
gold color everyone got gold some people
love it some people hate it i'm so in
the middle that I
don't want it well everyone got gold
because it was the only option well yeah
of course I like the pic there and so I
don't know like knowing that it would
have been a gold edition I think that is
what would have made me still stick with
the may date I think the minute it's
also gold no no yeah now also there were
space grey ones i know people a lot
people don't like that one but i would
have liked that too yeah just this goal
just doesn't really do it for me not
like okay so sneak peek sneak peek
alright I am going to be doing a video
and I'm going to put this out there so
all of our listeners and viewers can go
ahead and start hating me right now but
while I was on my sabbatical while I was
on break for an entire month I decided
just for just for the sake of
experimentation way where's your mute
button just want you to say this why not
say that no please please could I did
decide that for the entire month now
there are multiple reasons why I did
this but the main reason is because I
wanted to you know up until now we've
done comparisons to it and we've done
we've done some coverage but I really
wanted to finally get to know the other
side see if the grass was greener and I
used and I used an iphone 6 plus the
entire time I was off now I'll let
myself out see you later buddy we'll see
I wasn't worried about you using an
iphone it's just you're using the pink
iphone see that's the other this rose
gold iPhone right here now i will look
vehicle yeah rose gold yeah pink wait
what yeah no doubt what you didn't see
did off screen here he was just taking
his case off of it I did cover it up I
covered up the hell out of it and the
the cover that I was using was the was
the one plus cover that they sent us so
i was still reppin android to an extent
that's funny I didn't realize yeah look
inside it says okay get a grip good um
but yeah I so covered it up not because
I was she I was ashamed of the rose gold
actually it grew on me this rose gold
like it actually kind of grew on me
actually kind of liked it because it was
for the most part different now when you
compare gold and rose gold like that's a
huger different that's a much different
and i'm kind of i'm just not entirely
too sure if I was really out did what
someone come back out
anna ravanar so I I don't know the rose
gold of the iphone actually kind of grew
on me but I will admit I covered it up
because when I went to New York for a
week during my during my break I knew
that you know some people might be
around people i knew that yeah i knew
that i might end up seeing some people
and you know what I went to a bar with a
couple of my friends from like way back
in the day and they know what I do for a
living and they know that you know this
is kind of a thing so when they saw me
bust this thing out and use the
fingerprint reader which does work
really well I my friend she god bless
her she threatened to tweet a picture of
me using an iphone and she said your
career will be ruined and here you go
admitting it free i'll admit it you know
why because like i said sneak peek
sometime after CES is done i will do a
video sort of explaining or rather just
giving like my thoughts on now that I've
given it a real like the old college try
I will be able to give you some real
concrete reasons why I am so happy to be
back on in Troy I'm so happy but yeah
that does sorry tangent there but the
main thing is the gold on here you like
it yeah yes that's it summary sarcasto
aggression I were joking about this
earlier i have not opened my 6p yet
we've got an internal debate going on
whether or not i'm gonna order a case
from amazon you know and a case to cover
it before I open it or not come on like
a skin you know just something so i
don't like big honking cases anybody
justice quickest a bunny in there just
get justjust yeah yeah yeahs tape we
have gaff tape on that work we have so
many supplies at the Riggin boo that's
just amazing but yeah that does the only
thing and I think as far as phones go
the mate will probably take the cake and
you know what good on Molly and I think
they thanked God for them that they made
CES actually fun for us and Android
people here you know it was good no I
will say just quick because you brought
up the iphone yeah the mate 8 says here
charges 105 percent faster I believe it
there is no fast charging an iphone at
whatsoever nine volt two amp rap
charge they're saying in 30 minutes of
charging you got one day of usage that's
done yeah that's pretty dope I believe
in you know see that's the thing and I
mean you know what you know that that's
against Nick peak that's one of my
biggest gripes with the iPhone because
we all have we all have those friends
that are walking around at the at the
party like who's got an iphone charger
who's gonna realize it's annoying and I
was one of those people so yeah that's
the thing but yeah good on huawei great
showing out here at CES we can't wait
for what's going to come down the pipe
that said the other manufacturers that
did come out with some Android
iterations you know like we give them
their due and they all have coverage on
an authority com now there are booths I
want to end on our booth you know
because I didn't want this to become a
hour-long podcast like it was yesterday
because it's just the three of us you
know so for the last let's say five
minutes I want to talk about our booth
because I think it's a totally I mean
we're so happy about it I want to back
up though ZTE came out in a big way I
mean maybe their phones are not you know
the flagship devices that are gonna hit
the big stores but they're hidden and I
mean their devices are seriously great
for them I think they that's you know
they've been wonderful yeah they are
doing wonderfully and you know what the
statistics that they share obviously
every company can share statistics and
they want but the traditions that they
are the statistics that they share all
sound pretty great and if ZTE is not
something that's on your radar then you
know just we should definitely be it son
crushes radar because one of the phones
is going to cricket yeah exactly but
yeah so for the last few minutes here
yeah yes oh wow see there crush that's
that is why we say that okay so yeah for
like one of the episodes he just said
cricket like eight like six times in one
sentence you know is again like I say I
love LG and stuff in LG yeah and as and
you know what that's uh not too much
from LG that we're seeing here but I I
will say I will say that you know I
don't know what it is that they never
said they never said anything but you
know one of our buddies from LG did tell
us that to you know nothing here but
look forward to this year that date well
CES has never really correct me if I'm
wrong
never really a big mobile device
launched yeah it's not the event hasn't
been worse on here now was yeah it used
to be huge for I remember when I wasn't
really into CS anymore when they stopped
doing video game announcements yeah yeah
I was always looking for it to cs4 video
game announcements but not anymore then
the party slowed down not cool alright
so again last few minutes let's let's
talk about this booth alright so one
thing that one thing that I'm
technically obligated to say right now
is you guys who are going to CES on the
final day from the general public and
even all of you who are in it now as
fans who are who happen to be exhibitors
and vendors and stuff like that come by
you guys can totally come by we actually
have a lot of stuff planned for the
final day of CES so that all of you guys
can really partake in what has been a
pretty great experience for us to have
you know just the space you know and you
get to you get to kick it with us you
know it's been absolutely humbling the
people you folks that have stopped by
thank you so much I mean seriously did
totally humbling you you just okay we
kept I you see I got it he got totally
distracted he was trying so hard not to
get detective what had happened I'm
gonna use that excuse for losing my
train of thought anyways but no
seriously I mean we had I'm afraid I
can't remember his name Josh may but we
had a younger gentleman show up at the
booth today here a huge fan Omid and we
had a you know this wonderful
opportunity where we could take a group
photo with him and the look on his face
he was we made his day I believe we made
his day and it is so humbling if you
guys can make it by please do its we
don't use a sieve he's a fan which is
one thing already but I think it's also
a little bit overwhelming to be like oh
it's it's great to meet you guys and
then Here I am with a camera let's take
a photo yeah yeah I think you took like
video and everything I saw you down
there I was like oh yeah he's going
alone and he was so he was yeah you
could tell but yeah that was the end of
the Wade end of the day by the way yeah
during the day we do a little bit of
work to do still yeah you want the news
and we gotta get you some so yeah you
could literally come by and just see
like that like from here up and just us
looking down at
another computer yeah bro praying yeah
definitely oh how are you I I loved it I
loved uh having the base you know like
you said having a home base at the
actual show floor just being able to go
take your business come back and get to
meet some people and the whole it's a
different experience right like it's a
different interaction with the with the
fans different interaction with the
exhibitors and different interaction
just with other journalists the most of
the I got like a bunch of messages all
day and i'd say like sixty percent of
them we're all like i'll stop by the
booth hey are you at the booth hey can I
come over yeah like it's it's great when
loves and exhibitors yeah everyone yeah
everyone we also get a quick shout out
to a couple of a couple of our buddies
who did come by danny winget and Marco
Hannah that came in in the morning and
then mark from TechnoBuffalo he came by
while we were doing an interview he just
came by and shouted at me today and I
was talking to a CEO exactly but yeah
that that's what happens when you give
everyone a central place to be able to
find you yes if they want to find you
now they have already so um good I dare
say our booth is also kind of situated
you can't miss it yeah it's like it's
right there yeah you totally cannot miss
it and that's one of the best parts
about you come into the well let you
know right now it's the it's the
entrance to the south hall once you get
inside and you take a left or you look
left this is green light that just sort
of like burnt their dinner and then
that's our booth right and use in and
I'm not even I'm not even exaggerating
there because there's a huge TV right
word you would come in that shows you
the content we already have green lights
yeah that's big metal I daresay if
you're a fan enough for the show to be
listening watching this it you've
probably seen our social media posts
yeah showing off this booth we love
exactly on us and we love it so much and
we want to we and really we just want to
like we're very humbled by it very very
grateful to be able to have that kind of
space and for everyone that helps you
know just to put it together you know
all right well I want to leave it at
that so if you are going to be at CES in
the final day please come by and yeah
you might end up on a video you might
end up on our
medo you might walk away with no shirt
maybe or more or more you know you never
know so come on by if you want to kick
it with us and if you want to be a part
of what has been so far a hectic busy
but ultimately a very good CS experience
we still have a few more days left so if
we're going to see what happens so keep
it tuned to Andhra 34 even more and
remember we're doing a podcast every
single night that were here at CES and
you guys are so distracting I swear to
God oh we are going to do a podcast
every night and you can not only listen
to it in your podcast applications and
whatnot but you can also watch it on
YouTube which has been really nice to do
a lot more work but you know what i
think it's been worth it if you guys are
enjoying it and you can also keep in
touch with us on all social media let us
know what you want to see and let us
know how we're doing here at CES 2016 as
you watch all of that content on our
youtube channel and also read it up on
android or decom don't forget about our
sister sites of course Johnny Feist over
here is mr. tabtimes over here and you
had a really good time earlier with a
product that will talk about tomorrow a
tablet that made Android a bit more like
Windows that sounds terrible but you're
going to see why I was amazing and then
of course we have sound guys and we have
a lot of sound meetings that are going
to be happening over the next couple of
days but ultimately of course you can
keep it tuned here for even more because
