Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly

started the google play store is having
a cyber weekend sales event in honor of
black friday during this time you can
save a bit of money on stuff including
Dragon Quest and final fantasy games
some music movies books TV shows and
even magazines hurry up and take
advantage before these deals expire
unfortunately we do have some bad news
this week everythingme launcher has shut
down for good the popular and very
well-done launcher was unable to
properly monetize the experience despite
having millions of users and have
decided to shut the doors for good good
news everyone it seems futurama will be
returning as a mobile game based on the
description it appears as though it'll
be a puzzle game with a storyline
written by dave grossman the same guy
who did the wolf among us by Telltale
Games it could be a lot of fun and we'll
tell you more about it when we find out
ourselves in preparation for the force
awakens there will be a new Star Wars VR
application coming to Google cardboard
on December second the application will
let people view some stuff in full VR
that ties directly into the introduction
of the movie this is something that fans
definitely don't want to miss speaking
of Star Wars if you go to google.com /
Star Wars you can join the light side or
the dark side of the force once you do a
select number of Google applications
will do some fun stuff based on your
decisions some of the applications
include chromecast gmail google chrome
google calendar and youtube for even
more android apps and games news don't

splash this week as usual if you want to

we'll have those links for you in the
video description below a new
application has been released called
jiffy the point of jiffy is that it
connects you to services in your
vicinity including snow removal
appliance repair electrical and others
unfortunately it's only available in
Canada so you'll need to be a resident
of the great white north in order to use
it but it looks like a fun service that
can be really useful for Canadians
everywhere here's hoping they have plans
on expanding someday
EA has released a new game called Star
Wars galaxy of Heroes a title they've
been teasing for months now it's an
adventure game with action RPG elements
where you assemble a crew of your
favorite Star Wars characters and then
go into battle it is an EA game which
means there are a ton of in-app
purchases and how bad they are depends
on your opinions on in-app purchases as
a whole in either case it can be a fun
time waster for fans of the series and
you can try it out for free event asking
is an application that allows you to
keep entire Android applications in a
floating button that opens them quickly
this is a great application for heavy
multitasking and for people who want to
get to certain apps very quickly on any
screen it has extra features for
browsers and there is even a route
option in case you want that it's free
to download with an optional three
dollar and ninety-nine cent in-app
purchase for more functionality shooty
Skies is a retro style arcade game when
you take to the skies and shoot bad guys
you fly in a plane to take on all sorts
of various bad guys and it's all wrapped
up in charming minecraft style graphics
there are also boss fights various
pilots that you can unlock loot that you
can collect and a whole lot more it's
free to play with in-app purchases but
the in-app purchases haven't stopped
this game from accumulating a very
impressive 4.6 rating on the Google Play
Store the call of Champions is a new
MOBA and if you've ever played a MOBA
before then you know what you're getting
into you grab yourself a team and then
try to take down all of the bad guys you
can compete online against other people
in matches that last about five minutes
there are 15 playable characters
including a promotion that gives you one
for free when you start playing and the
game seems to work well for most people
