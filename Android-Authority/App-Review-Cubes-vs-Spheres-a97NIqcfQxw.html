Android Authority comm and today we'll
be taking a look at cubes vs. spheres
it's available in the Google Play Store
for just 99 cents the menus in this game
are pretty standard there is a main menu
where you can choose to play either
campaign motor survival mode at the
bottom you'll find a button where you
can view your achievements once you
select a game mode you'll see a list of
all of the available spheres and a level
selection screen just tap one of the
levels to get started the game is easy
to learn and easy to play you select
your sphere and it pops out from the
hole he then shoot it at the blocks this
process is repeated until all the blocks
are gone or until too many blocks have
invaded your space and you lose the game
you can look around by swiping left and
right and the spheres trajectory can be
changed by swiping up at a different
angle
the faster you swipe the further they go
it's like one of those old arcade golf
games with the roller ball except you no
better news fares are unlocked rather
quickly gamers should have all of them
unlocked inside of ten levels if they do
it right
unlocking the stairs only gives you
access to them you must spend additional
points to buy them one at a time to use
in-game the only sphere with unlimited
ammo is the blue one which can be
upgraded to split into multiples it has
almost everything you'd want in a mobile
game achievements ease of use unlockable
items a gradual rise in difficulty even
the sound effects are good and the music
is catching because of this we gave
gameplay a perfect 5 out of 5 stars
when you get right down to it this is a
game you shoot spheres at cubes so the
graphics obviously aren't going to be
groundbreaking the levels themselves the
spheres and the cubes are all
rudimentary shapes and various colors
there is after all only so much you can
do with a cube that said the game still
looks pretty good the graphics are
smooth and there is no pixelation the
levels spheres cubes and menus are all
well designed no ridiculous clutter and
nothing that is offensive to the eyes
all things considered if we gave it a 3
out of 5 stars the replay value for this
game can be narrowed down to a positive
and a negative aspect when beating a
level you get an angry bird style
ranking based on your score so you can
beat a level but only get one star also
like Angry Birds gamers who want to
perfect the game will play the levels
repeatedly until a three star ranking is
achieved
additionally levels will likely need to
be played over and over again to accrue
points to buy more spheres survival mode
also adds some replay value because
gamers can test their skills to see how
well they can do however the negative
part about this is that when the game is
over it's over
once all the levels have been beaten and
survival mode has been played to death
let me time to put this game away and
find something new thankfully cubes vs.
spheres is designed well enough to where
this won't happen for a
time so oh no we gave replayed by you
with three out of five when you look at
cubes and spheres as a whole it's one of
the funnest games in the Google Play
Store early gameplay making me the
impression that it's a slow game and
that it would get boring but when those
blocks start getting closer and there's
a whole lot more of them it can actually
get a little overwhelming and that's
when things get interesting because it
is easy to play people who don't enjoy
games very often can still enjoy it due
to the game getting harder as it
progresses more experienced gamers can
find joy in the challenge when it gets
harder so there aren't many demographics
that won't at least enjoy this as a
casual game to kill a few minutes
because it's fun lengthy gameplay and
addictive nature we found it hard to
come up with reasons why this wouldn't
be worth a dollar which means we don't
have any reasons why it wouldn't be
worth a dollar so we gave cubes versus
spheres an overall rating of 4.5 out of
5 stars once again I'm Joe handy from
