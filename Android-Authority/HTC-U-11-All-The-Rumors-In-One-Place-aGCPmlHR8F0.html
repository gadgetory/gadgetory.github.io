flagship out of the park and I'm talking
about their upcoming HTC u 11 this year
HTC has decided to unveil its new
flagship a little later than usual the
company has already confirmed that it
will take the wraps off the device on
May 16th the reason for this is likely
because of supply shortages for the
snapdragon 835 which is rumored to power
the device samsung apparently had first
dibs on the chipset which is found in
the s8 and si plus now it looks like
qualcomm latest processor is available
in larger quantities as the announcement
of the u 11 is just around the corner
now that we got the release out of the
way let's talk about what's under the
hood according to the latest rumors the
smartphone will offer a 5.5 inch display
with qHD resolution and will pack a 3000
milliamp hour battery as mentioned
previously the HTC u 11 will be powered
by Qualcomm's latest chipset that
Snapdragon 835 the u 11 will reportedly
be available in two variants one with 4
gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of
storage and the other with 6 gigabytes
of RAM and 128 gigabytes of space you'll
be able to expand the storage with the
help of a microSD card on the back
you'll likely find a 12 megapixel camera
with Sony's IMX 360 to censor and HDR
plus support which offers real-time HDR
processing in the viewfinder before the
picture is even taken HTC will
reportedly equip the device with a 16
megapixel front-facing selfie snapper
featuring Sony's IMX 3:51 sensor the u
11 is expected to support a fingerprint
scanner located on the front below the
screen and include four microphones to
allow for a surround sound effect when
recording Hall 3d audio
according to lab Toofer a noted HTC ROM
developer and frequent a leaker the
smartphone will also ditch the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack this means
you'll have to plug in your headphones
using the USB type-c port with the help
of an adapter which we hope will be
included in the retail box yeah I know
some of you are crying but let's talk
about what HTC is calling HTC edge
sentence HTC knows that it needs to come
up with something truly innovative which
is why it is reported that the flagship
will be equipped with something called
edge sense according to Evan blast the
you Levin will be embedded with sensors
in its frame that will allow you to
perform certain tasks just by squeezing
and swiping the edges of the device
these include launching the camera
calling up a digital assistant like HTC
zone sends companion or Google's
assistant and turning on Wi-Fi among a
bunch of others it's also expected that
you'll be able to squeeze the device for
different lengths of time in order to
perform different tasks Blass has posted
a video showcasing the feature on
Twitter you can see that right here so
cool or gimmicky for me the jury's out
let's talk about design those of you
hoping for a bezel less design like the
one in the s8 and the g6 may be
disappointed
based on the first leaked image of the u
11 the flagship actually looks very
similar to the uplay meaning it doesn't
have small bezels on the top and bottom
as you can see it sports a fingerprint
scanner on the front while a circular
camera lens along with a flash module is
found in the back just like the you play
and the u ultra it's expected to have a
metal frame and a glass back the device
is expected to be available in five
different colors you'll be able to get
your hands on white black blue red and
silver versions of the U 11 just keep in
mind that not all colors will be
available in every market so let's talk
price how many bones is this device
going to cost you quite a bit but not as
crazy as the f/8 although not yet
confirmed the HTC u 11 will probably
cost around the same as its predecessor
when it was released last year this
means you'll be able to find it for
around $700 u.s. and 570 dollars in the
UK and Europe the retail price can be
quite different from country to country
but it is expected to be somewhere
around 700 to 750 euros so what do you
guys think is it a gem or a no buy
personally if this is the design I'm
longing for the days when HTC was really
the most innovative and Android
smartphone design they used to have it
in the bag for a couple years back when
it was the HTC seven and eight yeah what

below or on Twitter
