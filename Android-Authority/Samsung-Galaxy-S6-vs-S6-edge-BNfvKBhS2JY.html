the wild and available across all major
carriers I'm sure those of you looking
at Samsung's new devices are asking
yourselves which one is better for me
well it's time to find out because it's
Josh regard from Android authority
what's going on everybody and this is
the Samsung Galaxy s6 versus the Samsung
Galaxy s6 edge from a design perspective
you're obviously looking at one well
actually two main aspects that
differentiate these two devices the
curves on either side of the screen in
the case of the s6 edge this is all
complete with the same tactile home
button and button layouts for both
devices as well as the camera package on
the back accompanied by the heart rate
monitor both devices now have a glass
backing as well eliminating the
removable back and the feature is
implied underneath that were in previous
Samsung devices though the s6 is a tiny
bit taller and only a few grams heavier
than the s6 edge these differences are
largely negligible what makes the case
for the s6 edge in design are indeed it
slopes on the right and left portions of
the screen and the real difference has
to be felt to be believed as I mentioned
after my unboxing what really made sense
of the edges to me was the fact that
they come down to meet the palm hence
making side-to-side handling better
perhaps better than any other slab
device for gripping the sides a very
prominent lip in the metal frame tilts
down ever so slightly but mainly sticks
out from behind the screen that melts
right down over it so with a good pinch
there aren't any problems keeping the
phone in check without rigging with the
screen accidentally however this can't
really be said foreign landscape usage
as I did find it a little tough to hold
the device on the edges without a little
bit of fidgeting but this was really a
rare occurrence in reality the width of
these devices is very much the same but
with the screen coming down on either
end the s6 edge actually feels more
narrow and that is what makes all the
difference yes it will be the s6 edge
that ultimately turns heads while the s6
proper looks more like a Galaxy Xperia
mashup the s6 edge will look even better
to the tech-savvy and will become more
recognizable to the common consumer as
it stays on the market so if handling is
more of a big deal to you than the s6
edge is an experience that has to be
felt and we're pretty certain that it's
going to stick with
now the same sentiment can be given to
the displays as the curves of the s6
edge happen to add to the viewing
experience as well
specifications are as high as you would
expect for a new flagship by Samsung
with the highly vivid 5.1 inch Super
AMOLED display now coming in at quad HD
resolutions can super high pixel
densities the result in either device is
a colorful sharp experience that has yet
to miss a beat in work play and media
consumption what makes the s6 edge so
compelling is the fact that it's screen
is essentially one entity and doesn't
have any specific area sectioned off for
the edge capabilities though we will get
into the actual edge screen features in
the software section it's worth
mentioning that they only take up one
side of the display that you choose and
even then they only appear when you
specifically trigger them it's as if
Samsung finally figured out that the
edges aren't really made for
game-changing features but rather for a
new way of looking literally at a device
as such elements of Android material
design are given an auxilary effect a
rolling effect that isn't always noticed
but appreciated every time that it is
watching media in landscape mode makes
the heads-up notifications look even
better because they have this effect for
example and even then the edges don't
move any of the frame away from your
viewpoint again they are really there
for aesthetics convenience and a few
features that actually mostly stay out
of the way in performance Samsung has
decided to forego the snapdragons of the
world and put out its in-house Exynos
processor and to great effect the Exynos
7420 is backed by mali t760 8 graphics
and 3 gigabytes of RAM though it is also
worthy of mention that the built-in
storage benefits from a ufs 2.0 flash
memory construction that helps keep
things as optimized as possible this is
a case that has been made against
expandable storage because it just won't
be able to keep up with the installed
storage the only real stutter that we've
ever seen involves the flip board power
briefing screen which typically has to
refresh every time you swipe to it and
it can slow down your immediate return
to the home screens and back all tasks
move along with little consequence even
if you're trying to do them at the same
time with the multi window or even the S
window capabilities but perhaps the best
way of feeling this speed is to go to
the old-school method of jumping between
applications via the recent apps screen
few problems came up with gaming too
with the most intensive applications we
did notice the phone getting quite warm
it was not to the point of discomfort
and with that the performance aspect is
pretty much tied here which is simply a
benefit for anyone that chooses either
of these phones in hardware the biggest
story since the announcement of these
phones has been the removal of the
replaceable batteries and expandable
storage though I did say earlier that
Samsung's case for the fastest flash
memory possible makes a bit of sense
both phones still support the usual
bells and whistles including the
fingerprint reader embedded in the home
button and that now vertical heart rate
sensor that in our testing works a
little faster than previous editions
found on samsung smartphones
connectivity with LTE networks has been
very steady on either device and the
voice calls are about as good as they
ever been and the sound coming from the
now bottom mounted speaker is pretty
adequately loud no matter which version
of these phones you get battery life on
either device remains pretty standard
despite the claims of going beyond due
to better processing in my estimation
the higher resolution seemed to even out
whatever optimizations were put into the
processors but of course it always comes
back for the s6 edge to the edges on the
screen now while they don't really add
anything to the hardware section I do
have to say that some of the accessories
for the s6 edge will turn out a little
bit different from its original
counterpart but as far as the features
go the edge screen features are going to
be covered in the software section but I
will mention that the night clock
especially when you have a trigger for
bedtime works really well on the
nightstand but in ultimately that is
still just a small addition now my
camera shootout that was just recently
published will show the camera quality
shared between these devices even better
but it can be restated that the camera
package Samsung put out this year is the
best they've ever put out and probably
one of the best in Android right now a
rear-facing F 1.9 aperture camera brings
auto HDR to 16 megapixel photos with a
laundry list of capabilities while the
front-facing camera also sports those
same specifications but at 5 megapixels
the app comes with a number of different
modes including panorama slow motion
video capture at 120 frames per second
and can be easily triggered with a
DoubleTap of the home button which is
one of the best felt enhancements of
this galaxy update using these cameras
and all but the lowest light in mostly
indoor situations yields some really
great-looking photos and especially with
a very good
working auto-mode most of the guesswork
is taken out of the smartphone
photography experience extra features
are available if needed but for the
general user who just wants to capture
high-quality memories both of these
devices are great companions to have
maybe we haven't really looked at it in
this particular lens per se but
smartphone cameras for a while we're
struggling to get to the point of
replacing even typical point-and-shoot
devices with this new crop of flagship
smartphones I think we're closer than
ever to doing that and this new galaxy
line is a prime example of that
evolution as has been mentioned a few
times already the TouchWiz iteration on
this line of Galaxy devices has been
toned down to the pleasure of many
including us here at Android authority
not only have many of the gimmicks been
put aside any ones that have been left
in don't get all up in your face about
using them even tutorials about how to
use different features are largely
absent and if you want to keep certain
features like s voice on the side that
is actually very easy to do this time
around despite a still pretty colorful
aesthetic a theme engine can be used to
change the look of TouchWiz to what you
prefer so with all that aside it's
better to look at what makes the s6 edge
different and it is the return of those
edge panels these panels and features
don't show up until you trigger them
which happens only from a standby
position via a couple of swipes on the
side that is picked by the user the
night clock comes up and then you can
swipe from the bottom portion to see
notifications news takers and a number
of other edges that can be installed via
the settings
despite some usefulness that can be had
in the news tickers the scrolling
generally focuses on one story at a time
and thus pales in comparison to even
using the briefing screen instead now it
can be a good way of looking at your
notifications quickly but waking the
phone up and seeing them on the
lockscreen right there is arguably still
faster and better to do and then finally
there's the people edge which houses
five people under specific colors for
easy access for calls and messages while
it can work has a pretty good speed dial
the main gripe I had with it was that
messages required the use of the native
messaging app instead of something like
hangouts which I use all the time and
while the phone is upside-down the color
assigned to a contact will glow on the
side as they're calling you alerting you
to who exactly is calling in an
interesting way it's not really a bad
idea but then again when you have your
phone screen down on a table it honestly
just
looks like the underside of an import
tuner car and even then who really puts
their phone facedown on a surface in
fear of actually scratching the thing
ultimately the main story here is how
TouchWiz has been optimized and made
even faster especially when you consider
the processing package made in-house
that Samsung has put within these
devices the edge screen features are
available for anyone who really needs
them but ultimately I don't think there
are many people out there who feel that
way and finally the price where we find
that paying for sloped screens means a
premium indeed the s6 edge will cost you
up to $150 more overall for the unlocked
version or the same amount broken up
into higher payments per month on
various carrier plans it's no secret
that flagship device has come at high
prices but would you pay even more for a
phone that basically just looks and
somewhat feels a little different that's
the question you have to answer because
both of these phones really show that
Samsung has left forward in the flagship
game the galaxy s6 and the s6 edge will
be the phones to beat this year and when
factoring in the speed and stellar
camera experience it will take quite a
bit to get ahead of the korean giants
but in the case of picking the s6 edge
over the s6 it's really a matter of
aesthetics and handling both of which
are actually felt benefits and if you're
looking for a phone that is ultimately a
looker unique to everyone including the
actual user themselves and quite a
head-turner than the s6 edge might be
worth that extra money personally if I
had a choice the s6 edge would be my
pick but I still hesitate to say that
the s6 edge Edition should have been the
only phone Samsung released this year
that's because if I had the galaxy s6
I still have largely the same experience
but at somewhat lower price point but at
least in this versus we get to see how
Samsung has reconciled the past almost
perfected the present and where they
might continue to be ahead of the curve
in the future as always thank you guys
very much for watching and I hope you
enjoyed this vs. between the Samsung
Galaxy s6 and the s6 edge yes we're
talking about two devices that are
essentially the same but the little
differences in the s6 edge might be
enough to put it over the top for you
