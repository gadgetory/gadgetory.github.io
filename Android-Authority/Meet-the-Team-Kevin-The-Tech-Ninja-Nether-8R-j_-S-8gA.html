team video I didn't know how to do this
so I'm just going to answer questions
that I've seen come to me that I haven't
answered yet so question number one is
about me my name is Kevin yes the tech
ninja you may hate it but I'm gonna use
the tech ninja probably for the rest of
my life it's a name that my buddy he
made up for me because I did a video at
work about why I love working where I
work at it was because of the technology
ninja technology ninja was a guy that'll
pop up on your desk and fix your
computers and we always joked about
having one because when people call the
help desk with issues they call us that
everything suddenly works and they say
Oh someone just must have fixed it for
me or whatever so that was the
technology ninja and then ended up
calling myself the tech ninja my first
couple videos on YouTube I didn't call
myself a tech ninja at YouTube what is
going on you know this is this is Kate
neither midnight whatever you want to
call me but yeah I ended up using the
tech ninja for YouTube I just thought it
was a fun name to use and yeah I like it
it's my name here this is what I'm using
this is facts about me second thing
about me is I'm from Detroit Michigan
that is my home that is my heart I
probably won't live here the rest of my
life because I do plan on living
somewhere that's more hot because it's
so cold
in 2d but I have two older brothers I
have a niece and nephew that I love
dearly and I have mom and dad still
around and my girlfriend who I adore and
love and all that good stuff I've been
dating for almost six years now I do
have a degree in computer information
systems for Homeland Security and I'm
very proud of this degree for a number
of reasons one it opened up doors for me
that I never saw before I had an
internship with a federal law
organization didn't really like it but I
did have an opportunity to do that and
to it does prove yourself to employers
that you can't complete something a
degree may not be for everyone but if
you can get one please do and talking to
the younger folk right now so the older
folk you can fast for about 30 seconds
but the young folk listen to me I know
you may have a calling in life or a
passion in life and that's fine I did
too but getting that degree show
that you can do something now my
opportunity wasn't given to me my
parents didn't pay for my school
anything like that I graduated high
school to two point one teachers told me
the only way I'll make something of
myself if I joined the army or something
like that and I had girls that I was
trying to talk to even tell me oh you're
not gonna be nothing in life I want to
talk to you yeah yeah okay so I did was
I got a job and I worked my butt off of
the job it wasn't a great job I worked
at a pizza place but I treated everyone
with respect and dignity and I was just
a you know I try to be a really good guy
and someone came in there was a CEO of a
company he came in there and saw how I
treated him and then he offered me a job
at this place so don't let anyone hold
you down and make sure you go out and
educate yourself as much as you can by
any means necessary now the third thing
I want to talk about is that people want
to know why I don't make enough videos
or some people are glad I don't make
enough videos but I do have a lot of
people say where you've been I haven't
seen your video in a while because
Android Authority is something that I do
for fun I do it when I have a chance to
I try to do one video a week I pretty
much give one video weekend a lot of
times videos get delayed and pushed back
because of you know our announcements of
newer phones and all the stuff like that
whatever you know I just try to have fun
I try to review a products that I'm
passionate about I don't review anything
that I don't like so when I talk about
accessories or accessories that I really
like so that's why you see my favorite
cases these are my favorite cases these
companies didn't pay me we went out and
purchased these cases to review these
cases for you guys and these are cases
that I really enjoy a lot of times I do
my favorite cases we have ten cases that
come in and I picked my five favorite
out of there or if they're only three
good ones I pick three cases out of them
so that's that so that's why I only make
one video a week because of my full-time
job and the stuff I do for sports and my
church and all that stuff so you know
this is the best I can do things that I
enjoy our sports I play in three
softball leagues right now I did play
basketball a few years ago and I used to
play football in high school so sports
are things that I really enjoy I love
playing them I love cinematography I
love sitting down and watching a movie
and break down the shots break down the
scenes and see how they draw interest to
the actual person that watch it if you
can see from my videos I try to bring
dramatic flair to them would I have a
chance to so if you want to check out
some of my videos like the beats by dre
is in the both QC 20 year but you would
see that I really try to bring in a
cinematic feel to it you know shut I
didn't shoot in my office but I shot
somewhere else a shot in different
locations and things like that
I love cinematography I love technology
I've always been a technology my whole
life I just love this stuff how did I
get to Android thority is a question
that a lot of people like to ask well I
was actually on XDA developers and I did
that for about six seven months it got
me experience exposure I started doing
tutorials and how to's the tips and
tricks and all that stuff and you know I
had a lot of fun doing that and I
appreciate my time there and my
opportunity there but Android 30 came
knocking at my door and I had to make
the move
I do love connecting with people I do
love having conversation I do love
having debates online so if you circled
me on Google+ we can have conversations
we can talk about technology and you can
hear my personal opinion on a lot of
stuff also I have my own YouTube channel
at the tech ninja and you know I'm not
doing that for money or anything like
that
I just make a video whenever I can i
unbox something new that I have talked
about something cool I explain what's on
my devices and I try to do some tips and
tricks and you know I really don't make
that many videos on there but if you do
like my style you want to connect with
me check me out on the tech ninja also

speaks comm you can check that out a lot
of my videos that I make here and I make

my house that is strictly for video
