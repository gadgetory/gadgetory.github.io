today we'll be taking a little peek into
the future of technology from
fingerprint secured wallets to
headphones that train your brain to be
less stressed this is Kickstarter's of
the month
so we're all very aware of mobile
payment systems like Samsung pay Android
pay and Apple pay and all these systems
were implemented to replace the wallet
well it's been a while now and it
doesn't seem that wallets are going
anywhere so how do we solve the main
problem that wallets have like how
insecure they are or how easy it is to
misplace them well it appears that revel
Incorporated has come up with a solution
is called cashew wallet wallets are
still vulnerable to theft and with so
many important things living inside like
driver's licenses credit cards and even
cash why hasn't there been a way where
only you have access to it and is always
by your side so with cashew wallet these
problems are answered cashew wallet is a
world's first wallet with a fingerprint
reader to ensure only you can have
access to your wallet and is always
connected to your smartphone using
bluetooth to ensure your wallet is
always by your side there's an
electronic latch that unlocks when a
fingerprint is recognized and if
somebody tries to tamper with the latch
you'll automatically be sent a
notification on your phone alerting you
of this however the goal is for this to
never happen as when you're out and you
start to walk away from your wallet
you'll be sent a notification informing
you that we left it behind also if
you're home you just can't seem to find
a wallet anywhere it has a fine my
wallet type feature where your wallet
will actually ring to help you find
where it is although this while it does
need to hold a charge amazingly you'll
only need to recharge this wall that
every nine months and it can be fast
charged right now the creators of cashew
wallet are seeking a forty thousand
dollar goal and with about 20 days to go
there at thirty thousand dollars and of
course will link to these in the
description below next up we have
something that I'm actually really
excited about because this is something
that I which had existed for years it's
called hub by echo audio the first high
five Wi-Fi hub for headphones and
speakers hub lets multiple users stream
high res audio together in real time so
let's say you're watching television
with your friends you want to use
headphones to listen for whatever reason
maybe more immersive sound or it's late
at night or maybe what you're watching
had some bad language so you just simply
pick up one of these wireless hubs
plugging your headphones and that's it
instantly you'll be listening to your
television in hi-fi settings it's
capable of pushing out 96 kilohertz
audio at 24-bit in real time you want
your friends can be listening to the
same audio source but with different
hubs using ultra-low latency Wi-Fi
technology and it's not just for TVs you
can use it for PCs gaming online
streaming really any source and what's
great about having multiple hubs is that
each can be tuned according to each
person creating a personalized high
quality experience for each user if
we're watching a movie together I can
have my hub set to seventy percent
volume while yours could be fifty
percent or I could add some extra
trouble in mind while you crank up the
bass echo audio was seeking a goal of
100,000 dollars for hub and even with a
week left to go they've gathered up 180
thousand dollars and now let's move on
to the next Kickstarter project we often
say we live in a very connected world
where at any moment we can contact
another person no matter what especially
with our smartphones but we never really
think of these two other groups of
people little kids and older people this
next project is called le and it's a
little device that's designed to be very
simple for anybody to communicate to
family members and let's face it lots of
grandparents have trouble keeping up
with new technology and younger kids
usually aren't ready to be able to have
a device that can access any website or
call any person so what happens there's
just no communication and staying
connected to your family is important
with jobs requiring so much travel and
distance so Italy is designed to replace
something like a landline phone it has a
large touchscreen speaker and remote
that sits in a housing that can be
placed anywhere around the house young
kids can use illy to make calls in a
closed network without a parent's help
or even permission since all contacts
and permissions have been set previously
by the parent it's even simple enough
for grandparents to use for adults they
have a worry-free way for their kids to
stay close to their family members
without having them bar their phones and
then who knows what they'll do with it
with illy you can record video messages
text messages and even drop pictures or
just talk as if it was a skype call
right now in sin Z the company who is
making italy has received 75 thousand
dollars of their $100,000 goal but now
let's talk about something this
little more familiar digital picture
frames but with a canvas we have in our
experience like no other it's a cord
free art display and streaming platform
that connects to your smartphone a
canvas features an app that uses curated
art stations to string new artwork from
a variety of different artists and
genres or even your own family photos it
has an ambient light sensor that helps
automatically control the brightness of
the picture to make it feel like an
actual photo on the wall rather than
just a digital screen it's a 23 inch
full HD display that comes in different
style frames as well definitely seems
like a cool idea but what makes a canvas
of one of the most interesting
Kickstarter projects is the fact that it
charges itself to keep a canvas Wire
free and hassle-free the company needed
to find a way for it to charge all by
itself literally while you're sleeping
at night eight campuses power cord will
automatically lower from behind the
frame and fall into magnetic charging
trade on the base of your wall then when
it's all charged up the motorized cable
will automatically slide back up into
the frame it's very strange but it works
and that feature alone gets a canvas on
this list of top Kickstarter's of may
the company is looking for one hundred
thousand dollars and so far have thirty
thousand dollars pledged and last we
have the world's first EEG headset that
trains your brain to cope with stress is
called mellow mind my brain technologies
the creators of mellow mind say that
sixty-two percent of americans have
reported that they have tried to reduce
stress levels but only thirty-seven
percent have been successful there's a
lot of downsides to traditional
relaxation methods the biggest being its
temporary effect but with mellow mind
you can easily train your brain to
handle stress more effectively once you
put on dimelo mind headset the EEG
sensors begin reading your brains
activity mellow minds will then generate
an audio soundscape a response to your
brain waves in real-time and according
to your relaxation level the music will
be adapted to you you don't have to do
anything except just listen to the
sounds present and mellow mind will do
the rest and after a while your brain
will adapt and strengthen itself to
learn to relax and finally deal with
stress much better the world is
definitely excited about this because my
brain
technologies was only seeking 56
thousand dollars but they already
reached 150 thousand dollars with almost
a full month left to go so what do you
guys think of these Kickstarter projects
