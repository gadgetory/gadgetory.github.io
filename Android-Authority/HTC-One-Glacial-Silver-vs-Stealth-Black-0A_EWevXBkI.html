picking one color over the other after
all your smartphone can and in my
opinion really should be an extension of
yourself so we're gonna take one of the
most well-received smartphone designs
and compare both of the currently
available colors hey it's Josh of agarra
from Android authority what's going on
everybody and this is the HTC One
glacial silver and the HTC One in
stealth black alright obviously this is
a very subjective matter so I'm going to
give my opinion in a little bit for now
just enjoy seeing both of these phones
in all their glory cue the music
the changes are pretty simplistic
anything that wasn't black on the silver
HTC one was made so anything that was
already black just stayed so you're
looking at the original aluminum
material with a new coat of paint and
possibly a slightly modified finish as
is evident by the Beats Audio design
coming off of the back it seems that the
color added a slim layer that makes
anything on top of it susceptible to
being rubbed off also the oil on your
hands can get caked into the finish so
just be wary of that it should also come
as no surprise and as you can probably
already see here the black finish it
does make specks of dust or any type of
debris really stand out you're gonna
want to keep it pretty clean these
details don't seem to be as much of an
issue if at all on the silver version
all right so you've probably heard me
say before that I love the stealth black
version I still do and I wouldn't have
it any other way
sure there are plenty of other black
phones out there but aluminum in black
just makes this already sleek phone
singing even more so stealth is
definitely the operative word because in
darker conditions it can blend into the
darkness the silver HTC one might have a
more defined look and thus is more
easily recognizable but in the end come
on it comes down to your own personal
preference thank you very much for
watching this video and I hope it made
your decision at least a little bit
easier for all of the best coverage make
