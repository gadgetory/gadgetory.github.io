android authority and today at Google
i/o Google talked a little bit about the
android wear update and the features
that you can expect to see as this
update begins to roll out to Android
wear devices now if you already have an
LG watch urbane you might already be
pretty familiar with some of these
features but if you don't these are some
of the changes that you expect to see as
the update begins to roll out so the
first feature is called always on and
this keeps the display lit at all times
in a dimly lit state so doesn't drain
your battery but it still allows you to
see your watch face and also other
applications like Google keep and Google
Maps so you can still do your grocery
shopping or navigation without having to
constantly tap or wake the display and
also other third-party applications can
tap into this feature as well google has
also implemented a new feature called
risk gestures which allows you to scroll
through notifications just by simply
flicking your wrist forward or backwards
depending on the direction that you want
to go and this is supposed to be really
helpful when you have your hands full
and you need to see the notifications on
your watch or your hands are just simply
covered in chicken grease or something
like that or you simply just don't want
to touch the display on your watch and
you want to be able to just look through
your notifications quickly without
having to interact with the display this
feature will allow you to do that you
can also draw emojis now so basically
what it does is when you draw the emoji
it'll analyze your drawing and give you
a list of emojis that thinks you're
trying to draw and you just select the
one that you want and send it off to
your favorite contact and it'll show up
on their smartphone and their Android
wear a SmartWatch if they happen to have
one with the latest version of Android
wear also comes a new launcher and
tapping on the display will show you a
list of applications that you have
installed on your android wear
SmartWatch and swiping over will show
you your starred contacts and swiping
over one more time will give your
standard Google search screen this
little bit of extra organization makes
it easier to find your applications and
contacts and helps to minimize the
amount of vertical scrolling google also
said at today's keynote that there are
now over 4,000 apps for Android wear and
many of them are capable of taking
advantage of the hardware and software
for android wear so for example you can
uber a car ride just by simply doing a
google voice search you can also do
things like analyze your golf swing
by using the watch's accelerometer and
gyroscope or use shazam to listen and
recognize a song using the watch's
built-in microphone Google's goal with
Android wear is to make it glanceable
actionable and effortless and that's
what all these new features and
enhancements are all about and again you
can expect to see this update rolling
out to your Android wear device very
soon as always guys thank you so much
