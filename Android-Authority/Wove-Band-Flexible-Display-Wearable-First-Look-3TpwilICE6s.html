announcement of a SmartWatch that really
has is excited
the wolf manned by poly era I brought
you a lot of information as to how this
particular device is put together but
today I can finally show you the actual
device it stretch of agar from Android
Authority what's going on everybody and
this is your first look at the wolf band
by poly era
and here it is the wolf banned by poly
era now you can go ahead and see all of
the action that this particular watch is
showing us in this video but I do have
to reiterate from Monday's video that
this is such a pre-production unit that
this is very pre-alpha even and right
now the stage is currently at 0.1 phase
that means that right now poly era is
just looking for people to be able to
create some artists to create
compositions on here and developers to
create the experiences that we
eventually make it onto the wrists of
those who buy the wolf band now there's
also no info on availability or pricing
at the moment because we are still very
much a long ways from this becoming a
consumer product but it will get there
sometime in 2016 now getting into the
actual specs themselves this is called
the wolf OS that you're seeing here and
right now it's just a demo unit so it's
just going to be cycling across a number
of different compositions everything
from landscape wants to portrait
orientation wants to even pictures that
is basically making this bangle or band
rather a kind of customizable and very
fashionable type of device that well
voeis is based on android 5.1 though so
you're looking at an actual android
iteration on the back end here now the
display resolution is actually 10 40 by
200 that's of course obviously 200 wide
and 10 40 on the long way so you'll be
wrapping this whole display around your
wrist and it is a paper display that is
going to be of a grayscale color so if
you've ever had any ink or ePaper
devices in the past you kind of note to
expect here but it is a full touchscreen
display which will allow you to navigate
across various portions of the loved OS
and the customizable compositions will
be made available with a companion tab
that will be compatible with Android and
iOS so you will be able to customize the
experience to your liking but it is
still a touchscreen display so you can
manipulate the operating system now like
I said before this particular watch is
not one that I can show on a wrist
because that is an experience that Polly
era is hoping to keep as personal as
possible for each and every user that
does get the wolf band now as far as
development goes the SDKs will be made
available for those
who are versed in Java html5 css3
javascript for android and there will
also be a graphics tool that will allow
people to help create very unique types
of compositions on here
and finally the processor underneath is
a one gigahertz cortex a7 now as you
might be able to see in a couple of the
compositions that are cycling on the
wolfman right now what's great about
having a display of this size is that
you can kind of prioritize the
information on your wrist for example if
you happen to have a text message come
in you can get a little ticker on the
top of your wrist where everyone will
most likely be able to see it and it
will tell you that you did just get a
text message but then flip your wrist
down and on the bottom of your wrist
where that display is you'll be able to
see the actual text in landscape not
only does this provide a certain sense
of privacy but because you're able to
show the information in landscape you
could feasibly see an entire block of
text rather than have to scroll through
it the way that current smart watches
with their touch screens require you to
now though the display rests on a number
of slats that eventually snake together
to create the round band at the top
there you're going to notice that there
is a small solid area now this is mostly
for the bits and pieces that Polly era
is unable to make into their digital
fabric technology and you probably
guessed it it's the battery
but it is also where Storage is going to
be put and that's four gigabytes of
storage with half a gigabyte of RAM and
the battery which it mostly comprises of
is a 230 million power unit now
considering that this is an ePaper
display it should go for quite a while
and they're even hoping that the wolfman
will be able to be used in landscape
mode sitting on a desk eva specially
when it is fully rolled out as you can
put a lot of information on there that
becomes just a fixture on your actual
desk and so there you have it for your
first real look at the wove band once
again wove calm is the place to go if
you are a developer an artist or anyone
that just really wants to create the
compositions that will eventually make
it onto the wove OS and you can head
over to wove comm where they have a
great presentation of exactly what this
particular device is
and you can stay tuned to Android
thority for all the best coverage of the
wolf Ben as they become available in the
coming months stay tuned to Android 34
