going on everybody looking at a green
edition that's because of the cover of
the samsung galaxy s4 which has just
been announced just less than an hour
ago we were at the event we got to see
all of the great features presented by
some representatives at Samsung a really
great presentation but now we get to see
the phone itself so we're going to jump
in and just take a look at a couple
things now we do have a cover on here
but there is the phone in all of its
glory and what we're looking at here is
a newly created samsung galaxy phone at
only seven point nine millimeters thick
it's a very very thin phone even with
this smart cover which is one of the
accessories as available for the phone
this is a smart cover called the S view
cover that when you close it it still
shows you some information inside and of
course when you open it it opens up and
wakes the screen so we're just taking a
look at the phone year I have to tell
you though when I picked up this phone I
was incredibly surprised at just how
light it feels at 130 grams this is
certainly one of the lightest and most
nimble phones that I have ever felt you
get the 5 inch Super AMOLED display this
time of Samsung's to Graham lives their
screen technology and you have the 1080p
resolution display at 441 pixels per
inch density so this is a very very very
good-looking screen indeed very vibrant
all the colors seem to really pop out of
the screen and also we have here is for
point-to-point to jelly bean and also
the memory inside you have 2 gigabytes
32 or 64 gigabytes of built-in memory
with and with a SD card slot that is
available inside as well and the back
cover is also removable meaning that the
battery is also replaceable so that's
great this has pretty much all the
features that we all really pine for
when it comes to our smartphones that
being said over there are a lot of
different features inside of the
software Samsung has really put the
emphasis on the features of the phone
which is interesting because we didn't
hear anything about the processor but
you will see in the benchmark that we
ran later
that we ran later we'll see you will see
that it is still a very very high
performing device it is really
interesting to see that the samsung
galaxy s4 certainly gets a super high
score of 25 900 now we've only really
seen a few devices break the 20,000
barrier but this one absolutely blows it
away so 25 900 we still don't know what
processors running inside of this phone
but hopefully we will know soon but we
at least know just how powerful it is we
were able to do the Geekbench to score
of 30 157 which is a great score for the
samsung galaxy s4 but this is the
interesting part we're coming down here
and as you can see we're getting a look
at the actual processor as you can see
there it is a Qualcomm ARM version 7 4
cores at 1.9 gigahertz well just about
1.9 so while they we're not talking
about the processor here at the
unveiling it is interesting to see that
we have some of that information right
here there are a couple of new features
inside the camera that really make make
their presence felt and right now we're
looking at the 13 megapixel camera and
as you can see there is us right there
we're looking at the 2 megapixel camera
that's found on the front but it's going
to peruse through here a little bit
let's take a look at this feature it's
the dual recording feature it is
something that we saw on the lg optimus
pro optimus g pro but the thing with the
samsung galaxy s4 is that a lot of these
features are actually customizable like
for example as you can see there our
picture me and Chris right over there it
is a stamp and you can change the kind
of frame that the front-facing camera
makes when you use this particular
feature also as you can probably see
before I was able to make it bigger make
it smaller move it around so while we're
recording
we'll be able to see both here we go
we're taking a look at a couple of
different modes here eraser is a very
interesting one that I'm not too sure
we'll be able to even test in this super
crowded room but in any case eraser is a
feature that allows you to take a
picture of somebody like anybody over
here maybe a family photo or what not
but if people walk behind the subject in
the photo it will find a way to erase
them from the photo because it takes
multiple pictures all at once in order
to take a picture of the background to
erase them and then you only get the
background there's also the drama shot
which when you take a picture of
somebody who's in a lot of motion it
will not only take a bunch of photos in
order to do a burst mode and capture
every one of them it'll put multiple
versions of the same subject in the same
in the same photo all right just like
with the note to what you'll be seeing
is that the functionality where you can
hover the pen over the display and
allows you to show some of the things is
the same thing here I were to hover over
here you can see I'm barely even
touching the display will go from the
side here and
I think I accidentally touched it come
on
here you go so we're going to just hover
over there and you can see that the
display comes right up so the screen
itself is so sensitive or rather there's
a new technology inside of the screen
that allows for the registering of close
touch is not even full treasure so
that's really awesome too so these are
just some of the great features that
they added in there even a couple
features in 4s health is what they call
it which allows you to calorie track and
also see let's say how much movement you
had in one day there you go so we
haven't really burned anything today but
that's okay so you get to track
everything that you eat everything every
exercise that you do in order to make it
so that you can get healthy or lose
weight and it's just a great companion
for that so those are just some features
of the software that's in here and
that's really what they were focusing on
here at the samsung galaxy s4 launch
event and let's go to about device and
show you that indeed it is jellybean 4.2
so so that is the samsung galaxy s4 and
we are going to become comparing it to a
bunch of other phones in the market
today and we're going to be here for you
giving you all the coverage live from
the launch event in New York City this
