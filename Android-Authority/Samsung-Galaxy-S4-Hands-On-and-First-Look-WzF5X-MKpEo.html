going on everybody we're looking at a
green edition that's because of the
cover of the samsung galaxy s4 which has
just been announced just less than an
hour ago we're at the event we got to
see all of the great features presented
by some representatives at Samsung a
really great presentation but now we get
to see the phone itself so we're gonna
jump in and just take a look at a couple
things now we do have a cover on here
but there is the phone in all of its
glory and what we're looking at here is
a newly created samsung galaxy phone at
only seven point nine millimeters thick
it's a very very thin phone even with
this smart cover which is one of the
accessories as available for the phone
this is a smart cover called the S view
cover that when you close it it still
shows you some information inside and of
course when you open it it opens up and
wakes the screen so we're just taking a
look at the phone here I have to tell
you though when I picked up this phone I
was incredibly surprised at just how
light it feels at 130 grams this is
certainly one of the lightest and most
animal phones that I have ever felt you
get the five inch Super AMOLED display
at this time of Samsung Super AMOLED is
there screen technology and you have the
1080p resolution display at 441 pixel
per inch in density so this is a very
very very good-looking screen indeed
very vibrant all the colors seem to
really pop out of the screen and also we
have here is 4.2.2 jelly bean and also
the memory inside you have two gigabytes
32 or 64 gigabytes of built-in memory
with and with a SD card slot that is
available inside as well and the back
cover is also removable meaning that the
battery is also replaceable so that's
great this has pretty much all the
features that we all really pined for
when it comes to our smartphones that
being said over there are a lot of
different features inside of the
software samsung has really put the
emphasis on the features of the phone
which is interesting because we didn't
hear anything about the processor but
you will see in the benchmark that we
ran later
that we ran later we'll see you will see
that it is still a very very
high-performing device it is really
interesting to see that the Samsung
Galaxy s4 certainly gets a super high
score of 25 900 now we've only really
seen a few devices break the 20000
barrier but this one absolutely blows it
away so 25 900 we still don't know what
processors running inside of this phone
but hopefully we will know soon but we
at least know just how powerful it is we
were able to do the geek bench to score
of 31 57 which is a great score for the
Samsung Galaxy s4 but this is the
interesting part we're coming down here
and as you can see we're getting a look
at the actual processor as you can see
there it is a Qualcomm ARM version 7 4
cores at 1.9 gigahertz well just about
1.9 so while they we're not talking
about the processor here at the
unveiling it is interesting to see that
we have some of that information right
here there are a couple of new features
inside of the camera that really make
make their presence felt and right now
we're looking at the 13 megapixel camera
and as you can see there's us right
there we're looking at the 2 megapixel
camera that's found on the front but
it's kind of peruse through here a
little bit let's take a look at this
feature it's the dual recording feature
it is something that we saw on the lg
optimus pro Optimus G pro but the thing
with the Samsung Galaxy s4 is that a lot
of these features are actually
customizable like for example as you can
see there our picture me and Chris right
over there it is a stamp and you can
change the kind of frame that the
front-facing camera makes when you use
this particular feature also as you can
probably see before I was able to make
it bigger make it smaller move it around
so while we're recording
they'd be able to see both yeah we go
we're taking a look at a couple of
different modes here eraser is a very
interesting one that I'm not too sure
we'll be able to even test in this super
crowded room but in any case eraser is a
feature that allows you to take a
picture of somebody like anybody over
here maybe a family photo or whatnot but
if people walk behind the subject on the
photo it will find a way to erase them
from the photo because it takes multiple
pictures all at once in order to take a
picture of the background to erase them
and then you only get the background
there's also the drama shot which when
you take a picture of somebody who's in
a lot of motion it will not only take a
bunch of photos in order to do a burst
mode and capture every one of them it'll
put multiple versions of the same
subject in the same in the same photo
alright just like with the note2 what
you'll be seeing is that the the
functionality where you can hover the
pen over the display and allows you to
show certain things it's the same thing
here if I were to hover over here you
can see I'm barely even touching the
display we'll go from the side here and
I think I accidentally touched it come
on
there you go so we're gonna just hover
over there and you can see that the
display comes right up so the screen
itself is so sensitive or not or rather
there's a new technology inside of the
screen that allows for the registering
of close touch is not even full touches
so that's really also - so these are
just some of the great features that
they added in there even a couple
features in 4s health is what they call
it which allows you to calorie track and
also see let's say how much movement you
had in one day there you go
so we haven't really burned anything
today but that's ok so you get to track
everything that you eat everything every
exercise that you do in order to make it
so that you can get healthy or lose
weight and it's just a great companion
for that so those are just some features
of the software that's in here and
that's really what they were focusing on
here at the Samsung Galaxy s4 launch
event and let's go to about device and
show you that indeed it is jelly bean
4.2 so so that is the Samsung Galaxy s4
and we are going to become comparing it
to a bunch of other phones in the market
today and we're going to be here for you
giving you all the coverage live from
the launch events in New York City this
is Joshua regard Android authority your
