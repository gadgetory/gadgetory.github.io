Aoife sign here at Aoife in Berlin 2014
and I'm actually here right now to bring
you this rundown on the Samsung event
the premier event unpacked episode 24
2014 because well we had to rush out of
the Samsung event itself in order to
make it to the Sony event which you're
probably seeing a lot of videos from
there already right now but I did want
to give you this run down to just sort
of give you my thoughts on the unveiling
and the show itself and it actually was
a very interesting one now obviously we
already got a look at the devices
themselves a day before the actual event
and you are already seeing those videos
right now on the note for the note edge
the gear s and even the gear VR which is
a very interesting product in and of
itself and essentially what we're
looking at here is really Samsung's next
iteration next evolution of their note
line now if I can be a little bit candid
here I will say that the note line
pretty consistently excites me more than
the Galaxy S line and that definitely
was the case right now the note for now
has a metal edge all around it and it
has a very nice feel and look to it
because of that metal edge but speaking
of edges what we have now is the note
edge which I do have to say is a phone
that I feel like I would be buying a
myself at some point because not only is
it super different it is also a bit of a
special edition so you're not really
going to be finding it too easily on
other in other people's hands but one
thing I do have to say about the note
edge is that well that edge on the right
side that does provide a bit of a ticker
of on top of the experience that you
probably will have already on the
smartphone that is essentially the note
for now with a curved right edge the
only thing is when you're holding it in
your right hands or even your left hand
upend it doesn't even really matter
which hand you're holding it in you
might actually trigger that edge
accidentally on the side so that's
something I did want to sort of put out
there no matter how cool it is how
different it might be it might pose a
bit of an issue when it comes to
usability but from there we all set the
gear s which is a curved display
SmartWatch but really that's not the
only story behind it really the biggest
story when it comes to the gear s2 me is
the fact that it's so huge if you really
wanted a SmartWatch to be basically like
a smartphone being strapped onto your
wrist well that's exactly what the gear
s is especially because it will take a
sim card and be able
to perform a lot of the tasks your
smartphone probably can already only now
it's now on your wrist and you'll be
able to do a lot of those things without
being tethered to a phone which in
itself is pretty cool but it's also kind
of odd to have an entire let's say
galaxy s2 or something like that
strapped onto your wrist that's exactly
what I felt when I first put it onto my
wrist that being said though it is
Samsung's image of the future when it
comes to our wearable technology and
that also includes the gear VR which we
weren't able to get a great look at at
the moment when we were taking a look at
the rest of the devices but at the booth
here at Aoife we will take a much better
look and they told us that they have
chairs available and you'll be able to
get the full experience and sort of a
controlled environment so we're really
looking forward to bringing that to you
but again if I could be a little candid
it's like Samsung took the google
cardboard if you remember from google
i/o the cardboard um idea and really
like turned it on its head like they
gave it to oculus and was like go nuts
with it obviously that obviously they
probably had this and it works for quite
a while but it just reminds me of the
cardboard that I used out in google i/o
as far as a presentation when it was
pretty it was pretty standard in terms
of what Samsung usually puts out for
their releases its a typical motif of
having the people up on stage sort of
talk amongst themselves without really
acknowledging that the audience is there
for the most part and they try their
best to not have it really scripted
there obviously the two representatives
from Samsung and then one media
personality that's there to give sort of
the regular person's perspective so the
presentation was really what you would
expect from it but it was nice and
flashy they provided a lot of insight as
to why the new features and all these
devices would really work for you but
what really interested me was the fact
that the partnerships with Samsung
continued to get even better you have
Swarovski which unfortunately a lot of
guys out there probably all the guys out
there won't really be looking at
swarovski as the different types of like
cases or let's say the watch band for
the gear s that's all bedazzled up I
might not be for everybody but it's
another partnership that they have and
the one that I thought was really
interesting was actually with mon blog
now one blog obviously is known for
their writing other pens and it's just a
great experience all around they also
have great watches too if I might add
but mom blog has created a pen that is
it that can be doubled as the stylist
for the galaxy note 4 now it's great to
see that mon blog has come onto the
frame when it comes to being a partner
with samsung and it really shows that
samsung is able to have like a a very
extended reach with a lot of different
companies all over the place and mom
blog being one of them is really
interesting I'd be interested in trying
out one of those two pins that were
announced and really seeing how they
work not only in writing but also as
stylist stylist is for the note 4 but
yeah like I said we are it were near the
end of the day of this first press day
and you can probably hear it in my voice
that I'm really kind of losing my voice
after talking so much but there is so
much to talk about here i D Phi even
though the show it's tough as itself
hasn't even started and in this sort of
run down I wanted to give you on samsung
I do have to say that in the past when
I've gone to Samsung unveilings I have
sort of walked away from a couple of
them thinking to myself well it's nice
that they've added these particular
things to the tablets or phones but they
didn't exactly excite me I can tell you
this much when I started using the note
4 in particular I did get pretty excited
about what i was seeing there not only
is it a refinement and everything all
around from the original note 3 of last
year it also provides a lot of its own
characteristics and its own style which
i think is really great especially with
that metal edge so i just want to give
you that run down and give you a look at
the actual event itself so that we could
really share with you the experience
that we have here at Aoife but it is
time for us to get back to work and
bring all these great videos out for you
so make sure you stay tuned to android
authority because we are your source for
all things fifa 2014</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
