has a population of approximately twelve
thousand people now the name should
sound familiar because this is the same
Corning that's responsible for making
Gorilla Glass I was recently invited to
Corning's reliability and testings labs
where they run routine tests on its own
glass as well as competing once all this
is done to ensure that their products
live up to their claims after the visit
I will certainly say that my outlook and
appreciation for Gorilla Glass has
changed dramatically for Corning there's
more to it than just making the glass
okay
so there's a reason why Corning's
Gorilla Glass is found in many of
today's devices it's just the best at
what it does Gorilla Glass 5 is one of
pointings most recent products but at
its testing labs I got to see what
happens behind the scenes this isn't the
first time I've visited a testing labs
of some sort so it's pretty familiar
with some of the tests and demos I saw
there of course this wouldn't be a
Gorilla Glass tour if I didn't see it
scratch and impact resistant qualities
for myself trust me it was fun breaking
the barriers glass from the competition
but through it all Gorilla Glass managed
to hold up the time after time
reinforcing the realization I already
knew many tests I saw were controlled
tests like how they have custom-made
machines that drop devices from varying
Heights and angles onto a rough surface
of some sort they do this for all the
obvious reasons not only to reinforce
its superior qualities over competing
glass but also to uncouple reasons why
glass is still capable of failing
so given Courtney's reputation it makes
perfect sense why they do the things
they do it's all for the name of quality
shirts like I said though everything is
found to break that's just the reality
even the hardest of substance
take for instance sapphire which is no
foreign by foot scratch resistance will
eventually succumb as well there are
reasons of why that happens microscopic
imperfections it's both visible and
invisible to the eye or the root causes
to why even
with the glass can shatter or break I
went throwing some other outside forces
such as applied pressure tension deep
and any chemical exposure such as
swimming the pool they can all impact
the glass negatively for a smartphone
owners are screen shatter because of
something we do like clumsily dropping
them all texting and walking when the
biggest eyeopener's dermabrush is with
how corning sciences are able to
determine the exact reason why they fail
the medical scientists that work in the
photography department the specialized
scientists inspect broken glass to
determine the root cause of failure
using high-powered microscopes it almost
seems like there's an EM CSI Division of
the labs because they see what can't be
seen because like our fingerprints each
shattered screen tells its own unique
story and these Freitag rafi scientists
can inspect the various patterns and
impact areas to make a determination
pretty cool stuff if you're to ask me
seeing that there's quite a lot involved
when it comes to nature of glass again
we can't stress about how Gorilla Glass
on our smart phones and other mobile
devices are underappreciated it's one of
just a rectangular piece of glass left
open the touchscreen display sometimes
during the halfway point of the tour I
came to the realization that the
aesthetics plays an important role with
the glasses strength and integrity think
about it for a second one solid piece of
glass is manufactured to reach a certain
standard once intentional imperfections
are introduced though such as those
cutouts for your home buttons they sneer
pieces and even curved edges the
integrity and strength of the glass are
modified so you can truly bet it has
lost some of its resistive qualities
this of course is a tough balance
because you know that the development
process for a phone is extended due to
these modifications the engineering is
unbelievable when you think about how
the strength and integrity of Gorilla
Glass has increased with each iteration
while continually becoming skinnier
there's a reason why Gorilla Glass is
used by more phones than anything else
it's no coincidence that billions of
devices leverage it you can say that the
Torah was an insightful experience that
made me realize that corny
and continues to invest a lot of its
resources to the research and
development of Gorilla Glass for them
it's more than just shattering glass for
the state of quality control but rather
they're doing all that because they want
to strive for perfection so I say the
tour over at Corning collapse was an
experience of its own it definitely made
me more mindful about the glass on our
devices so if you guys want to learn
