hindi the android authority app guy
swift key went free and that means there
are a lots of changes in this video
we're gonna check them out ok so this is
going to be a quick video because all
i'm going to do is explain the new
changes at its core swift key is still
the same old swift key with the same
awesome prediction that swift key flow
and other features even most of the
settings remain the same the biggest
change is their monetization methods
instead of being a paid application
swift key now gives away the application
for free and it now has in-app purchases
wait
don't hit that complaint button yet the
only things in this application that
cost money are the themes yes friends
swift key has finally updated their very
dusty and musty theme selection to
include many many more themes some of
them come free and for a limited time
you can grab a pack of themes for free
to see if you like the new styles but
this is how Swift key will be making
their money from now on also included in
the update are over 800 emojis as well
as settings that let you control them if
you long press the Enter key you can now
directly enter emojis into text messages
email status updates etc there is quite
the selection and for the most part they
work with pretty much every other
application lastly there are a few
changes that have been a long time
coming Swift Key has updated their
autocorrect algorithms to be smarter
with your typing and it also
incorporates emoji use so you may start
to see the keyboard anticipate your
emoji needs my personal favorite is the
addition of a dedicated number row which
you can turn on in the settings and
that's really it folks it doesn't take
long to explain but it's really quite a
huge update if you want to talk more
about it leave us a comment below and
tell us what you think of this move I
think it's awesome and that a lot of
people who balked on getting SwiftKey
because of the cost have no reason to
avoid it now also the themes are pretty
awesome once again i'm joe hindi from
