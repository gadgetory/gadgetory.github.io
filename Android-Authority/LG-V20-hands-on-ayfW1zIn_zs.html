experiment for LG the innovation that
came out of it was this idea of having a
modular phone something that offered
expanded functionality beyond what we're
used to getting in smart phones but when
Lenovo introduced its modular
implementation
LG's approach appeared Elementary by
comparison still you could say it was an
inviting new change with every 20 you'll
be surprised by what changes it bares
especially when the be 10 was regarded
as one of the most underrated
smartphones released last year an a 35
you know that the b20 needs to be even
more successful four things really stand
out the most the v20 the first relates
to the new design it looks nothing like
the V 20 which might be a good or bad
thing depending on how you think of it
gone is the ruggedized design with the
be tender skin body and that stainless
steel frame instead it's been replaced
by the same metal construction we saw
already with the g5 yes it's far more
premium looking now but it means that
the V Series no longer has the same
identity despite the change the beech
one is still offers a level of drop
protection with its military grade
standard even with the new metal
construction at all to some it might
feel more fragile than the v10 but
doesn't seem to compromise its dirtiness
at the same time they've trimmed down
its overall size as well what's most
interesting though is that it doesn't
have the same modular approach you think
it would with the button on the bottom
right corner of the phone but it just
allows the backplate to come off to
provide us access to the battery
secondly there's a big emphasis on its
audio recording capabilities now the
rumors turned out to be true with this
one seeing that the LGB 20 features for
Dax
we're told that it reduces white noise
by up to 50%
you also have support for lossless music
formats
it has a 75 stage fine volume and you
also get left and right balance control
they've also increased clarity into the
132 decibel range up from the beat ends
maximum level of 120 decibels add to
that the new 24-bit rate and no
compression you know that'd be 20
messing around when it comes to this
kind of stuff the third major standout
of the phone is its camera the video
recording side to be exact before we get
into that it should be noted that the
dual front camera setup from lasher's
model is not here anymore
instead it's just a single 5 megapixel
camera with an aperture of f11 now we're
not too bummed out by this just because
it's still a wide-angle camera that
offers 120 degrees of coverage the dual
camera implementation is instead
reserved to the rear camera making it
just like the LG g5 almost it breaks
down to a 16 megapixel and 8 megapixel
combination with the same wide-angle
capture we've seen already give it
almost that fisheye look however LG
improved its stability thanks to its new
steady record 2.0 system it leverages
two things
the gyro based electronic image
stabilization and the image stream
analysis based digital image
stabilization so it ultimately makes
footage more stabilized than before
beyond that the LGB 20 acts much like
its predecessor it's going to be great
for shooting video since it's still one
of the few to offer true manual control
while recording video still we wish that
some other modes and features besides
stabilization were brought along for the
ride there would have been four stand
outs but this last one is somewhat
overshadowed the LGB 20 has been teased
in being the world's first phone to
launch with Android 7.0 nougat that's
all fine and dandy if it weren't for the
fact that many of the Nexus brand
devices have already received the latest
and greatest version of the platform so
yeah that's the little bit of the V 20
Thunder it's a little bit funny just
because nougat brings to the table some
features that we've been seeing already
with LG's customized experiences take
side-by-side multitasking for example
it's now baked into the platform which
means that more apps will be supported
by it overall LG's take on nougat here
with the b20 doesn't look visually
dramatic as previous iterations for the
most part it follows the recipe of
maintaining a cleaner more
straightforward approach everything else
about the phone is pretty much expected
it features a 5.7 inch quad HD IPS LCD
display with Gorilla Glass 4
like the v10 and just like it we get the
same always on second screen it
functions in the same capacity as before
but LG has improved it by increasing
visibility from 35 minutes to 68 minutes
you also have higher contrast and you
have the option for a longer signature
it's also no shock to know that it's
powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820
chip coupled with 4 gigabytes ram it
smooth and buttery with its performance
from what we can see so far but based on
the benchmark scores of all the other
phones using the same chipset you know
it's no slab here with the beach running
either there are 64 gigabytes of storage
which is the only option from the looks
of it but there's expansion piates micro
SD card slot
the battery gets bumped up to a 3200
milliamp power cell which we hope will
seriously improve its battery life the
b10 was notorious for its atrocious
battery life so open there's a
significant improvement here and while
it supports quick charge 3.0 there are
still no baked in wireless charging
support that again we're dealing with
the metal phone here and finally the
fingerprint sensor in the back is
similar to the one in the g5 so there's
nothing dramatically new about it
LG is reluctant to mention the b20 s
price right now leaving that for the
carriers in the US
- announced separately so more than
likely be priced similarly to the note 7
so that's some reference to what we can
expect now timing seems to be on LG side
with the introduction of the V 20 seeing
that it's being announced a little ahead
of Apple's new iPhones and as well as
hopefully capitalizing on the bow
surrounding the galaxy note 7 at the
moment full isn't here yet and as we
know there will be plenty more phones
coming onto the scene it's offering from
LG favors a more practical convention
and comparison to the g5 so if it's able
to excel in the areas it alleges to be
superior over the competition it'll
surely be a phone to contend with so
that's our quick hands-on look you can
kind of tell they're kind of targeting
audio files and people who are big into
recording video so hopefully it really
excels in those two areas so if you guys
