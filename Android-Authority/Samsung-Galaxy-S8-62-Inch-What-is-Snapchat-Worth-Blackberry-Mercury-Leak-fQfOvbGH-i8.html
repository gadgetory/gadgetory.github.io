Evan blasts the most famous tech leaker
out there is saying that yes this indeed
is the design of the Samsung Galaxy s8
but there's some bad news because if
this leak is true it means that samsung
is going to hard-code
the branding of samsung at the top of
your screen thereby negating that
wonderful screen to bezel ratio Wow
this report comes from ventureBeat and
the noted gadget leaker Evan Blass also
known by his Twitter handle evey leaks
he claims that the galaxy s 8 will be
sold in a 5.8 inch and a 6.2 inch
version both which q HD Super AMOLED
displays that have an aspect ratio of 18
5/9 compared to the 16:9 norm both
phones will have displays that will be
larger than the aborted galaxy note 7
but the galaxy s 8 5.8 version should
have the same display width as the 5.8
galaxy s7 due to the different ratio so
as you can see it looks like the display
has almost no bezel as well as previous
rumours have suggested 5.8 the small
version is going to be a 5.8 how big of
these freaking phablets gonna get
grandma but on the good news the image
would seem to confirm early reports that
it will have a standard 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack the 5.8 version will have
a 3000 milliamp hour battery according
to blasts while the larger 6.2 inch
model will get a 3500 milliamp hour
battery so back to the whole Samsung
branding thing on the screen some people
have said that no Evan blast was just
kidding I mean it's ridiculous we are
living in an age where the unbelievable
is actually becoming true and to be fair
Evan Blass hasn't been known for someone
with a sense of humor so it's not
looking good all right so let's talk
snapchat and a big question that tech
pundits love to ask is how much is
snapchat actually worth with snapchats
initial public offering looming ever
closer we're about to find out just how
much our snaps are worth to snapchat
according to sources speaking to recode
we finally get to see snapchats closely
guarded financial information and plans
for operating as a public company
sometime this week when it publicly
files for an IPO
analysts expect snap Inc to be valued
somewhere between 20 to 25 billion and
that's even greater than Facebook paid
to acquire whatsapp a few years back
rumor has it that in late negotiations
Google tried to offer whatsapp even more
than Facebook's offer but was too late
to sway their decision now I know a lot
of you are getting really excited about
BlackBerry's mercury but I'm warning you
don't get your hopes up
because I think you're gonna be
brokenhearted again the BlackBerry
Mercury is weird
wonderful and increasingly looking to be
a compelling prospect on that front the
latest rumor claims it may share the
same camera sensor used by the Samsung
camera king of the day the Google pixel
the information comes from a typically
reliable leaker Roland quant revealing
that the mercury will use the Sony IMX 3
7 8 sensor with a 12 megapixel
resolution and support for 4k video
quant also confirms what Evan blass
reported six months ago that the mercury
will be powered by the Snapdragon 625
chipset you think I'm wrong I know many
of you want to think I'm wrong you're
hoping that the mercury will somehow
revitalize the BlackBerry brain
and be an awesome smartphone
manufacturer yet again I'm past it I'm
past it I hope I'm wrong let me know
what you think in the comments below
meet Jeremy shoemaker otherwise known as
shoe money and he became famous for this
photo where he showed off a cheque that
he made from Google Adsense and he's
become so good at making online
businesses that he made an announcement
that he does not start a new business
unless he can secure the businesses name
in a dot-com now why is that exactly
well no domain name extension tells your
story with the same degree of trust as a
dot-com or dotnet domain name.com and
dotnet domain name extensions inject
credibility and your online presence and
who doesn't want to be credible and
don't forget you get 15% off when you
use our coupon code Android when you
think domain names think domain.com okay
guys so quick chat here over the past 72
hours the world has gone insane with the
immigration ban in the US and I've been
working real hard and trying to provide
a truly nonpartisan political view on
how the immigration ban will affect the
tech sector because it will it is and it
could potentially be really far-reaching
I've been working hard on all weekend I
want to do my best at it so please watch
for that it's going to come out as soon
as possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
