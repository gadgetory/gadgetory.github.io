authority and we're here at the TCL
event at CES 2017 taking a look at the
BlackBerry mercury this isn't the
phone's official name but if you've been
following the BlackBerry rumors this is
what most people have been referring to
it as so yes this phone is real and it
does exist something to keep in mind is
that this is an alpha build so things
are subject to change and we're not
allowed to talk about the specs or the
software but what I can talk about is my
observations about the device during our
short time with it first things first
the design is made of metal with the
exception of the back which is more of a
soft touch leathery like material so not
only does it feel really nice but it's
also very grippy and easy to hold on to
I did find it to be a little on the
thick side but overall the build quality
felt extremely nice it's got a
completely flat top that houses the
headphone jack while the bottom has a
more traditionally rounded shape with a
USB type-c port that's flanked by two
speaker grilles on the left side is the
power button and the right side has a
SIM card slot a volume rocker and a
custom key that can be mapped to
different apps or possibly other
functions I can't tell you the size of
the display but it is a touchscreen and
right below that touchscreen is
BlackBerry's tried-and-true physical
keyboard
it's a capacitive keyboard just like
we've seen on some previous BlackBerry's
so you can use the keyboard to navigate
through the OS instead of using the
touchscreen again I can't talk about the
specs so I can't really tell you about
the camera the processor or the screen
resolution or what version of Android is
running but you can clearly see it's a
similar stock light experience from
other recent blackberries like the D
Tech 50 and you can more than likely
expect all BlackBerry's usual services
and security features to come
pre-installed it's a phone that's going
to be geared more towards the enterprise
market but it will be sold unlocked and
also through carriers it's shaping up to
be a pretty interesting device and it's
great to see blackberry bringing back
that QWERTY style portrait form factor
and we'll definitely find out more about
this device including as pricing and
availability at Mobile World Congress so
keep it tuned here to Android Authority
for our coverage of that in the future
and also keep it locked here to the
answer authority YouTube channel and
Android comm for all of our CES 2017
coverage
