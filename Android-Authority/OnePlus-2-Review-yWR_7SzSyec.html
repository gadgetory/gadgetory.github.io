to continue the viral momentum of the
first animated splash right off the bat
announced through a full VR presentation
this new phone sports some very
forward-thinking features while coming
in at a pretty respectable price point
but is it all worth the hype this is
Joshua Vergara from Android authority
what's going on everybody and this is
the oneplus 2 a metal frame adorned with
the number of new features updates the
oneplus formula 2 pretty good effect
metallic material automatically makes
for a more premium looking and feeling
device over the original oneplus one
and despite the same size in the screen
from before the oneplus 2 has a slightly
smaller overall footprint that makes it
feel that little bit better in the
handling department but the buttons get
updated as well with the power button on
the right under the volume rockers this
change was to accommodate the new input
on the left the alert slider the front
of the device is still 5.5 inches in the
display but now has a divot on the
bottom that is for the capacitive home
key and the fingerprint sensor
this is a press type that is always
firing and will go over the fingerprint
reading in a little bit the capacitive
keys here are all lines at the bottom
but are designated with lines now which
is a nice touch the backing of the
oneplus 2 retains the sandstone black
material which we liked in the original
because it really established oneplus is
style it still feels a little bit like
sandpaper but still provides a good grip
some might not take to this material but
at least it is easy to replace the back
cover pops off and can be replaced by
any of the available style swap covers
and finally the USB type-c port on the
bottom is flanked by speaker grilles we
will get more into this in the hardware
section as well but having a reversible
plug in port here has already proven to
be a subtle but still welcome change
overall this is a really premium feeling
device especially when compared to its
predecessor up against the rest of the
competition oneplus has done a pretty
great job of really keeping their design
language unique and distinct there have
been really no problems in handling
which is a big plus for this 5.5 inch
display a 5.5 inch display keeps the
oneplus 2 within current smartphone
standards but in reality standard is
probably the best word used to describe
the two after all the 1080p resolution
screen doesn't quite live up to the quad
HD performers of flagships from other
companies but that isn't to say that the
oneplus 2
doesn't do well in fact it is a great
display writer overall and sporting a
somewhat higher color saturation it
really looks great in pretty much any
situation the IPS brightness might have
been bumped up that little bit too much
though as colors start to get a little
blown out when turned up all the way
this isn't something we did often though
and the boost does help in broad
daylight viewing that said the 1+2
display managed to be every bit as good
as we hoped it would be
though the quad HD resolution could have
further put this phone in the realm of
flagship killer this display is every
bit as good if not better then the rest
of the full HD displays out there
the real upgrade in the two happens
under the hood and after the phone
powers up the Snapdragon 810 returns
again in the oneplus 2 it really brings
the power octa-core power is backed up
by the audrina 434 graphics and 4
gigabytes of RAM for the 64 gigabyte
version of the phone just about
everything about this spec sheet screams
power and the 4 gigabytes of RAM really
helped make the Spartan oxygen OS fly so
for the most part that was definitely
the case the power of the processor is
hardly in question as oxygen OS is
seemingly more to blame for a number of
bugs and a few crashes that have
occurred in our usage still everything
from browsing to work to gaming has been
a treat with a highlight being minimal
slowdown and basically any game that we
threw at it but overall speed through
daily tasks was never in question and
with oxygen continually getting the
updates that it will need we're sure
that it will be every bit as stable as
it is pretty fast in hardware it's all
about new features and there are a few
main ones to mention here let's start
with the one we already talked about the
fingerprint reader and the capacitive
home button underneath now setting up
the reader is a pretty familiar
procedure and after that it's possible
to just rest a finger on the reader even
when the screen is off and the always
firing sensor will unlock the phone in
no time it's a great way to use a
fingerprint reader when it works now my
issue with it was hitting the actual
area properly though I definitely don't
think this is a problem with the phone
itself I did have some trouble
triggering the fingerprint reader and
even the home button underneath
consistently the best way for me to do
it was to cover the whole area with my
thumb and press down fairly hard until I
finally felt that short vibration now
moving to the sides the alert slider is
the new easy way of basically silencing
the phone the textured feel of the
slider
is easy to feel for when the phone is on
a table or in the pocket those sliding
up on the phone silences it which feels
a little bit odd doing so it takes
really no effort popping off the back
cover reveals a dual SIM card tray which
is somewhat four into Western users
while it is possible to cater calls
texts and/or data to either card
inserted this feature might be best used
for travel to round out the hardware
editions we have the new USB charging
port which means a whole new cord the
new standard will always take a little
bit of time to get used to but
thankfully oneplus is making this flat
red cable available at a very low price
so if nothing else oneplus is helping to
make USB type-c a real reality but their
implementation comes with some
sacrifices mainly in fast charging the
battery in the oneplus 2 is of a good
capacity 3300 milliamp hours and with
the right low brightness settings and
some due diligence I actually got some
of the best screen on time I've seen in
a while but when it came to plugging in
1 + missed the mark a little bit
charging time took around 2 hours to go
from 0 to 200 which isn't terrible but
simply pales in comparison to any fast
charging solutions out there and without
wireless charging plugging in feels a
little bit like a chore now despite the
Snapdragon 810 having fast charging
capabilities they simply aren't taken
advantage of in the oneplus 2 and it
really could have been a poster child
for the future of this new standard and
then of course there's the part that all
of you have talked about already the
lack of NFC in the oneplus 2 now this is
a big deal not just because the oneplus
2 won't be able to take advantage of any
of the pay services that are coming out
it's also a big bummer because any of us
who use NFC enabled audio peripherals
just simply won't be able to use this
phone with them speaking of audio the
speaker set up on the bottom of the
device just gets the job done
attempting to go the extra mile with the
Mac's audio enhancements when using the
built-in speakers any changes in the
application basically just make it
louder but not too much body getting
added in even when blasting the low ends
the enhancements are better felt with
headphones as the different modes for
music movie and game can be used
appropriately
it seems that game blasts the audio
movie goes for a lower volume or trying
to emphasize higher ends for dialogue
and music can be somewhere in the middle
depending on your settings personally I
just pumped the bass and be done with it
so obviously the section with the most
to talk about in the 1+2 is hardware and
while all these new features are surely
welcomed and in a lot of ways
forward-thinking their actual execution
can be somewhat uneven and now the
camera one of the most important aspects
for the oneplus 2 to really try and need
flagship standards the 13 megapixel
shooter from before returns here backed
by a 5 megapixel front facing units the
main additions are to the back camera
however which now has laser autofocus
and optical image stabilization the app
is really simple which is par for the
course in oxygen OS but future updates
will bring manual controls and further
control over the settings but
nonetheless modes include panorama 4k
video recording slow motion at 720p
resolution and even a time-lapse
function somewhat similar to the iOS
iteration my main gripe with it was in
changing modes swiping up and down on
the viewfinder worked fine until getting
to panorama which always goes to
portrait orientation and the need to
change position was something I never
really got used to and to that point the
speed of the app itself is kind of
average getting shots off wasn't a
problem in the beginning but slowly we
notice the amount of time the oneplus 2
needed to create the JPEG and to that
end the picture quality is decent maybe
sometimes above-average but mainly
bogged down by again uneven execution in
the new features the laser auto focus
needs to be triggered better by the app
which doesn't get proper focus upon
launch spot focusing and metering are
always required right off the bat
rather than an automatic focus on a
subject that could plainly just be in
the middle oh yes is always a welcome
addition but it can really only do so
much
the camera app ops for really slow
shutter speeds in lower light situations
and when those speeds are slow enough
all the stabilization in the world won't
be able to deal with that movement just
like with the oneplus one really steady
hands are required just about all the
time
when all the pieces really come together
though pictures do have a pretty good
level of saturation without looking
doctored and details are captured really
well what we did like was HDR which did
a good job of really making photos pop
sure it might look a little bit like a
filter on the picture but even exposure
and a bump up in saturation can often be
pleasing to the eye you just have to be
diligent with the spot focusing and
to ensure you actually have the right
levels in both definitely a place that
oneplus needs to improve on in futuro
TAS wherever possible now I don't think
the oneplus 2 is a bad camera companion
to have on the daily but it feels to
really kill flagships due to an app that
doesn't fully leverage all of the tools
it has available and finally in software
we have oxygen OS a very Spartan version
of Android really much of what you see
on the surface will look very familiar
this is basically a Google now launcher
with some customization built in and
more to play with when you dig deeper so
aside from the notification drop-down in
quick settings that can be moved around
the new software features are found
within the settings there's the dark
mode which is a mode that makes all
brighter portions of the interface dark
it sounds simple but it is actually a
pretty great tweak to use when in lower
light environments like in bed it
actually is quite nice though so we
wouldn't fault anyone for keeping it on
especially after picking a custom accent
color for a further customized look app
permissions come to oxygen before the
new Android M release and the lower
majority of users might not dive into
this page the ability to see what
certain applications have access to what
and then possibly be able to turn them
off won't please anyone that wants that
extra peace of mind aside from that
there are features we've seen before on
screen nav buttons are still available
and gestures on the turned off screen
can still be used to access the camera
flashlight or the phone itself now the
most obvious addition to this otherwise
very stock version of Android is the
shelf which essentially replaces Google
now on the left of the home screens
though at first glance it looks like an
HTC Sense home widget with frequent apps
frequent contacts and a user-defined
cover up top this page can actually
house any and all widgets for
safekeeping my personal setup put
productivity widgets here which was
actually pretty great and freed up the
home screens now all of the widgets will
be put in cards however so there might
be a lot of free space around any
widgets that aren't 4 cells wide or at
least a few cells high perhaps in future
versions oxygen will look more different
than just take on a stock Android look
until then it's a somewhat customizable
OS that feels more familiar than
anything else yes the oneplus 2 requires
an invite to purchase which will always
sour most people but at least the
company has been taking measures to
ensure their stock will meet the demand
and that said the demand is even higher
for this phone compared to the original
and the price for a premium feeling
device with a slew of new features can
explain that 16 gigabyte models come in
at 3:29 while the 64 gigabyte version
will be at 389 and with all that we've
experienced with the oneplus 2 we've
come to one simple conclusion this is a
flagship device through and through but
it will be killing any other really
high-end devices anytime soon
we can't fault oneplus for keeping the
features in line with the price points
but calling the oneplus 2 a flagship
killer feels like a stretch this year
the oneplus one was born of a different
era when quad HD and overachieving
cameras were yet to become reality
now when the current high-end market
oneplus has simply to meet the standard
and hope it remains the viral power it
was last year whether or not it truly
succeeds depends on your needs but we
will say this the oneplus 2 is an
incredibly solid device that is marred
by inconsistent execution in the areas
that are really needed to succeed it
just missed the mark mainly in camera
and bugs in the operating system but
supposedly these can be helped by future
updates that oneplus has already
promised to roll out nonetheless we do
think the oneplus 2 deserves to be among
the best even if its impact is not quite
as huge as it was last year as always
thank you guys very much for watching
and I hope you enjoyed this review of
the oneplus 2 it's basically like the
oneplus one got a real premium upgrade
think about cars for a second think of
the oneplus one as the stock car and
then after that you put a sport and
performance package on this thing and
that's pretty much what you get in the
oneplus 2 that's kind of the best way to
describe it because even though it does
deserve to be called a flagship it's not
really killing any other flagships in
the market that being said however it is
a great device and you just might find
that the oneplus 2 is one of the better
choices for you especially with its
better unlocked price point than many of
the other ones that being said however
keep it tuned to you for all of the best
