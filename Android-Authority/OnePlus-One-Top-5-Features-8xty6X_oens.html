come and gone and we got to see for the
first time what the phone is that this
company has been teasing for months so I
went on over to Beijing China and I'm
very privileged and proud to say that I
brought you the first look at this very
intriguing phone so what now well I'm
waiting for the review units from
oneplus themselves but until then which
is probably at least a few weeks from
now
I wanted to revisit the phone one last
time so that you could see what we think
is very exciting about this upcoming
phone so it's Josh Vergara from Android
thority what's going on everybody and
these are five of the top features that
the oneplus one is bringing to the
smartphone game and of course one of the
first things that we'll talk about is
probably the first thing you'll see when
you look at the device and also put it
into your hand and it's the first thing
you'll feel and that's the build quality
we are working with a 5.5 inch device
here that does make it bigger than most
of the ones we see out there but even
for its size it does feel pretty
accessible it almost feels like a bit of
a Galaxy Note 3 in that regard because
the Galaxy Note 3 is one of those phones
that the more you keep using it the more
it starts to feel normal and that is
definitely what I felt with the oneplus
one but it was also helped by the fact
that the back is tapered so it's not
necessarily thick the whole way around
on the back making it so that that curve
allows the phone to sit very nicely in
your hand
however the back cover especially on the
white version that I was able to test
out was made of the quote unquote baby
skin material that was presented at the
launch event that was created by a
company called cashew and that made for
a very nice feeling and also very sturdy
material on the back that not only made
it not fingerprint prone but also was
not of a soft touch plastic it's
somewhere in the middle it's like a hard
plastic that actually feels very smooth
and gives it a nice sort of distinctive
feel compared to other devices but the
build quality doesn't really stop there
because the back cover is removable it
is a little bit tougher to get off
because you have to take the SIM tray
out first and then sort of get the
little clip to come up from there and
then you can unclip from around the
device but the back cover is removable
and that means that it is also
replaceable one of the big points that
was made
the presentation is that you're going to
get a bunch of different covers that all
may come in this isn't confirmed but
they may coming out around the $20 u.s.
price point which is a great price to be
able to change the look of your phone
now that goes from wooden options like
bamboo to even Kevlar to the white that
you already saw to the black that you'll
see in the 349 64 gigabyte edition but
also a denim option now I wasn't able to
no one really was able to see the denim
option in in real life obviously we
always saw our render but what I was
told by our friends over at one-plus was
that the denim material actually feels
really nice and they're really excited
to see what everyone says about it
alright and it's time to get underneath
the hood and of course one of the big
draws of this phone is the fact that it
is even at its price point which we'll
get to later sporting the fastest
possible processing package that is
available currently today and that is
the Snapdragon 801 clocked at 2.5
gigahertz with the audrina 330 and also
three gigabytes of ram which isn't
always that comment in the flagship game
but in the oneplus one you get those
specifications and you get the power
that you need that powers the
CyanogenMod 11 s that should provide one
of the smoothest and best experiences on
a smartphone because there are a lot of
fans of CyanogenMod out there they know
exactly what to expect and when you have
all of the power behind this wonderful
OS well you're going to get a really
great experience and as I have just
mentioned in talking about the
processing package we also have
CyanogenMod 11 s this is the version
made by cyanogen that isn't necessarily
built from the ground up and brand-new
for the oneplus one but it is sort of
the marker as Steve Kondik sat in our
interview to the future the next
generation of San Jose in terms of their
image and also in terms of some of the
function area that they're looking to
bring to the table and the oneplus one
was a great place to start apparently
and that is because Santa Jomon 11s
brings the same customization and same
power that you've come to expect from
previous iterations especially the most
recent ones with of course some
additions made specifically for the
phone itself like the gestures on the
turned off screen in order to get
quickly into places like the camera and
of course other enhancements that we are
looking forward to really testing like
the new theme engine that will allow you
to get a new
look on your signage in mod launcher the
trebuchet that you can really customize
it to the way that you want it if you
don't want that stock Android like
experience but the stock enter like
experience is already pretty great and
if you've used Santa Jamaat in the past
you know that you can change it to
really what you want it to be with just
options coming out the wazoo all over
the operating system and for our fifth
and final reason why we are really
excited and I'm sure you are about to
the 1+1 it should come as no surprise
it's the price obviously at $2.99 this
is a phone that has really made a buzz
in the smartphone game and we're really
excited to see just how this price point
will play out in terms of sales in the
West especially because that's just a
price point we have not seen in the
smartphone game yet in the past the only
phones that really made us really
excited based upon its lowered prices
were the Nexus 5 and the Nexus 4 before
it's but in terms of the oneplus one
$2.99 is perfect for an entry point into
the Android game that is probably as
good if not better in some cases or
arguably than some of the other
flagships that are out there today if
you want just the bare core experience
done probably at its very best with the
likes of cyanogen and also with the
likes of the 13 megapixel camera on the
back and also the 5.5 inch screen then
you probably can't look any further than
with a oneplus one and so there you have
it for this final semi final look at the
oneplus one as we are waiting for our
review unit to come in I wanted to give
you the five top reasons and also the
five top features in a way of the
oneplus one that really get us excited
about it and I'm sure these are all
reasons why you are probably excited
because you've been commenting all over
our videos to talk more about the
oneplus one so we just wanted to revisit
it one last time to give you one last
glimpse at it so you can get excited for
a few weeks from now when we finally get
our hands on our own review units so
stay tuned to Android Authority for all
of the best courage of the oneplus one
in coming in the next few weeks and but

devices that we have already been
