going to look at two almost identical
phones the Xperia T XLT 29 I and the
Xperia T LT 30 P called the Bond phone
and marketed in the US as the LTE
equipped model the experi l LT 38 II
we've compared these two against other
competing devices but this time let's
pit them against each other
if portability is important to you
you'll be happy with either the Xperia T
or TX both are pocketable the TX is
slightly taller and wider yet also
lighter it's slimmer than the Xperia T
and looks elegant
in contrast the Xperia T X is slightly
heavier and thicker but shorter and less
wide which makes it look stocky and
solid both these phones have their jet
black screens accented by a thin frame
of plastic it's subtle on the Xperia T
but it looks cool on the TX up front
you'll only see the Sony and Xperia word
marks and silver you won't find any
physical buttons on both phones since
both rely on virtual keys if you turn on
your Xperia TX you'll see the exterior
weird mark light up this is a cool
effect that I particularly liked the
front camera sensors phone speaker
grille a notification light are on the
top bezel a notification light however
is located on different corners of the
phones the Xperia T's is here and on the
TX it's here the headphone jack at the
top is very convenient especially for
people like me who frequently listen to
music on the go the positions of the
buttons and ports also differ on the two
at the left side of the Xperia T is the
microUSB port but on the TX is the power
key at the right side of the tiara where
most of its buttons and ports are
positioned micro SD and micro SIM card
slots power key volume rocker and
hardware shutter button on the same side
on the Xperia T XR its microUSB port
volume rocker and dedicated shutter
button at the bottom side of both phones
is a small hole for the microphone I
consider the Xperia T Smike Rho USB port
to be in a good location since it's less
likely to be covered by your finger
however I'm not very fond of how the
buttons are
based on both Xperia phones they look
very busy to me the elements on the
phones bags are centered and aligned in
exactly the same order 13 megapixel
camera camera flash and mark logo Xperia
logo and loudspeaker owing to the shape
of their back panels both the Xperia T
and TX are very comfortable to hold in
the hand their inward curving backs
allow both phones to rest on your palm
the Xperia T's back is covered in soft
touch rubbery material that does not
attract fingerprints while that on the
t-axis textured plastic both make
gripping easy for me the Xperia T axis
back panel is more attractive mainly
because it is removable even the battery
is removable and replaceable I'm even
willing to speculate that this removable
bag is partly the reason why the phone
sides are not too crowded with parts and
slots the micro SD and micro SIM card
slots are right here under the back
cover both the TN TX have 4.55 inch TFT
LCD capacitive touchscreens with Sony's
Mobile BRAVIA Engine making these phones
perfect for viewing pictures watching
movies and playing HD games though I
noticed that the Xperia T's brighter
colors look unnatural and washed out
compared to the Xperia T axis own
slightly yellowish darker and more
natural-looking colors the touch screen
this place on both phones are snappy and
generally responsive but I noticed that
the Xperia T tends to be more responsive
and loads webpages faster in terms of
processing muscle both phones have been
left behind by the quad-core bandwagon
but their dual-core processors work just
fine for them both of these phones are
powered by the same dual-core Snapdragon
s4 MSM 82-68 chipset with 1.5 gigahertz
Krait CPU Adreno 2 to 5 GPU and 1
gigabyte of ram for storage either phone
has only 16 gigabytes of inbuilt storage
but thanks to microsd card slots each
one can accept up to 32 gigabytes more
storage bringing total storage to 48
gigabytes on each phone
both phones come with NFC DLNA bluetooth
and Wi-Fi unfortunately neither supports
4G LTE but AT&amp;amp;T is variant of the Xperia
T the Xperia T l LT 3080 does nowadays
many devices come with or have been
upgraded to Android 4.1 or even Android
4.2 but both the Xperia T and the Xperia
T X are still on Android 4.0 point for
Ice Cream Sandwich topped with Sony's
Timescape UI according to Sony both
phones will be getting jellybean and
early 2013 since they both run the same
operating system and UI these two phones
have the same basic features from the
lockscreen to the notification menu app
jar and security features the Xperia T
however comes with play books play
movies music and limited and video
unlimited pre-installed despite the
earlier Android version and the dual
core processing I was surprised to see
these two phones play 1080p full HD
videos without a smudge has a fleeting
stutter much less a momentary choke as
for audio listening is a joy on either
phone between the two I find the
experience he more capable of louder and
crisper audio both come with Sony's
Walkman AB and tagging along with it our
equalizer presets a 5 band equalizer
clear bass and excellent functionality
so yeah multimedia playback is extremely
pleasurable on these two phones both
phones have 13 megapixel back cameras
blessed with sony exmor are sensors and
hardware shutter buttons these phones
are also meant to double as digital
cameras with such powerful camera
hardware they produce good-looking
photos in a variety of lighting
conditions though I noticed that the TX
photos tend to have a yellowish tint the
Xperia T tends to provide crisper and
more vibrant photos video capture
however has shattered my heart I was
expecting Sony quality performance
especially with image stabilization
features on both phones
sadly most of my test video clips came
out shaky and jittery powering the
Xperia T is a non-removable
non-replaceable 1850 mAh lithium ion
battery for about seven hours
time on 3G while on the Xperia T axis
are removable 1700 mAh lithium polymer
battery for about 6 hours of talktime on
3G battery length however depends on
your usage habits and very many ways the
Xperia T and T X are similar they have
similar processing hardware and similar
screen technologies though the Xperia T
provides brighter colors and often
aggressively and excessively reduces
noise while the TX gives more natural
and vivid colors the Xperia T also
delivers crisper and louder sound and
snaps photos quite well whether indoors
or outdoors which of these phones do you
like the Xperia T or the xperia x let us
know in the comments get more android
news and reviews from android authority
comm and our youtube channel thanks
again for watching
this is April until next time may the
light side of the Android force be with
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
