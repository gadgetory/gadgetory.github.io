brought to you by carbonite go to
carbonite.com and use the promo code
authority for a free trial google app
updates abound we're getting so close to
the official unveiling of the note 3 and
you bunt to edge is dead long live the
ubuntu edge hey everybody i'm chris look
filling in for josh while he's on
vacation and we're taking a look at the
top android news of the past week in
android authority weekly google has been
on a roll this past week updating apps
like crazy Google Play services updated
version 3.2 probably making some
developers happy and causing users to
wonder what exactly it is Google
Hangouts updated as well bringing even
more emoji and adding a little butter to
make the interface more slick gross
Google keep the best note-taking app
you're probably not using updated
getting reminders and even better their
location aware so no longer will you
forget to buy batteries even though I
walk by than three times yesterday sorry
in what I think is quite possibly the
coolest thing to happen all week apps
are now prohibited from changing
settings without your consent even
better they're also prohibited from
pushing ads in notifications thumbs up
Google surprise surprise there are even
more rumors floating around the next
Nexus phone which a lot of people just
love to call the Nexus 5 some people
think that it's going to be a variant of
the LG g2 since the Nexus 4 was a
variant of the Optimus G while some
including evleaks are saying it looks
like it might be made by motorola
they've been scarce on details though so
we'll just have to wait patiently at
least until the next rumor pops up in a
few days speaking of evleaks Evan blast
leaked images earlier this week of a
device called the HTC sorrow which seems
like it'll be a mid-range phone that
sits at the junction of the HTC One and
the company's desire line of phones the
image was dedicated to HTC PR person
Jeff Gordon with whom blast seems to be
having a feud of sorts this is why we
can't have
things ok so we already knew that
Samsung would be announcing a SmartWatch
in September but this week GigaOM went
ahead and published a report on the
specs the little guy could be packing
we're looking at a 2.5 inch 320 x 320
AMOLED display a dual core Exynos
processor 1 gig of ram a 2.1 megapixel
camera bluetooth and NFC compared to
what others have said in the past it
doesn't look like we'll see a flexible
display here the Galaxy gear should be
announced officially at Aoife in
September but I have a feeling that it
just might be overshadowed by another
device if only I can remember what it
was oh yeah official details on the
Samsung Galaxy Note 3 or less than 10
days away I know right though we'll know
everything official style soon enough
that isn't enough to stop the rumor mill
Sam mobile is saying that the galaxy
note 3 could start shipping the same
week it's officially unveiled and that
Samsung is kicking the 16 gig version to
the curb with the base model coming with
32 gigs of internal storage now Sandoval
has a pretty good track record but do
remember that nothing has been confirmed
yet in news from the saw that coming
department the ubuntu edge campaign on
indiegogo ended earlier this week and
while it raised a record-breaking 12
million eight hundred thirteen thousand
five hundred and one dollars that wasn't
even half of the projects 32 million
dollar goal that's the bad news the good
news is that if you back the project at
least you get your money back though it
wasn't successful this whole thing did
raise awareness of the idea of an ubuntu
phone and canonical CEO Mark
Shuttleworth hasn't ruled out trying to
do bun to phone again in the future good
luck but don't quit your day job mark oh
wait that kind of is his day job the new
Nexus 7 which might as well be called
the Nexus eight if you follow the same
naming scheme as the whole Nexus 5 thing
got an update Friday that hopes to solve
two serious issues with the device the
first is a GPS issue that was affecting
over fifty percent of our readers with
the updated Nexus
seven according to a poll on our site
the other is a problem with multi-touch
so have you got the update yet how's it
working for you let us know and that
wraps it up for this week if you're
looking for more details or if you just
plain like to read a written companion
