on everybody and we want to talk about
smartwatches for a second now
smartwatches are still kind of a tough
category to describe because there's so
many of them out there and thanks to
Android where we have so many of them
that range from the incredibly expensive
and gaudy to the easily accessible and
affordable and unfortunately we can't
really think of anyone Android wear
watch that any of us here at Android
authority really truly love there's kind
of a reason for that aside from the look
of the watch that you might be buying
the experience of Android wear is
largely the same across the board you
have a lot of functions available in
Android wear even some watches that are
able to take calls and also respond to
messages be Notification centers and
there are sporty ones that rock GPS
heart rate monitors and finally NFC is
available for things like Android pay
and that's where the tick watch came in
powered by a custom version of Android
mahboy hoped to separate themselves from
the rest of the Android wear devices by
providing a different experience that
included one impressive quirk a
touch-sensitive panel over on the side
that you could tickle in order to scroll
through all of the elements inside of
the SmartWatch me personally I'm always
a proponent of more input methods
especially on smartwatches so you don't
have to rely on just the screen to do
everything well with this tick watch was
able to carve out its own little space
in the world of smartwatches that has
become incredibly saturated but with the
latest edition of the tick watch family
the affordability of the device became
the priority and with that mob boy put
Android wear into their tick watch the
result is this the take watch s and the
tick watch e now before we even get to
any other portion of the design we have
to say that the tickle portion the
touch-sensitive panel is not available
on these versions of the tick watch
which is a bit of a bummer because for a
device called tick watch there are a
couple of expectations and that is
actually one of them the change to
Android wears a whole different story
that we'll get to later but for now just
note that the tick watch S and the tick
watch e are pretty much all screen all
the time with the exception of the
button over on the left our review units
came in very particular colors the tick
watch s came in this very loud a yellow
green mixture of sorts and unfortunately
the tick watch s already started to show
signs of wear and tear even after just a
few days of usage while out in Hawaii
the ComTech summit now there's some
obvious pitfalls to having a device that
looks like this after all it doesn't
really blend in very well with the
outfit I have on right now it usually
works more for casual and even sporty
looks like this there that's more like
it
so obviously the tick watch s works
better with the Wardrobe like this and
if you're wearing a tie and maybe like a
suit jacket this watch is just gonna
stick out like a sore thumb but then
again that's the reason why you have
something like the tick watch e which
looks like this
there you go this is the matte black
version of it and there are a couple of
other ones available in the tick watch
family of the e devices but this matte
black one actually blends in with pretty
much any wardrobe and at the same time
it does still come with GPS and a heart
rate monitor so you can still do some of
the fitness stuff so that means that
this watch will blend in better with
casual clothing and with other wardrobes
like the one I had earlier you might
notice that we're not really showing the
tick watch E as much in this video and
that's because this happened to it just
a couple of days into our recent trip
the watch too started spazzing out as
far as I know there wasn't any wear and
tear or any major bumps that happened
with the watch the screen just started
to flicker and it had a permanent
version of an Android wear card at the
bottom so unfortunately the tick watch
he was not the watch that we would be
able to use continuously for our review
so you might want to take that into
consideration when it comes to the price
point of the tick watch e in particular
it is the cheaper one of the two devices
and based upon the price point you might
want to remember that your mileage may
vary in terms of the QA on these devices
both the tick watch S and the tick watch
E have the same specifications for the
most part across the board the tick
watch a simply has its GPS inside of the
units while the tick watch s puts the
antenna inside of the proprietary bands
and both also Rock the same display so
despite the tick watch these problems
the tick watch s shows us that the 1.4
inch OLED display works quite well for
Android wear and since it's an LED panel
it's able to do always-on display
capabilities without taking up extra
battery the rest of the specifications
are also the same including mediatek
processors that work well even after
weeks of usage and four gigabytes of
on-board storage if you want to put
music files in there and listen to them
without needing your phone around mob
voice-o-matic any cellular cabe
in order to extend battery life and they
say that it would get up to two days
we got about 1.5 days but we felt like
we had to charge it nightly just to be
sure that we didn't run out of battery
in any middle of the day so what makes
the s different from the e is mainly
just its looks and where the GPS antenna
is located because both still have heart
rate monitors and you can also get
pretty much the same experience when it
comes to health applications in either
device the health application is very
Apple watch esque with its circular
designs but it does do a good job of
counting calories steps it is also good
for doing sleep tracking but I use sleep
as Android the app in Android wear in
order to do that overall it does a fine
job of general fitness tracking and it's
nice to have these tools available on a
SmartWatch whenever you do kind of want
to check your vitals or at least track
what you're doing but with Android wear
you get an experience that is very
similar to a lot of other Android wear
devices they take watch s and they take
watch e are very affordable but they're
not that much cheaper than other devices
in its same category but the tick watch
S and I take watch she do come with the
latest version of Android wear which
come with in all of the different
features like different applications
also gestures and overall just to a
slightly more refined design to the
Android wear that we think needs a
complete overhaul but it begs the
question as to who really wants a
SmartWatch like this after all they kind
of reflect their price points the
all-plastic designs of the two that we
got kind of make us think that these are
more like toy watches rather than true
timepieces
but again the price point is meant to
reflect that and at 1:59 for the tick
watch e and $1.99 for the tick watch s
it's basically coming down to whether or
not you have ever used a SmartWatch
before if you never have and you don't
want to use up too much of your money on
any one SmartWatch this might be the one
for you you can get into Android wear
pretty easily thanks to mob boy and
their take watch family even if what we
loved about previous tick watches no
longer is the case here so will this be
your first SmartWatch with the original
tick watches that recommendation was a
bit easier to make because the tick
watches were actually a bit unique
compared to the rest now you just have
an easy way of getting into Android wear
and if you just want to get your feet
wet in a new form of tech well this
might be one of the easiest places to do
it as always thank you guys very much
for watching and we hope you enjoyed
this video on the tick watch as in the
tick watch
if by the end of 2017 you're still
looking for a SmartWatch that you don't
have to really spend a whole lot on and
it has a very low point of entry well
this just might be it so keep it tuned
to Andrew authority for more on this and
all wearables and you can keep it tuned
here for also all of our coverage of CES
as it is going to be happening in just
under three weeks keep you tuned here
