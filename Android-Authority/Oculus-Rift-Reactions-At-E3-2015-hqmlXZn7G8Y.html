authority and we are still here at e3 it
is the last day and we just got a chance
to take a look at oculus rift and we
just wanted to give you guys our
impressions or reactions of it rather
and I'm joined by one of our writers
here andrew grush and we're just going
to kind of riff and talk about it and
give you guys our thoughts so I'll just
kind of go ahead and go over a little
bit so this is my first time trying
oculus rift and I got to try project
Morpheus yesterday but today is my first
time trying oculus rift and I got to
play a game called of Eve Valkyrie and
we're basically a pilot inside of a
plane and it's actually pretty cool so
it's very immersive but I don't
necessarily feel like I'm actually
completely in the game it just kind of
feels like it's just right in my face
but I'm inside of a large large aircraft
and I'm shooting other players that are
flying around it was kind of really hard
to play just because I I don't know I
guess because it's my first time and
just shooting these other airplanes that
are flying around because it's kind of
really difficult to control so I
probably would have needed a lot more
time to just gain some experience and be
able to aim better and just get the hang
of the controls better but it was a
really cool experience I thought
graphically it looked really good you
are able to notice some pixels but I
definitely would say that it was a lot
sharper than what i saw on project
Morpheus but both of them I would say
they're pretty much the same as far as
the performance and the responsiveness
of it all it was a really great
experience so but what about you grush
what did you think about your experience
with oculus rift well this is your first
time checking it out yeah before this
all I mess around with was the gear VR
and comparatively this just blows it
away i was i was so impressed i checked
it out to edge of nowhere and basically
you start out in the Arctic setting and
you're just it's kind of has an eerie
theme and the
you're looking around if you have to
jump from platform to platform things
are crumbling as you're going past and
then as you get further in you start
like seeing like dead bodies you start
hearing like noises and then ice
climbing down this ladder at one point
and I call some of these like I don't
know what there's some kind of monster I
don't know and then they start coming
down at you and it's a really intense
game I'm like still like it was it was
amazing yeah I could definitely tell by
your reactions when you're playing it
that you're kind of getting really into
it so I jumped out of my seat at one
point when one of those things came
behind me it's like what the heck is
that you know and yeah you felt like I I
do agree it isn't like you don't fully
feel there you are in front I mean you
know this was not a first-person game
was a third person for one thing but
it's still a very different feel than
like a traditional playing I'm like you
know compared to my ps4 or whatever you
know it's a huge difference yeah it
definitely is very different like the
game that I was playing it was it was
first person so I guess I felt a little
bit more involved but again it just kind
of feels like I'm just seeing everything
closer and not necessarily feeling like
I'm completely in that world and I don't
know about you but I was actually still
able to see a little bit through the
bottom of it I could see my actual hands
so I don't know if you had that problem
a little bit yeah just just like a
little bit but everybody just be a bit
issue you know the way I have classes
well so do you and so I pushed out the
headset maybe a little more I don't know
yeah on top of the glyph fits glass is
just fine it was pretty glass friendly
but it's definitely not hair friendly
I'll say that so I kind of had like a
Wolverine look at least that's what Josh
was saying and josh is behind the camera
right now how did you feel about it Josh
he's actually periscoping so I've good
at scoping my reactions right now to it
um so the beat I did have that problem a
little bit where I had the just a little
bit of light coming through on the
bottom I will admit that that was a bit
of the issue but while you had a first
person perspective you had a third
person perspective than Emma more of an
action sense I had two straight a
platformer I played what was called
Chronos and Chronos you just had a
character running around some monsters
and
you're able to fight them with your
sword it was a little bit it reminds me
a little bit of like what's that one
game on ps2 that was that one game
because there was a way like a shadow
the Colossus it was a little bit like
shadow of the colossus and but on a
smaller scale but the thing about it was
instead of a first-person perspective
where you're seeing and everything's
coming at you it's more about depth it
would imagine watching The Avengers and
you were able to see that people were
really far away but you could see what
was near you in the imax 3d this is a
little bit more like that it wasn't like
the Hulk running at you it was more like
those wide scenes you're inside this big
like stone temple and you can look
around and actually see the details you
can tell that there's real depth between
the different columns and stuff like
that so that was the thing and then when
the big boss came out that was a way and
it got kind of funny because you run
away from the big boss and then his hand
comes out and that was the first time it
was like whoa he's trying to grab me but
the gameplay was good I do think the
resolution could use a bump up but
that's that that's the truth about all
these vr platforms to be honestly um but
all know it's a good experience but you
know justice just my opinion I would
equate oculus in the same vein as a lot
of the other VR platforms where it's
still just a it's still just a regular
gaming experience just made better with
depth and 3d rather than like a fully
like immersive experience well this has
just been our quick reactions of oculus
rift and hopefully you guys enjoyed this
