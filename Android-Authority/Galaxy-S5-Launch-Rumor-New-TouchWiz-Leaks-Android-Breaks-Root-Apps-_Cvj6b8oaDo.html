welcome back to android weekly my name
is Jason we cover Android news in these
parts and boy do we have some goodies
for you in the form of galaxy s5 rumor
but I know what you're thinking yeah
whatever Jace a badly photoshopped phone
does not a rumor make yeah but what if
that photo showed no signs of
manipulation and the official
announcement for the galaxy s5 was
leaked by a blogger who is correct last
year about the galaxy x 4 yeah getting
so excited I'm having trouble
controlling my inner geek catch it hey
if women can gush on puppies I can gush
on a phone and what I'm excited about is
the fact that a blogger named elder
mertes in I hope I'm not butchering your
name too bad older but he claims that
the Samsung Galaxy s5 will be officially
announced on sunday februari 23rd at 6pm
a day before the Mobile World Congress
interesting you see for those of you
paying attention when a company like
samsung announces a flagship phone they
traditionally like to do it at a
standalone event they don't want to do
it anymore at these big conferences like
CSI mobile or Congress because it's
really hard to get above the noise and
be distinguished between all the other
competitors out there so why would they
do it at day before well I thought that
was a masterful stroke of marketing
because if they do in a day before what
all the press are at that you know in
Barcelona ready and primed to report on
phones every other phone that is
released or announced at the Mobile
World Congress will immediately have to
be compared to the Samsung Galaxy s5
pretty smart now last year elder
predicted the launch of the samsung
galaxy s4 almost to the day which gives
a lot of credibility to his claim as a
reminder the samsung galaxy s5 rumored
specs are a 5.25 inch 2k display a
snapdragon 800 chipset and the three
gigs of ram so yes let's talk about that
new TouchWiz which is the other half of
this rumor we've heard lots of stirrings
about a new TouchWiz and we've seen some
graphic
from last week but this most recent
graphic is very Google now ask it looks
like these cards would live in the home
screen and users would be able to swipe
up and down to go through them we see
some cards that are found on Google now
such as flights deliveries and events
however there are also cards for home
automation fitness social stairs and
messages overall the UI looks like a
combination between Google now and n
Notification Center moving on in news
about android root breakage oh boy
according to well-known developer
chainfire the next version of android
could be bringing a change that will
stop you from accessing your favorite
root apps now of course such a move
would make many of us so angry we'd want
to give birth but you should know this
was not meant to be an attack on root
apps but an attempt to improve security
a recent addition to the android open
source project master tree has been
spotted that will prevent apps from
extracting files to the directories
located on the data partition and then
executing them as root the idea here is
that it could prevent some malicious
programs from executing scripts on the
data partition and furthermore it's
unclear whether this change will be
added to the next version of android or
not and so last up is the rumor that the
nexus 5 would now be available in
various colors not just in black and
white so the fruity among us could enjoy
some banana strawberry and blueberry
phones thanks for watching android peeps
and i thought today I would do something
completely different and find out who
actually watches this portion of the
show and how effective I have been and
teaching you about Android so your
homework is the following find out how
you can use Android to translate this in
just a few seconds it's been I'm in fits
a child on each come out Toronto for
stage to me the spout in the comments
below on twitter on google+ give me the
translation tell me what i said and i
will give you a tribute and this week's
Q&amp;amp;A
