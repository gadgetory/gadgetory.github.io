name is Kevin aka the tech ninja and
today I'm reviewing the Moga pro gaming
controller for Android devices the first
question you should ask yourself is how
often do you game on your Android device
whether it's a tablet or a phone some
games can be tough to play due to the
lack of controller well here comes the
Moga pro mobile gaming system it is
created by the mobile company and their
slogan is game on anywhere this is the
pro version of the controller which
retails for about $50 it comes with a
flexible arm internal batteries that
charge via USB and also a folding tablet
stand this controller also works with
any device that is running Android 2.3
or higher the controller is mixed
between an Xbox 360 and a PlayStation 3
controller the middle of the controller
tucks away the flexible arm which comes
out to about a 90 degree angle
this exposes the power switch and the a
and B mode more on that later the header
logs are tight and are clickable the
surface buttons are firm on the left
side there is an additional analog and
standard D pad and the Bluetooth sync
button the grips on the controller are
well done and provides a comfortable
feel on the back of the controller we
have a USB connector for charging and
top shoulder buttons and two triggers
the tablet standing folds and a
kickstand comes out and allows you to
place a tablet on it for viewing not a
requirement but nevertheless it's a very
nice touch and I found myself using it
with other devices as well the companion
software which is called the Moga pivot
it walks you through how to sync the
device it gives very clear and specific
instructions not only does it get your
controller connected but it also acts as
a controller compatible play store these
are games that mogul confirms work but I
can assure you there are plenty of more
games that are not in the store that
indeed work some games require your
controller to be in different modes some
games require a mode and some games
require B mode simply flip the switch
under the arm and you're back in
business
in my several hours of gaming the
controller was extremely quick
and responsive the triggers have a
perfect amount of give and the analogs
were fine-tuned for precise movements as
far as controls it felt comparable to
console gaming there was little to no
adjustment period for me to use the
controller
I honestly synced the controller within
two minutes and I hopped into a game the
small issue that I have is that the
start and select buttons aren't a very
hard to reach location I understand that
this may be the only location for it but
it's just difficult for me to reach my
fingers up that high and I have pretty
big hands so the question that was posed
to you in the beginning how often do you
game on your Android device well getting
a controller that provides counsel like
control change your mind let me know
what you think below are to answer one
more question the note 3 unfortunately
does not fit miss controller but
remember you can always use the tablet
holder for any device as well so it
doesn't have to sit on top here but my
lg g2 does fit without an issue at all
just some food for thought once again my
name is Kevin aka the tech ninja you can
find me on YouTube and Google+ and
hopefully you subscribe to android
authority for more great videos because
we are your source for everything
