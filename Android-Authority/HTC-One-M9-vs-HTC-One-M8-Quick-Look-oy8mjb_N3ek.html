this a look at the HTC One m9 and its
earlier brethren the HTC One m8 is
Joshua card from Android authority and
here's your quick look in this versus
video if you happen to be one of the
people that wanted a much different
design in the HTC One m9 well HTC opted
to follow the m8 and the m7 s design
almost to a tee putting the two together
in order to create a whole new DNA and
of sorts whether that's good or bad
depends on how you feel about the m8 and
the m7 but you're going to get elements
of both in the brand-new one m9 because
this two-tone coloration not only has a
different hue on the rim as you can see
in this gold rimmed version of the
silver edition of the HTC One m9 but
you'll see that the elements also
include a shell of sorts that comes from
the back comes over to the sides and
then it tapers in to provide the front
panel that concave is a little bit into
the sides and it also makes the device a
lot easier to grip especially
considering the rear the back rather the
hoos material is definitely not as
slippery as was found in the HTC One m8
now the biggest design difference
between the two phones is going to be
the camera module on the back because
the one m9 features a squared camera
module that is protruding slightly out
but is much larger than the camera found
in the One m8 and as because of a 20
megapixel larger sensor on the m9 which
we'll get into a little bit later
HTC also gave up on the depth sensor
from the m8 and relocated the power
button to the side which is an ahkam
change you no longer get a dual camera
on the top but you also don't get that
power button on the top either but if
the designs of the phones were very
similar the displays are downright
identical both feature Full HD
resolution in a 5-inch package ensuring
a very crisp experience and while
competitors are adopting quad HD HTC is
content with full HD for now
but the only real difference between
these two displays is the fact that the
m9 at least in our testings thus far
shows a much cooler temperature compared
to the warmer colors of the m8 the one
m9 is one of the first devices to be
powered by the new Snapdragon 810 chip
by qualcomm featuring eight cores and
64-bit architecture HTC also upgraded
the memory to three gigabytes of RAM
and storage stays at 32 gigabytes though
it will be expanded by microSD cards if
you so choose and on the other hand last
year's ma was not really that far behind
with its snapdragon 801 and two
gigabytes of ram but the real story here
is that sense 7 the new version of cents
on the HTC One m9 absolutely flies
through its elements even with a couple
of the added elements that they put into
this new version of HTC Sense as you can
see in this little video right here I'm
really trying to multitask and go pretty
nuts on the head sense 7 interface here
and it is able to keep up with me
without any problems and in camera HTC
is going back to a conventional camera
sensor on the m9 but if you do miss the
ultra pixel camera has been brought over
to the front in order to bring great
self-portraits to the fray nonetheless
though the 20 megapixel rear facing
camera is supposed to bring a lot of
good enhancements to the camera
experience from the m8 but in our
testing so far we have seen that it's a
little bit uneven low-light performance
on ultrapixels already proving itself on
the m9 in its front facing iteration and
it did do a bit better of a job on the
m8 from last year but the 20 pinnacle
pixel rear-facing optics on the m9 do
have a bit of a troublesome time trying
to get low-light performance but
ultimately you do get some good shots
out in broad daylight but it's in the
low light situations that we do have
some problems and even the grainy
results coming from the video now we do
have to preface this by saying that the
m9 will get a software update in order
to fix the camera issues as we were told
so we are going to hold our reservations
until we get that particular software
update in our review units in the coming
weeks and finally in software you want
to really be blamed if you saw these
cents on the m9 I thought it was much
like the one on the m8 afterall a lot of
the elements do remain the same despite
the lollipop additions which you will
already see in the notification
drop-down and in the recent apps screen
if you choose to use the card view but
there are a few main additions to the m9
that we went through in our first look
and it conclude they include rather the
Sense home widget that is a contextual
app launcher up front that will change
the apps that it shows you based on your
GPS location it's kind of a nice
interface that allows you to get your
apps pretty easily but it's also nice
that it's just a widget so you can put
it away if you really don't want it then
that the theme engine is really probably
the biggest part of sense that we really
like already and even in this first
iteration it is a nice way of starting
off a theming engine on what was
originally just changing colors in the
m8 this time around you can change a lot
of aspects of the operating system even
going as far as putting a picture inside
ideally your chosen wallpaper and it
will analyze the picture in order for
you to find the right colors to change
the elements in order to match that
wallpaper but all in all you do get a
very similar experience from one to the
other and whether or not these two
devices are really a big step from one
to the other is going to be up to you to
decide and we will go through a much
fuller versus video once we get our
hands on a review unit of the m9 to
bring you our assessment of that very
question but nonetheless we do like what
the m9 brings to the table it is a more
refining of the design inside and out
from HTC where the only real weak spot
at the moment is in the camera and if
you used the m8 from last year you liked
what it was able to do with its camera
well that is exactly what we're going to
really find out in our future comparison
if the cameras really show a big
improvement but until then keep it into
Android authoritative in more coverage
of the HTC One m9 and remember to keep
it tuned here for even more coverage of
the Mobile World Congress 2015 in
Barcelona Spain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
