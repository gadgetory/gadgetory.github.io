everything you see it when you turn on
your phone you see it when your phone
slows down due to crap where it's a
prison for your phone well it is control
specifically carrier and manufacturers
control so if you hate TouchWiz HTC sent
or any of the number the crap were apps
that carriers force onto your device and
you can't delete the solution to that is
to hack the matrix or in today's terms
we route our phone but before we get
into the benefits of rooting your phone
let's first talk about why you should
not root your phone so the number one
reason not to root your phone is this
that's right your warranty if you root
your phone you gotta say goodbye to it
so that means that if you legitimately
wanted to make a claim on your warranty
because the manufacturer did something
wrong with the phone you can't make that
claim anymore because rooting it
completely voids the warranty
now the second big reason not to root
your phone is that you run the risk of
breaking it grandma you're like talking
to a brick wall but we should clarify
something really important here rooting
your phone is normally very safe no
problem with rooting your phone it's
when you root the phone and then flash a
custom roam on the phone like paranoid
Android or CyanogenMod which potentially
can run a risk and we refer to that as
bricking your phone because if done
improperly and the worst case scenario
happens the only thing you could use
your phone is for a brick now the third
and final major reason not to root your
phone is that there is an increased
security risk that a virus could infect
your phone so if you can live with those
caveats here's the great reasons to root
your phone now when you root your phone
you have what's called super user access
you
get to the deepest aspects of Android
you're able to control things that
Android wouldn't normally allow you to
control and one of the things that you
can do is remove bloatware crap where
all the apps that you don't want gone
number two reason to route your phone is
that you can free up your phone's memory
by putting apps on your SD card yes if
you root your phone that is something
you can do now one of the major reasons
to root your phone is that you can flash
a custom ROM and completely change the
user experience with your phone
CyanogenMod paranoid android those are
the two of the most popular roms but
there are hundreds of roms out there and
you can customize and tweak and tell
your heart's content and for you
tweakers out there for you geeks who
just love to tweak and twiddle this is
for you
there are fantastic options when you
want to flash a custom ROM all right so
it's decision making time to root or not
to root is rooting best for you well in
my experience I think you can break down
Android lovers to two kinds one is the
Android enthusiasts and the second is
the Android geek and the Android
enthusiasts loves Android they love to
buy the latest greatest Android phone
they keep up to date on Android apps
they may even watch YouTube videos about
Android but they don't cross the routing
threshold I'm an Android enthusiast I've
rooted my phone in the past because I
wanted to access apps that required root
but I never flashed the custom ROM
because I didn't really need to and now
that I have the Nexus 5 stock Android I
love it it's more than enough for me it
provides all the tweaking that I need
but Android geeks and there's a lot of
them they like xda-developers comments
this has millions of Android geeks there
they love to tweak it's a hobby ok they
love to tweak and twiddle little tiny
insignificant things to the average user
but to them it means a lot those who log
the xposed framework for example just
can go on for hours about what they can
do what they can't do the explosive
framework there's a whole world of
Android for those of you who want to
root your phones there's endless
possibilities but to the average user
those are insignificant little tweaks
but tanana greek they love it so let me
know in the comments below
are you and Andrew an enthusiast or an
Android geek what do you think do you
want to root or not
are you routing is your phone routed I'd
love to hear about it thanks for
watching Android army my name is Jace
love to connect with you write to you on
Google+ or Twitter now you should know
if you don't know already that this is a
four part series about the great leap
forward in each one of these Android Q&amp;amp;A
shows I have a clean a tiny little clue
maybe big clue you don't know but it's a
hidden clue about what I believe is the
next big leap forward for Android now
what you think is the next big leap
forward but what I think the next big
leap forward is and if you can take all
those four clues at least four clues or
maybe more and conclude about what I
believe that next big leap forward is
you could potentially win a $50 Google
Play gift card so keep searching I'm
reading all the comments below talk to
you on the next android Q&amp;amp;A</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
