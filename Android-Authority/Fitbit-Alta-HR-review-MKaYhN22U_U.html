entry-level fitness trackers before will
know exactly what to expect from the
fitbit of the HR simply put this is the
fitbit alta plus heartrate monitor what
that means if you're getting a device it
is great for active users and it will
reliably track steps taken sleep quality
and basic activities it has one of the
best Pat ecosystems out there and a
solid design that's comfortable to wear
however this is not a device meant for
serious athletes or even anyone with
more than a passing interest in running
or other activities such as CrossFit for
those casual users it is a likeable and
well-made tracker it is worthy of your
consideration
I'm Adam Schmidt ski let's turn the
tables who see just how fit to the
purpose the Fitbit ultra HR is in terms
of appearance this device barely
deviates from the Fitbit alter that came
before it it's a slim tracker that blend
into its strap it has a simple black
screen that requires a firm tap to
activate and scroll through and this is
the only input that the hey child will
recognize and it's not particularly
sensitive they get annoying quickly you
can also turn the screen on to check the
time by bringing your wrist up to your
face this works about 80% of the time
the strap has been updated since the
last generation of alters now use more
conventional and less fiddly locking
systems which is welcome the other big
news is that you can swap out the straps
to find the one that best suits your
personal style or lack thereof and yes
it is backwards compatible with the
alter meaning it can try all the fancy
leather and metal tracks that are
already out there
yalta HR is comfortable to wear it
doesn't get in the way much and it's
certainly a welcome break from my bulky
beaver active HR it's visible enough to
say hey I track my health but not
ostentatious enough to draw unwanted
attention
battery life is fairly middling and
although it claims it can manage seven
days I've found mine tend to start
running low at around five
I've seen better from far more feature
pack devices but it's long enough to not
to be an issue for most use case
scenarios the charger is proprietary so
don't lose it but it's easy enough to
use and charge it fairly quickly there
are some very basic SmartWatch features
here specifically you can receive
notifications on your wrist as with most
of the trackers these days as well as
calls and calendar reminders
notifications are limited to just a few
apps though and messages are truncated
even when you choose the maximum links
for them in the settings after they
eclipse appeared there's no way of
getting them back to see the messages
you miss it's nice not having to get
your phone out to see who texted you or
who's calling but that's as far as it
goes could not buy this as a SmartWatch
but this device is all about the fitness
tracking earlier I described the ideal
user for this device as being passive
not particularly accurate thing is
nearly everything that Fitbit Alta does
happens on down low step counting of
course happens in the background is
pretty accurate for the most part the so
dude is most of the activity tracking
that is to say that you don't tell the
old HR that you're going for a run or
engaging in sports rather it will try to
detect it on its own you do have the
option to start a walk hike or run if
you wanted to sync with the GPS though
there's no way to manually begin other
activities specifically the Fitbit Alta
HR can automatically identify and track
walks runs outdoor bike the elliptical
machine aerobic workouts in sport as an
entry level fitness tracker
there is no GPS built in here there's no
water resistance this time either unlike
the Flex - so Swimming's off the cards
there's also no way to track weight
training which for me is a big letdown
looking at the Fitbit during a workout
also doesn't provide any useful
information
fortunately the algorithm here called
smart track because why not
appears fairly impressive in keeping
with the other purpose I've tried out
only now it has the added benefit of a
heart rate monitor for even better
accuracy it can successfully auto detect
the bike rides and runs which never
ceases to amaze that said it's not
infallible
I recently use some edge trim is to cut
the grass around the edge of my lawn for
instance and the all thr recorded app is
a bike ride the heart rate monitor
provides an interesting additional
metric for your workouts but it's not as
accurate as more sports oriented
trackers during training and it doesn't
provide a particularly detailed
breakdown after activity either rather
it mainly can be useful as a way to
track your heart rate throughout the day
and to provide you the score for your
resting heart rate this is a useful
measure of overall fitness and a nice
addition to have if you're dedicated to
your dream sessions and runs you'll be
able to see your fitness improve over
time you can also check your current
heart rate at any time during the day
and the heart rate monitoring should
result in a slightly more accurate total
your daily calories burned as well the
heart rate wanted to also ensure that
users can take advantage of the new and
improved sleep tracking which now breaks
our sleep down into four distinct stages
awake REM light and deep this is
possibly the best implementation i've
yet to experience with sleep tracking
it's accurate in my testing and the
additional information is very welcoming
useful i'm actually gonna miss this when
i stop using the old HR and it really is
well done oh and there's also movement
reminders which are pretty much a part
of the course these days although it's
nice touch from the device challenges
you to feed it 170 steps the big bonus
of using any Fitbit device though with
the software the Android app remains one
of the most intuitive and useful of any
fitness tracking solution on the Play
Store and there's fantastic support and
integration from a wide range of other
services ranging from Alexa and IFTTT to
My Fitness Pal
insights the useful and the badges and
messages are generally motivating
the popularity of picnic is also a big
plus here as it means you'll be much
more likely to be able to find friends
compete with I've been challenging my
wife with the weekend warrior challenge
which has been a fun way to encourage a
few more steps out of a space do your
fear what you'll get when you mess with
the warrior so the big question is
whether or not the typical thr can
improve your health and help you lose
weight the answer that is yes if you
diligently track your calories consumed
in calories burn then make sure to
maintain the deficit you should see
daily weight loss the heart rate monitor
will only help to make that calculation
more accurate and the automatic activity
tracking your screen list is personally
useful less driven users will likewise
benefit from the ability to track run
and monitor their sleep and resting
heart rate as they say that which is
monitored improves that's it
those looking for full Smart Watch
features or who are more serious about
their training should look elsewhere for
something that comes with more precise
and fully featured activity tracking
I'll be speaking with my vivoactive HR
just as a lot to debate the Cal soccer
but it falls short of being at all
sports tracker there's nothing
particularly new or exciting about a
Fitbit Alta HR this is literally alter
but with a heart rate monitor thrown in
for good measure that heart rate monitor
makes a big difference and opens up a
lot more possibilities sleep tracking
and for calorie counting its refinement
rather than true innovation that's often
what yields the best and most reliable
technology you pay a little more Fitbit
as compared with other similar products
from other manufacturers but in exchange
you get a reliable brand of thriving
ecosystem it's nice to we're good at
what it does and has a decent amount of
features for basic health tracking and
light activity tracking if you're a
casual user looking to collect a little
data about your health and maybe shed a
few pounds in the Fitbit also HR is a
fairly comprehensive and very reliable
choice so hope you found that
interesting in mutual guides thanks very
