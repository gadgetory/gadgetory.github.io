when you sign up today i hope everybody
had a great fourth of july and for our
neighbors upstairs a great canada day
today we're talking about the next big
release by LG the upcoming moto x
android 4.3 and some sad news regarding
the HTC One S hey Josh regard for man
Joe Thornton what's going on everybody
and it's time for another dose of the
week's top Android news it's android
authority weekly and exciting new
releases on the horizon with rumors
circulating regarding the next LG
flagship phone the LG g2 aptly named
because the company has dropped the
Optimus name is looking to break new
ground with the inclusion of the
snapdragon 800 processor and an
unheard-of 3 gigabytes of ram well we
first thought to be a 5-inch screen
device was then later updated by a
report that stated that the phone would
be coming with a 5.2 inch display now
that's not really that big of an
increase but it is a new development
obviously all of this information is
still just speculation as the device has
yet to be officially announced speaking
of that snapdragon 800 that will be
included in the LG g2 it got the
benchmark treatment this week in the LTE
a version of the samsung galaxy s4 tests
were done and the device itself did hold
up against its competitors the
snapdragon 800 performed very well
supporting claims that the processor
would be giving even more performance
with lesser power consumption we're
going to have to see how it goes with
the upcoming devices that it will be
included in and now I move on to the
Moto X the long fabled phone coming out
of google acquired motorola this was a
big week for marketing for motorola as
ad started to appear in US magazine
stating that the Moto X would be made
and manufactured entirely in the USA and
more importantly have a very high level
of customization well this week we also
learned what that means ABC News learned
that buyers of the Moto X will be able
to customize the phone with different
colors on multiple parts of the phone as
well as have an optional engraving that
is put on the back of the device also
you can upload a picture to the website
that will then be used for the installed
wallpaper on the
phone screen a sign-up page has been
created on the motor world of website
allowing people to sign up if they want
more information on the Moto X as it
becomes available now you can't do that
but you can also just stay tuned to
android authority for all of the news on
the Moto X don't worry we've got you
covered we move on to Samsung as the
company released sales numbers on the
galaxy s4 this week as of today just a
couple months after the release of the
device Samsung has reportedly sold 20
million units of the galaxy s4 now
that's a pretty crazy number considering
the phone isn't even that old yet so now
the galaxy s4 holds the title of the
fastest selling Android device ever
still unfortunately Samsung can't seem
to catch a break when it comes to market
analysts who are all still very
skeptical about their expectations
that's harsh still it's a milestone that
Samsung hopes to build upon with the
release of their upcoming Galaxy S 4
variants news about Android 4.3
continues to surface since a version of
it was leaked last week it was recently
given the teardown treatment and a lot
of interesting tidbits were found
apparently new notification code was
found that would allow third-party apps
to replicate the notification panel and
give devices that are paired to the
phone or the tablet access to the
notification drop-down perhaps this is
all preparation for the wearable tech
that should be coming later this year
like Google glass and Google's
smartwatches also Google is supposedly
planning with the release of Android 4.3
to release their stock Android apps into
the Google Play Store as we saw last
week with the Google Play editions of
the samsung galaxy s4 and the HTC One
the updated camera app was easily
packaged into an apk and it looks like
that might have been somewhat by design
apparently every core app will make
their way to the Play Store eventually
and thus give users a better way of
creating a stock experience if they're
using a forked version of Android this
way you would be able to get a much more
Nexus like experience without the need
of rooting and flashing custom roms on
your phone and finally regarding Android
4.3 that leaked version that was out
last week has actually been rooted so if
you have a samsung galaxy s4 and you're
feeling a little adventurous go ahead
and back up your data and then head over
to android authority calm to fly
how to get it all things come to an end
and today we end on the unfortunate end
for the HTC One S the member of last
year's flagship group for HTC has been
reportedly dropped from the
much-anticipated update to Android 4.2
and since five users of the one s will
now be left with the less loved since
four and a boiling sense of betrayal
after all HTC did promise this past
februari on facebook that the HTC One S
would be getting the update and as we
all know it's not official unless it's
faceboook official unhappy owners of the
retired phone took swift action and
created a petition that would hopefully
cause HTC to change its ways found on
change.org this petition has a goal of
five thousand supporters and hopes to
make HTC really make these updates
happen for the 1s as of the time of this
filming it is still shy of that five
thousand mark but it does need that last
push to make it so we do have a link
down in the description below if you
wish to head over to the petition and
sign your name and so there you have it
for this edition of android authority
weekly as always a ring companion can be
found for this video in a link in the
description below don't forget to check

authority including our other weekly
show Q&amp;amp;A hosted by chris as for next
