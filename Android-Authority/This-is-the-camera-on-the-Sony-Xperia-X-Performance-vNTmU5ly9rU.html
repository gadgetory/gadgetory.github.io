Authority and today we're going to be
taking a second look at the sony xperia
x performance
more specifically the cameras on the X
performance mainly because this is one
of the stronger points on this phone and
they do offer a lot in terms of image
quality and features now just as a fun
fact this entire segment that you're
watching is being recorded on the
front-facing camera of the sony xperia x
performance so let us know what you
think of the quality down below just to
recap the front camera is a 13 megapixel
shooter and the rear camera is a 23
megapixel camera neither have optical
image stabilization but the rear camera
does come with phase detection autofocus
and a standard single LED flash now
right off the bat one of the first
things that I like about this camera is
that I don't have to have a camera
shortcut on my home screen and that's
because the xperia x performance has a
dedicated camera shutter button
obviously this is something that has
been a staple with Sony phones for a
pretty long time but it's still nice to
see Sony continuing to keep that
physical camera shutter button on their
phones you just hold it down and it will
launch directly into the camera whether
the phone is awake or asleep and it does
it fairly quickly too if you're not too
fond of using that dedicated camera key
you can also use the power button to do
pretty much the same thing the only
thing it won't do is act as a shutter
button but otherwise it'll still launch
the camera from pretty much anywhere
the camera app itself I would say is
pretty easy to use and fairly
straightforward for the most part you
have these standard toggles to flip
between the front and rear cameras on
the upper left and one to control the
LED flash on the bottom right and if you
swipe up and down on the display this
will cycle you through the various
different camera modes like superior
Auto manual video recording and the slew
of Sony camera features which I will
talk about in a second of course you
have your standard on-screen camera
shutter button and right below that is
the camera settings which are more or
less contextual based on what shooting
mode you are in but you can do things
like set a self timer change the
resolution or toggle on HDR one thing I
thought was really odd about HDR mode
which I also mentioned in the full
review is that the toggle is only
available when shooting
in manual to me this feels a little
unintuitive simply because when most
people shoot photos with their
smartphones it's typically in Auto mode
so to me it would have made more sense
to have it available in the superior
auto mode having it buried in the camera
settings also makes it a little slow to
get to so it would have been nice to
have the toggle available directly on
the cameras main interface if you aren't
familiar with how superior auto works
basically it can detect a variety of
different sceneries and subjects such as
macro shots date/time shots nighttime
shots food documents etc and make
adjustments within the camera
automatically to give you the best
looking shot possible or at least what
the camera thinks is the best looking
shot if you'd rather have more controls
over your shots you can switch things
over to manual but the manual mode isn't
quite as good as some manual modes
offered on other smartphones you can
control white balance exposure ISO and
select a specific shooting scenery but
if you're shooting at any resolution
higher than 8 megapixels you'll be
limited to only white balance and
exposure and even those controls have
been kept pretty basic white balance for
example gives you the standard cloudy
tungsten and daylight options instead of
granular controls with actual Kelvin
numbers because this is a Sony phone the
X performance comes jam-packed with
additional camera features most of which
you may already be familiar with if
you've used a Sony Xperia phone before
now I won't go through all of them in
specific but there are a lot here such
as a RF act sound photo style portrait
creative effect sticker creator face in
picture sweet panorama and time shift
video that's only counting the ones that
come pre-installed but if you want even
more there are a slew of extras that are
available for download there are a lot
of fun to play around and experiment
with and one of my personal favorites
definitely has to be AR effect it
doesn't have any real utility to be
honest but you can do a lot of cool
stuff with it like make dinosaurs crawl
all over the place laser shoot from your
eyes where mass and a bunch of other
really cool effects that can make for
some pretty creative looking photos and
videos something to note about these
features however is that you don't want
to get too carried away with them
because they will cause the phone to
overheat and you'll be greeted with a
message telling you the app is going to
close moving on to the actual image
quality I want to start with the front
face
camera at 13 megapixels you've got a lot
of room a zoom and crop which isn't
something you can usually say about most
front-facing cameras the actual quality
of the images have been surprisingly
good and I think most people will be
very pleased with using this camera for
selfies they're well detailed colorful
and vibrant and can pretty much trust it
to take a great photo even if you have a
hard time seeing the display which I ran
into a few times when taking photos
outdoors on a sunny day now if you're
more of the vlogger type you can record
some pretty decent looking video but
despite being a 13 megapixel camera
video recording options do cap out at
1080p and just like many of the other
features that this camera offers video
recording can also make this phone
overheat so it's not exactly the most
ideal phone for vlogging especially if
you're trying to record some extremely
long clips and it's actually overheated
quite a few times already from me
recording this the story is pretty much
the same with the rear camera even
though it's 23 megapixels video
recording tops out at 1080p at 60 frames
but I will say it's pretty good looking
1080p footage the camera focuses quickly
handles exposure well and even though it
doesn't have optical image stabilization
the footage comes out relatively stable
and looks even smoother if you're able
to physically stabilize it with
something like a car mount I've also
been really pleased with the overall
picture quality of the rear camera the
pictures are packed full with detail
especially in well-lit areas or daytime
shots and there's just the right amount
of color and saturation to make the
photos look pleasing to the eye again if
you're in a zooming and cropping you
certainly have a lot of freedom to do
that with such high resolution photos in
low-light the photos are perfectly
usable but you can definitely notice
some noise and softness around the edges
it also has some troubles focusing in
low-light and without optical image
stabilization you'll need to keep the
camera perfectly steady because even the
slightest movement can result in a
blurry shot overall though I do think
the cameras on the X performance is one
of the strongest points of this phone
and even despite some of his issues with
overheating when using the built-in
features or recording video it's a very
enjoyable and fun camera to use and is
pretty reliable in most situations but
that is going to do it guys hopefully
