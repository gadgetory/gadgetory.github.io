by Toyota the updated Galaxy Note 10.1
recently brought an excessively thin
light and well-designed device to the 10
inch market but if you aren't a s-pen
person there is now a tab version
available and it's pro hey it's Josh
vegard from android authority what's
going on everybody and this is the
samsung galaxy tab pro 10.1 now for all
intents and purposes the tab pro 10.1 is
every bit the same as the note 10.1 2014
edition except it doesn't have the S Pen
it still has a nice thin profile that
employs the textured plastic look on the
back allowing for a very nice feeling
device all around that isn't crazy big
like its new bigger sibling 2560 by 1600
resolution is the name of the game for
this new line of tablets and here it
looks every bit as good as the note 10.1
2014 edition screen underneath the
surface is the Snapdragon 800 or the
exitos 5 octa depending on your region 3
gigabytes of RAM and a massive 9500
milliamp hour battery for a good
longevity what the tab pearl can boast
however at least for now is a newly
updated interface while the note 10.1
takes on much of what we've come to
expect from TouchWiz the much-needed
refresh has come to the proline the
magazine you I not only allows you to
make pages made up of grid tiles that
are occupied by a specialty widgets it
now has a very magazine like looking
interface it is actually pretty clean
and definitely functional pricing and
availability are still a little blurry
but the proline should be available
within the next few months one
possibility is the availability of a
premium bundle that includes a lot of
subscription services and software for
both work and play once again this is
josh regard from android authority
reporting to you live from the samsung
tech lounge here at CES 2014 and once
again thank you to toyota for sponsoring
