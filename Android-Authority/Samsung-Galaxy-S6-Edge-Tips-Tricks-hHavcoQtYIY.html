Android authority and the s6 and the s6
edge are slowly making their way into
consumers hands even though the phone is
technically not even out yet but if you
have one or you plan on getting one
you're probably going to be interested
in how to use some of the features that
are available on both of these phones
but today we're gonna focus purely on
the s6 edge but if you're an s6 owner
don't worry we have a separate video
coming for you guys a little bit later
so stay tuned for that but we want to
just focus on the s6 edge and the
features that make it unique and
different so with that being said let's
go ahead and just get right into it this
is tips and tricks for your samsung
galaxy s6 edge
alright so tip number one is how to
switch the edge features from the right
edge to the left edge because by default
it's actually all on the right edge and
that's probably because samsung assumes
that most people use their phones in
their right hand which is probably a
pretty safe assumption but if you use
your phone in your left hand you're
gonna want all those features to be on
the left edge and to be able to change
that up it's actually really simple you
just jump into the settings and look for
edge screen and select that and then
scroll to the very bottom where you're
going to see edge screen position and
select that and this is where you'll
have the option to switch between the
right or the left and like I said it
defaults to the right so go ahead and
change it to the left and then you are
good to go and all of the edge features
will be on the left edge tip number two
has to do with the edge lighting so if
you're not familiar with edge lighting
by now essentially the edge of the
display lights up anytime you have your
phone face down and you receive a call
or a notification you can actually
dismiss it by placing your finger on the
heart rate monitor and this will also
send them a text message a little quick
reply and I believe it says something
along the lines of I can't respond right
now sent from my Samsung Galaxy s6 edge
and you can actually disable this quick
reply if you don't want the person to
know that you just ignored their call
or you can change the message to
something completely different as well
so in order to do that just jump into
the settings and go to the edge screen
settings just like before and then just
tap on edge lighting and you will see an
option for quick reply and this is where
you can either disable the function
altogether or you can change the message
to say whatever it is you want
moving on to tip number three and that
is the people edge and how to set them
up so the people edge allows you to have
five of your favorite or most frequent
contacts and you can easily access them
by swiping on the little tab that
appears on the upper portion of the
display and in order to set them up you
can actually do this in one of two ways
you can either jump directly into the
People edge settings or you can just do
it right from the edge display itself
either way that you want to do it is
perfectly fine but actually find it a
little bit easier to do it from the edge
display itself so all you have to do is
tap on one of the empty slots and it
should take you directly into your
contacts application where you can
select whoever it is that you want to
select whether it's mom or dad or your
friends or your family whoever it is
that you want to put you can put them
onto your people edge and you just
repeat those steps over and over until
you have filled up all five of those
slots and you can also rearrange them in
any order that you like if you don't
like the order that you have them
initially and you can just do this by
long-pressing on a contact and dragging
them up and down along the edge or you
can do this again by jumping right into
the people edge settings and doing it
from there
you can also assign individual colors to
each contact from within the people edge
settings and these colors will actually
coordinate with the edge lighting so for
example if you assign purple to one of
your contacts the edge lighting will
actually light up purple anytime you
receive a call or notification from them
tip number four is how to set up
information stream and information
stream gives you little tidbits of
information that you can easily access
by swiping across the edge of the
display when the screen is turned off
and in order to set this feature up you
have to jump into the edge screen
settings once again
and from here you can actually manage
your individual feeds so you can have
different things like Twitter Yahoo News
sports scores and even they feed for
your own missed calls and you can also
download additional feeds if you'd like
but as of right now the options are
pretty limited but you can expect this
list to grow as time goes on and from
here you can also set the duration from
as low as 15 seconds all the way up to
10 minutes and you can also make some
adjustments to the weather here as well
as to how often you want to weather to
refresh and whether you want the weather
to be in Celsius or in Fahrenheit and
various other different weather settings
our fifth and final tip has to do with
the night clock and this is a pretty
self-explanatory feature but this
essentially allows you to use the edge
as a night clock and in order to set
this feature up you just go into the
edge green settings go into night clock
and from here you can set the duration
as to when you want it to turn on and
when you want it to turn off and one
thing to keep in mind is that you only
have a 12 hour maximum so if you plan on
sleeping any longer than that you're
pretty much Sol but once you have the
time set you're pretty much good to go
and it'll turn on when it's supposed to
and it'll turn off without you having to
do anything and there you have it guys
