the market for a dual-sim phone
your choices are fairly limited is the
samsung galaxy grand duos the phone for
you find out in our review while dual
SIM phones aren't that popular in North
America they're much more so in the rest
of the world
the problem is finding a dual SIM phone
with some higher-end features can be
pretty tough let's find out if the
galaxy grand duos is up to the task
starting with the specs the samsung
galaxy grand duos packs in a 1.2
gigahertz dual-core processor 5-inch
mobile WVGA display one gig of ram and 8
gigs of internal storage expandable via
microSD its rear camera is 8 megapixels
and capable of recording 1080p video
while the front shooter is 2 megapixels
and records 480p video powering it all
is the 2100 milliamp hour battery the
design of the galaxy grandiose is
reminiscent of both samsung's galaxy s3
and galaxy note 2 while the design is
unmistakably Samsung and build quality
is solid it's just a little too large to
use comfortably with one hand though
that is to be expected in a phone this
size the display is clearly the weakest
point of the galaxy grand duos the low
resolution of 480 by 800 pixels
certainly doesn't help and I saw some
backlight leakage at the top of the
screen there is a benefit to the low
resolution however in that it actually
improves performance since the hardware
doesn't have to push as many pixels
we weren't expecting super impressive
performance out of the galaxy grand duos
so we were actually pleasantly surprised
with how well it ran scrolling is very
smooth apps launched quickly and the
games we tested ran fairly well and to
to benchmark scores varied quite a bit
with the final average score ending up
at about 7500 the galaxy grand duos runs
Android 4.1.2 jelly bean and of course
run Samsung's TouchWiz on top of it
the usual suite of s apps are included
and some features from higher-end
Samsung devices have been included like
split-screen which you'll either love or
hate the rear facing camera on the
galaxy grand duos is very usable but not
quite up to par with Samsung's
higher-end phones in good light it was
fine but low light performance isn't
great video capture was decent but it
wasn't very sharp and looked noisy in
some darker areas of the video while the
low resolution screen and less than
top-of-the-line hardware should and do
help the battery life the 2100 milliamp
hour battery still doesn't last as long
as we'd like it to we got about six
hours of moderately heavy use and if
you're using two sims you can expect
battery drain to be pretty steady in the
end it's clear that unless you need dual
Sims
there are many better phones on the
market that said if you do need dual
Sims the galaxy grand duos is one of the
best options currently available if
you'd like more in-depth information on
the galaxy grand duos we have a full
