brought to you by carbonite head to

authority to get two months free hello
again ladies and gentlemen I'm Joe Hindy
the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android QA where you ask
and we answer this week we're going to
be talking about tablet-optimized
applications the note 3 versus the
iphone 5s and a whole lot more so let's
get started one Francois asks is Android
getting better in his tablet-optimized
apps offering to me progress seems very
slow am I wrong you're not wrong but
you're not necessarily right either it's
up to each individual developer to make
sure that their app is tablet-optimized
and it actually has very little to do
with google or android tablet
optimization is going strong there are
hundreds of thousands of apps that work
and look good on tablets which is far
more than the 30 or so we had two or
three years ago however big players like
Facebook and Twitter who have hundreds
of millions of users still haven't
optimized their apps yet so it can
appear to be going slow when it's really
going about as smoothly as it possibly
can Chris asks what do the developer
options do and do they damage your phone
if you use them the developer options
are included so that developers can test
and debug their applications before the
release to the Google Play Store that
said there are some options in there
that could affect your performance
negatively but there's nothing in there
that could harm your device mostly
you'll find options to change animation
speeds show CPU overlay to see how hard
the CPU runs show screen touches and a
host of other stuff that is mostly
useless to your average user it is fun
to play around with sometimes but there
is nothing there that can do any real
damage to your device Mustapha asks
after using blackberry for three years
which bunch should I upgrade to the
iphone 5s or the note 3 unfortunately
there's no way I can answer that
question without knowing what you need
specifically in a smartphone I'm a
control for this but both devices are
actually quite capable of replacing
blackberries so you really can't go
wrong with either one that said you have
to ask yourself what you really want the
note 3 is among the best Android devices
in the world it has a giant screen
amazing specs the latest Android for now
and a host of other features the iphone
5s has a much smaller screen good specs
and it's the best apple has to offer
what I'd recommend is watching reviews
and if possible go to a store and hold
each of them in your hand
you know what you need you just need to
figure out which one fills those needs
better Darko asks how's the progress of
wine for Android going will it ever be
done that is a pretty difficult question
to answer the last time wine made big
headlines was when it was announced
about eight months ago and they have
been working on it since then however no
other large announcements have been made
sense according to their wiki page there
has been a lot of progress it's still in
the development stages but the list of
things left to do is significantly
shorter than the list of things already
done I can't say for sure when it's
going to be out but they have been
working on it ridwan asks when will the
cyanogenmod app be available as of right
now there is no official release date
for the signage and mod application
considering everything the app has to do
when you run it the CM team is probably
waiting until they've ironed out all of
the major bugs before they release there
are a number of people who have posted
demo videos and at least 4 Nexus devices
it seems to work fairly well I don't
want to speculate on a release date
because it's unknown how far cm wants to
go with this app before it's made
available to the public once again I'm
