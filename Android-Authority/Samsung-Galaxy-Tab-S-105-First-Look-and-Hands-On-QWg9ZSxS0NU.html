their 10 inch tablet offering in order
to bring you a better experience all
around so it's Joshua regard from
Android Authority and this is your first
look at the Samsung Galaxy Tab s 10.5
there are ultimately a few elements to
the Samsung Galaxy Tab s line of tablets
that have been announced today that
really kind of stand out yes it is the
display but it's also a little bit in
the design and also the robust accessory
suite that you will be getting with at
least the Tab s 10.5 but first let's
talk about the design where the
signature samsung style comes back again
on the front is the button layout we're
used to with the physical home button
that now has a integrated finger scanner
flanked by the recent apps and back keys
compared to the Tab pro 10.1 the big
noticeable difference here is the
narrower bezel all around which may have
been needed in order to justify the
slightly larger screen now while it does
allow for a more compact device all
around especially at this size the
handling may be hindered a little bit
because when you're using this big
tablet in landscape mode you don't
really have a whole lot of room to be
able to rest your thumb and grip the
entire tablet but turning over to the
back you get the same textured plastic
with a perforated design perforate
dimple design rather that is found on
the galaxy s5 already and even the look
of the rear camera slightly mimics the
smartphone you do also get the dual
stereo speaker setup with one on the
right side and one on the left though on
the right side you have the microSD card
slot the SIM tray for LTE variants and
also the micro USB charging port
speaking of the sides at just six point
six millimeters thick and weighing at
around 465 grams the Tab s 10.5 has a
handling experience that is a little bit
better than what we've seen from
previous 10-inch Samsung tablets but it
is also sort of getting more in line
with what we have come to expect from
let's say the Sony Xperia z2 tablet and
of course the marquee feature here is
the new display technology that is being
used on the tablet line the Galaxy Tab s
line now features AMOLED displays and in
this 10.5 inch screen you get a
resolution 2560 by 1600 resulting in a
pixel density of 288 pixels per inch
AMOLED display tech brings all the
vibrant color
brightness saturation and the punch you
in the face nature that we've come to
love about flagship Samsung smartphones
and it looks even better when you blow
it up into this larger display you don't
really need too much of convincing to
see that AMOLED has a difference from
previous LCD based screams as you can
see in this comparison that was actually
set up for us to see the difference
where AMOLED has higher contrast and
deeper blacks compared to in this case a
TFT LCD display so anything you do on
these displays will be a lot of fun
be it surfing the web watching videos
playing games but in the case of Samsung
they do realize that tablet usage is
very much a media consumption experience
and that's what they're trying to
enhance with these new displays
performance shouldn't be an issue
because you're going to get the best
that Samsung can offer in these tablets
already with the exceed O's 5 octa
processing package at least in the Wi-Fi
only version but there are going to be
LTE variants of these two tablets so we
want to be surprised if it came with a
Qualcomm Snapdragon perhaps 801
processor either way you're going to get
the Adreno 330 GPU and three gigabytes
of ram so this tablet should easily be
able to handle everything from web
browsing to gaming to video viewing
however when it comes to the built-in
storage it can be further expanded with
microSD cards of up to 128 gigabytes of
capacity and finally the Tab s 10.5
packs of 79 hundred million power
battery slightly smaller than the
battery of the Tab pro 10.1 but should
still offer a comparable and at least
equally impressive battery life and with
power saving features on you should be
able to get a lot of time out of this
outstanding tablet as we move straight
into software we have basically what was
already first introduced in the Tab pro
and no pro line of tablets with the
magazine UX adding itself on to the
TouchWiz suite now essentially we'll get
to a magazine UX but TouchWiz remains
TouchWiz even with the slightly flatter
elements all around and the new circle
centric areas in the notification
drop-down and in the settings menus you
still have basically that very colourful
slightly bloated look in TouchWiz but it
is still ultimately very functional
especially when you consider various
features like the multi window which
will allow you to use more than one
application at once the magazine UX on
the other hand is a nicely
formatted grid format that does allow
you to get quite a bit of information at
a glance but as you start to dive deeper
into the sources you'll find that you
need to get through a bunch of clicks
just to get to what you really need to
as in the magazine UX is basically a
front end for the Flipboard which makes
it a little bit less robust as we would
have expected originally in the tab pro
no pro and now in the tab pass line and
finally a more than honorary mention
should be given to the accessories that
you can use with at least the Tab s 10.5
now the Tab s 8.4 does come with a snap
cover and you'll notice on the back that
there are two dimples in which you'll be
able to snap in the plastic that allows
the covers to stay on but the cases and
actually the keyboard of the Tab s 10.5
are the ones that I feel should be
mentioned because they are much more
robust and provide more functionality
rather than just covering the screen for
example this particular smart cover will
allow you to cover up the the actual
tablet altogether but you'll be able to
fold it back in a few different ways in
order to get a better handling
experience when it's laying on the table
and then here is a look at the keyboard
it is a Bluetooth keyboard so it does
not attach to the actual tablet but you
are able to lock it at the top with a
little clip that will allow you to have
the keyboard and the tablet easily
transportable together but when you're
using the tablet uprights
it does not latch into the actual
keyboard itself we'll have more on these
particular cases in a video coming up
very soon as I cover the actual event so
stay tuned for those and remember that
Android authority is your source for all
things Android so stay tuned here for
further coverage of the Samsung Galaxy
Tab s line newly unveiled today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
