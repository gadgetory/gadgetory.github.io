Authority and get ready cuz we're about
to break down five of the best apps for
the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 now to do this
we had to establish a few criteria first
the app had to be awesome
second it couldn't come pre-installed on
the note 2 and third had to make use of
some of the more unique features of the
note 2 like for example the s-pen now
that we know what the rules are let's
get started with the first app on our
list if you're like me and I know I am
you can barely write your name legibly
let alone draw anything interesting the
first app on our list sketchin aims to
change that first choose the picture
you'd like to draw from the included
packs and sketch them we'll show you
step by step how to draw the image when
you finish you'll get to see how well
you've done personally I think I need
some more practice sketch um also has a
free sketching mode and a creator mode
which lets you create your own drawing
lessons the app is a free download in
the Google Play Store when you look at
apps optimized for the note 2 or the
rest of the note series you're going to
see a lot of note-taking apps it's like
the developers saw the name had a Eureka
moment and thought I know what I'm gonna
do for an app of the many note-taking
apps available the second item in our
list papyrus is my favorite using
papyrus couldn't be easier once you've
created a new notebook or a new note
just write down your notes with the
s-pen if you need to erase something
just swipe it away with your finger
papyrus is a free download in the Google
Play Store but there are optional in-app
purchases like PDF export and cloud
uploading options the third app on our
list photo desk is a combination of a
photo organizer and a photo editor in
addition to using the s-pen it can also
utilize the note to split screen feature
hovering over an image or folder with
the s-pen will bring up a little info
bubble and pressing the S Pen button
will bring up a contextual popup menu
it's also easy to resize images add text
and audio and move multiple photos
around with drag
drop by far one of the coolest features
is photo desks map view which shows a
map displaying where various photos were
taken this makes things like organizing
your vacation photos way easier photo
desk is a free download in the Google
Play Store so you've learned to draw
using sketch um and now you're looking
for something bigger and better now
would be a good time to check out our
fourth app flip a clip when you were a
kid did you ever make flip books well
flip a clip is like that except it's on
your note too instead of the corner of a
notebook you'll have to create your
animation one frame at a time but even
if you're like me and can't draw you can
still end up with something pretty cool
philippa clip is a free download in the
Google Play Store plus its name is
really fun to say our previous apps have
either helped you get things done or
learn new skills with our final apps
scribble racer it's time to finally just
have some fun sure you can use the note
to zest pen for a ton of games but
scribble racer was actually built for it
it seems simple at first put the S Pen
on the screen and don't crash into the
walls pick up stars and fruit and candy
which for some reason fills up your slow
down meter which you can activate with
the S Pen button as the game continues
it gets faster and faster and eventually
you will hit a wall still it's
surprisingly addictive scribble racer is
a free download in the Play Store but it
is ad-supported
and that my friends wraps up our list
now let me guess you disagree at least
about one app that's totally fine just
let us know what you would have included
instead in the comments below
now if you want to get into a little
more detail about these apps we have a
written article at Android authority
calm you'll find the link to that in the
description of this very video we always
have new videos going up on our channel
so if you want to stay up to date make
sure to subscribe I'm Chris Wolfe from
Android authority and thank you for
