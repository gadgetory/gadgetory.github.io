going on everybody and we are bringing
you our first look at the lg optimus G
pro this is the new beast in their
family it comes in at a 5.5 inch screen
at 1080p so you're looking at one of the
first phones to have a screen more than
five inches especially LG's first this
is going to be the year of the 5 inch
screen but LG has decided to go a little
bit farther in that respect and put half
an inch more on there so what you're
looking at is this is the white version
here you have a bit of a small bezel on
the side so that's really cool and we're
going to come around the back real quick
and you'll see the camera on the back
side along with the LG logo on the
bottom the button layouts are for the
most part pretty much the same you have
your power button over on the side where
your thumb would land so it's still even
for a 5.5 inch phone having that there
is really nice and then the volume
buttons over here on the other side so
it's it's a really sleek form factor
kind of reminiscent of the plastic feel
that Samsung phones may have but at the
same time it feels really nice in the
hand and it really isn't too hard to use
even though its size is a little bit
larger coming into the UI this is the LG
up this is the LG Optimus UI that you
may know and love from the Optimus G and
if you are familiar with the Optimus G
UI then this is going to be largely the
same kind of the nice lockscreen here
the Optimus G let's head over to the
home screens very colorful you white to
start off but there are some
improvements on here some design choices
in terms of the higher resolution icons
some of the new icons right here we have
this weather app so like I said before
if you are familiar with the Optimus UI
already then there really isn't too much
here that's very new but there are a
couple very interesting new features
that we can talk about in the camera at
least one of the first things that
you'll see here the camera interface is
just like this and right here we have VR
panorama right there in the middle and
VR panorama is a new feature to the
camera that allows four types of photos
that photosphere on the new jelly bean
4.2 is that it is capable of so you have
a grid
it's very much the same it kind of goes
around and you get the street view like
photos there however the one that I'm a
little bit I'm quite excited about
actually is the dual recording dual
recording allows you to actually we
should probably go to move video first
there you go do recording allows you to
have a small overlay and what this is is
it is using the rear 13 megapixel camera
with the 2.1 megapixel camera in the
front in order to do a
picture-in-picture so as you can see
we're right there you see there okay and
then you can you can record both at
using both cameras at once so it's a
very interesting feature that might
prove to be very fun other than that
you're looking at the Snapdragon 600
processor here clocking in at 1.7
gigahertz back to by an Adreno 320
processor so a graphics processor so
this is quite the robust performing
phone this there's a lot of power behind
this one thing that we do have to
mention here though that is very very
important is the fact that we have a
removable back this is a very big deal
for for many many people out there
because what this means is would be
removable back you are able to replace
the battery that is found inside and in
there is a whopping 31 40 milliamp hour
battery battery life on five-inch screen
phones tend to have a little bit of
trouble keeping up but with 30 140
milliamp hours inside of the optimus G
pro you can be sure that you're going to
have quite a lot of battery life other
than that you have your micro SD or you
might goes Micro SIM slot over here but
there is expandable memory from micro sd
so really this is a phone that is that
essentially despite a much larger screen
which some people may or may not be used
to yet you have some features on here
that many of the tie-in phones these day
are still lacking those two in
particular removable battery and micro
sd we're going to take some extra looks
on this we're going to do some verses
videos as well we're going to compare to
a lot of different phones a lot of
different competitors but the less we
are very very pleased with what we're
seeing so far from the lg optimus G pro
so go ahead and stay tuned here we have
a lot coming for you from the Mobile
World Congress here in Barcelona Spain
so stay tuned because this is Android at
the
and it is your source for all things
