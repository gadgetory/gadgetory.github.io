lenovo is looking to offer the Chrome OS
experience in a small package designed
for educational institutions and
businesses the chrome box tiny may be an
attractive option thanks to its
versatility and affordable price tag
this is Bailey Stein with Android
authority and this is my for review of
the lenovo thinkcentre chrome box tiny
the chrome box tiny gets its name from
its 1-liter form factor measuring 7 by 7
point 2 by 1.4 inches and weighing 2.2
pounds the size makes it somewhat
portable and ideal for use in
environments like home entertainment
systems well it does have several rubber
feet on the bottom for horizontal use
there's also a stand to support a
vertical position included in the box
you should be able to easily use the
chrome box tiny with your own monitor or
TV since it supports both DisplayPort
and HDMI out although one of the key
features of the lenovo chrome box is the
ability to make a space-saving
transformation at least according to
Lenovo's website what all of that means
is if you purchase a compatible lenovo
think vision monitor you'll be able to
slide the chrome box right into the open
space on the back by doing this you're
essentially creating a Chrome OS
all-in-one or tiny in one as Lenovo
calls it
although home users may not benefit from
this feature as much it does make it
quicker and easier to deploy or upgrade
equipment on a large scale there are two
models of a chrome box available the 10
h5 and 10 H 3 the 10 H 5 is the less
powerful of the two but also cheaper
thanks to its use of a dual-core intel
celeron 3205 you clocked at 1.5
gigahertz
the 10 h3 on the other hand is slightly
more expensive with a dual-core intel
core i3
5005 you clocked at two big yards you
can purchase either model with 2 or 4
gigabytes of RAM but I'm testing the 10
h3 with 4 gigabytes of RAM performance
on my unit has been excellent and while
I haven't tested the other models myself
I'm confident that they'll offer similar
performance after all Chrome OS is a
relatively conservative operating system
and it isn't nearly as demanding as
Windows or OS 10 for that matter I would
recommend getting a model with 4
gigabytes of RAM however especially if
you'd like to have a lot of tabs open at
once the chrome box provides 4 USB 3.0
ports an audio jack HDMI and DisplayPort
outputs a Kensington lock an Ethernet
port and built-in 802 11 AC Wi-Fi I did
find that attaching the included antenna
boosted the Wi-Fi signal significantly
and yes lenovo did design their monitors
to accommodate this there isn't an
integrated speakers so you'll either
have to have a monitor with speakers or
use the audio jack well it does support
Bluetooth 4.0 I did have some issues
when using a Logitech ultrathin Mouse
and an Apple wireless keyboard the mouse
cursor would occasionally flicker but
what was more alarming was when the
computer would start entering a
keystroke repeatedly well it did seem a
bit funny at first when the computer
started typing the number 8 it became
very frustrating when it started
backspacing all my work and one note I
decided to switch to the included wired
keyboard and keep my Logitech mouse to
see if this would resolve the issue but
it seems that the issue is present
regardless of whether I had the keyboard
connected only to be resolved by
completely switching off bluetooth a
computer restart does temporarily
resolve the issue but I still had issues
where my devices but just randomly
disconnect and refuse to pair again in
the end I turn bluetooth off and just
switch to the wired accessories since it
was just too much trouble to keep it on
hopefully Lenovo can resolve these
issues in the future so that users can
use bluetooth reliably the included
mouse and keyboard although wired are
actually pretty good the keyboard
provides a good amount of tactile
feedback while offering Chrome OS
exclusive shortcuts the mouse is also
nice to use although again I would have
preferred wireless accessories since
this chrome box is targeted towards
educational institutions and businesses
however the included wired accessories
do make sense running Chrome OS the
lenovo thinkcentre chrome box tiny
provides a very basic software
experience for those who use cloud
services exclusively Chrome OS is very
easy to use and offers only the things
that you absolutely must have when
turning on the chrome box you can
immediate
notice the sense of simplicity there's a
chrome West logo and within just a few
seconds here at your login screen log in
and you'll be greeted with the main
Chrome OS interface a search button in
the left corner next to the pinned apps
and status information in the right
corner there's no desktop where you can
place shortcuts or files just a
wallpaper of your choice the search
button will pull up Google where you can
search the web launched specific apps or
use Google now the main app you're
likely going to be using though is
Chrome which works exactly like it does
on Windows and OS 10 you can install
apps and extensions from the Chrome Web
Store and also quickly switch between
those apps by using the task view
shortcut on the keyboard if you click
the time in the bottom right corner you
can access a system menu with options to
sign out or power off connect to Wi-Fi
or Bluetooth adjust the volume or access
the consistently simple full Settings
app there's also a help link in that
menu which provides a bunch of excellent
helpful resources if you have any
questions or need help and that's really
all there is to it if you plan to use
the chrome box like a regular PC you'll
probably have to make some changes but
those changes may not be as major as you
may have expected unless you need
serious local file management powerful
photo or video editing tools or
developer tools you'll likely be able to
use Chrome OS quite efficiently if
you're someone who just wants to type up
documents send emails and browse the web
you won't have any trouble using Chrome
OS although you can't install Microsoft
Office you can still use Google Docs or
word online for basic documents as
mentioned earlier there are multiple
variants of the lenovo thinkcentre
chrome box tiny starting at about 200 $5
and going up to $340 there is a 16
gigabyte SSD but it should be noted that
you likely won't need to store much
locally since the cloud-based Google
Drive is baked into Chrome OS you also
get 100 gigabytes of free storage for
two years with the purchase of a Chrome
OS device so you should have plenty of
space while Chrome OS may not be for
everyone the lenovo thinkcentre chrome
box tiny offers a good value for not
only educational institutions and
businesses but also home users who just
want to
if I'd experienced and don't need
Windows or OS 10 applications
Lenovo's chromebox is small and portable
performs well and offers a simple
software experience on the other hand I
do wish that Lenovo would fix the
Bluetooth bug and I understand that this
won't be enough to replace a full PC for
many people including myself although
there are similar offerings that run
Windows ad subsequently offer better
application support the chrome box is a
very solid option for those wanting
something very easy to use thank you for
