with Android authority and in this video
let's see how ZTE s affordable flagship
compares to the galaxy s7 first off
there's design whereas the galaxy s7 is
composed of curved glass panels held
together by an aluminium band the xn7 is
encased in a beefy all metal unibody the
xm7 is considerably larger to with the
5.5 inch display compared to the galaxy
s7 s 5.1 inch display for something
smaller you should also consider the 5.2
inch axon 7 mini or for something larger
the 5.5 inch galaxy s7 edge in the hand
the x m7 feels smooth and slippery due
to its all-metal curved rear well the
galaxy s7 feels distinct and graspable
though it's glass easily collects
fingerprints both handsets feel premium
in their own ways and offering equally
top-notch build quality now for looks
it ultimately just comes down to
personal preference but I personally
think that the galaxy s7 looks better
with its light refracting glass you're
getting capacitive navigation keys on
both phones and while it's nice to be
able to change the position of the back
and recent keys on the axon 7 Samsung
keys are nicer to use since they're
illuminated and better positioned the
galaxy s7 is also ip68 water-resistant
so it can handle being submerged in 1
meter of water for up to 30 minutes this
is a great feature to have for peace of
mind we have to commend Samsung for
implementing this without adding any
flaps or gaskets to the various ports
sadly the xn7 is not water resistant at
all so you'll need to be more careful
perhaps interestingly both phones use
quad HD AMOLED displays manufactured by
Samsung aside from the point 4 inch bump
in size on the axon 7 the only major
difference is in sunlight readability
since the galaxy s7 is using a Super
AMOLED panel it does a bit better
other than that however you're getting
nearly the same experience with Gorilla
Glass 4 and subtle side curves the same
can be said about performance in the US
both films ship with a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 820 Adreno 530
and four gigabytes of RAM that is to say
you'll be experiencing some of the best
performance available today regardless
of your choice for connectivity the exon
7 offers the exact same options as the
galaxy s7 accept it as an additional SIM
card slot and comes unlocked out of the
box it's also technically compatible
with all four major carriers in the u.s.
although we've been hearing mixed
reports from Verizon and Sprint users so
if you're at either of those networks
you'll probably want to go with the
galaxy s7 but if you're on a TT mobile
or one of their respective MVNOs you'll
notice no difference in network support
both phones offer microSD card expansion
although on the axon 7 it's only up to
128 gigabytes requires that you give up
the second SIM card slot what's sort of
ironic however is that the less
expensive accent 7 base model includes
64 gigabytes of storage compared to the
galaxy s7 32 gigabytes of based storage
if you want the same 64 gigabytes with
the galaxy s7 you'll be needing to pay
more the Exxon 7 features a recessed
rear-facing fingerprint reader while the
galaxy s7 s reader is embedded within
its home button both are reasonably fast
and accurate when it comes to external
audio the axon 7 is the clear winner
with dual stereo front-facing speakers
compared to the galaxy s7 s distorted
sounding side firing speaker the
difference is very noticeable and if you
especially value volume clarity and
immersion you can't go wrong with the
axon 7 the contest gets a bit more
interesting when it comes to headphones
though although ZTE has heavily marketed
the s m7 s dual independent hi-fi audio
chips
I couldn't notice a difference compared
to the galaxy s7 that's not to say that
all of this is just marketing fluff as
the xn7
does still sound better than some other
flagship devices but rather that Samsung
seems to have also used a high-end audio
chip in our battery life testing the x
m7 on average just slightly edged out
the galaxy s7 with a full day of use and
5 hours of screen on time compared to a
full day and four hours both phones
offer a great battery life and you may
be able to achieve even longer battery
life with more stringent management the
Exxon 7 supports quick charge 3.0 for
50% charge in 30 minutes well
cs7 has quick charge 2.0 for a 60%
charge in 30 minutes the galaxy s7 also
supports qi and PM a wireless charging
if that matters to you Samsung has been
known for it's amazing cameras for some
time now so it's no surprise that the
galaxy s7 is 12 megapixel F 1.7 shooter
l performs the accent 7s 20 megapixel F
1.8 shooter to clarify the galaxy s7 has
a lower megapixel count in order to
provide larger pixels allowing for more
light which theoretically means better
photos especially in low light and yeah
the galaxy s7 s camera is better
although the daylight photo difference
may not be as much as you had expected
the X on sevens camera is quite capable
in good lighting
despite its tendency towards warmer
color temperatures and trouble with
brighter colors with that said the
galaxy s7 s dynamic range is plainly
superior just notice how well the galaxy
s7 brings up the shadows without losing
the details on the highlights
unlike the axon 7 it is worth noting
that axon 7's images are sharper though
so if you want to crop in you won't lose
as much detail as with the galaxy s7 in
low-light the difference becomes much
clearer the light is oddly reflected
across the s7 blend at times it offers
far brighter less noisy and more
detailed shots than the axon 7 this
shouldn't come as much of a surprise as
we declared the s7 s camera to be one of
the best in low light and the X n sevens
to be one of the underperformance in our
respective reviews if you take a lot of
pictures in low-light the s7 s extra
cost may be worth it for video recording
both phones do 4k at 30 P in each offer
optical image stabilization the s7 once
again edges out the axon 7 with better
colors and more gradual exposure changes
it also offers more manual controls
which can be very helpful for
professionals all things considered the
s7 is clearly superior in the camera
Department for camera apps to the s
Evans feels a bit more polished those
ZTE s is also quite easy to use although
both phones are shipping with Android
6.0 marshmallow each include their own
extra features and UI tweaks the exon 7
includes ZTE is fairly young me favor UI
4.0 whereas the galaxy s7 features a
more evolved touch
is neither experienced is overly jarring
you'll be giving an app drawer pseudo
stock UI and generally tolerable system
apps either way with that said I found
myself enjoying the galaxy s7 software
more than the axon 7s I do like some of
ZTE s features and changes but they
really need to work on polishing the
experience like Samsung has there's no
doubt that me favor will improve over
time but for now
TouchWiz feels more like the finished
product on a positive note for the axon
7 it doesn't ship with nearly as much
bloat whereas the galaxy s7 does the few
EPS it does come installed with can be
uninstalled based on what we've seen
historically it looks like both the
Exxon 7 and galaxy s7 will be receiving
over-the-air updates to Android 7.0 new
get within the next six months or so you
can buy the ZTE axon 7 in either gray or
gold unlocked and dual SIM for $400 the
galaxy s7 is available in black white
and gold for around 672 $700 depending
on the carrier that's a pretty
considerable difference in pricing so
you want to carefully consider our
conclusion before that though it's worth
mentioning that in the United States the
xn7 includes ZTE Exxon passport 2.0 a
two-year premium warranty basically if
you happen to water damage or drop your
Exxon 7 you can get it replaced for a
relatively low cost advanced exchanges
and two-way shipping are provided for no
additional charge both of these phones
are excellent choices and they're easily
among the best smartphones released this
year it's impressive how much of the
core experience the Exxon 7 gets right
yeah the galaxy s7 does a lot of the
smaller things better but it also cost a
lot more and if you aren't really going
to use those features it might not be
worth the extra cost it's certainly a
case of diminishing returns with the
accents of an even offering better
battery life a much better audio
experience and a better warranty
ultimately you have to ask yourself
whether the galaxy s7 is water-resistant
more sunlight-readable display better
camera and more polished software are
worth the $300 plus price difference
