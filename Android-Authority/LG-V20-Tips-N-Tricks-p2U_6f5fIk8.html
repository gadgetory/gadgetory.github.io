authority and with the lgb 20 student
hit store shelves you're probably going
to want to know a little bit more about
what it can do especially if you plan on
picking one up so let's go ahead and get
right into it this is tips and tricks
for your LG V 20 so our first tip with
the lgb 20 is how to bring back the app
drawer just like the LG v 20 from early
this year the V 20 defaults to a
launcher that does not have an app
drawer and personally I'm not a fan of
this app drawer list experience because
it's a little bit more difficult to stay
organized and it also makes it feel a
little bit more like iOS so if you're
not a fan of it either you can easily
change it in the settings just jump into
the main settings scroll down and select
home screen and tap on select home from
here you have the option to pick between
home which is the default launcher easy
home and home and app drawer which is
the one you'll want to switch to to
bring back the app drawer once selected
it'll automatically take you back to
your main home screen and you should now
have a more traditional Android
experience now if you're not a fan of
LG's own launcher obviously you can
download the a third-party one from the
Play Store like the Google now launcher
or Nova if you want an experience that
feels a little bit closer to stock tip
number two is how to set a custom
signature on the second screen along
with a matching wallpaper and one of the
coolest features from v10 last year was
the ability to set this signature on the
second screen but they've made a few
improvements to it on the V 20 so you
can now set a custom signature that's
longer more characters and you can also
set a custom signature wallpaper to
match to do this you'll want to jump
into the settings scroll down and select
the second screen settings tap the show
when main screen on option and then
select signature from here you can set a
custom signature to be your name a
phrase or whatever you really wanted to
say you can also select from a handful
of different fonts but something to keep
in mind is that some of these fonts are
larger than others and may cut off part
of your signature if you're using a
signature with a lot of characters once
you have everything exactly the way that
you want it just hit save and you'll be
prompted to use the first character of
your signature as a lockscreen wallpaper
and if you want to pass on this option
you can just hit later but if you'd like
to set a matching wallpaper tap on
settings select a wallpaper that suits
your fancy and apply it from now on any
time that you wake up your phone you
always be greeted with your signature
and a matching custom wallpaper and it's
a pretty cool way to make your v20 a
little bit different from everyone
else's one of the most underutilized
feature that has been available on LG
phones for quite some time now
are these smart settings and is still
available here on the v20 if you're not
familiar with smart settings it's
basically a way for you control specific
functions on your phone based on your
location or open a specific application
based on whether you plug in headphones
or connect a bluetooth device ultimately
it's a really convenient feature that
can save you a lot of time in the long
run and also make your life a lot easier
so for example if you want Spotify or
Google Play Music to automatically
launch when you plug in headphones jump
into the smart settings menu select
these settings for earphones make sure
it's enabled and from here you can
select any app you'd like to have open
when you plug in headphones but
obviously music apps and other apps like
YouTube make the most sense here from
the smart status menu can also have your
phone automatically toggle Bluetooth and
Wi-Fi on or off and change your sound
profiles based on whether you're at home
or away from home in order to do this
all you have to do is input your home
location and set your preferences for
Bluetooth Wi-Fi and sound profiles
accordingly and your phone will
automatically make the changes that
you've set when you come home or take
off for work in the morning the LGB 20
still brings all the same manual video
recording capabilities of the v10 from
last year but it also has a lot of new
improvements and features one of the
biggest changes is built-in focus
peaking and if you're a content creator
you'll know exactly how important and
how much easier it is to shoot video or
take photos when you have focus peaking
it's really easy to use just jump into
the camera app switch to manual mode for
either photo or video and tap the focus
toggle to switch to manual focus if it
isn't on manual focus already from here
focus peaking should already be enabled
by default but if it isn't just tap on
the focus peaking toggle and as you
adjust the cameras focus you'll notice a
bunch of green fuzzy lines starting to
appear this is focus peaking and the
green fuzzy lines indicate what the
camera is currently focusing on and it's
extremely useful for getting a crisp and
clear shot and that you're getting
exactly what you want into focus one of
my favorite features that LG has added
to the v20 is the comfort View mode
which is basically a blue light filter
and we saw Samsung add this to the
seven so it's really cool to see LG do
the same thing with a V 20 if you're not
familiar with what a blue light filter
is that essentially filters out the blue
light from your screen and replaces it
with a yellowish hue which is a lot
easier on the eyes and causes a lot less
eye strain especially when you're
looking at your phone in the dark or
during nighttime hours to enable this
feature just swipe down on the
notification shade look for the comfort
view toggle and enable it you can also
change the intensity of the blue light
filter by long pressing on the toggle to
get to the comfort view settings and
from here you can switch between low
medium or high and even switch to a
purely black and white screen last but
not least our final tip is how to beam
your LGB Tony if you're not a fan of the
general UI or the way the icons look you
can change it with the built-in themes
and it's pretty easy to do just jump
into the themes section under the
settings menu and select one of the
available themes and hit apply these
themes can be pretty expensive and
change a lot of the interface from the
icons notification shade settings menu
and LG's own apps the only downside is
there aren't that many available for the
V 20 right now but hopefully this list
of themes will continue to grow as time
goes on and that about wraps it up for
tips and tricks for the LG b 20
