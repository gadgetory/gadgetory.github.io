by Toyota it's dark slacker here with
android authority reporting live from
CES 2014 and we are here with a very
very special known or guessed a personal
inspiration of ours in mind specifically
John render of technobuffalo dude RZ
thank you for having me man it's good to
be here that's really great to be here
you know we're really part of a really
select lucky group of people I think the
most fortunate of to get to do what we
love for a career and it puts food on it
is like mind blow and I'm only even rice
and beans right now was it as long as it
keeps you going the fact that we get to
talk about technology and their shows
like this exists that's right in
audience like yours that net watch us is
is incredible so how many CS is have you
been to in your life this is my fifth
CES that's been it's been a lot of a lot
of cesses yeah if you if you what
numbers is for you just be my third one
yeah so even teen you've been here
enough to see it like the show totally
yeah totally change Oh radically changed
I'm like giant announcements yeah to
like we aren't micro stuff yeah it's
been really strange to see companies not
do big product announcements or they
want their own state instead of being
upstaged like 10 minutes later by
something else we're just talking about
the elf in the room the fact that apple
doesn't have a presence at any of these
events a lot of people like Samsung our
student companies they board that model
and they want to take an in-house they
want to control the environment yeah no
I think Apple to Apple inadvertently or
advertently killed yeah CES and
otherwise there'd be huge announcements
millions of dollars spent yeah and then
20 minutes later there's another huge
announcer everybody forgets about wishes
announced actly and you know they're
always doing like Samsung do is older
event before Moldova Congress a always
and you know they like to catch the
attention getting the wave and they're
always talked about during the event
it's really smart actually no I agree
unfortunate ever come be like Samsung
made released like 90 products and once
they're like they're always the new
announcement coming out yeah have you
seen our galaxy pro Galaxy Note pro
galaxy the new branding is confusing
don't you think it's so confusing I
couldn't keep track beforehand you got
like I there's so many Samsung products
I think their model if like if there's a
rumor about Apple making our product
like an iPad pro they're like we we need
that but it's worked for them they've
been very successful and they certainly
you know they make they make good
product so it really do pen ain't broke
don't fix it and they also make almost
virtually every single component that
goes into their mobile technology I mean
they're like the largest heavy-duty
construction industry business in the
world yet and on and on they do a lot
behind the scenes I think with the whole
Apple lawsuit even though they
technically lost they came out so so far
ahead and kept them sure position them
for market dominance I agree they
essentially got to take apples R&amp;amp;D and
only paid a billion dollars for it cheap
it says but you know something just
really nerdy him something I've talked
to a lot of engineers and today on in
other places but is that Apple still
possesses the most advanced tool and
dialing process in the world they invest
billions of dollars on foxconn and their
partners in China so they always have
the most advanced fabrication and feel
you know it's unmistakable you pick up
an iphone 5 5 s it has the best build
quality of any phone you know I think
that was true except for the HTC One
which which I love the HTC One and you
can look at iOS and say maybe a little
bit stale and you look at KitKat for
Android and you're like it's really
awesome like do I care about the build
quality or ever you know more open OS
that I can do anything I want with and
that looks really nice you know we have
something in common we also we love
technology obviously we're really
passionate about what we do but we
followed in your footsteps and we
actually gave the PadFone or sees me at
the zenfone an order from Andhra
Authority place for the best android
phone simply because the build quality
of it was fantastic you know and it's
cheap and that's not tonight it's really
I think you have to look harder now yeah
to find a bad phone yeah then you do to
really find just a you know a good phone
everything's good everything's good now
I mean it's got the point where Android
especially like everything's pretty much
has a dual core in a Giga ram or more
and injury will run great undo Gorna
Giga ran up so this they did with
android 4.4 kitkat cleaned it up for you
it's incredible with off contract phones
like the Moto X and
oh gee like amazing it's a go why it's
not a contracting well I think a lot of
people see the glitz and the glamour of
a new device is heavily marketed and see
$99 they just want to continue with
rising so my family you know that's
that's the mentality you're like what
and I guess ironically we're promoting
that whole like we kind of want
mentality I new phones so we're we're
we're contributing to the contradiction
yes you know of it i'll get to
philosophical of technology you know
it's the last day the show i'm gonna wax
poetic oh yes what did you love what was
your favorite thing here at CES john so
they're a couple things that I really
loved and they're not overly traditional
I guess first they actually are both in
LG ok I'm actually LG and nikon LG had a
34 inch widescreen Thunderbolt monitor
which looked ridiculously awesome out
and they also had a mirror in a clear
display would you do you can't see those
I didn't see that but I did see the
display for ya really good good looks
like a window but it's a 10-point
multi-touch touchscreen which is awesome
Wow then we had a chance to go to nikon
they've got like a 68 cameras set up
they take a full 3d image of you I said
it was awesome and they were you inside
of the game I've always wanted to crush
goombahs and now I can actually get a
chance to do that and so coming up we
have a lot of really big paradigm
shifting stuff coming up huge oculus
rift I mean everything is just getting
faster and better like what do you see
as being the next big thing yeah oculus
is really at the heart of that I mean
it's sort of a countdown so it's kind of
weird yeah it's a countdown to when they
get bought yeah and becomes more
mainstream but they're committed to
bringing the v1 out to market on
themselves so I do think something like
that is really going to change things
certainly 4k yeah was whether we want it
or not getting just like jammed down our
throats Santa phone overkill that's so
over I thought 1080p phones look great
2560 by 1600 displays that are coming
out I lesbian chopra make it yeah for
mobile it tell me how long the battery's
gonna last the screams are advanced
screens are advancing so far advanced a
better technology I'm not sure they have
1080p and a phone that's gonna last me
yeah you know but I understand the
appeal behind something it looks like
you're looking yeah yeah damier its can
get it to the point where you're
watching a show in like 4k and your
phone's gonna look like you're just
acting it like you want David Caruso to
actually act out CSI miami in your house
to get better resolution you know what
you're getting on your tablet or phone
in terms of
wearable technology are you proponent of
google glass and other augmented type
realities I'm good for life good for
people I don't I'm split on google glass
in all in all honesty I I see the appeal
yeah and I see the potential for but
right now it's more of a toy yeah I
think we're bull's eye like I think
Qualcomm's talk is is awesome I think
the new pebble steel is I'm rocking a
pebble that's a beautiful thing to get
yeah the pebble steel is great actually
won one of our CS awards you know
they're a ton of where I got a fuel band
on under my broadcast it's slowly
creeping into your life I'm laden with
with the biometric sensors so your wife
and baby can know how your horse I like
you I like the other biometric sensors I
do not yet have the biometric nipples
but perhaps it was good someday I may
know i i'd not any of that a quite yet
but they do have a drop cam up so i can
watch the little guy and yeah it's got
creepy to say watch him sleep and you
might not know but a big congratulations
to thank you wife just gave birth
legends I've lost a baby way I would
swim dad yeah I got it huh gotta get
three and a half month old and it's been
it's been awesome to look at him dig
you're a person like you actually exists
yeah we're like there was no person and
now there's a person it's been it's been
really kind of cool well that's what
it's all about I think what we often
tend to forget is that technology is
just designed to augment our lives to
enhance them to make them better you
know to increase communication with our
loved ones and form more meaningful
relationships I agree and we get lost
all the glitz and the glamour of all
these brands and all the breakneck pace
of with which things change you know but
I I couldn't agree more and every time I
like to look at my phone and look up
there in conversation I think it hurts a
little bit to have to do that it's
actually why I think something and I
never saw the use of a SmartWatch really
until I can be like the less it's still
rude but less shoot I'm like reply to
that nope nope I'm sure it's a lot less
invasive like you're with people then
whipping out your phone valentino three
ambien leave especially galaxy not
throwing really odd but what a phony
nah actually what I knew I do i do i
love i love i love phablets i'm not
gonna lie i can't i can't hide it okay
that's awesome well you know it's just
such an honor for us you know the real
thank you I'm honored I'm honored to be
he to be on your Airways man thank you
for having me I'm a big fan of what you
guys doing here one of the really
pioneering of a younger generation of
youtubers and you guys doing a really
killer job and it's an honor to see and
to watch I'm kind of speechless so
probably could have to go the video
little short guys jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo we're reporting live from
CES 2014 thank you so much time my
pleasure thank you for having me thank
you very much man and once again thank
