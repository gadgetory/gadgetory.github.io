on everybody and this is the HTC u 11
life now we already have a review of
this phone here at Android authority
done by Chris Carlin and he reviewed the
Android one edition many of his positive
thoughts I echo in this video so I
figured I would do something a little
bit different from this video review let
us know what you think about it in the
comments down below now the main
difference between my version of HTC's
new device and the one that Chris Carlin
reviewed is the software experience
because his was Android 1 and I have HTC
Sense but this is the version you also
get in the US while the Android 1
Edition is available in more places
outside of the States
so with that in mind let's talk about
the software experience first HTC Sense
obviously is what you get here about one
really nice benefit that I actually just
experienced in the last few days was an
update to Android 8.0 Oreo what HTC
Sense does benefit from some of those
additions that we might have already
enjoyed on devices like the pixel 2 for
example pressing and holding on an icon
in the home screens allows you to get to
a few quick functions in these shortcuts
on top of that you also have the ability
to do picture in picture with an
application like YouTube you would be
able to play a video for example and
when you press the home button you'll
get a version of the video that floats
on top of your workspace so you would
still be able to do other things while
you're still enjoying something like a
YouTube video this also works with
applications like Google Maps so if
you're going to get navigation done you
can do even more on top of it and that
comes on top of software you might be
familiar with from HTC including
blinkfeed which has always been a part
of sense and it is a good agricultural
media feeds into just one easy to look
at an easily scrollable feed but if we
are going to talk about features that
this phone has alongside the pixel 2
then of course we have edge sense what
you can do here is squeeze the phone and
it will bring up any number of functions
and it doesn't necessarily have to be a
Google assistant like I have here you're
able to set it to pretty much any app or
any function that it provides but you
can also squeeze and hold the device in
order to do some other functions as well
in my case I have it set to taking the
screen shot which I actually do quite
often so it's nice to be able to do it
quickly as you can see here there are
also some options in order to do
app squeezes so you can do something
like going to the camera and squeeze it
in order to take a photo you can go into
maps and squeeze it to zoom into the map
or you can program your own with a beta
function that allows you to provide some
taps and holds inside of these
applications in order for you to program
them to a squeeze and finally we're
going to go outside the Google ecosystem
a little bit to show the other
assistance that HTC originally
programmed for the simple squeeze and
that is HTC Alexa that's right Amazon
Alexa does come on this device and it is
another way for you to get what you
might already enjoy on an echo in your
household on a portable device and
that's the main function of it I
personally found that HTC Alexa didn't
really provide as many functions that
I'm used to using on Google assistant
like opening up YouTube to watch certain
videos or opening up my music apps to
play music and podcasts so those are the
main differences between the two
versions of the HTC u 11 life but let's
take a look at the actual device itself
the rest of the body is made of plastic
and does not necessarily scream premium
and of course because you have a glossy
back here you are going to get a lot of
fingerprints which is basically the case
here and these are all fingerprints that
I just got while filming this video the
phone doesn't scream premium by any
means but HTC has found a way of
mitigating that as there is a ip67
certification for water and dust
resistance so even if it doesn't feel
like the strongest phone out there it
can take more than it lets on but of
course we get down to the bottom and
this is where a lot of points of
contention might be discovered you have
a USB type-c port that is over to the
side which is a little bit odd and it's
a bit of a throwback to much older HTC
devices you have a bottom mounted firing
speaker here which is a single unit it
doesn't really get too loud it gets
pretty loud but it also doesn't sound
too great so even if the speaker
experience might not be the best you do
get some great headphones in the box and
they are these u sonic compatible
earbuds that provide really punchy bass
and actually a very enjoyable soundstage
so what you have here is probably the
best set of headphones I have ever been
included or bundled with a particular
phone inside the box they do have a USB
C connecting port here on the bottom
which means that these are the
headphones that you are expected to use
with
you 11 live at all times now the reason
why I say that is because the phone does
not come with a headphone jack adapter
and that's a kind of big bummer because
it requires you to spend a little bit
more than the affordable price for the
phone by getting the adapter on HTC's
own website and this is all powered by a
specification sheet that should tell you
what the performance will basically be
like now while this phone is going to
falter a little bit in terms of
performance compared to the snapdragon
835 and other phones with even more
gigabytes of RAM that doesn't mean that
it's not a reliable performer even
though there might be that little bit of
slowdown with applications we still
found that this phone was enjoyable to
use on the daily and it got us through
pretty much any task that we threw at it
no matter what even gaming even if it
takes a little while for an for a game
to load up and there might be some
slowdown where you're doing multitasking
like the picture-in-picture we mentioned
earlier and finally let's talk about the
camera now this is one area where HTC
made sure not to skimp out on the
specifications one of the main issues
with the camera is just in the app
itself now this has more to do with the
performance than anything else but you
do get a number of modes here it's just
that the app is still a little bit slow
there is some shutter lag and you might
need to have some patience before
getting that perfect shot after you're
fiddling with the exposure compensation
and maybe trying to find what mode you
want to use and waiting for it to
actually load that up but the you 11
life has proven itself a reliable
companion because of its good color
reproduction and sharpness in all but
the low-light situations things do fall
apart pretty easily even when you're
indoors where there's less light but
with the steady hand you can still get
some good photos without the
stabilization I compared pictures
between this and the original u11 and
found that the U 11 life still provided
some pretty comparable quality photos
the main reason why the U 11 life
falters is because of its higher
aperture and also the lack of OIS like
we've already mentioned the original u
11 obviously gets better specifications
overall but the lower specifications of
the u 11 life proportionally reflect
what its overall prices and that's
actually the story of the U 11 life in
general now this is a phone that takes
the flagship experience and just
proportionally brings them down in order
to reflect the price point there are
times when the camera might actually
remind us that we're using a budget
device but HTC has done a good job in
making sure you don't feel like you're
really missing out that's the best part
about this phone that comes in at 300
and $50 $349 to be exact or $300
outright if you happen to be on the
t-mobile network and if you are looking
to get a phone on t-mobile for a cheap
price $12 a month is kind of one of the
best entry points or a device like this
so it's refreshing to approach the end
of the year when the high note struck by
a phone that only cost that much no
matter which version you pick the cents
Edition or the Android one Edition the
main story here is the phones value for
money HTC has made a mid-range version
of their flagship device that shouldn't
actually make anyone feel like they're
missing out and we think that that's the
best part of it as always thank you guys
very much for watching and we hope you
enjoyed this review of the HTC u 11 life
