brought to you by Full Sail University
so it looks like HTC might be making a
little money now so what's going on
HTC made some major news last week when
it announced that monthly revenue hit a
six-month high last month
what initiated such success well it
could be the new HTC One a9 smartphone
which features a brand new design
language cleaner leaner Sense build
given the misgivings fans and critics
had about this year's flagship proper
the one m9 all eyes are now on the
prospects of 2016 and what may come
forth today we have a slightly better
clue thanks to the leaker lab Toofer he
said this remember reports about HTC's
next flagship codenamed HTC o2 well it's
dead HTC perfume is its next flagship it
has Android 6.1 and Sense 8.0 GP
provided this information is accurate
the new flagship is now called the HTC
perfume it's currently unknown if this
is implied to be the final name of the
device or simply the company's internal
codename the o2 for reference was
rumored to include a six inch quad HD
display
it's Snapdragon 820 system and a chip
four gigabytes of RAM 64 or 128
gigabytes of on-board storage and a 3500
milliamp hour battery now when some
people saw the sense 8.0 GP some thought
that the GP stood for the Google Play
Store meaning a Google Play Store
edition of the HTC perfume but I think
that's wishful thinking if it were truly
a Google Play edition we would have seen
that in the name of the actual device
not of cents 8.0 what do you think am I
wrong now let's talk about the alleged
Xiaomi me v render an alleged render of
the Xiaomi me5 smartphone has been
leaked online the leaked image shows us
the front side of shammies upcoming
flagship which reveals a physical home
button sitting right below the display
of the phone if the render is indeed
accurate according to reputed Chinese
analysts Pandu Tang the me5 will not
make use of
welcomes new ultrasonic fingerprint
scanner technology which the analyst
says isn't ready for primetime just yet
thus we can expect a traditional
fingerprint scanner just like the ones
on the latest Apple iPhones Samsung
Galaxy handsets etc the me five is
rumored to be powered by qualcomm
snapdragon 820 chipset and paired with
quad HD display four gigabytes of RAM a
16 megapixel rear camera and a 3000
milliamp hour battery there's also a
rumor that the me5 will come with a
force touch equipped screen but nothing
can be confirmed as of yet now let's
talk Android tablets or Android laptops
it's been a while since we've heard
anything about the pixel C tablet
leaving many consumers wondering when
they'll be able to get their hands on
one but this week we have good news you
can now purchase the pixel C from the
Google Play Store starting at $499 us we
know $4.99 isn't cheap especially when
it comes to the tablet market and that
premium price point is just for the
tablet itself you'll need to spend an
additional $149 for the fancy magnetic
keyboard or the keyboard folio we
recommend the former the tablet comes in
both 32 and 62 bite flavors with the
higher storage option going to $5.99 us
if you need a refresher the pixel C
boasts an impressive 10.2 inch LCD
display with 2560 by 1800 resolution and
a pixel density of 308 PPI
it's powered by NVIDIA Tegra x1
processor 3 gigabytes of RAM at 34.2
watt hour battery and runs Android 6.0
marshmallow it also comes with an 8
megapixel rear camera and a 2 megapixel
front-facing camera and has USB type-c
port for charging and data transfer so I
think between how to become TV and
xda-developers TV to previous YouTube
channels I worked for where I
interviewed over a hundred and 20
software developers what became very
clear is that there is a gap between the
instructional theory you learn in the
classroom as a developer and the
hands-on work experience and our sponsor
Full Sail University addresses that
issue they give you both Full Sail
University's web design and development
