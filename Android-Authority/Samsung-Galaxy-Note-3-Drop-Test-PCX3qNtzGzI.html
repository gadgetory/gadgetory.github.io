what's going on everybody and I'm here
at the beautiful La Arboretum in the
wonderful six to six to bring you
another drop test and this time we're
talking about the Samsung Galaxy Note 3
this is the one that just came out and
it has a bit of a different design
philosophy so we want to see how it
holds up to our drop test instead of
glossy plastic it's a textured plastic
the sides are a lot flatter and overall
its design is just a little more
decisive if you will now we're going to
jump right into it but you guys know the
drill I'm about five six so I'm going to
be dropping it from about five feet
right on its back and then on a side
which is its bottom and then finally on
its face so one thing you have to know
though job tests can be kind of random
I'm gonna do my best to get it to drop
perfectly onto the floor but even if it
drops a little bit weird we'll see how
it how it does when it hits the floor
let's get drop it here is the first test
on the samsung galaxy note 3 falling
flat on its back well hopefully alright
all the cameras should be going and oh
and
the only real damage that you can see is
right around here where it landed
there's a couple scratches there but
other than that the note three seems to
have survived the back test but let's
see how it fares in our side test where
we drop it right on to its bottom so
here we go it comes our side test drop
it right on to its bottom and here we go
okay and for the most part the Samsung
Galaxy Note 3 seems to have sustained
very little damage it did land pretty
squarely on its bottom maybe on the
maybe just on the front side more than
the back side but as you can see the
back cover is starting to come off just
a little bit but of course we could just
snap that right back into place but
there are some real scuffs right there
as you can see the back cover does snap
right back into place we just have a lot
of scratches on the bottom side right
here I also just wanted to show you very
quickly that this is still an operating
device operational device rather there
you go I'm able to get through
everything just fine it's all there so
after two tests we still have a very
well working phone all right the final
drop test this time flat on its face
let's see what happens
checking on my camera and let's see what
happens in three two one
oh you could already see it what oh you
could already see it and so there it is
just like we expected the screen
completely we're almost completely
shattered it landed pretty squarely on
its front and on the top-left corner you
can see that kind of where all of the
spider webs actually began but then it
kind of rippled through and now we have
this lovely little pattern of a broken
glass screen in front of us you do have
somewhat of the fear that you might cut
yourself on the screen I can feel all of
the little shards hitting my finger as I
bring the drop down down but yeah the
screen still looks to be operational
despite all of these cracks that are
here and I really hope I'm not cutting
myself
doing this on a hot day in Los Angeles
we found out that the Samsung Galaxy
Note 3 is more than just a textured back
well more than that really because we
had to land on its back and nothing
really happens we had to land on its
bottom and it really just scuff the
paint but then we had to fall flat on
its face and as you can see right here
all these spider webs on the screen it's
cracked almost beyond recognition but
when we turned on the phone it still
worked
you could definitely still use this
phone much like many iPhones out there
the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is still
operational even after a few drops so
even though you should probably be
replacing your screen it'll still work
even if you crack it so there you have
it for this drop test on the samsung
galaxy note 3 as always stay tuned to
android authority for all of the best
coverage because we're your source for
