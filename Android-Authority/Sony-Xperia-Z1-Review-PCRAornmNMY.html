all thought hey Sony still got it but we
did stop just short of saying that Sony
was back at the top of the mountain when
it came to the smartphone game however
with the release of their newest
flagship device Sony is hoping that it
won't just be called the one but it will
actually be the one hey it's Josh regard
from Android authority what's going on
everybody and this is the Sony Xperia z1
Sony has put all its cards on the table
for the Xperia z1 drawing not only from
their design prowess their media acumen
but also their pedigree and photography
to create what could be one of the best
phones available now in terms of design
it's hard not to see shades of the
original Xperia Z in this phone not only
does it have the generally rigid
rectangular shape with flat sides it
also retains the black slate look with a
strong metal frame encased almost
entirely in glass the front and back of
this phone is completely black leaving
all of the action for the sides we do
get the sony logo up front while the
optics of the 20.7 megapixel camera are
nestled in the top left corner on the
back as has become a motif of many
Xperia smartphones the button layout is
all found on the right side and is
centered around a large silver metal
power button below it here are the
volume rockers and a two-stage camera
button while all of these buttons feel
very sturdy and thankfully lacks
squishiness especially in the very
responsive camera button their
positioning might not be optimal for
some the main buttons fall perfectly
where my thumb lands which i think is
great but other people might
accidentally trigger them from time to
time above this over power button and
also directly on the other side of it or
a few covers that are also common for
Xperia smartphones these cover up the
SIM card slot the SD card slot and then
the microUSB port for the purpose of
water and dust resistance I always have
some reservations regarding small
plastic covers because they can break
off but these seem pretty well
constructed in the hand you realize that
this phone isn't quite as rigid as the
Xperia Z and this is because the sides
of the phone have been given subtle
curves Sony found the intersection when
it comes to feel allowing the z1 to have
a decisive shape while feeling pretty
smooth it is also quite heavier than the
original Z at about 30 more grams but
this just gives the z1 a more
feel overall the z1 has a look that is
becoming more and more familiar to us
but it is just unique enough this time
around to be welcoming ly different sony
has really been working hard to bring a
better display experience after the
Xperia Z which came with a pretty
admittedly subpar screen what was once
just called the Bravia Engine is now the
ex reality engine underneath what is now
called a triluminos display capable of
1080p resolution at 441 PPI we're
starting to get spoiled by small bezels
and current top-tier smartphones however
so the thicker ones around the Xperia
z1s display might be a little
disappointing but only a little at least
for me straight on this is a great
screen complementing the darker tones of
the Timescape UI very well when it comes
to media I do still get shades of a
small Sony television with this Xperia
smartphone all in all it's a very
enjoyable experience
I certainly had a great time watching
the colorful first episode of planet
Earth I feel the need to explain that
while viewing angles might not be a
definitive feature of a screen having
good viewing angles is still the mark of
a good screen that being said the angles
on the z1 while much better than the
ones on the original Xperia Z could
still use some improvement a grayish hue
casts over everything when you get steep
enough but this isn't the only thing I
noticed the backlighting of the screen
kind of shows up on the sides look at
the screen at an angle and you can see a
white line along the very edge of the
screen it's far from distracting but it
is one of those things that you can't
stop noticing for a while after you do
for the first time the Xperia z1 is one
in a long line of new phones coming out
with the next iteration of the Qualcomm
processor the powerful Snapdragon 800
clocked in at 2.3 gigahertz this
processor is backed by the also updated
Adreno 330 and 2 gigabytes of RAM does
anyone employees it quite well
keeping its high-speed basically
throughout from the home screens to
within apps some smoother transitions in
the updated Timescape UI helped further
illustrate all of this to be fair
Timescape is a less intensive version of
Android than most so that helps a lot
Gaming is a breeze as well with every
game in my newly acquired Humble Bundle
moving along very well and without
stutter rest assured that the Sony
Xperia z1 keeps up with the best in the
smartphone game today in the hardware
department the Xperia smartphones
generally have
water and dust resistance making them
capable of braving the elements the z1
has IP 58 certification making it able
to withstand up to 30 minutes in 1 meter
of water if you're a little clumsy
around your phone it will bounce right
back after a spill or a dip while the
battery might be non removable
expandable storage is definitely a
welcome addition allowing for more than
just the 16 gigabytes built in call
quality through the top speaker was
adequate and clear but not particularly
crisp what it did have was volume as at
full blast the sound of the person on
the other line was pretty loud and clear
to others the main speaker on the bottom
of the phone is much larger than was
found in previous experience and
actually translates to somewhat richer
sound perhaps ironically however it does
like some volume and can be drowned out
rather easily by outside noise the z1
comes with a large 3000 milliamp hour
battery that performs pretty well I was
able to get the battery down to about
60% in 6 hours with my personal flavor
of usage this included a couple episodes
of planet Earth playing a couple games
shooting pictures and video and
performing benchmark tests the batteries
should be able to get you through a
standard workday just fine though really
heavy power users might have to keep a
charging cord handy arguably the biggest
story with the Sony Xperia z1 is it's
very beefed up camera offering it's as a
right next to the actual unit underneath
the large g4 G lens this is a
custom-made Exmor RS sensor larger than
most cell phone cameras and is capable
of a whopping 20 point 7 megapixels the
technical information will please fotox
as this camera is a wide 27 millimeter
shooter with a very good f 2.0 aperture
that really helps with low-light
shooting unfortunately all of this
positivity doesn't really translate to
the actual app the newest additions are
some new functions made available by
downloaded add-ons these do include
augmented reality or even a social life
that broadcast to Facebook it's a pretty
simplistic and classic layout with the
right-side housing the main buttons and
the viewfinder taking up the appropriate
amount of the screen depending on the
aspect ratio speaking of which setting
the right aspect ratio is something you
have to do in the manual mode which also
allows you to change the ISO exposure
compensation and white balance if you
hit for the superior auto mode it
automatically picks the 16 by 9 ass
which is preferred but unfortunately
brings the picture size down to 8
megapixels which is kind of a really big
bummer for that matter the 20 megapixel
shooting is rather exclusive as the next
step down from it is a steep drop to
that an 8 megapixel count all of that
aside the picture quality coming from
the z1 s camera is really quite stellar
all of these shots were taken at the 20
megapixel 4 by 3 ratio in manual mode
with everything set to its normal
setting sony proves its prowess once
again with pictures that are incredibly
detailed and have a great level of color
vibrance
the color reproduction is pretty
accurate and though I would venture to
say it is a little on the saturated side
it is just enough to add an attractive
vibrancy to pictures and not much else a
high noise reduction makes some of the
darker parts of the picture lose a
little detail to keep the noise level
low but it doesn't keep pictures from
remaining really nice the video quality
is also very good with full HD capturing
available all in all this is a camera
that many a user will enjoy and
especially in the daylight it is one of
the best camera phones I have ever used
and now we come to software which
actually isn't all that big a story as
Sony hasn't changed a whole lot in the
Timescape UI it takes many of the
tenants from stock Android the simple
homescreen AB drawer soft keys the
drop-down with some power widgets at the
top and the recent ABS functionality and
overall it gives it a much darker tone
the result is an operating system that
is comparable as speedy especially as
Sony's main additions are in the form of
many more transitions that help make
everything look even more buttery smooth
Sony's own additions make a return here
like the album movies and walkman apps
that bring nice media experiences other
than that however the only other real
additions to this otherwise classical
version of Android are the small apps
these are small overlays that you can
use for quick multitasking active clip
has been added for quick editable
screenshots along with Gmail ultimately
it's a nice looking UI that sits pretty
squarely in the middle there are just
enough additions without going overboard
and yet it is simplistic enough without
getting boring finally we have the price
while the Xperia z1 isn't quite
available on US carriers just yet we
wouldn't be surprised if it was priced
at least at 199 dollars for two-year
contracts however currently in online
retailers it is at
least $750 unlocked Sony typically
offers premium pricing for their premium
phones and this is no exception and so
there you have it even if it does miss
in a few small places it's hard not to
like the Xperia z1 as a whole package
the screen is still very enjoyable if
not perfectly executed the performance
really doesn't disappoint and the
upgraded camera is a wonderful performer
that should even please hobbyist shutter
bugs whether or not this is Sony finally
getting back to the top of the mountain
remains to be seen but personally I
think they've certainly done closer with
the Xperia z1 everybody thank you so
much for watching and I hope you enjoyed
this full review just remember that this
is not the end of our Xperia z1 coverage
