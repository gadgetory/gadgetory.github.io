what's going on everybody and here we
are with Android TV I have the lovely
Chelsea here giving us a demo of the
interface and what kind of applications
we'll be able to go through one thing I
do have to explain real quick though is
even though this is coming through a box
we're not gonna be seeing any of the
live TV capabilities of this but that's
okay because this is not exactly or
rather the boxes that are being given
out to developers at the show are not
going to be truly indicative of what the
final consumer types are going to be but
at least we can see what Android really
looks like on a TV in this particular
interface and Chelsea is going to show
us what it's all about
I'm gonna hand the mic to her but I'm
gonna get it back from at some point so
make sure you guys sit back and enjoy
this Thanks
so there are two ways you can control
Android TV you can do it through a
wireless remote like this you know to
play games and I'll show that in a
little bit you can also do it through
your phone so this is I'm not sure if
you'll be able to see it but how the app
looks right now just a prototype and
you're able to control toggle through
the banners or there's just an up down
right left
so the first banner you have is in this
case recently watched content so we
watched the lego movie a little earlier
you've got a couple of other things we
looked up and then you're going to start
to see apps and content that the app
would suggest based on things you've
liked the things you've watched and
things you've searched that's pushed
through the app not Google then we move
down to the next banner which is apps
those are not just movie like Netflix or
TV shows it can also be something like
Songza so you could play music in your
living room or so you know this is
really just meant to be a way to access
all the content you need and want in
your living room or wherever else you
might have a TV and then we move down to
games so I'm gonna take you back up and
show you a voice search which I think is
the coolest part of Android TV with
voice search you can do anything you
would search on Google so you can search
something like who is the President of
the United States
the United States of America and then
you'll see YouTube clips as well as
people that you search for probably
after you search Barack Obama you can
also of course look for TV or movies
it's it's topical I guess it's topical
okay so we'll try now I'll do it that
hurt us I'm a Julia
they tried okay now we're gonna do an
actual search Jennifer Lawrence
and that would show you again a
knowledge panel movies on google play
that Jennifer Lawrence is in Jennifer
Lawrence related YouTube clips and then
actors or in some cases it's also just
other people that are searched for when
you're looking for this actress you can
also do with genre I think this is kind
of cool or something around a date
movies from the 9th movies from the
1960s so you can do something like this
you can also say science fiction movies
from the 70s so some of these are a
little more current but again it just
looks like the most common searches and
results around these queries so if we go
back and while this will just have it
back in a home button can we can keep
going back and I'm gonna pass the mic
back over so you can see it game I'll
provide commentary so do they Leo's
fortune is this the one that your you're
supposed to be playing because it was
shown at the keynote I think yes I think
the graphics are gorgeous I'd never
heard of I'm not a big gamer so I'd
never heard of it until yesterday all
right there we go
this looks really nice on the actual
display like it's actually really good
I mean it's not necessarily just scaled
up is that it looks like it's actually
made for the resolution and all the
games are made specifically for Android
TV so what is the what exactly is the
premise of the game what's what's your
goal
does it get to the end or so far it's a
pretty gorgeous calm experience in which
I understand I'm supposed to collect
coins it's gonna get harder but as you
can see even this is hard for me and
that's right so now you'll start to sort
of have these more physical challenges
where right now this is again the
easiest well you look at that you just
impaled the little guy
that's right it's just to get to the end
but it kind of gets increasingly
difficult to do that a lot of its just
playing with the control and using the
weight of Leo he's a little bit cocky I
will tell you sometimes when he well he
does well he really can show off and the
only thing he can really do is get
bigger hmm
so there we go see yes
of Android TV we're really excited about
it and it should ship by q4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
