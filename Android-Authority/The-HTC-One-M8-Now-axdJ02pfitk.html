well-received metal-clad phone continue
to receive awards for its now refined
design and underneath it hoped to be
everything that would make people choose
this one over other flagships and though
a lot of people took to the eye-catching
design and snatched up this particular
phone that was then and this is the HTC
One m8 now one thing we will always give
H do you see when it comes to their
announcements of phones is that they
usually keep it pretty simple the same
could be said about their marketing
strategies especially with this
particular ad that they used but that is
a different issue that we would talk
about probably another time but the same
could also be said for what was offered
in the m8 itself this time around the
second I appeared on the top of the
phone above the four ultra pixel optics
that HTC was still touting as the best
low light experience but this time
around the second camera module was
going to bring depth data to photos and
the end results would be better depth of
field similar to DSLR shooters this was
a bit of a swerve considering what once
was rumored to be a dual camera shooter
now the dual camera Edition wasn't for
3d picture shooting but instead it was
for adding effects and Aiden unfocused
effects to just about any picture after
you take it aside from the phone one
nice aspect of this new flagship that I
will mention was the addition of many
in-house accessories for the one which
wasn't always the case with Android
devices and given the out of box
thinking with the dot view case in
particular the HTC One m8 felt more like
an experience rather than just a raw
power device for the spec hungry masses
once we got our hands on the actual
device what impressed us about the phone
at the announcement and during our first
hands-on continue to impress us and the
HTC One m8 still continues to be one of
the most beautiful phones that are
available today and also this particular
design became quite desired from a
number of people who wanted their
flagships to be constructed very
similarly to this with its metal body
and a great design all around and the
design continued underneath with a sense
UI that was actually pretty simplistic
but still very elegant and because you
didn't have to fiddle too much with the
user interface in order to get the
day-to-day experience down this was a
phone that could please a lot of the
common users but it didn't come without
its detractors the brushed metal is
still one of the most slippery services
to you
and complaints about the phone slipping
about have been observed though the
rounded sides add to the look we still
don't think they provide the best grip
but that is alleviated somewhat by the
narrowness of the phone itself and
though we might not see any changes to
this in the near future the htc bar at
the bottom remains a sore point for many
users and we've been constantly told
that this bar helps accommodate the
sheer amount of tech in the body which
does make a little bit of sense and
speaking of that tech there's not a
whole lot that you can say about the
boom sound speakers because they are
still one of the most widely regarded
ways of consuming media on a smartphone
today HTC Sense continued to get better
and though it is a pretty different take
on the stock Android experience it is
also one of the easiest to navigate out
there a vertical app drawer felt odd for
a little while blinkfeed was still a
nice way of getting the general
headlines from the news or social media
feeds and it is still considered a
better second homescreen edition than
the competition though adding contextual
colors to sections of the interface
sounded like a good idea it was kind of
moot because I prefer to have everything
in monotone or black once I found that
option was available for me it just
matched the general dark look of sense
better where there was some real
contention was in the camera
it's an iteration from HTC that still
used the ultra pixel construction while
low-light performance was always an
issue with Android flagships HTC hoped
to alleviate their smaller megapixel
pictures by trying to remedy this very
problem and in some cases it proved to
be true but my biggest gripe with the
One m8 was really its exposure often I
would get pictures that were simply not
of an accurate color reproduction or of
a proper exposure opting for either
blown out or darker images depending on
where your focus and exposure were
tapped in the viewfinder when you took
the photo while gaining good photos is
definitely possible with the One m8 it
just didn't happen as often as we would
have liked which is where we get into
the dual camera capability in short
getting depth information for every
single photo was a very nice idea but
execution didn't really do it justice
when shooting a proper subject in a
photo the dual camera effects would
definitely find the spot and try to
stitch it up for a nice bokeh effect but
oftentimes the effect would bleed into
the wrong parts of the photo with this
first step already causing some issues
trying to put extra effects on top of
the bouquet actually exacerbated the
issue not to mention the fact that many
of the effects HTC put in the One m8
were more or less hokey or just plain
impractical
one part we did like about the camera
experience was the highlight reel made
possible by Zoe in the gallery though
you might sometimes forget that you can
use the Zoe camera to get short clips or
even burst shots of your scene doing so
could result in a really nice recap of
an event or day in your life and when
done well it was a nice low surprise to
come back to
in this quick revisit to the HTC One m8
it still looks like the phone everyone
wants because of its nearly flawless
design it certainly is different from
all of the other phones in the space and
if you're the kind of person that wants
to get a bit of attention for your let's
say fashion choice of a phone the One m8
is certainly the best bet it's just a
disappointment that HTC couldn't exactly
get the camera rights and even today it
is overshadowed by other cameras that
forgo tricks and perhaps gimmicky
additions in order to provide an easy to
use an effective photo taking experience
despite the day-to-day user experience
of the m8 remaining one of the best this
is only one side of the story and the
camera experience is the shave year or
sometimes blown out other side all of
that changes in the HTC One m9 which has
a further refined design a sign that HTC
knows where their flagship line has its
drinks and there is also a much more
powerful 20 megapixel camera that makes
ultrapixel a front-facing iteration this
time which is a great idea and since is
getting even better without trying too
hard to change what makes it highly
accessible but you're going to just have
to keep it tuned to Android authority
until that review comes out which is
actually coming very shortly and you can
see what our verdict is on the HTC One
m9 it just might be the refining that
the HTC one line has needed but until
then keep it tuned to Android authority
