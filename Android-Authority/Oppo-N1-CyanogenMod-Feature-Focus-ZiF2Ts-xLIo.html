Authority what's going on everybody and
today we're going to revisit the oboe
and one now this is the large phone from
oboe with a rotating camera that did
receive some good reviews from most
primarily because it does manage to be a
very good smartphone with a little bit
of uniqueness built in however what has
really distinguished this phone in
recent weeks is the fact that it's
supposed to be the CyanogenMod phone now
that is not supposed to be the official
name of this particular phone but it
does come with CyanogenMod and you are
able to install it once the files are
available at opos website a limited
edition of this phone will be made
available with CyanogenMod built in now
again it's a limited edition so the rest
of you who get an n1 will just have to
install it yourself and about a week ago
you saw me put up a picture showing that
I did exactly that now why did this
particular video take a little bit of
time to come out well primarily that is
because the CyanogenMod that is found on
this phone that I am about to show you
and I'll sensibly the ones you're going
to see across the Internet at the moment
are likely not going to be the final
versions there's still an update that
has to be released for that version of
Sandwich and mod that will make it the
final version and once it does it will
be made available for all of your n1
goodness so if you are already familiar
with CyanogenMod then you probably have
a lot of the elements already down let's
go ahead and unlock it and what we have
here is a pretty typical android lock
screen and CyanogenMod allows you to
customize the lock screen with a bunch
of different shortcuts in the ring right
here then that was always a very welcome
addition and also of course the widgets
right on top so if we just unlock the
phone it really just just looked like a
stock Android build and that is
essentially what CyanogenMod goes for is
just keeping the very very pure version
of Android but also adding in a lot more
customizability like for example well
first we have the folders here the home
screens I only use one home screen
actually and the app drawer
one thing that you are able to customize
and is very welcomed at least for me is
the the capacitive keys at the bottom
can be customized to have different
functions so if for example the menu
button over here
you don't want it to be for menu you
want it to be for the recent apps which
is a typical function for stock Android
then you can always make that do the
case so that is a very welcome addition
there and you're also able to customize
what holding them does so holding the
home button of course goes to Google now
for me as usual is the case that if you
bring down two fingers then you get the
power widget however if you go from the
very right you still get the power of
widget also the two finger swipe is of
course what you get in pretty much every
version of Android that takes advantage
of the notification shade however on the
elbow and one with CyanogenMod you can
also swipe down from the right now
here's where things kind of get
interesting
of course the Oppo n1 comes with a few
particular functions or features that
the operating system should be able to
take advantage of and one of them is of
course this rotating camera but there is
also the Oh touch area on the back this
is just a swiping area that allows you
to get a few functions a few different
tasks done mostly just swiping and
tapping for particular things that you
want to be able to get done because the
screen is huge enough already
it just is supposed to add to comfort
now whether or not this little area is
good for you is pretty much depends on
whether or not it's comfortable for me
I'm able to swipe back and forth pretty
easily on here but on CyanogenMod I
wasn't sure if the Oh touch area was
being taken advantage of
so I searched around for a little while
and it it took it took a little bit of
searching but someone finally pointed me
to an area of the settings that I almost
never go to and that's language and
input now of course the reason why is
because well if it's in English that's
pretty much all I need to know so I
never go here nonetheless if you go to
language and input and you come all the
way down to the bottom there it is the
Oh touch settings
Oh touch settings it can be enabled you
could do double tap to capture inside of
the camera which I'll show you in a bit
and you can long press to launch the
camera I don't like using that because
there are times when my finger just
stays on the back and I'm unable to stop
it from loading the camera so let's head
back here and I'll just go open the app
drawer and there you can see the actual
Oh touch is working beautifully
working just fine and let's go ahead and
take a quick self-portrait in the camera
it can be a little finicky after all yet
to just get the tap just right but if I
go like that there you go go ahead and
double tap in order to take pictures so
selfies on the no on the n1 with
CyanogenMod or just about as easy as
they were when you're in the color OS
and then of course the other addition
that is available in the Oppo n1 is its
little buddy that it comes bundled with
and that is the oke click the O click
this nice little looking just module
here that connects to your phone via
bluetooth was available for the n1 in
the color OS and it has a lot of very
very obvious functions just finding your
phone or finding the old click and the
camera shutter release using just the
button that's on here well when it comes
to sandwich in mug that option is also
found in the settings under the button
menu and after you get it set up you
have a remote camera shutter button
available for the soun Genma camera and
I can just show you that right now
there's the O click in my hand and boom
the last thing at least in terms of
CyanogenMod taking advantage of n1
functionality is when it comes to
gestures now in the color OS in my
original review for the n1 one of my
favorite parts about it was that gesture
area you swipe down from the top left of
the screen and you will get a canvas in
which you can program and draw any
number of gestures made for opening
various apps however when it comes to
CyanogenMod on the Oppo n1 we don't
necessarily have a gesture area or a
canvas to be able to draw but a few
gestures that are programmed in can be
accessed via when the phone is locked
that's right when you lock the phone the
screen still takes presses let's say I
wanted to unlock my phone without having
to reach for the button just double tap
on the screen and there is our
lockscreen just go right in after that
there are two more gestures that you can
use if you remember drawing a circle in
color OS and the canvas allows you to
get to the camera well if I just draw a
circle right here on the screen and go
straight into the camera so that's
really nice a nice easy way to get to
the camera and then finally for all of
you out there who get lost in the dark a
lot
drawing a V we'll turn on the torch and
there it is so that is your look at
CyanogenMod on the Oppo n1 now I call it
a feature focus primarily because being
able to install this OS on the n1 to me
is a great feature
after all the n1 comes built with its
own recovery built in and that allows
you to install not just the CM ROM but
also any other certified ROM that's Oppo
deems okay to use with the n1 of course
our mod is the main one so you're able
to just jump into the phone have the ROM
already situated inside of the file
system of your phone and when you boot
into the recovery by holding the down
button as you power on the phone you can
select the ROM and it gets installed
allows you to intersperse between the
different kinds of roms if you so please
and that's something that I might do
from time to time because I am actually
a fan of the color OS that being said
though CyanogenMod is a very accessible
ROM and a lot of you out there might
install it on your end ones just because
CyanogenMod is a very easy operating
system to use now as a final reiteration
I will say that the Oppo n1 comes in two
different flavors but the flavor that
comes with CyanogenMod built in will be
a limited edition that is yet to be
released and one that does come out you
might want to jump on it as fast as
possible because like I said it's a
limited edition however rest assured
that installing signage in mod on the n1
is about as easy as they can get when it
comes to routing you don't even have to
route the phone you just have to open up
the recovery because all of that is
already done for you don't worry when
Sanja mod is officially out in its final
version for to the N one I will show you
exactly how to do it so as always thank
you very much for watching and this was
your future focus on the Oppo n1 dealing

install and what it can do stay tuned to
