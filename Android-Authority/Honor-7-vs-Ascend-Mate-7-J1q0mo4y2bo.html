but last year while we announced it
ascend mate 7 and delivered its first
all-metal smartphone this year Huawei
has released the honor 7 which brings an
updated all-metal bill and an experience
that's definitely been inspired by the
May 7 but how do these two devices
compare hey what's up guys is arrived
here for Android authority bringing you
a quick look at how the Huawei honor 7
compares to the ascend mate 7 phablet
one of the first things you'll notice
about either of these 2 devices is that
they come with all metal aluminium build
the ascend mate 7 was huawei's first
premium metal clad smartphone and the
company has clearly learned from this
experience with the honor 7 adopting an
improved build in a smaller body a key
difference between the finish on each
handset is down to the matte finish on
the honor 7 which is a very welcome
change the ascend mate 7 has a slightly
slippery finish but the matte finish on
the honor 7 coupled with blasted ceramic
particles provides a lot more grip a
problem I faced with the ascend mate 7
is that it scratches quite easily but
the honor 7 looks like it won't have the
same issue
thanks to this improved finish making
smart phones is always a challenge and
OMS regularly have to compromise between
putting a large display and making the
handset usable the ascend mate 7 is
definitely on the larger side thanks to
its super-sized display and
unsurprisingly the smaller honor 7 is a
lot more manageable in the hand at 8.5
millimeters thick the honor 7 is point
six millimeters thicker than the ascend
mate 7 but 28 grams lighter and this
difference in the build results in a
handset that feels more sturdy and
reliable in the hand on the back both
handsets look very similar to one
another but there are some considerable
differences not least in the camera and
the screen sensor beneath it the mate 7
is Huawei's first smartphone to come
with the fingerprint sensor and stands
out as you can unlock your phone just by
tapping the sensor even when the display
switched off while the sensors do look
identical the fingerprint sensor on the
honor 7 has been updated and doesn't
come with a metallic ring around it
which is a world first for smartphones
on the May 7 the fingerprint sensor is
limited to just unlocking the phone
but on Dioner 7 it has gained a few
extra and very useful features these
include the ability to return to the
home screen by pressing and holding the
sensor accessing notifications by
swiping down on it and accessing the
recent apps menu by swiping up on the
sensor both handsets feature the power
and volume keys on the right with the
SIM card tray on the left but in making
the honor 7 Huawei has made some welcome
improvements the honor 7 also comes with
a new smart key that lets you launch
favorite applications or toggle certain
features as an example I have it set up
so a single press launches Twitter a
double press takes a screenshot and a
long press pulls up Google now a
changing Huawei's design strategy over
the past 12 months has meant the company
is moved away from a rear mounted
speaker to a bottom mounted one the
mate7 speaker is located on the rear and
while it is certainly not bad the mono
speaker on the bottom of the honor 7 is
definitely more pleasing the bottom of
the honor 7 also comes with new machine
grilled holes that house the speaker but
are designed to make the experience a
little bit more premium the ascend mate
7 is definitely one of the largest
devices on the market and in making the
honor 7 while we reduce the screen size
significantly while keeping the same
resolution that mate 7 has a 6 inch full
HD display while the honor 7 screen is
reduced to a much more manageable 5.2
inches thanks to the same resolution but
a much smaller display the density on
the on a 7 display is much higher at 424
pixels per inch and this definitely
shows with the honor 7 display appearing
sharper to the eye
despite the smaller display the honor 7
has a lower screen to body ratio with
while we are making the display
frameless on the ascend May 7 but having
to add small bezels to either side of
the honor 7 screen there's no denying
that the honor 7 was heavily inspired by
the mate 7 but in making its latest
handset the Chinese company has made
some very welcome improvements both of
these handsets come with octa-core
processors and while we zone high
silicon keyring chipset but there's a
key difference in which chipset is being
used the mate 7 sports an older Kiran 9
to 5 while the honor 7 features a Kiran
935 and other than the p8 Mac's is the
first Huawei smartphone to use this new
chipset both handsets use cortex
processors in a big little formation but
the
seven uses older cortex a15 and a seven
calls while the honor seven uses eight
cortex a53 cause with a much higher
clock speed the mate7 is available in
two options one with 16 gigabytes
internal storage and 2 gigabytes of RAM
and the other with 32 gigabyte storage
and 3 gigabytes RAM in comparison the
honor 7 comes with 3 gigabytes RAM as
standard and either 16 gigabytes or 64
gigabytes of storage it's worth noting
that the 64 gigabyte variant of the
honor 7 is only sold in China and while
we is yet to reveal whether this will be
made available elsewhere
both the mate 7 and the honor 7 come
with expandable storage but on the honor
7 the micro SD card slot doubles up at
the dual sim card slot a feature much
lauded in the mate 7 is dual sim support
but this is only present in certain
variants of the handset and certainly
not the variant that launched in Europe
in comparison the honor 7 will support
dual SIM in every market with one sim
available for LTE use and the other
limited to just calls or SMS a feature
that particularly stands out on the May
7 is the enormous 4100 milliamp hour non
removable battery which is definitely on
the larger side of the market the mate 7
has a larger battery than most of its
rivals and this translated to excellent
battery life in testing I found that it
lasted a couple of days with moderate to
heavy usage while the honor 7 has a much
smaller 3100 milliamp hour battery while
we claim it can still last 1.2 days with
heavy usage and over two and a half days
with moderate usage for the times when
it is running low the honor 7 also has
you covered as it is the first Huawei
smartphone to come with quick charging
built-in compatible with both the
British and the European standards quick
charging means you can charge for five
minutes to make up to an hour's worth of
calls and charge to 50% battery in just
13 minutes both phones also come with
dual antenna and signal plus technology
which promises to ensure that the metal
build never interferes with the signal
strength using the dual antenna design
the handset can intelligently switch
between antenna in a microsecond
depending on which is providing the best
signal strength alongside this the honor
7 also supports Wi-Fi plus technology
which improves battery life by
automatically disabling Wi-Fi and then
re-enabling it
recognises you are near unknown Wi-Fi
network both inmate 7 and the honor 7
come with other hardware specs you would
probably expect from a modern smartphone
these include Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy
and LT cat 6 which offers download
speeds of up to 300 megabits per second
and upload speeds of up to 50 megabits
per second on the go the honor 7 also
comes with Wi-Fi AC which promises
better Wi-Fi performance and an infrared
port which lets you control your smart
appliances from your phone another key
change in the honor 7 compared to the
mate 7 is in the camera the 13 megapixel
camera on the mate 7 isn't the best on
the market but has been improved
massively with the honor 7 now sporting
a Sony AMX 230 module which delivers 20
megapixel resolution and all importantly
phase detection autofocus while we claim
the honor 7 can focus on a subject in
unbusy row point 1 seconds which makes
it the fastest in the world on a
smartphone and while it's difficult to
test this the honor 7 is certainly no
slouch at focusing on a subject the
camera has also been protected with
sapphire crystal which insures the
protruding camera does not scratch and
is difficult to damage the honor 7 comes
with a range of software based features
that initially launched on the p8
earlier this year and these include the
good food time-lapse and like painting
modes Huawei has also added a couple of
new features to the honor 7 camera
including a D mist filter to remove fog
or smog from photos a star tracking mode
to capture the night sky and two
additions to the light painting mode in
the form of the silky water and
taillight tracking up front the mate7
has a 5-megapixel selfie camera but the
honor 7 topsis with an 8 megapixel
camera and two crucial new features
first the presence of a soft light lets
you capture selfies in varying lighting
conditions and second a new perfect
selfie mode lets you replace your face
in group shots with a pre-programmed
image which ensures you always look good
when you take a group selfie one concern
that many people have with huawei
smartphones is the emotion UI software
which is otherwise known as Mui and it's
very similar to Marmite in that you
either like it or you don't an issue
raised by many Android enthusiasts is
regarding software updates and this is
an issue that definitely impacts on
while we're device is almost a year
after it launched on Android 4.4.2
KitKat
the mate7 still runs on the older
software version but this is not
necessarily a bad thing as we covered in
our Huawei p8 review earlier this year
Wiley's latest in motion UI version 3.1
comes with some rather strange UI tweaks
such as the navigation menu when
notifications are difficult to read but
the older emui on the May 7 doesn't
suffer from these sadly these quirks
make their way to the honor 7 but while
Huawei hasn't fixed all of these
elements it has added a few new
interesting features the knuckle
screenshot which was absolutely
atrocious from the p8 has been improved
so you can now double tap with your
knuckle to take a screenshot or
completely disable the feature in
settings Mui also now comes with a far
shot setting that lets you double press
the volume down button to launch the
camera and take a picture there's also a
hidden apps drawer which lets you get
rid of some of the icons on the home
screen by putting them in a hidden menu
that can be accessed by pinching out a
good use case for this would be if you
wanted to separate your work apps from
your personal apps as this would let you
hide the work apps and not see them once
you leave the office
sadly Mui still doesn't come with an app
drawer which most users will find quite
jarring and while we've asked why way to
introduce the feature via an option in
the settings it's unlikely we'll see it
anytime soon
the beauty of Android however is that
you can change the launcher very easily
and this should make the experience a
lot more enjoyable if you don't like
team UI the ascend mate 7 is without a
doubt one of the most premium
smartphones Huawei has ever released and
the honor 7 aims to build on this thanks
to its new improved body additional
features and a much better camera yes
the software is arguably more complete
on the mate7 but while it's not perfect
it is certainly manageable on the honor
7 Huawei's on a7 is launching in the UK
today for just two hundred and
forty-nine ninety-nine which when you
consider the specs is an absolutely
fabulous price in comparison it's taken
the mate 7 nearly a year to drop to a
similar price tag and the additional
features in the honor 7 mean it's pretty
much the better handset what do you
think of the honor 7 and the changes
made by Huawei since last year's ascend
mate 7 let us know your thoughts in the
