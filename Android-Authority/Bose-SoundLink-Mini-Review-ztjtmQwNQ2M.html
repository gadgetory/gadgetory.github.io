musician and a fan of all things music
there are a few possessions I treasure
more than my home stereo I love it
the thing is when you're on the go you
can't just pack up your stereo and take
it with you sure you can use headphones
but sometimes you just want to kick back
relax and fill the room with sound
that's where the Bose Soundlink mini
comes in as you can see it's a little
guy but the sound that comes out of it
is huge the thing is is it work the
hefty price tag let's find out opening
off the box the first thing you'll see
is the Bose Soundlink mini speaker
itself and the charging cradle and
finally the wall charger aside from the
manual that's about it
the Bose Soundlink mini connects to your
music playing device in one of two ways
first you can connect via bluetooth
every time I paired my phone with the
Soundlink mini was super simple and it
was only one time that I had to bother
with pressing the Bluetooth button on
top of the speaker Bose claims a
bluetooth range of up to about 30 feet
and am i testing I was able to easily
continue playing music from around 20
feet away and that was with two walls
between me and the sound link if you
don't want to or can't use bluetooth you
can also just use the eighth inch
auxiliary jack located on the right side
of the speaker just over the power
connector there isn't too much to say
here just plug it in and there you go
this probably isn't a feature a lot of
people will use but it's still nice to
have one thing worth mentioning is that
the Soundlink mini can't be used with
speaker phone I honestly can't think of
a single time in my life where I've ever
wanted to use speaker phone with a
Bluetooth speaker but if that feature is
important to you you may have to look at
another product bose claims the
Soundlink mini gets about seven hours of
battery life which is almost exactly
dead-on with how I found the battery
life assuming that seven hours on one
charge isn't enough it's easy to either
leave the Soundlink mini on its charging
cradle or just plugged into the wall if
you're going to be carrying the speaker
around with you quite a bit I recommend
using the cradle well if you're pretty
much leaving the Soundlink on your desk
all the time for example you might want
to just leave it plugged in because the
grip on the bottom of the speaker will
keep it in place better than the
charging cradle will
when it comes to sound quality this is
definitely one of the best Bluetooth
speakers I've heard better in some cases
than other models from Bose even for
such a small package it's capable of
some very big sad now you're not going
to provide all the music for a party
with the Soundlink mini but for a few
friends or just yourself it's more than
enough the high frequencies and mid
range both come through loud and clear
bright and crisp but not overly so
unfortunately the bass doesn't hold up
quite as well it can't really because of
the sound link may need small size don't
get me wrong
this is Farb a seer than most bluetooth
speakers I've encountered but you're
never going to get earth-shaking low
frequencies out of something so small
the small size also means that you're
not going to get much in the way of
stereo unless you're pretty close to the
speaker again the sound link does better
here than most other single Bluetooth
speakers but the small sides can only do
so much Wow you'd probably want to hear
what the Soundlink mini sounds like it
really isn't possible to do this in
anyway that does the speaker any justice
but I'll do my best to make sure it's
something you're used to I use music you
might be a little familiar with
overall the Bose Soundlink mini is about
as good as I can imagine a speaker this
size sounding and the build quality is a
major plus yeah at $1.99 is on the
expensive side but you're definitely
getting a solid piece of tech for the
money and that wraps it up for this one
