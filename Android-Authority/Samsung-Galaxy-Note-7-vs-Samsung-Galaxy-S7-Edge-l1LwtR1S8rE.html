Authority and a lot of people have been
saying that the note 7 is just an s7
edge with an S Pen but is this really a
fair way to assess the note 7 well
that's what we're going to find out what
the note 7 vs. the s7 edge so obviously
there are a lot of similarities between
the note 7 and s7 edge but there are
quite a bit of differences as well that
really separate these two devices and
we'll get into what those are as we go
through this comparison first up is the
design both the note 7 and s7 edge are
made of glass on the front and back with
a smooth metal frame sandwiched in
between and as you would expect a look
and feel very similar this is by no
means a bad thing because they're both
beautiful looking devices and feel
extremely solid in the hand the only
downside of course is that these two
phones attract a lot of fingerprints but
that's just to be expected when you're
dealing with phones made predominantly
of glass the note 7 does borrow a lot of
design cues from the s7 edge like the
slight tapers on the backside the
rounded corners and that curved edge
front glass the Samsung has managed to
refine the design even more on the note
7 the curved edges on the front are
still noticeable but they're not quite
as drastic as the s7 edges and I
personally like this better because
you're less likely to run into
accidental presses with your palms or
fingers the metal frame has also been
more seamlessly integrated into the
glass on the note 7 making the phone
feel like one unified piece of material
and this may sound like a minor detail
but it actually makes a huge difference
in how much smoother and more
comfortable to note 7 feels the SM Edge
already feels incredible but the note 7
takes it to another level and is a
testament of how Samsung continues to
make this glass and metal design better
with each flagship the note 7 is larger
than the s7 edge but it's not by much
and the curved glass allows Samsung to
make the note 7 smaller than previous
notes despite having the same screen
size one difference between these two
phones that you cannot see is that the
note 7 is covered in Gorilla Glass 5
versus the Gorilla Glass 4 on the s7
edge there's been a little bit of
controversy with the Gorilla Glass 5 on
the note 7 which is a whole topic on its
own that we're not going to get into but
it's supposed to be a lot stronger and
more durable than Gorilla Glass 4 other
than that the rest of the design between
the notes
and s7 edge is pretty typical Samsung
you have the power button on the left
side volume buttons on the right and the
SIM slot that also doubles as a micro SD
card slot for expandable storage on the
bottom is the headphone jack and single
speaker but on the note 7 you'll notice
that Samsung has finally switched over
to USB type-c over the microUSB that was
used on the s7 edge and of course on the
note 7 you also have that dedicated slot
for the s-pen like every s-pen before it
this year's s-pen has brought a lot of
improvements it has a much finer point
and more levels of pressure sensitivity
for a much more accurate and precise
writing experience perhaps the most
important improvement of all is that can
no longer be put in backwards Samsung
has also added a bunch of new features
to take advantage of the revamp s-pen
you can now hover the S Pen over the
screen to translate text or images
magnify the screen or create a gif or
Jif from something like a YouTube video
to share with your friends as long as
it's not DRM protected material the
screen off memo has also been improved
giving you the ability to scroll and
write much longer memos and you can even
pin important memos to the always-on
display to make it easily visible for up
to one hour the note 7 has a slightly
larger 5.7 inch display over the 5.5
inch display of the s7 edge but aside
from the size difference they're
practically identical
they're both quad HD resolution and
Super AMOLED which means they're
extremely sharp and colors are very
vibrant saturated and full of inky deep
blacks they're absolutely stunning
displays to look at and everything from
web browsing watching YouTube videos and
playing games is a fantastic experience
because of the curved edges the note 7
also now shares the same edge features
from the s7 edge this means you can have
shortcuts to your most commonly used
apps favorite contacts tasks and a
variety of other information like sports
scores and the weather just by swiping
inwards on the edge of the display the
note 7 also has built-in support for
streaming HD our content so movies and
TV shows from Amazon for example look
even more amazing on the super bright
and beautiful display you really have to
see it in person to truly appreciate it
and it's only going to get better as
more HDR titles get released another
really cool feature about the no 7s
display is that you can down scale the
resolution to 1080p and even 720p to
help extend your battery life right
below the displays is Samsung's standard
home button that also doubles as a thing
print sensor and at this point we're all
pretty much aware of how well Samsung's
fingerprint sensors work it's fast
accurate reliable and works well and
adding an extra layer of security to
your smartphone but with the note 7
Samsung took it another step further by
adding an iris scanner the iris scanner
utilizes infrared to scan your eyes to
unlock your phone and it actually works
surprisingly well especially for a first
generation feature it does however take
a little bit longer than using your
fingerprint simply because there's extra
steps involved after you wake up your
phone you actually have to swipe up
before it starts scanning your eyes this
swipe up gesture is really meant to
prevent the phone from accidentally
scanning your eyes when you don't want
it to but it would have been nice if
Samsung gave us the option to disable
the swipe if we wanted here in the
States the note 7 and the s7 edge are
packing the same exact setup with a
snapdragon 820 and 4 gigabytes of RAM
and with the same software and same
hardware it's really no surprise that
both of these phones have very identical
performances in day to day use a lot of
people may be disappointed that the note
7 doesn't have an improved processor or
more RAM but they Snapdragon 820 and 4
gigs of ram is still plenty of power
they're both blazing fast and day to day
use everything from opening apps
multitasking web browsing and playing
heavy games all work extremely well and
we finally have some Vulcan supported
game titles available on Google Play
that is going to give you superior
graphics and gameplay on both the note 7
and the s7 edge the note 7 also carries
the same ip68 water and dust resistance
that was reintroduced on the s7 earlier
this year and this protection on the
note 7 includes both the phone itself
and the s-pen so no matter what phone
you pick from Samsung this year you're
guaranteed to have this protection which
is great for everyone as far as battery
life goes the note 7 packs a 3,500
milliamp hour battery which is the
largest battery we've ever seen on a
note device but it's still a tad smaller
than the 3600 milliamp hour pack on the
s7 edge but I would say that the
difference is pretty negligible if
you're looking for phones that get 5 to
6 hours of screen on time on a
consistent basis and can easily last a
full day even on heavy use the note 7
and s7 edge are two phones that can do
that for you they both also carry fast
charging and fast wireless charging
which really comes in handy when you're
dealing with two phones with massive
batteries so no matter how you decide to
charge your phone you're going to be
able to do it pretty quickly the note 7
also features the same exact cameras on
as the s7 with the five megapixel
front-facing shooter that works really
well for selfies especially because of
that wide angle then along the rear you
have the 12 megapixel camera with F 1.7
aperture optical image stabilization and
that super fast dual pixel autofocus
technology the camera from the s7 is
still one of the best smartphone cameras
on the market if not the best so you
can't really blame Samsung for sticking
with the same sensor it takes fantastic
images in almost all lighting conditions
with plenty of detail sharpness color
and depth for the most part the images
do look very similar which is not all
that surprising but it does look like
Samsung made some tweaks the image
processing the note sevens in-camera
sharpening appears much more natural and
not as aggressive as the s7 s and the
white balance issues that plagued the s7
in low-light doesn't seem to be a
problem on the note 7 which is awesome
because these couple of changes only
make this camera even better
the most notable improvements with the
camera is actually with the camera app
itself the s7 s camera software was
already pretty clean and easy to
navigate with the note 7 Samsung has
made their camera software much more
intuitive you can still double tap the
home button to launch the camera like
usual and it packs all the same features
from before like selective focus live
broadcast and the pro mode but the
interface has been revamped with a much
flatter and more simplistic look it's
also much easier to use and navigate
with just one hand by using swipe
gestures you can swipe to the right to
access the camera modes to the left to
bring up the various different camera
filters or swipe up or down to switch
between the front and rear cameras both
the note 7 and s7 edge are on the same
version of Android with Android
marshmallow along with Samsung's
TouchWiz skin on top and for the most
part the general look and feel is very
similar you have many of the same core
functions like multi window and the
theme store but Samsung has made a lot
of subtle and some not so subtle changes
to the interface of the note 7 if you
look closely you'll notice that many of
the app icons have been revamped with
new graphics and a more uniform look and
certain system UI elements like the
notification shade and Settings menu
have been given a slight facelift to
match the rest of the changes that
they've made throughout TouchWiz the
settings menu is cleaner and much more
streamlined making a lot easier to find
what you're looking for and they dialed
back a lot of the colors for a much more
minimalistic appearance instead of big
bright bold colors that used to have
before on the s7 and s7 edge they've now
gone with a softer more eggshell like
color scheme that's a lot more
peeling and easier on the eyes and this
change can be found throughout the
entire interface including Samsung's own
apps the only change that I'm not a fan
of is that the toggles in the
notification shade on the note 7 are no
longer scrollable like they were on the
s7 and to get the brightness slider it
now takes 2 swipes down on the
notification shade instead of one
samsung also consolidated all their
various different note-taking apps into
one app called Samsung notes and whether
you use this app or not this change
makes the process of finding the
appropriate app for taking a note or
drawing a lot less confusing and reduces
some of the bloatware
the note 7 also brings a new secure
folder to lock away any apps or
sensitive information that you don't
want anyone else to access and this can
be locked with a standard password pin
lock pattern your fingerprints and even
the brand-new iris scanner TouchWiz is
surprisingly pleasant used on the note 7
and Samsung has made a lot of really
nice changes so hopefully we'll see this
trickle down to the s7 and s7 edge in a
future update
so yes it's pretty clear at this point
to the note 7 bars a lot from the s7
edge but with that being said it's an
entirely different phone that offers its
own unique experience despite how much
it has in common with the s7 edge this
still feels very much like a note device
should feel and not just an s7 edge with
an S Pen like a lot of people have been
saying the s7 edge did a lot of things
right so you can't really blame Samsung
for bringing many of the hardware and
software features over to the note 7 and
by doing so this also simplifies the
decision making process for consumers
now as the note 7 worth upgrading to if
you have the s7 edge absolutely not not
just because they share a lot of
similarities but also because the note 7
is not meant to be an upgrade for people
coming from the s7 edge the note 7 is
meant for people coming from much older
devices like last year's s6 is the note
5 and even the note 4 if you're coming
from any of those devices this will feel
like an amazing upgrade and you won't
regret making the leap to 7 as always
