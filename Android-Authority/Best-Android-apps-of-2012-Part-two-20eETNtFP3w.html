next app is one of my favorites on the
list which is the Chrome Beta browser
now this recently was released for the
Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich operating
system and what this actually does is it
allows you to sign in to your Google
account and it'll sync to the Chrome
browser that you have on your computer
now what we can do here is of course it
gives us our initial instructions this
is our tab menu we can add all these new
tabs and we just get rid of a tab by
swiping over to the left or to the right
and anyways we can go here we have our
incognito tab like we do on the Chrome
browser we have our bookmarks which what
it does is it imports our desktop
bookmarks our other bookmarks and our
mobile bookmarks so I'll just go ahead
and click the desktop bookmarks and has
all of the different bookmarks I have
for my desktop Chrome application now
anyways I'll just give you a demo by
going to a website go to Android
authority com it has a very clean user
interface even though it's in its a beta
version it's very bug free there's no
lag or really anything like that it
doesn't it's it's a completely stable
web browser anyways our options once we
get here or we can request a desktop
site which is actually added in one of
the newer versions of Chrome for a few
months I was using this and that was not
a functionality so we'll click that and
we'll just kind of bring up what Android
authority looks like when it's on its
desktop application as you can see it's
very nice now this actually does not
support flash so you'll have to watch
out for that everything is moving over
to HTML so they're already making the
first step in doing that they're not
going to support flash on this but if
you encounter a YouTube video or
something you can click it and open it
in your YouTube application and many
times you're able to just open it on the
web page anyways now what you can do is
just a swipe another tab and you're left
with nothing here of course your menu
options here you can set a new tab and
this has an easter egg when you get up
to 99 tabs you can actually get a little
smiley face here
I know awesome anyways this syncs what
you have been viewing on your other
devices with Chrome now here's my HP
laptop you can see here that I have the
tabs open YouTube and the article in
Android authority best apps in 22
and it also has my Galaxy Nexus last
synced webpage I was viewing um when I
had my other devices on Ice Cream
Sandwich it also displayed my Galaxy Tab
and my Galaxy S fascinate here and
showed what they were of using viewing
on Chrome it was these are my recently
closed
we have DS and we have Android authority
and welcome to Google so that's
basically the Chrome browser it's very
stable it's awesome and I would suggest
using it if you're running the Ice Cream
Sandwich it's free now our next one next
one excuse me is the Chrome to Phone app
now what the Chrome to Phone app does is
it lets you easily share links maps and
currently selected phone numbers and
text between your computer and phone
much like what the Chrome browser did
and this is what I would suggest anyone
who's not running Ice Cream Sandwich now
here we have there are three easy steps
to completely set up on your phone you
choose your Google accounts I like to
Chrome to phone connect excuse me and
then set your link action preference
we'll go next and we have all of our
different Google accounts I have no
history using because it's actually all
synced through my Chrome Beta app but
this is what you can you can actually
use this as the same functionality as I
just showed in the chrome beta this is
what I suggest anyone who's not running
Ice Cream Sandwich but still wants
Chrome bookmarks and the chrome
experience on their phone heading to our
next app we have our color node
application which is actually a widget
which is very very functional if you
like the sticky notes on Windows 7 or
you've used a Motorola phone with one of
the stock sticky note widgets what we
will do here is just add a text enter
and we can either discard send lock or
remind let me just go back to save it
and now it's saved as one of our notes
now what we'll do here is go to a blank
screen bring up a widget as you can see
here we have our color note widget I'll
choose a one by one and we choose our
note now there's the note we just made
and here it is to move it around with my
launcher you can resize it whoops make
it bigger
somewhat anyways when you click it it'll
bring up the note that you wrote and
it'll allow you to edit the note you can
go back and this is very helpful for
helpful for to-do lists or
shopping lists or reminders for classes
reminders for work anything like that so
if you need a nice widget on your home
screen to remind you to do things you
can just get the color note application
type up a little note and then place it
directly on your home screen you'll
never forget what you have to do moving
on to our next one we have our Flixter
application which is a movie streaming
and movie movie reviewing app with
Rotten Tomatoes anyways we have our
box-office movies which has our theaters
and upcoming I'll go to the home first
you can search for movies actors or
directors scroll through here to see
their featured tab and you can log in on
Facebook and see what your friends are
doing and also share what you're doing
you have our mission impossible' trailer
we'll go ahead and just boot that up
show you some of the functionality of
this application this give us gives us
the Rotten Tomatoes news the review on
mission impossible so you get to 93% on
Rotten Tomatoes and then it's also
giving us the reviews for the other ones
so that's what I clicked and we can go
back and we can see my movies now what
you can do is connect with Facebook you
can give a gift to watch a full-length
movie on Flixter and view theaters in
your location and we can check our DVD
releases that are coming up I'm pretty
sure that we can watch a trailer here so
I click contraband and we'll be able to
watch our trailer now I don't know where
this is streaming from but as of right
now it doesn't look like it's an HD I'm
sure you can change your settings okay
so there was that anyways we will go
back and that was our Flixter
application guys if you want to check
out the latest movies reviews for the
movies where to watch the movies and
upcoming DVD releases get this
application especially if you're a movie
buff head it on to our next application
we have the PDA net 3.5 know what this
is gonna allow you to do is even if with
even if you don't have a rooted phone
this is going to allow you to use your
mobile tethering or your mobile Wi-Fi
hotspot without paying
your carrier that pesky $10 a month or
whatever they're charging anyways you
can choose a USB tethering want to use
your USB and plug it into your computer
or possibly plug it into your tablet to
tether the internet through your 3G or
4G connection you can do that and use
your Bluetooth mode or your Wi-Fi
hotspot mode now it verifies our
internet connection and it will provide
through a Wi-Fi hotspot tool named Fox
five select okay or in view more details
anyways it will send us to the Play
Store if we do that and we will download
the Fox five free software that will
allow you to use the Wi-Fi connection as
a tethering application will try the
Bluetooth as well and that uses Fox five
and the USB tethered
uses PDA net desktop client so what
you're going to do with the USB mode is
you will I'm going to turn off the PDA
now anyways you will download the
desktop client on your desktop or on
your tablet which is a separate
application and then when you use the
USB tethering that application either on
your desktop or on your tablet and
you'll be able to use your internet now
this is very fast and it's actually
pretty functional if you're getting 4G
coverage in your area for me 3G 1.5 mag
not not too useful but you know if I
needed to use the internet on my tablet
and I couldn't do what I was trying to
do on my phone this would be very useful
for me so check that one out guys moving
on we have our TV listings app which
when we click that gives us a different
TV provider all of our different TV
providers I'll enter my zip code so here
are all our different providers for the
zip code I have entered we have our
DirecTV Dish fave global world TV we
have Comcast down there and then we have
our local listings I'll go ahead and
click DIRECTV which is going to be
pretty national it's a pretty pretty
across the spectrum we have our
information channel and it just shows us
all you know pilates a home blah blah
blah paid programming all of the
programs are going to be on and what's
what channel they're going to be on and
what time so anyways it just says what's
on going back whoops
we will click it again and I'll bring up
the menu you can choose the time of day
you can search for things you can filter
by different categories and set
reminders to watch your
favorite show the more gives you a
refreshing about and the settings key
gives you your configurable TV provider
which I've already chosen of course you
can filter your channels and then you
can use a 24 hour time format if you're
into that so this is a great great one
to keep up on your TV shows guys or your
movies and you can set your own provider
and everything to customize and suit
your need check this one out if you want
to stay up to date on your latest shows
anyways we'll go now to the words with
friends application now this is also
available in a paid version what you can
do here is login either with your
Facebook or your email address and you
can play Scrabble with your Facebook
friends or their friends you have on
your contacts list and this is pretty
fun and I don't really want it to spam
my Facebook so beware it will do that
once you do this it'll give a
notification everyone you're playing
Words With Friends whatnot be aware of
that so don't want to do it this time
and I don't want to log in with my email
address so basically you guys that's
what this will do is you can play
Scrabble with all of your friends and
it's pretty fun a lot of people actually
have this app going back we will now go
to our Google Play Music application now
with the Google Play Music application
you can actually stream all of your mp3s
to Google's cloud server and stream them
from there anytime you want to hear your
music now of course it gives you your
artists albums and your option to select
an account to stream it and you can also
choose not to stream all your music to
the cloud which is what I'd like to do
because a lot of times it will find
problems with your id3 tags whatnot and
it will delete them and if it does not
think that they're a genuine file which
of course I would only get genuine files
but anyways you have all of your you
know artists and stuff we can just click
a song and this is the nice user
interface it gets
and you gives you the info you can
actually rate it up or down to see if
you want to play it again what not
anyways that was our Google Play Music
app we have a bunch of settings here
really you can just shuffle or you can
go to your settings choose your Play
account a lot of them have to do with
your cloud server here which I really
don't like doing but a lot of people
find it convenient because it takes up
zero space on your phone it'll all be in
the cloud you'll just stream your music
so what you're going to need is a data
connection for this application but what
else you can do is request that these
songs may be made available on your
phone so you do not have to stream them
from the cloud</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
