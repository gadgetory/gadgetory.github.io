release of the LG g3 and while the leaks
told us what we needed to know pretty
much already by then the excitement was
still there when I got my hands on LG's
new flagship so after pondering it over
a bit here are the features I'm most
excited for with some general thoughts
sprinkled throughout hey it's Josh
Vergara from Android Authority what's
going on everybody and here are 5 of the
reasons why I'm very excited about the
LG g3 now the first reason I'm going to
talk about probably shouldn't come as
much surprise you can't talk about this
phone without getting into the screen
experience 2560 by 1440 resolution makes
this a behemoth in both size and sheer
pixel density with 534 pixels per inch
LG is a master of panels so there was no
surprise when this handsome screen
performed really well even in my brief
period with it the sharpness is through
the roof with great clarity and text and
media does it ultimately make a huge
difference when compared to 1080p
displays no not by a long shot
unless you really just want to be on the
bleeding edge you'll have the same
amount of fun on let's say the LG g2 or
the Nexus 5 with their 1080p displays so
in the end it is just a great addition
and it's surprisingly easy to handle
because LG continues to achieve really
thin bezels on all of their devices and
if you do come into this phone for
plenty of the other things that it
offers then the screen is just the
cherry on top of the sundae that is the
entire package okay this is actually
really highly subjective but as much as
I love to the LG g2 as an entire package
I never really was a fan of the fact
that it was made almost completely of
glossy plastic and if you happen to be
in that camp as well then you probably
like me and you think that this
aesthetic change in the g3 is somewhat
of a big deal
yes it did look metallic in all the
press photos and the renders but while
that brush design is definitely there it
is a finish put on top of hard plastic
it's a pretty interesting misdirection
on the part of LG and they were lucky
that the plastic hybrid turned out
pretty great because it seems a majority
of people feel the same way don't get it
twisted then this is not metal but it is
a step in the right direction for anyone
that wasn't a fan of glossy plastic from
before hard let's talk about the cameras
and optical image stabilization which is
a bit of a big deal
because it is a feature that made quite
a bit of
difference in the LG g2 and the Nexus 5
already so it's no surprise that LG
continues to refine it on the g3 it's
all about OS plus the enhanced version
of stabilization originally found in the
G pro 2 if you remember a post we did
back at MWC regarding the g pro 2's OAS
plus you will find that we thought it
was quite a good performer and
definitely a good upgrade from the LG g2
what's also exciting is the updated
camera app which has a more streamlined
look and brings a lot to the table
mainly all of the goodies that you would
expect come here with dual camera shots
4k video recording and all the options
needed to cater the shot to your liking
the front facing camera deserves a
mention also because while it might only
work with 2.1 megapixels it still has AF
2.0 aperture that should make selfies a
lot easier to take especially in
low-light situations and also that hand
to fist gesture that helps eliminate any
fidgeting with the on camera shutter
button or even the volume down button on
the back was really responsive and easy
to trigger and finally there's the laser
based focusing system while I did kind
of wonder what it would be like to try
to shoot faraway objects with it the
main takeaway here is that the focusing
speed on the g3 should be leaps and
bounds better than the super slow focus
of the g2 what was otherwise a good
camera was hindered by the time it took
to finally get the right focus and that
looks like it has been remedied on this
new version
LG's overhaul of the UI is another
reason why I'm really excited because
you only have to look at the LG g2 s UI
to realize that well LG hasn't always
been great about streamlining their user
interfaces and by bringing down that
notification drop-down and seeing just
how little space there was for actual
notifications you pretty much got the
whole story now the entire UI has been
given a flatter look it's been cleaned
up with circle centric elements
especially in the notification drop-down
and there have been a lot of additions
baked in this time around a multi window
makes its debut now on a flagship g4
example as it was originally kept on the
G pro 2 and the G flex and also the
knock code returns which is one of the
better ways of securing and easily
getting into your device otherwise the
smart applications have yet to be put
through their paces but they look
promising
for example optimization of your device
might sometimes be obtained but on the
LG g3 the smart cleaner looks for apps
that you haven't used it ages and
recommends
moving them after that the smart notify
is a widget version of Google now's
cards essentially you should be able to
get an attractive way of getting all
that information as long as it is not
intrusive I really enjoyed what I saw in
the UI of the g3 it already looks a lot
better than the previous iterations it
comes with some good features but I did
have to think about it after a while and
I realize it is still somewhat bloated
especially if you take advantage of all
of LG's widgets your home screens will
get pretty crazy there is still quite a
bit of space taken up in the
notification drop-down and while the
settings menu is a little bit better
there's still a lot to take a look at
sure some of you out there might be
saying that on the g2 you could turn off
a lot of those features that take up a
lot of that space and that is true but
it is also true for the g3 at least to
some extent there are definitely some
features that are still retained in the
g3 s you I like that G page that you can
swipe to from the home screens that
teaches you tips and tricks about your
device all you have to go into the
settings and still turn that off if you
want to get it more simplistic and more
minimalistic so it's not that big of a
deal it's just a little bit more work
that still has to be put into
streamlining the experience on your own
but ultimately the g3 UI is another
example of how LG still has a little bit
of a ways to go with their software but
they're definitely headed in the right
direction and for my final reason this
is in no way me saying that LG is the
only one that puts out great first party
accessories for their devices after all
there are the S view cover z' for
samsung devices and of course the great
dot view case for the HTC One m8 but I
might venture to say that LG is more
consistent and more practical with their
offerings for example the LG tones that
you see me wear often are some of the
best and easiest headphones and wearable
tech that I actually have the quick
circle case that I did a video on is an
attractive looking cover that still
keeps a good amount of functionality
through that large circle on the top and
of course there is the G watch which we
have yet to slap on our wrists but it
should be a good development in the
growing world of wearable tech what
really struck me about the presentation
was that when they showed the LG g3
alongside all of the accessories that
will come with it essentially I thought
to myself I would actually use all of
those accessories with my g3 and most of
them actually I could use with other
phones as well
and so there you have it for these five
reasons as to why I'm really excited
about the LG g3 yes there are a lot of
reasons why you should like this device
we're super excited about it but I also
wanted to look at the other side of
things and see what the possible other
side of the coin is when it comes to at
least a few of these aspects nonetheless
though we are super excited to get this
phone we can't wait to do our review on
it I can't wait to put it through its
paces so keep it tuned to Android
Authority for all of that and beyond of
