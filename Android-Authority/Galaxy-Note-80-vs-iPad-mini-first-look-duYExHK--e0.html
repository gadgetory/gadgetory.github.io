hands-on look at the the lion in the
room of the 7 inch 8 inch market which
is the iPad Mini versus samsung recently
announced today in fact the Galaxy Note
8.0 now as you can see both have a very
very similar form factor and also
aesthetically are quite similar now the
iPad wins it for me right here simply
because of his brushed aluminum and it's
really really nice thin bezel and it's
also thinner but it's nice to see
Samsung come to market with something
innovative with S Pen functionality and
hopefully aggressive pricing
additionally the Samsung will have a
higher ppi count but in terms of the
specs what we're looking at is a totally
different ballgame due to the fact that
iOS is obviously a lot simpler of an
operating system and it requires a lot
less in terms of hardware specs to run
no word on pricing a release date we
heard q2 for the know date but in terms
of the raw specs we're looking at two
hundred and ten millimeters high versus
two hundred millimeters high for the
iPad Mini and the thickness is also very
different as well it's going to be 722
millimeters thick for the iPad Mini
versus 7.95 for the Galaxy Note 8 in
terms of the weight in the hand the
Galaxy Note 8 is going to be weighing in
at around 338 grams whereas the iPad
Mini is three hundred and twelve grams
making a little bit lighter now this has
an ex enos Samsung created for 41 2
o'clock to one point seeker one point
six gigahertz
it's an ARM Cortex a9 with a Mallee 400
GPU the apple is only a dual-core clock
at 1 gigahertz but is also an a9 but it
has their custom power vr GPU which is
actually quite robust now this is an 8
inch display with the Galaxy Note 8
obviously versus the iPad Mini which is
7.9 both are of the IPS LCD variety now
the PPI thankfully on the Galaxy Note 8
is going to be a lot higher we're
looking at 189 pixels per inch where's
the get my iPad Mini
it is only gonna be 162 pixels per inch
right out of the box actually this is
kind of cool the Galaxy Note 8.0 at
least the one we're getting here it has
micro SIM HSPA+ capability and microSD
expansion which is awesome now sadly we
don't know whether or not this will be
released in North America but
internationally you will be able to pick
one of these bad boys up and it will
have the ability to have a SIM card
added to it now this one contains 4600
milliamp hours for the Galaxy Note II
and the iPad Mini has 16.3 watt hours so
really hard to differentiate their
camera wise they're both very similar
we're looking at one point three
megapixels for the iPad Mini excuse me
one point three megapixels for the
Galaxy Note 8 versus one point two so
really really nothing different there
but the fact that this doesn't have any
Pen functionality whatsoever means that
there's a little bit limited it's sort
of a passive media consumption device a
lot of people really like it that are
looking for a smaller form factor but
for anyone that wants to draw notes or
take pictures to create the s-pen is
going to lend a lot more functionality
on the galaxy note 8.0 for anyone that
nones Galaxy Note 2 they will know that
the S Pen has a lot of cool stuff that
you can do and we don't really have time
to fully demo that as we're in a little
bit of rush mode here but we just want
to offer you a first hands-on look at
the iPad Mini versus the Galaxy Note 8.0
would tell us which one you think is
better
you think Samsung's created is something
good here or is the iPad still gonna
reign supreme star steal a cuvette here

ground at Mobile World Congress 2013 in
Barcelona</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
