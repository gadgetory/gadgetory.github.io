what's going on everybody and I'm doing
some voiceover in this video because the
audio at the actual event just kind of
really got blown out so I just wanted to
make sure to get some better audio for
you and present to you the various
accessories that are available for the
Samsung Galaxy Tab s 8.4 and 10.5 now I
tell you about the audio because you're
gonna see my hand gestures probably
won't be fitting with what I'm saying
but I will still present to you exactly
what is great about these particular
covers I am looking at the book cover
right now for the Samsung Galaxy Tab s
8.4 which is the smaller of the two and
as you're going to see right here the
actual plastic tabs on the inner part of
the book cover actually fit into some
small nubs on the back of the 8.4 tablet
and they really do get in there pretty
securely you have to really pop them out
in order to finally get the actual
tablet out of the case so that does make
it pretty sturdy
other than that though it does cover up
the screen very well and then it folds
into an actual stand in a number of
different ways to make viewing easier
when you're putting it on a table so you
don't have to just lie it flat after
that it the magnets are pretty strong so
you will be able to get not only the
stand to work pretty well but also the
cover will really protect your tablet
after that we have the 10.5 version that
you're seeing right here and I did
already showcase it a little bit in the
hands-on for the 10.5 inch tablet and it
for the most part it's just the same
thing which is basically the trifold
that will put me put together via
magnets and then you'll be able to put
them together in certain ways in order
to stand the tablet up for better
viewing pleasure it's nice to see though
that Samsung has created the same exact
accessory for both Apple for both
tablets mostly because while we used to
complain that first party applications
or accessories rather we're not
necessarily available all the time but I
think Samsung is one of the better
companies out there that tends to really
go all out when it comes to creating the
actual first party accessories for their
products and these tablets are no
exception and thankfully the same goes
for other accessories as well as Samsung
has created their own keyboards for
these particular tablets
right now we're looking at the 8.4 sized
one at the moment that pretty much it
works like a stand and the reason why is
because it's actually a Bluetooth
keyboard you aren't able to pair the
keyboard with your tablet but then after
that there's just a slot on the back for
you to be able to rest it on there is a
power button on the back or rather a
power switch and then right above on the
top right of the keys are you will see
that pairing button and once you have it
paired you just nestle it there right
onto the slot in the back and you'll be
able to just have it sit there while you
type away I did type with the keyboard a
little bit and I didn't find it the most
comfortable after all these are smaller
keys but they're also incredibly
squishing the same is true for the 10.5
inch tablet version also but nonetheless
it is pretty cool though how you will be
able to take both of these the tablet
and the keyboard rather you'll be able
to take them with you easily because
when you lay the tablet down there is
any little clasp or a notch at the top
there that you'll be able to put to get
up or down and then it will keep the two
pieces together and you'll be able to
take them with you pretty easily it does
feel pretty secure and that tab for all
intensive purposes actually kind of
keeps things really secure there which
is really nice a couple of the ladies
alright Samsung we're telling us that
this is kind of familiar to them because
it feels like a clutch I thought that
was kind of funny but it is kind of true
so let's move on over to the 10.5 inch
tablet keyboard now and it's basically
the same thing just blown up see this is
actually kind of cool of Samsung to
really create the actual cases and
keyboards for their products it really
shows that they are putting a lot of
thought into exactly what it is that the
consumer needs when they buy these
products and as far as this keyboard
goes there's a larger version and yes
the keys are a little bit wider so it
does help in terms of typing but not a
whole lot because they are still
incredibly squishy but still you have
the same exact functionality with this
larger one you just lay the tablet down
and you'll be able to hit that notch and
you can go ahead and have both of the
keyboard and the tablet with you easily
at all times so that's just a quick look
at the accessories these ones in
particular for the Samsung Galaxy Tab s
line keep it tuned to Android 34 further
