andrew authority and when xiaomi held
their press event in february they
announced a new online store as their
entry into the US market but this online
store consists purely of just
accessories at least for right now that
hover didn't stop them from handing out
their 2015 flagship to members of the
press is this shammies way of proving
that they have what it takes to enter an
already crowded US market well that's
what we're here to find out with the
xiaomi me note as the note name and 5.7
inch screen may suggest this will be a
device that many whether you like the
name or not we'll put squarely in the
phablet category with the design of the
me note xiaomi really hit it out of
ballpark here as it is quite gorgeous
looking 2.5 d glass can be found on the
front giving you that subtle curve along
the edges and on the back is what xiaomi
likes to call 3d glass that provides for
a much more pronounced curve on the
sides all this is held together by an
all metal frame with chamfered edges and
in the handy me note feels solid the
metal and glass construction gives off a
premium feel and it's very easy to hold
on to because of those chamfered edges
one handy usability is surprisingly not
as bad as you might think and a lot of
that can be attributed to the device's
thinness at only 7 millimeters and its
relatively small side bezels there is a
little bit of shuffling in the hand in
order to reach every corner of the
screen but for the most part it's fairly
comfortable to use in one hand all
things considered now because the back
is made of glass it does tend to get a
little bit smudgy and covered in
fingerprints but on this white model
that i have here it's not really all
that noticeable and you actually have to
look pretty closely in order to see them
but i'm not entirely too sure if i could
say the same thing about the black
version of this phone taking a tour
around the device the power and volume
keys are comfortably placed on the right
and they're very clicky tactile and easy
to press the sim card slot which takes
both Nano and micro is located on the
left side the 3.5 milimeter headset jack
is up top and the micro USB port along
with the single speaker is mounted on
the bottom capacitive menu home and back
keys flanked the body
of the display and a multicolored LED
notification light sits above the
display along with the usual sensors
earpiece and front-facing camera with
the word note in its name one would
expect the display to be quite large and
as mentioned earlier it measures in at
5.7 inches with a resolution of 1080p
with a pixel density just shy of 400
it's a considerably sharp looking panel
color saturation viewing angles
brightness and outdoor visibility are
all very good and the 5.7 inch screen
size makes all types of media
consumption like web browsing watching
YouTube and playing games a very
pleasurable experience the color
calibration of the display can also be
adjusted in these settings allowing you
to configure the level of contrast and
warmth of the display but the default
settings already look plenty good to my
eyes that I never felt the need to make
any adjustments features like love mode
are also available to increase touch
screen sensitivity and a reading mode
that reduces glare and makes the screen
a lot easier on the eyes it's similar to
how the flux application works for
Windows and Mac and you can even select
which applications will trigger this
feature the internal specs may seem a
little bit dated at this point but
they're still powerful enough to easily
consider this device a flagship the Meno
is packin a Snapdragon 801 chip and a
surprising three gigabytes of RAM which
puts it on par with some flagships that
are hitting the market this year at
least in the RAM Department general
performance like swiping scrolling
opening up applications and navigating
through the UI has been quite good
heavier tasks like gaming has also been
solid and with three gigabytes of RAM
multitasking is an absolute breeze
I will admit the device does tend to get
a little warm after a short amount of
time gaming but I didn't notice any
decrease in performance because of it
another thing to note no pun intended is
our review unit is a pre-production
model running beta software so app
crashes and random freezes and things
like that did happen every now and then
but for the most part the me note has
been very snappy and responsive and all
these software related bugs will most
likely be ironed out in future software
updates anyways
with the rest of the hardware the usual
slew of connectivity options can be
found along with LTE connectivity
although us bands are not supported 16
and 64 gigabyte storage options are
available but the me note does not
feature a microSD card slot so you're
limited to purely internal storage which
probably won't be an issue if you get
the 64 gigabyte model but the 16
gigabyte model could be a little
problematic for some the bottom mounted
speaker does sound good and gets fairly
loud in volume but being mounted on the
bottom means you get sideways firing
audio and it's very easy to muffle with
the palm of your hand when using the
device and landscape
the camera on the back comes in at 13
megapixels and it also features optical
image stabilization and a dual tone LED
flash which is not all too uncommon in
smartphones nowadays the camera UI is
fairly simple to navigate and use with a
large white shutter button and a decent
amount of features but it doesn't try to
overwhelm you in any way swiping upwards
or to the right will bring up several
different modes like manual panorama
refocused and a few others swiping
downwards or to the left will bring up a
bunch of different live filters if you
want to have a little more fun with your
picture taking the exposure can also be
dialed in manually just by simply
turning the digital ring on the screen
which I thought was a nice touch and it
felt extremely intuitive the refocus
mode allows you to refocus a photo after
the fact which is nothing new at this
point but it does work pretty well as
long as you follow the guidelines of
having a clear subject of focus and a
clear background overall image quality
was actually pretty good the shutter
speed is fast and photos come out
looking sharp with a great amount of
color in both indoor and outdoor
situations the HDR mode also works
really well on this camera bringing back
some detail while adding some extra
warmth and color into the image in
low-light and increase in noise levels
is to be expected but the OIS and ISO
limit of 3200 certainly helps the camera
pull in as much detail as possible while
the images are usable there is a pretty
substantial decrease in sharpness and
detail but in most situations this
camera has been a great performer the
battery in the me note is a respectable
size at 3000 milliamp hours but at this
point in the game some might consider it
to be just average regardless during my
testing battery life has been very solid
with usage consisting of mostly texting
web browsing and checking up on social
media with some like gaming and YouTube
watching thrown into the mix I was
averaging anywhere between a day to a
day and a half with five plus hours of
screen on time on a heavier day where I
gained a lot and snapped a lot of photos
with the camera battery life did take a
dip with the screen on time top
now at four hours but considering my
usage that was still more than enough to
get through a full day standby time is
also good with the mean note losing only
one to two percent overnight so all in
all I've been extremely pleased with the
battery life on this device battery
saving profiles are also available in
the settings that disable Wi-Fi data and
other network functions to help you
extend the battery life even further and
these profiles can also be set to come
on automatically when battery life hits
a specified percentage in software the
me note is currently on Android 4.4
KitKat which shall means me UI on top
like many other Chinese OEMs the me UI
interface does away with the app drawer
in favor of an all homescreen experience
so folders are really your only way for
any type of home screen organization the
icons are Square and colorful and so are
the preloaded wallpapers but it's not
gaudy or overbearing it actually looks
quite good on this display there's a lot
of Chinese applications pre-installed
which will most likely not serve of any
use if you live in the States and Google
Play isn't installed by default but it
literally took no time at all for me to
install it and get all the applications
that I needed the me UI interface
introduces some really nice features
like hi-fi audio for improved audio
quality when using headphones and a
pretty robust theme engine that lets you
alter the look and feel of the OS from
the icons wallpapers lockscreen and even
the default applications a one-handed
mode is also available that can be
activated by simply swiping from the
home button outward in either direction
to shrink the screen down from anywhere
between 4.5 to 3.5 inches while I
personally am a fan of stock Android
through-and-through I have to admit the
me UI interface brings a lot of nice
additions to the core Android experience
in China the Xiaomi me note is going for
roughly 370 US dollars but if you're in
the u.s. looking to import one you're
going to be paying more than $500 for
one at least according to sites like
eBay all in all the Xiaomi Mino is one
very solid device from hardware to
software and is one of the most
enjoyable devices that I have had the
pleasure of using from a Chinese OEM in
quite some time and that's why it's
getting our editors choice 2015
it's just a shame that this isn't coming
to the States but maybe this is shammies
way of teasing us and if it is it's
certainly one hell of a teaser as always
