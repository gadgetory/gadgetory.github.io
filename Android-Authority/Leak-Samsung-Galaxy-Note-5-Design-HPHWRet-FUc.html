brought to you by domain.com so the
question we gotta ask is are these more
recent leaks of the galaxy note5
legitimate or are they a sad attempt at
a blogger to get attention I got some
thoughts on that but let's just take a
second and talk about leaks and rumors I
had read in the comments from last
week's show that basically most the show
was all leaks and rumors and this is a
new show not the leaks and rumors show
the problem is with 24-hour media there
is an enormous demand for information
about leaks and rumors and if we don't
answer them or meet that demand to some
extent people are just going to go
elsewhere to get that so I consider it
my job to report those leaks and rumors
and try as best i can to sort them out
for you sift through them and try and
gauge with you how legitimate those
leaks and rumors are so that being said
let's dig in the video shown here
published via on leaks by French tech
blogger Steve hmmm Stauffer allegedly
shows a 3d mock-up of the galaxy note5
based on product schematics the origin
of the schematics is not known though we
can speculate that they might be sourced
from a third-party case manufacturer
that had advanced access to the note 5
now I decided to report on this because
only has been accurate with leaks in the
past but if you see in the original
video in the comments below the video
there are some legitimate tech
journalists ie from mobile geeks that
did question hemin stouffer's integrity
and doubted that the leaks were
authentic so keep that in mind the
design of the device resembles that of
the galaxy s6 with the biggest
difference being the tapered profile on
the back which resembles the curved back
of the Xiaomi me note pro the curved
sides are almost the reverse of the s6
edge design where the back is flat and
the screen hugs the sides the model
measurements seem very close to the note
for suggesting the no.5 will stick with
the 5.7 inch to
way the 10.2 millimeter thickness of the
model seems rather large but it includes
the protruding camera so the phone's
body could be a couple of millimeters
thinner now there's no clue in this 3d
model about the materials that samsung
will use for the note 5 but metal and
glass looked like a good bad if that's
the case the back cover the phone will
not be removable which is bound to
disappoint many of us separately an
Italian tech site HD blog published a
set of renders that it claims it created
based on the information on the galaxy
note 5 from unspecified sources the
renders were published yesterday but
it's not clear if they are based on on
links model or on independent
information the image is shown here show
the same curved back with a metallic
frame sandwich between two panes of
glass now I was reading the comments
from the galaxy note 5 rumor show I did
on Saturday where many of you had said
that you'd be really upset if there was
no removable battery on the note 5 and
you wouldn't buy it if it lacked a
removable battery but I think you might
want to accept that that's really where
all smartphones are likely going from
the manufacturers point of view they are
trying to predict what eighty percent of
their buyers will do eighty percent of
the time and eighty percent of the time
they're not going to remove their
batteries or need to remove their
batteries this is a geek power user
thing as is microsd support all that
kind of stuff so I think the reality is
that's where it's going and it also
gives manufacturers another upgrade
option right so you have the 16 32 64
gigabyte options where they can
encourage upgrade sales that's probably
where it's going what do you guys think
let me know in the comments below so
we've sent out to teachers to two
different winners one in Indian one in
the States for our domain name extension
contests and I want to do another one
because there was lots of interest but
this time i'm looking for a dot-com
domain name extension that somehow
encourages joe hindy to eat durian fruit
if you don't know what i'm talking about
some loyal viewer in the comments will
fill you in let's demonstrate to Joe
Hindy the power of it calm why because
no domain name extension
tells your story with the same level of
trust as a.com or.net domain name dot
com and.net domain name extensions and
Jack credibility in to your online
presence and who doesn't want more
credibility you can say fifteen percent
on domain name and web hosting is when
you use our coupon code android at
domain.com check out don't forget
fifteen percent off when you use our
coupon code android when you think
