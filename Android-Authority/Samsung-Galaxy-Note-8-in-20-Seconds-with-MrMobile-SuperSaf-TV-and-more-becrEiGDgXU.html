actually really nice in their hand like
feels perfect in the hand because of the
additional weight you've got the s-pen I
mean it's the only phone with a stylus S
pen's great the camera is nice to see
Samson go dual camera six weeks around
that's all groovy it is a big phone and
it's going to be pretty damn expensive
but I want I actually think it's just a
si plus with the pen and that's not
necessarily a bad thing because you can
only get a pen on a note and you can
only get that functionality there so if
your aim is a pen get the no date and
not the si if you don't like depend get
the si and not be no date that's pretty
much my two cents on the whole thing but
I am excited about the folks nice
Michael Josh all right what's women on
everybody
well their last year's note seven was
already of it sorry I want to do
everyone anyone I meant to the will
Astros bone that shall not be named was
already amazing so I don't really expect
it to get significantly better it's like
Lassiter's phone and a little bit like
the s8 now with the infinity display but
more for writing notes which it should
be they'd fix a little bit of the flaws
the they kind of move the finger print
sensor away from the camera and now with
dual cameras every time all right
oh yeah don't worry don't worry
introduce I'm a veteran what's got
everyone just Tommy okay gadgets boy and
I've just had to look at the new Samsung
Galaxy Note 8 it's slick great camera
great design and the screen just again
screen is just fantastic it looks
amazing if there's anything I want to
change would be the fingerprint sensor
still needs to move from where it is but
we can do it at Samsung nice and a bong
bored at work all right here we go
start now all right so the Galaxy Note 8
is back I'm excited because I'm a big no
fan I show you having my cooler big no
fans and I have to say though the new S
Pen features are
and even though they might not sound as
fantastic the ability to live transcribe
live message in the school and also that
camera Samsung makes cameras as if he
needs an introduction I'm still gonna
give it to him go for it what's up
youtube this is sap from super surf TV
all right cool twenty seconds of the
node age starting now very impressed
overall love the build the the to curb
display the infinity edge minimal bezels
we've got the s-pen I really like that
do cameras both with oh is really
looking for to check that as well thank
you guys for having the only channel oh
nice
cool it's mr. mobile himself that's me
alright brother so we have 20 seconds on
the no dates I'm giving you 20 seconds
starting now the no date reminds me an
awful lot of the note 7 which is a good
thing because this year the no date is
not gonna have the problems the note 7
did in all likelihood I'm concerned
about the smaller than usual battery I'm
concerned about the dual camera setup no
I'm not
damn it Josh let me do this again the no
date reminds me a lot of the note 7
which is actually quite a good thing
because Samsung is really focused on
safety as far as the battery goes this
year I'm not worried about it from a
safety standpoint the smaller than usual
battery the corner of unproven camera
platform and the high price tag have me
a little worried that people are just
gonna buy the si+ and it's one all right
so hold up oh and so really I'm just
excited to have a note again after what
happened last year I'm liking the design
very s8 inspired s-pen is great not sure
I love the camera module on the back but
we're gonna have to see how the Saint
performs nice alright it's structured
magorium what's going on everybody and I
guess I'll go ahead and round out this
20 seconds on the Samsung Galaxy Note 8
and I'll start right now the Samsung
Galaxy Note 8 is exactly what Samsung
needed to make in order to redeem
themselves from last year's device but
they already did that with the Galaxy s8
so what they're doing now is putting a
bunch of new features on there the dual
camera is a great idea but I don't
really like how it looks and then the
s-pen is always fun to use especially
for screen off memo which is my main
feature that I use it for and there
my time it might take more than one take
so we'll try this here
it's called 20 seconds I know I'll call
20 seconds five times think of your
snake what's the tag at the end of the
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
