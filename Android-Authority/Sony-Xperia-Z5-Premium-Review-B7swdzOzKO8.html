only a matter of time before a company
push the technological envelope to
deliver the world's first 4k smartphone
do you need 4k on a smartphone does it
impact on the battery life as much as we
expected and his 4k set to be the new
standard let's find out hey what's up
everybody isn't there up here for
Android authority and I'm bringing you
our review of the sony xperia z5 premium
the Xperia z5 premium comes with the
same design as the Xperia z5 and the
Xperia z5 compact which has been tweaked
and improved slightly since past Xperia
and sets the rounded corners and glass
back are comfortable in the hand and the
weight of the handset results in an
overall experience the front of the
Xperia z5 premium is dominated by the 4k
display which is flanked by two
front-facing stereo speakers there's a
small bezel either side of the display
and this is coupled with very large
bezels above and below the screen the
small LED notification light in the top
left corner is large enough to notify
you at a glance whether you actually
need to power up the full display the
right-hand side of the Xperia z5 premium
houses all the buttons and the less
recessed buttons provide quite tactile
feedback
however the cramped design of the
buttons with all the buttons in the
bottom half of the phone can be quite
difficult to use and this is especially
if you have big hands like me the
fingerprint sensor is located in the
power button on the right and while this
will be near useless for anyone who is
left-handed the larger size of the
Xperia z5 premium means this is more
comfortable to use than on the regular
z5 to the left and Sony have kept the
SIM card and microSD card trays hidden
underneath the flap and the large size
of the enclosure makes it quite easy to
take the unified tray out one of the
tweaks in the Xperia z5 premium versus
older Xperia handsets is the glass back
which improves the field of the handset
but presents a very large problem within
days of getting mine the back scratched
really easily in general day to day
usage so if you're someone who likes to
keep your phone naked this is something
to keep in mind
to the bottom of the handset is a
capitalist USB port and despite this in
the open headphone jack at the top the
Xperia z5 premium remains waterproof at
7.8 millimeters thick and weighing 180
grams the Xperia z5 premium is
definitely not the lightest or slimmest
handset on the market but it is a
pleasure to use the overall asymmetric
design works really well and the Xperia
z5 premium feels well more premium than
the Xperia z5 and the Xperia z5 compact
the 4k display is the biggest selling
point but also the biggest controversy
on the Xperia z5 premium first let us
say that Sony have done exceptionally
well to deliver the world's first 4k
smartphone as they've managed to pack
Ultra HD resolution into a handset that
measured just 5.5 inches now to the
controversy the sony xperia z5 premium
has 4k and it doesn't as it's only 4k
when you're viewing a video or a photo
on the 4k display Android lollipop
itself doesn't support Ultra HD
resolution natively and to get around
this sony runs xperia z5 premium in
1080p resolution which is exactly half
of 4k and then upscales 4k content to
use the full resolution of the screen
when you want to watch something in full
4k resolution you have two choices
either capture a 4k video from the
camera itself or side load 4k content
from the library on your computer the
display offers 806 pixels for each
density and while many people claim that
you can't see this extra resolution
recent studies have shown that the human
eye can see up to 700 or even 800 pixels
per inch density depending on how good
your eyesight is to put this to the test
we found a 4k soccer highlights video
and decided to play it back on the
screen now you might not be able to
discern all the differences between 4k
and 1080p but the video certainly looks
absolutely fantastic and there is a
noticeable improvement over the exact
same video in 1080p now what about the
colors on the Xperia z5 premium display
and does the world's first 4k screen
have the most accurate colors to test
this we profile the display using the
spectrophotometer
found out some very interesting results
firstly colors on the Xperia z5 premium
are surprisingly accurate aside from the
color white which has the largest Delta
error in our testing when profiling the
color white it comes up with a blue tint
now there's no doubt that Sony has done
amazingly well to deliver 4k in a 5.5
inch display but it's not without its
compromises probably the biggest of
these is the lack of 4k content as
YouTube itself on your Android one let
you view a 4k video in native 4k
resolution and the other is the type of
display that Sony is used and while
neither of these is a deal-breaker it's
worth keeping this in mind if you plan
to buy the Xperia z5 premium just for
its display the Xperia z5 premium comes
with impressive hardware and is
definitely premium under the hood it's
powered by a Snapdragon 810 processor
with three gigabytes of RAM and 32
gigabytes of storage and this delivers
impressive performance that's on par
with most flagships on the market the z5
premium also comes with microSD card
support which many OEMs seem to be
dropping and with a total available
storage of 232 gigabytes
there's plenty of storage for all those
4k videos Ward's briefing is a key
feature that sets Sony apart handsets
apart from the competition and the z5
premium is no different with ip68
certification allowing you to use it for
up to 1.5 meters underwater for up to 30
minutes
like most flagship smartphones Xperia z5
premium comes with an array of
connectivity options including bluetooth
4.1 with aptX Wi-Fi n / AC NFC and an FM
radio the Xperia z5 premium is powered
by a large 3,430 milliamp hour battery
which is definitely large compared to
other flagship devices but it's a
necessity given the 4k Ultra HD display
to find out just how long it'll power
you through the day we put you through
some testing which revealed a total
standby time of around six and a half
hours we took this further and found
that if you used it exclusively for
Wi-Fi browsing the z5 premium can last
for almost eight hours the biggest
feature on the z5 premium is the 4k
display so just how long can you watch
if video 4 on a full charge
testing we found it last 538 minutes
when plane back 1080p video or just over
three hours when playing back 4k that's
the measure testing but what about in
actual usage this is where the z5
premium is a letdown for me personally
over the past few weeks the battery life
has been hit and miss with average usage
it can last you anywhere from one day to
two on a full charge but there are some
real-world cases that just make very
little sense as an example let's take
video calling the other day a 90-minute
video called resulted in the battery
dropping from 88% to just 2% if you plan
to use your handset for video
conferencing on the go for work
the z5 premium is probably not the one
for you for the times when the z5
premium doesn't get you through a full
day this quick charge 2.0 but crucially
the quick charger isn't included in the
box if you don't have a quick charger to
hand and need to eke out every last
minute of battery life sony has also
included its stamina ultra stamina and
lower battery modes and these can be
used to extend your battery by around
20% or more the sony xperia z5 premium
runs on android 5.1.1 lollipop with a
planned upgrade to Android marshmallow
alongside the lollipop OS Sony have
added some small tweaks and changes
including their own short apps and
improvements in the home screen
management settings and more Sony's
Android interface has always been quite
pleasing to the eye
but I found that it does feel quite
sluggish at times and sadly the Xperia
z5 continues in the same mold while the
interface does seem to be very sleek
there can be a noticeable delay when
opening games or closing apps and in
particular in the camera there is a
definite delay when taking and capturing
an image however there is good news on
the horizon for all Sony fans and this
is where the Xperia z5 premium will
really shine in the future planned
upgrade to Android marshmallow as you
might have seen from the video we
published a few weeks back Sony's
working on its marshmallow update in a
different way to its rival OEMs instead
of developing it behind closed doors
Sony has made its concept for
marshmallow a user focused program that
allows users to influence the upcoming
update one of the biggest improvements
in the
one set for marshmallow is the speed of
the interface the older hardware on the
Xperia z3 running marshmallow provides a
faster experience than the current
flagship hardware inside the Xperia z5
premium at the moment sony has kept the
interface almost stock like with just a
handful of changes and tweaks and if the
final version is anything like the
current build of the concept the Xperia
z5 premium will be one of the fastest
smartphones on the market now to the
camera and one of the biggest changes in
the entire Xperia z5 range is the camera
with Sony delivering the first major
camera update to the Xperia Z range
since the first experience that handset
the new camera boasts a 23 megapixel
sensor with phase detection autofocus o
to auto HDR and a plethora of camera
apps along with the ability to record 4k
video the camera is always subjective so
we conducted an in-depth camera test as
part of best of Android 2015 and pitted
the z5 premium against some of the best
smartphones on the market the z5 premium
didn't come first and it didn't come
last and overall the camera is
definitely on par with most flagships
out there the biggest issue with the
camera that I found is inconsistent
performance in some scenes the camera
can take simply stunning images but in
others the shot suffer from too much
noise too much over processing and
especially in a complex scene a
significant lack of detail if you plan
to take a lot of wildlife and landscape
scenery shots you'll probably find the
z5 premium lacking for your needs but if
you just want to capture moments and
share them with your friends without
worrying about the little details the z5
premium camera will probably do the
trick for you all of our pictures were
captured in Sony's superior auto mode
which is the default mode and the mode
that most people will use the camera in
for those who need more customizable
options sony has also included a manual
mode that allows you to tweak the white
balance and the ISO it doesn't come with
a full array of manual controls found on
other smartphones but it should be good
enough for most people safer
professional photographers who are
looking for a portable camera to use on
the move now to the price and innovation
certainly doesn't come cheap as you
might have expected the world's first 4k
smartphone
comes with a relatively hefty price tag
although it's not too far out of reach
in the UK the Xperia z5 premium retails
for approximately 600 pounds which
equates to around nine hundred US
dollars this will probably price out
most people interested in buying the
Xperia z5 premium but is it worth
spending the extra money on as far as
flagship smartphones go the Xperia z5 is
certainly up there with the best of them
a lot depends on why you want to buy the
c5 premium if you're buying it purely
for the 4k display then honestly it's
not worth it
after all it's running in 1080p around
90% of the time if you're in the market
for the Xperia z5 premium for its other
features the handset certainly takes
these boxes but so does the rest of
Sony's range the key thing about the z5
premium is the size of its display and
if you want the Xperia z5 but with a
larger display than the Xperia z5
premium is certainly the one for you as
long as you're willing to understand the
compromise with the 4k display and pay
the rather large price tag so what do
