of the year for better or worse but
everyone wants to know exactly what the
next version of the Galaxy has in store
for us
so let's find out because it's Joshua
Garf a manager authority Oh what's going
on everybody and this is the Samsung
Galaxy s5 as is the case with plenty of
the dates two flagship smartphones this
year much of what you remember from
previous iterations returns and in the
galaxy s5 there are some subtle but
ultimately not too significant changes
the first thing you'll notice is the
shape of the phone which takes on a very
familiar form factor with the rounded
corners that put together what is pretty
much a flat profile all around it'll
either be too familiar or it's going to
be played out depending on who you are
samsung's trademark button layout
returns with the new and welcome change
the tactile home button with back and
this time a recent apps button which
helps to provide a much more traditional
experience at least when it comes to
multitasking one thing you will notice
especially if you're a screen that are
that the bezels around the screen are a
little bit larger now some of you out
there will lament this change but there
is a reason for that Samsung was going
for durability in the galaxy s5 so when
this lands if you happen to drop it on
the sides perhaps the screen is going to
be a little bit more protected and also
you also get that ip67 certification
come around to the sides and you'll find
the same button layout atop a slightly
different backdrop now while we did see
a somewhat notebook design i introduced
in the galaxy note 3 this time around
the ridges are much more pronounced and
neither detract or add to the handling
because the sides for all intents and
purposes are still flat so the
experience is largely the same head down
to the bottom and you'll have the
microUSB charging port that is now
covered by a piece of plastic another
facet of that IP certification I just
mentioned when it comes to the material
on the back I will have to say that I'm
not the biggest fan of this perforated
design primarily because we already had
a great full leather offering that was
introduced in the note series so for
some people out there and somewhat
myself I do find this to be a little bit
of a step backward but anyway when it
comes to the back you have that cover
but up here you have the ISO cell the
new ISO cell camera and also the
addition of the heart rate monitor
ultimately however looks are one thing
handling is a whole different story and
in that regard I have to give Samsung
some credit because they believe in
their design and if it ain't broke they
don't necessarily have to fix it the
size of the phone even with the 5.1 inch
screen is still highly accessible as it
is only marginally larger than its
predecessor if you were a fan of the
handling experience of the Galaxy s4 you
get largely the same deal here it's an
aspect of the phone that always strikes
me first the ease of use in one hand and
the ability to reach most places on the
screen because of the ergonomics so if
the looks of the phone are going to lose
some points maybe it redeems itself by
having a form factor that is ultimately
familiar meaning that the learning curve
on the galaxy s5 is really not all that
steep at all
Samsung continues its tradition of Super
AMOLED displays by bumping up its size
by 0.1 inches and pretty much everything
you may expect from this 1080p
resolution screen with 432 pixels per
inch is here in the galaxy s5 display
highly vibrant colors do justice to the
updated version of TouchWiz as colors
basically pop out and punch you in the
face this kind of vibrancy is
eye-catching to be sure but can be toned
down if you wish them to be viewing
angles are as good as ever allowing you
to see elements clearly even in steep
angles and pretty much any in all media
you're going to watch through this
display shines through so fire up games
like plants vs. zombies - and enjoy
yourself worth mentioning is the screams
ability to register touches from fingers
even when you're using gloves along with
its ability to recognize a hovering
finger for air view capabilities in
performance as is the case with all the
flagship updates this year the Samsung
Galaxy s5 sports the basically required
processing package the Snapdragon 801
clocked in at 2.5 gigahertz and backed
by the audrina 330 and 2 gigabytes of
RAM often we see comments regarding
stutter and lag on Samsung Galaxy
devices but while they may have been
occasional in the past I would use the
term seldom for this one credit can be
given to the updated and thus optimised
new version of TouchWiz in which I only
really find delays in the my magazine
area when it is trying to refresh the
line content especially with the slew of
tools available in the new version of
TouchWiz getting work and play done
shouldn't be an issue and thankfully the
phone is powerful enough to even handle
all of those tools
ip67 means that the s5 is dustproof and
can be under one meter of water for 30
minutes and after splashing about in my
tests the phone bounced right back and
was responsive I didn't even have much
trouble with the water registering
presses on the screen as can be an issue
with other water resistant phones and
all of that protection helps keep safe a
number of features that range from
ultimately useful to maybe useful
sometimes because at the very least
under that back cover you have access to
that removable battery and also to the
expandable storage using the microSD
card slot an IR blaster allows you to
control your TVs and set-top boxes in an
app that helps you find the best content
on TV and the sensors within the phone
help with various functions like the s
health pedometer and the air gestures
all of which make their return in the S
5 call quality on the t-mobile network
yielded few problems no calls were
dropped and neither side of the call
complained about the sound quality and
speaking of sound quality the speaker of
the Galaxy s5 is still relegated to the
back side portion and mostly retains the
experience of before with a pretty
one-dimensional sound and a lack of
volume while it is possible to mess with
the settings in order to achieve a
slightly better sound overall the galaxy
s 5 speaker just pales in comparison to
any of its competitors that have
front-facing speakers the main additions
when it comes to the hardware are the
heart rate monitor and the finger
scanner both of which are covered in
future focus videos but here's the gist
the heart rate monitor does add another
layer to the s health fold but unless
you're only looking for a snapshot of
your heart rate from time to time the
single readings possible by the s5 SHRM
won't prove useful for anyone truly
passionate about fitness and while the
finger scanner does add another level of
security to the s5 I found it a little
more bothersome than anything adding to
the time it takes for me to get into the
phone perhaps when it is given more
functionality than basically just
unlocking the phone I would use it much
more at the time of filming all of the
b-roll for this video I was using the
phone pretty extensively obviously
especially since I was taking it out for
a camera shootout so here is what my
usage looked like once the battery hit
50% so the average user will get
longevity from this phone while power
users might be reaching for the power
cord just in time for bed and the ultra
power saving mode might be your saving
grace as you are able to strip the phone
experience to its monochromatic
bare-bones limiting you to only some
apps and settings at the benefit of
having much more longevity now one of
the biggest additions to the Galaxy s5
is the new ISO cell camera an optic
package that brings 16 megapixels of
power and new technology to isolate
pixels for higher quality photos but if
you don't need to hear the technical
jargon perhaps the quality may speak for
itself first we'll talk about the app
which takes on the Mohr circle centric
motif of the updated TouchWiz look while
dialing it back on some of the features
that were originally introduced in the
galaxy s4 and then adding in a few new
ones it's a pretty simple app to use at
first glance as auto mode will get you
where you need to go but open up that
settings menu and you'll see all that
you can tweak in a long scrolling menu
live HDR affords you the ability to see
through the viewfinder
the effect HDR would have on your shot
it's useful if you aren't sure how HDR
would affect the scene and when you use
it right it can really enhance an
otherwise jarring Li contrast II photo
select the focus of Samsung's way of
adding some style to your photos with
the mode on you can focus on your main
subject and then the camera will take
multiple photos and process them
together the processing time is a little
long but if done right you can play
around with the resulting image and
while at times it will do its job well
and yield you the choice of foreground
background or everything in focus it can
be a hit or miss at times when the
software is unable to draw a perfect
line between subjects you'll notice as a
portion of the picture will be blurred
because it wasn't processed properly in
the end ISO cell seems to do the trick
as far as quality goes at first yielding
photos with great colour saturation and
pretty good detail at first glance the
details are captured pretty well as a
number of photos show good sharpness
even after zooming in but this is not
true for every photo lowering the
overall lighting conditions will
exacerbate this which comes as a little
surprise but the camera does continue to
get some decent
it's even in those less than ideal
situations so with the slew of features
and settings Ives disposal the ISO cell
camera proves to be a worthy companion
for anyone that wants to get even just a
little bit more out of their smartphone
photography and we finally make it to
software in which we see an updated
version of TouchWiz one that might not
be as drastic and update as many hoped
but still manages to somewhat add to the
formula at first glance touch with seems
like the same old same old you have the
very colourful home screens and also the
app drawer which is still a paginated
layout horizontally but then you'll see
in addition in the home screens when you
move left and it is called the my
magazine while it is supposed to be a
news aggregator it does piggyback off a
Flipboard but not to the extent you
might like even casual users of
Flipboard which is still a very powerful
and stylish news application will not be
happy to know that their own set up
notifications don't filter through the
my magazine screen instead it pulls from
a curated list of categorical offerings
and then your social media outlets more
freedom of choice would have helped the
my magazine which ultimately becomes a
shortcut to parts of Flipboard that you
probably don't use pull down that
notification drop-down and you're going
to see how the circles comprise the
power widget and when you bring it down
to see all of the features available in
your s5 you'll find that signature long
list of particular toggles now many of
these will be familiar but one worth
mentioning is the toolbox a small
floating button which is much like a
chat head that provides a quick shortcut
to up to five different favorited apps
after that we also have a download
booster which allows TouchWiz to
download files larger than 30 megabytes
using both your Wi-Fi and mobile data
connection it works extremely well but
don't get carried away or you'll use of
all your data in no time and all of
these are found in a completely revamped
settings menu that has taken on that
circle motif as well all options are
also quite elegantly categorized in pull
downs making it easy to find what you're
looking for after that much of what you
may remember returns like every gesture
you may or may not use the multi window
and apps like s-health
which was updated mainly to accommodate
the heart rate monitor what strikes me
most about this update version of
TouchWiz is the fact that it's actually
pretty smooth and I found the
performance to be actually quite good
the only thing that I'm really sick of
when it comes to TouchWiz are the noises
that it makes all of those little noises
that we've had since the galaxy s2 are
really played out but those subtle
changes that you find in here do afford
it a little bit of freshness at least
until it doesn't feel fresh anymore and
after that it pretty much comes down to
touch was being a little bit too
familiar for its own good but at least
it's pretty snappy and it's still pretty
reliable the Galaxy s5 will be available
for all the major carriers soon at the
premium prices for their two-year
contracts usually $1.99 in the States
expect unlocked versions of the phone to
range close to the $700 mark and so
there you have it the Samsung Galaxy s5
now a lot of you out there are probably
not going to look at this phone as a
proper upgrade and how do I know that
what's because you've sounded off on it
already and in quite a few ways they're
probably right some additions like the
heart rate monitor or even the finger
scanner still don't feel ultimately
useful to me and will probably sit in
that Samsung bag of tricks marked galaxy
syndrome which includes a number of
other features from previous iterations
it also might not be the best-looking
phone out as for some it seems too
similar to its predecessor while perhaps
somewhat regressing with its material
choice but for every finger scanner
there's an ISO cell camera for every
design choice you may not like there is
now IP certification and for every point
loss for being unoriginal there are
points for familiarity half of you will
like this phone the other half will not
that's the reality of the galaxy at this
point but there is one thing for certain
you probably know what it is you want
and if what the galaxy s5 offers fits
into your needs then guess what you're
probably going to love this device and
for everyone else out there we do have
the benefit of quite a few other choices
in the smartphone game but as far as the
galaxy s5 goes I would encourage you to
still give it a try
