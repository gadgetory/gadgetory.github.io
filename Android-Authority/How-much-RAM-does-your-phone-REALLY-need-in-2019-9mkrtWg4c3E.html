is android authoritative the humble
beginnings of android you'll find
smartphones with quite small amounts of
RAM quite small amounts of memory maybe
512 megabytes maybe 1 gigabyte and then
over the years that kind of number has
started to rise slowly 2 gigabytes 3
gigabytes 4 gigabytes in flagship
devices really was quite popular for a
couple of years but now we've got to the
point where memory is kind of going out
of control we had 6 gigabytes and 8
gigabytes and now people talk about 10
gigabyte devices probably we're gonna
see 12 gigabyte devices so how come
we've gone from these humble beginnings
right up to these very very large
amounts of memory is it just spec Wars
is one camera just trying to beat
another just on the specification sheet
or actually do you need that amount of
memory well I've done some
experimentation I've done some
investigation and I want to look at how
much memory do you actually need in your
Android smartphone so if you want to
find out more please they mix playing so
the first thing to mention is I've just
published a video over at the Gary
explains channel which talks about the
technical details of how Android deals
with its RAM what does it do when you
try to launch an app and there's no
space left in RAM for that app to
actually occupy now I'll go into all the
technical detail over there but the
bottom line is is that some other app
will have to be kicked out of RAM to
make room for the new app and what that
means is if you're scrolling through the
recent apps screen if you tap on an app
that's actually still in memory it would
have come up instantaneously and Carol
exactly where it left off however if you
tap on an app that actually been kicked
out of RAM then that app will load up
from the beginning you might see kind of
the splash screen as it loads and it
will try to resume exactly where it was
but maybe in some cases like in a game
it won't be able to resume exactly where
it was it will maybe take it to the
beginning of that level or something
like that so there is a disadvantage to
having apt kind of kicked out of RAM
because it does affect your user
experience ever so slightly having said
that there is a point where having so
much RAM
doesn't really change the user
experience I mean it kind of
unreasonable to say hey I launched this
app three months ago and I've never
rebooted my phone when I tapped on it in
the recent apps list it reloaded it from
the disk that's outrageous I wanted it
to stay in memory for three months well
clearly that's not what we want either
so we do is look at how much RAM do you
actually need do that when you look at
two things first we're going to see how
much RAM and actual app takes a second
if when you see how much RAM is
available on some of the popular Android
devices okay so let's start by looking
at apps now when you load an app from
the internal storage and it come of
comes up onto the screen it takes up
some RAM in your Android device so a
standard app in Android takes about 300
megabytes of RAM so if you think about
you know Google Play itself or Spotify
or candy crush you know YouTube simple
apps like this some of course take
slightly less some take slightly more I
did a kind of an experiment looking at a
lot of the popular apps and the average
about 300 megabytes so that would mean
that if you had for example a
theoretical phone with let's say one
gigabyte of available memory that could
actually take three of those apps in
memory simultaneously without any
problem in fact once you include
swapping which I deal with in that video
on the Garrick special that might be
bumped up to let's say a fourth app
simultaneously in memory but there are
of course other types of apps for
example if you have a media intensive
app that say something like Instagram or
Gmail things that are kind of loading up
different you know pieces of data
photographs the Google Photos app for
example these kind of apps can take a
lot more space because every one of
those photos even though it's a
thumbnail needs to be stored in memory
and you want it accessible quick as
you're scrolling you want all these
pictures to appear so those kind of apps
can take maybe up to 500 maybe 600
megabytes of RAM so that would mean if
you were kind of using Google photos
then you might be able to also have
candy crush and let's say Google Play
and Spotify also all in memory at the
same time but that Google photo
ass has taken up more of the available
memory and then after that you've got
some very heavy intensive apps and these
are mainly games if you look at games
like for example Need for Speed no
limits or pub G or asphalt 9 then all of
these apps might take 809 under even a
gigabyte of RAM so if you go back to our
theoretical one gigabyte available
memory one game like Need for Speed can
take up all that memory in one go and
all those other apps you had you know
Google Play and Twitter and all that all
get kicked out of memory to make room
for that one app it's also worth
mentioning that Google Chrome falls into
that it's kind of heavy usage category
because as you're opening up different
tabs as you're loading up web pages
themselves have got images in them
actually the amount of space that Google
Chrome can use with three or four open
tabs can easily go over nine hundred
megabytes towards one gigabyte so in
thinking about how much RAM you need you
need to think about what kind of apps
you use do you run games like fortnight
and pub G and Need for Speed if you do
then your RAM use is gonna be much
higher than somebody who really just
kind of uses Spotify and Twitter and
then occasionally read some emails and
goes into Instagram they're very two
different categories of users and the
demands that you place on your
smartphone are very different they said
there's some popular Android devices to
see how much installed RAM they have and
how much available RAM they have which
can of course be used by apps so I've
got here a while way mate eight that
I've had for a couple of years it's a
three gigabyte device and that has 1.3
gigabytes of available memory and it's
using 512 megabytes of zared Ram
compression again go and see that gary
explains video if you want to know what
that means now a device that the pixel
3xl comes with four gigabytes of that
1.7 gigabytes is the available memory
and it's using one gigabyte of zed ram
and the device like the Galaxy Note 8
and the galaxy note 9 both have 6
gigabytes of RAM now the note 8 will
have about 2
seven gigabyte of available memory and a
2.5 gigabyte
zedd ram space whereas the note 9 will
have about 3.5 gigabytes of available
memory and a 2 gigabyte zedd ram and
then of course we come to the 1 plus 6
now 1 plus or one of the companies that
have always been pushing high amounts of
ram so it gives you 8 gigabytes of ram
the McLaren Edition gives you 10
gigabytes of RAM now in the 8 gigabyte
version then you get 5 gigabytes of
available memory after a reboot and
there is 0z ram you so there's 0
swapping available on the 1 plus 60 i
know we have those numbers it really
just a case of doing the maths plus a
little bit of leeway because of the idea
of swapping so if you've got 1 point 7
gigabytes of available memory like you
do on the pixel 3xl well that means you
can get 5 apps in memory simultaneously
when the apps are around 300 megabytes
of occupancy each if you then stick in a
big game for example like a Need for
Speed well that's gonna take away a
gigabyte then the other 700 megabytes
will can be used by 2 or 3 apps like you
know Google Play and Spotify and YouTube
without you having to restart any apps
at all but with 4 gigabytes of memory
even though you can happily switch
between half a dozen apps or so you can
even put in a big game in there and
still have enough memory to switch
between a couple of apps some users find
that over time because really they are
using more than just 2 or 3 apps they
might have maybe six seven eight ten
twelve apps they use regularly to do you
know the weather and the news and the
email and by time you start running all
those different things then they're
gonna find they are gonna find app
restarts happening quite frequently now
if you move over to some of the devices
with 6 gigabytes of RAM here we can see
already that we're talking about 2.5
gigabytes or 3 gigabytes of available
memory and that would mean literally you
can run like a big game like Need for
Speed still have 2 gigabytes of memory
available which means you can kind of a
load and then all your app that Spotify
and Twitter and Gmail and Instagram and
you'll still have plenty of room in
there
and on top of that you've got the idea
of the swapping using the SRAM so really
at this stage in 2019 six gigabytes is
the start of the sweet point because
here really you can switch between apps
quite freely even some very big apps and
you're not really gonna see an app
restart very often and then we get on to
devices with eight gigabytes for example
at the oneplus 60 and there you've got
like five gigabytes of available memory
so the sweet spot here really does
continue because you can run like you
know Need for Speed &amp;amp; fortnight and
Instagram and Gmail and a whole bunch
you know ten or twelve other smaller
apps all at the same time and they can
all stay in RAM and you can switch
between them seamlessly however this
really is the upper end of the sweet
spot and kind of I would challenge
people who use phones with six gigabytes
and eight gigabytes to see if they
really could see the difference inside
this sweet spot you know is there really
much of a user difference from my
testing and from my day to day usage I
have a six gigabyte note 8 I don't see
much of a difference between 16 bytes
and 8 gigabytes but they are both part
of this nice sweet spot however once you
go beyond 8 gigabytes to 10 gigabytes
and 212 and who knows 16 gigabytes
really now we are entering into the land
of mr. silly who of course if you've
read any of the mr. men books lives in
nonsense land and this really is a place
where it really is quite stupid because
you don't need to hold you know
fortnight and pub G and needs the speed
and and then who else knows whatever
apps all in memory all at the same time
so that an app you started you know a
month ago when you switched to it in the
recent apps it's still there so really
more than 8 gigabytes I think personally
is really quite ridiculous actually if
you translate that through to let's say
the desktop and the laptop world well I
have a laptop with 8 gigabytes my car
and run Premiere Pro and Photoshop and
lots of other things on it and it works
absolutely fine and the idea that my
smartphone would need more RAM than my
desktop on my laptop
really
quite ridiculous now we need to put in a
couple of caveats here because I can see
some of your already seizing and you
want to jump down to the comments and
start writing something well let's just
put in a couple of caveats here first of
all it does depend on which phone you
are actually using I have talked
generically about four gigabytes and six
gigabytes and eight gigabytes and an
eval of available RAM there are some
OEMs who put some quite heavy-handed app
killers in their version of Android so
you switch the phone off you put asleep
leave it on the desk and when you come
back thirty minutes ladies even though
you've got all that available memory
they've been killed off I know that in
my mate eight for example in the first
few weeks that I had it I certainly
spent quite a lot of time going into the
settings and there's a whitelist where
you can say don't kill this app and I
actually had to go through putting in
there the apps that I use most
frequently because they were being
killed off even though there was
actually free RAM available so some OEMs
do mistakenly kill off apps in the
background and then you switch to them
and you only has them open like an hour
ago and you haven't got that much
running and they've been killed off and
that can be a problem but that's not to
do with the amount of RAM you've got in
your smartphone that's purely the
firmware that the OEM has put in there
and they've configured it wrongly and
that's something you need to watch out
for and the second thing I'd like to say
is that it doesn't necessarily mean you
shouldn't buy a phone with let's say ten
gigabytes of RAM because maybe that
phone is good for other reasons so for
example if a really good smartphone came
out now which has got the best camera
and it's got the best display and it's
got the best battery life and it's
offering you know the best online
services then really the fact that it
comes with ten gigabytes shouldn't you
shouldn't say oh I'm not going to buy
that because that's just stupid
if it's good for the other reasons then
just accept the ten gigabytes what it is
but personally I would like to see
consumers boycotting devices with
anything more than eight gigabytes in
them because really it's unreasonable
all it is is just a spec war between 100
a.m. and another om it raises the prices
reduces the quality because they're
trying to squeeze in more stuff for less
money
and really isn't worth it but if you do
find a perfect phone that happens to
have that amount of memory well they
would have to accept it but really it's
not necessary eight gigabytes max is all
you're gonna need certainly for 2019
I would gather also for 2020 really this
has to stop this kind of battle between
these companies just has to stop because
it's not worth it and it's just stupid
and the final caveat to put in of course
is it does depend on your usage as I
have mentioned if you are just a person
who uses kind of the standard apps that
take 300 400 megabytes then you know 4
gigabytes 6 gigabytes
you may even better get away with 3 or 2
gigabytes in your use it's going to be
absolutely fine if your device is well
tuned other people who will do nothing
but switch between five different online
games that each take up 1 gigabyte of
memory and he wants to be kind of or she
wants to be switching between these you
know they're playing for tonight then
they play Need for Speed and they're
playing something else and they're
playing it well okay in that case then
you might need more memory but kind of
if we come down to the medium space here
of what you know and there's a large
wide media space of what a lot of people
do those are extreme cases for ok you
can live with it 6 to 8 is a sweet spot
anything more than 8 is really just too
much but your situation of course may be
different ok so there you have it my
name is Gary Sims this is Android or
thority I really hope you enjoyed this
video if you did please do give it a
thumbs up don't forget to subscribe to
the and or authority YouTube channel
don't forget to go over to the Gary
explains YouTube channel to look at that
video on how Android memory management
works and of course don't forget to go
into and/or Authority calm ok that's it
I'll see in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
