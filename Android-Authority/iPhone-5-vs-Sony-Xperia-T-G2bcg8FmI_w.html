Authority in this episode I'm going to
compare an apple and an on Apple more
specifically Apple's hottest smartphone
the iPhone 5 and one of Sony's freshest
releases the Xperia TLT 30p also known
as the Xperia T ll t 38 e in the US
phones nowadays maybe getting bigger but
the Xperia T is relatively pocketable
the iPhone 5 however is smaller lighter
and thinner than the Xperia T and can
comfortably slip into smaller pockets
both phones friend is simple and clean
on the iPhone 5 you can find the home
button earpiece grille and a front
camera but no logo or branding in
contrast the Xperia T's front has the
earpiece grille thread camera logos but
no physical button the Xperia T has no
use for hardware navigation buttons in
favor of virtual navigation the iPhone
5s Hardware buttons and ports are
conveniently positioned on its sides the
power button is on the top side and it's
easy to reach by the index finger the
right side has only the nano SIM tray
the mute switch and the separate volume
buttons are on the left side these are
easily accessible by the thumb the
headphone jack loudspeakers and
lightning port are on the bottom side on
the Xperia T the headphone jack is at
the top side ready for music playback in
an upright position
the microUSB port sits by its lonesome
at the left side and the bottom side has
nothing but the phone Mike on the
beveled edge most of the ports and
buttons are at the right side micro SD
and micro SIM slots power key volume
rocker and dedicated camera shutter
button I find these buttons in
conveniently positioned here on the
lower half of the side I actually find
the iPhone 5s buttons more conveniently
positioned the iPhone 5s non removable
aluminum back has glass strips at the
top and bottom parts the 8 megapixel
camera recording mic and camera flash
its overall look is essentially just
that of a black slab of glass and metal
with rounded corners
in contrast the Xperia T soft touch
rubber back curves towards the middle
making the phone lean into your hand for
a comfortable grip centered horizontally
are its 13 megapixel camera flash logo
and loudspeaker grille on the one hand
the iPhone 5s back projects class and
strengths on the other hand the Xperia T
combines strength and sexy if you ask me
either of the two can perfectly match
James Bond's character I also observed
that after having used the back of the
iPhone 5 tends to feel hotter than the
back of the Xperia T this is most likely
because the iPhone 5s aluminum back
conducts heat better than the Xperia T
Sperber back these two phones have
gorgeous an eye-popping displace the
iPhone 5 has Apple's popular Retina
display on a 4-inch screen with a
resolution of 11 36 by 640 and density
of 326 PPI on the other hand the Xperia
T provides visuals enhanced by Sony's
Mobile BRAVIA Engine and displayed on a
four-point 55 inch screen with an HD
resolution of 1280 by 720 and a density
of 323 PPI both phones in doubtedly show
color rich crisp and clear images on
their respective displays however I feel
that colors are more saturated on the
iPhone 5 or as colors are brighter on
the Xperia T compared to the processing
muscle of recently unleashed quad-core
phones both the iPhone 5 and Xperia T
appeared diminutive we
and vulnerable on the spec sheet at
least but in reality these two phones
despite the dual-core processing can
give generally snappy performance web
browsing on the iPhone 5 for example is
smooth and seamless Apple seems to have
perfected the art of optimizing software
and hardware the Xperia T however is not
particularly slow but you can feel some
lag when launching apps when zooming in
and out of webpages and when swiping
between screens the iPhone 5 comes in 16
32 and 64 gigabyte variants with no
microSD card expansion the Xperia T on
the other hand only comes with 16
gigabytes but can accept a microSD card
for 32 gigabytes more storage for
connectivity both phones are capable of
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections but be
wary of the iPhone 5s Bluetooth because
in our experience it is very picky
bluetooth on the Xperia T is not as
finicky the Xperia T is also capable of
near field communication or NFC the
iPhone 5 doesn't have this feature for
wide data connections and for charging
you'll only need a standard microUSB
cable for the Xperia T for the iPhone 5
you'll need a non standards-compliant
and proprietary lightning cable the
iPhone 5 runs iOS 6 bringing with it
Siri and Facebook and Twitter
integration it is a stable operating
system but personalization and
customization are not as flexible as
Android the Xperia T runs Android 4.0
point 4 Ice Cream Sandwich I feel
disappointed knowing that a lot of newer
devices already have Android 4.1 jelly
bean and some are already receiving
Android 4.2 on top of Ice Cream Sandwich
is sonice own x kpy which is a beautiful
unique and flexible UI the iPhone 5s
audio quality is good and crisp
unfortunately it's not very loud
Audio on the Xperia T on the other hand
is not only loud but also crisp and
clear
thanks to X loud enhancement clear bass
a five band equalizer and equalizer
presets
both phones can play 1080p full-hd
videos I like the layout and design of
the movies app on the Xperia T because
it feels like I'm at the cinema videos
played in the Photos app on the iPhone 5
has a storyboard on top allowing you to
skip to a certain part of the video the
two phones can capture awesome outdoor
photos photo capture and low-light
settings also produces acceptable photo
quality thanks to the camera flash on
both phones the Xperia T has greater
flexibility with image capture
resolution allowing you to shoot at full
13 megapixels or at a lower 10 or 2
megapixels the iPhone 5s image capture
resolution is fixed at 8 megapixels both
the iPhone 5 and the Xperia T can record
1080p full HD videos video recording on
the Xperia T however leaves a lot to be
desired image stabilization isn't as
stable and autofocus isn't as auto worse
the camera lens makes noise loud enough
to be caught along with the video
between the two the iPhone 5 gives an
hour more of battery power it uses a
1440 mAh lithium polymer battery which
can power the phone for up to about
eight hours of talktime on the 3G
connection the Xperia T can last up to
about seven hours talktime on 3G with
its 1850 mAh lithium ion battery and
some each phone packs satisfying display
for media consumption fast processor for
gaming and a good camera for taking
pictures
each phone's build and design projects a
distinct aura gives it a distinct look
and projects a personality performance
and navigation on the two phones are
fluid and generally seamless though the
operating system features on the two
phones may differ greatly both Android
and iOS are user friendly stable and
simple Android though provides greater
flexibility and freedom especially when
coupled with a user interface such as
Sony's Timescape UI between the iPhone 5
and the Xperia T which one suits you
