tablets in the world looks like we got a
few more on the way hey what is going on
guys lon here from android authority and
samsung's premiere event is on jun 12 in
new york city where they will be
unveiling some brand new tablets and if
you haven't been following any of the
leaks or rumors you're probably
wondering what it is about these tabs
that make them worth talking about make
them worth even mentioning because it
seems like samsung is releasing tablets
every few months but the reason why
these tablets are creating a lot of buzz
is because one they're featuring some
very high-end specs and two is the
display they're going to actually be
featuring a Super AMOLED display which
is something we haven't seen a lot in
Samsung tablets the last time we saw in
amla display on a samsung tablet was the
Galaxy Tab 7.7 which came out a few
years ago and that was really more of an
experiment more of a proof of concept
and we haven't seen another amla tablet
from samsung since then and AMOLED
technology is one of the reasons why
Samsung is pretty well known they use
AMOLED displays and pretty much all of
their smartphones with the exception of
a few but we haven't really seen that
technology translate over to tablets but
before we talk about why we haven't
necessarily seen samsung's AMOLED
technology used in their tablets let's
talk about some of the rumored specs
that we're expecting to see with these
brand new tablets so inside we're
expecting to see an Exynos octa core
processor and there's also been some
rumblings about a Snapdragon 801 ship so
there might be a possibility of seeing
two different variants of these tablets
which is something we've seen Samsung do
before on their phones and then around
back we're expecting to see an 8
megapixel camera a 2 megapixel camera on
the front and then all of your usual
stuff like Wi-Fi Bluetooth 4.0 LTE
connectivity and android 4.4 kitkat
running the show and then we've also
heard some rumors about a fingerprint
sensor being built into that home button
just like the galaxy s5 so that's going
to be interesting to see but the most
interest
spec of them all is the display besides
being super amoled is also going to be
super high-resolution coming in at 2560
by 1600 now none of these specs are a
hundred percent confirmed as they're
completely just rumors at this point as
Samsung has been completely quiet on the
entire subject but they did release a
teaser with a tagline tab into color
which we assume is a reference to the
Super AMOLED display and also the
possibility of having these tablets in a
variety of different colors instead of
just your standard black and white but
one thing that is confirmed though from
some of the leaked images that we've
seen is the design and it seems to be
featuring the same design as the Samsung
Galaxy s5 with the perforated back but
other than that it looks pretty much the
same as any other Samsung tablet as far
as anything else we're going to be
seeing at this particular event I don't
think we're going to be getting in s 5
prime so I wouldn't get your hopes up
for that I think that's pretty much just
a unicorn phone at this point we might
see some new accessories for these
tablets maybe an s5 mini something along
those lines but I wouldn't expect to see
anything major in terms of a flagship
smartphone but let's jump back and talk
about the AMOLED display so like I
mentioned earlier the Galaxy Tab 7.7 was
the very first tablet from samsung to
feature an AMOLED display but we haven't
seen one since then and the biggest
question to that is what's taking them
so long and the answer that question is
the technology just simply wasn't ready
let's take a look back at the original
google nexus one which wasn't a samsung
phone it was actually an HTC made phone
but it did feature in AMOLED display it
was one of the very first smartphones
with any sort of notoriety to feature in
AMOLED display and if you remember on
the next one the display wasn't all that
great like colors didn't look good
viewing angles were terrible and it was
also extremely reflective so outdoor
visibility wasn't good and ever since
then Samsung has improved on the oled
display dramatically and for the last
several years manufacturers have
preferred using lcds over OLED displays
because of all the disadvantages that
OLED displays brought
lcds were just a lot brighter you got
much more accurate colors and better
viewing angles and oled technology was
lacking all of this but it has improved
over the last several years and we've
seen that come to fruition especially on
the galaxy s5 the galaxy s5 has great
colors great viewing angles gets
extremely bright and it has great
outdoor visibility as well so we've seen
it improved so much over the last
several years and Samsung feels like
they're finally ready to be used on a
tablet and just taking a look back at
something like the nexus one to the
galaxy s5 now the OLED display has
improved drastically over the years and
even other OEMs are starting to adopt it
like Motorola for example so I'm pretty
excited to actually see these AMOLED
displays used on a tablet but let me
know what you guys think are you guys
excited about these tablets I'm gonna
stop talking now are you guys excited

forward to seeing an AMOLED tablet or is
