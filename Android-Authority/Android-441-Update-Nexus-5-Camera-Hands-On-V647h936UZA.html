going on everybody and if you are a
proud Nexus 5 owner then you may or may
not know that a update has just been
released for your beloved cell phone it
updates your android 4.4 kitkat from 4.4
to 4.4.1 and for the changelog we can
just put aside a bunch of the different
updates because the most important one
is what we're covering right now and
that is just a camera seeing as though I
have a couple of Nexus 5's right here
one of them is updated to 4.4.1 and one
of them is not can you guess which one
was that too much okay find the black
ones updated and of course as you can
see there 4.4.1
on the left on the black version and 4.4
the original on the white version and
let me tell you right now there is an
improvement but don't take my word for
it why don't you go ahead and just see
for yourself this is a bench that is
situated right outside of my house and
in this particular picture you can see
it actually doesn't look too bad but I
will tell you that the actual seen the
actual bench itself has a little bit
more richness to the color of the brown
in the wood so you see that picture and
then boom here is the difference with
the updated camera as you can see there
already the richness in that brown wood
that I was talking about earlier is
actually there it's a difference that
you can plainly see even even to the
naked eye it's not that hard to find for
my Filipinos out there here is a quick
picture of a calamansi plant and you can
see here how even the greens in the
background have a much better tone to
them but the actual pieces of calamansi
are given a much more vivid orange tone
rather than the washed out colors that
were from the original camera all in all
the pictures just look a lot more
pleasing that's really what we're going
for here so here is the white Nexus 5
that is sporting the original Android
4.4 ROM alright so let's get ourselves
focused here and then focus again so if
I'm going to focus in on the left fella
you'll see that the focus point takes a
little bit of time too and in that case
it didn't even get
there takes a little bit of times
actually get there and when I actually
take the photo it has to take the
picture focus again focus yet again when
I hit the shutter and it just has to
keep focusing every single time and with
the delay that's already there that
really causes a bit of a problem enter
the black edition of the Nexus 5 here we
go that camera should already be loaded
up and here is what focusing looks like
here you can already see that that
reticule in the middle the HUD if you
will is showing up very quickly
disappearing right away it is keeping
the focus about as well as it should be
right there if I focus on the left one
not only does it achieve the focus more
often but it does so in much better time
in almost half if not even less the time
of the original 4.4 build snap doesn't
even take any time to focus because it
already has the focus from the previous
shot so it doesn't have to really search
for it that's the point it's pretty easy
to see the improvements from left to
right what was once a little bit washed
out and lacking a little bit detail on
the left has been given those
improvements on the right and that could
also be because the camera does a better
job of processing not only its white
balance but also its exposure allowing
the camera to not just get messed up due
to the strong light coming from the
window and then just going for the
slightly higher exposure causing a more
washed out picture and then you look on
the right especially in these crops and
because of that better processing
there's more detail in jolly old st.
Nick's face and then you also have a
much better color reproduction providing
for a better picture overall in terms of
functionality there is one missing
feature on the HDR plus from the
original camera as you can see hdr+ is
there but I am unable to pinch to zoom
or even zoom pretty much at all here
whereas with HDR plus on in the updated
camera pinch-to-zoom
is perfectly doable
and to round out this quick look at the
camera updates found in Android 4.4.1 we
have a couple pictures of my android
buddy doctor now on the right side the
fabric on this Android plushie the green
is definitely much more vivid has much
more richness to it as compared to the
duller reproduction found on the left
side here we have dr. oil and the only
light that is coming through here is
from my monitor everything else is
turned off and on the original camera
you can see it's incredibly fuzzy but on
the updated camera while this is still
not a picture that I would necessarily
use there is still a lot more detail
despite there being a low light
situation and also yes the focusing was
a lot better on the updated camera as it
was able to actually focus on the scene
whereas I had to try over and over again
on the original camera until it finally
got the focus right if you want to see
the high-resolution examples of these
pictures as well as the split
comparisons between the two so you can
see the improvement from one over the
other then you can look at the link that
