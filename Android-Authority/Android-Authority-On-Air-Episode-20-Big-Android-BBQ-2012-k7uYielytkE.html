anderson and welcome to android
authority on air the original Google+
enjoyed hang out sho this week we are
joined by returning guest tree moats a x
android developer in it fellow android
enthusiasts we're joined by johnathan
franklin new guest this week he is a big
Android stand and the fellow enthusiast
and we're also joined by Aaron Caston of
the big Android BBQ welcome guys glad to
be here the Scott what are we talking
about this week oh we're going to be
talking about the Android BBQ we're
talking to Aaron about a little bit of
information on as to what it is and who
its imports going over some software
updates on some new device releases and
we got some tasty Nexus 7 News to talk
about towards the end okay so as we said
we have aaron here from the big Android
BBQ it's a yearly event i believe this
is the third year it will be the third
year come this fall and i'm pretty
excited excited i've never been to one
I've known this year and I don't really
know a lot about it so so Aaron is a
someone that's only seen a few videos
from time to time you know he tell us a
little bit about the Android BBQ um yeah
I mean it's it's it's an interesting
story so it all started at i/o three
years ago okay I was walking down the
street with I don't know if you know who
Gregg Caryn is he works with Moby cartel
and he's would be notions in Canada he
was there as a developer and a bunch of
people had met there for the first time
off of twitter uh we'd all been big in
Android enthusiasts and and I was like
man this is such a fun event it's so
great to get to know all these people
you didn't know before you know you get
him online but you never met them in
person we should there should be
something just to bring people together
so I contacted a buddy that I knew in
Austin his name is came on askari he's
it's known as big cave on on Twitter and
he's on google+ really great guy and
we're we talked about it and we were
like why don't we why would try
something small you know just like 15 20
30 people you know will do in the
backyard we'll throw a little barbecue
so we called it our big Texas beta
barbecue and we had 13 people show up
everybody brought like 25 bucks and
whatever they wanted to drink no that
went towards towards food and we
provided some drinks and everybody had a
good time and I had some shirts printed
up and you know it was fun and we
decided you know and a lot of people on
Twitter were like hey we wanted you know
do a bigger one we want to come you know
this looks fun so we I got with that
first year I was working with the droid
guy and we planned a barbecue that uh
with 500 people show up Wow we rented a
place called fiesta gardens in in austin
texas we provided kegs of beer pretty
much all you could drink Ray Walters
cooked for us he's a well-known I think
he's participated in some contests in
one he's a professional master slow cook
meat guy yeah he said he's our barbecue
master basically so he cooked out for
the first year I and hands down that was
the best pulled pork I've probably ever
had and it was just a really great
experience a lot of people got to meet
for the first time we had a lot a lot of
really influential developers come out
and get to know people and we learned a
lot I mean I'd never planned in a bit
before and neither had anybody else so
there are a lot of work goes into that
too you know there's a lot of behind
that you know you got to pay for it
that's the hard part you know is raising
the funds to pay for it and and we
really wanted it to be affordable for
our attendees we wanted it to be as
cheap as possible because you know I I'm
looking at it as if I were going to
attend this event I don't have much
money so you know I wanted it to be as
affordable as possible so we really put
the burden on our sponsors for that you
know where we wanted them to sponsor the
event so that we could bring all these
people together and really throw an
awesome event and we did
marie-jeanne answers right oh yeah we
have Texas Instruments the first year
they actually unveiled their cowboy guy
who is like this android with cowboy hat
mustache actually I have a this is
cowboy this guy a little bit on there
nice samsung they brought he was 6 feet
tall they brought one of these guys out
now first year that's first year samsung
was there HTC was there I mean we really
nailed some good sponsors and you know
we left that on a really high note and
we're really proud of what we had pulled
off and I think everybody was really
supportive nobody had a bad thing to say
but we learned a lot we learned that our
sponsors wanted was to connect with the
developers that's really what they were
looking for was to connect with the the
people that they could either higher or
get to use their SDKs and different
things like that so we knew next year
the following year we needed to
transition more to making it something
that developers would want to come to
and learn now is it only geared towards
developers or if I knew know nothing
about developing would I still be
welcome oh absolutely yeah it's we're
never going to forget who we are like I
said our first meetup was a meet-up
that's all it was the second year it was
kind of a enthusiast convention and then
the the earth well that was the the beta
barbecue preceded the original BBQ by
about four months so the first barbecue
was kind of an enthusiast convention the
second barbecue was more of a an
enthusiast convention with a developer
focus if that makes sense so we we had
some sessions last year we think we had
like 12 sessions total and we that gave
companies like Verizon and and texas
instruments and Samsung and Spiro and
the cyanogenmod team took a chance to
get up there and speak to the community
or speak to the the ecosystem of Android
and that was something there's not a lot
but I don't know that there's a really
any other event that's kind of offering
that
enthusiast developer you know bringing
just kind of the whole real community
centric event right yeah yeah it's a
melting pot of android developer android
you know it's an engine it it almost
seems like you know android social event
of the year but then it's also for
developers to do their thing to write
the reason we've really started to shift
more to the developers is because we're
basically offering one product to two
demographics we have our attendees who
are very important to us really they're
the heart and soul of the barbecue and
then we have the sponsors who we can't
make happen without them I mean they're
the ones that that allow us to do the
BBQ in the first place so so we have to
cater to both of them and we have to
provide a product and that it took it
took me a while to learn that that's
really what we're doing is providing a
product to these people will provide a
great experience product for our
attendees and a great opportunity
product for our sponsors and the
sponsors really wanted developers that's
you know that became abundantly clear to
us so we need it all you gotta you gotta
make this sponsors happy to know they
wanted you fronting the bill for a lot
of the event I'm sure yes I wanted to
learn more our viewers wanted to learn
more about the Android BBQ you guys
online you guys a google+ oh yeah we're
we try to we try to be everywhere that's
that's the only way we grow we don't pay
for any marketing we can't afford to
we're viral we grow virally and we grow
organically the only way anybody knows
about us is if you tell them about it
now this year I guess from you know from
paying attention to previous events it
looks like things are very you know a
lot of things are happening for you guys
you know you're going from it and
outside venue to a state-of-the-art the
conference center looks like this here
right so you can actually see photos and
all this is that cool stuff about the
the venue and and in some previous years
if you go to big Android BB q com or you
can check us out on Google+ big Android
b.b.q we're on twitter we're Android bv
q and we're on
facebook as I think big Android b.b.q as
well I don't know him all my head so
many social networks now yeah I know you
have to be everywhere right yeah yeah so
um you know this year we've got we've
tried to be a lot more organized this
year we moved indoors last year Texas
experienced a drought like never in my
lifetime I've lived here 30 years we've
never had anything like we did last year
this year hasn't been anything like that
but because it was so bad last year the
the venue we held it at is outdoors and
it's grass fields but last year they
were dirt field and when you have a
thought or 800 people walking in dirt
field you're kicking up a lot of dust
when you have sponsors like Texas
Instruments who are showing off their
panda boards and am song showing off the
galaxy s2 or whatever it was at the time
you have dust on everything it wasn't I
mean it worked out really great
everybody had a wonderful time the
sponsors were all really happy I think
all the attendees were really happy but
I got some feedback saying look you know
that's not a good environment for for
equipment electronics so and we had some
difficulties with the City of Austin so
we really gave it a lot of thought I
actually live in her so it'd be a lot
easier for me to just stay at home and
plan everything from here so if
something goes wrong I can just run down
to the convention center or run down to
the city offices and say hey what do we
got to do to get this fixed I couldn't
do that with it in Austin so we moved it
here I found the Hearst convention
center I looked around it you know the
dallas convention center the arlington
convention center for hotels and this
place is i don't know if any of you guys
have ever been to moscone center and
gets out there about two years ago it's
like a mini moscone so if you took
motzko knee-squeezed it down to one
floor and like compact it a little bit
and made it only sigh you know enough
room for maybe 2,000 people that's this
place you know the solid glass front
windows it's really realized I mean is a
really beautiful complex and so I went
down there we talked to them that it
caught us a little bit of a deal because
I told you I gave him the whole we're
small-time every
buddy that works on the barbecue is
volunteer including myself nobody gets
paid so we don't have big budgets you
know we don't have any investors the
only way we pull off the BBQ is with
ticket sales and sponsors that's the
only way it happens yes so we we talked
to them they're helping us out we're
having it catered by them this year but
the chef was it used to be the Executive
Chef for the Texas Rangers so you know
he's kind of knows what he's doing I'm
sure the Texas Ranger guys love barbecue
so yeah he's he's really good we do have
ray still cooking though which is which
is one of the things that kind of
surprised me so we've never really done
this in the past or we never done it at
all this year we had peered tickets and
we tried to kind of sweeten the packages
a little bit and make it a little more
exciting and some some different stuff
for our attendees we didn't want to
raise our prices but because our costs
are so much higher this year we had to
find creative ways to raise additional
income we just that's just in order to
do it we've got to figure out ways to
raise more money so we came up with this
idea of having some some different tiers
of path of tickets originally it was
going to be a Kickstarter but uh it
doesn't really work out so well when you
want like if you wanted to buy two
tickets how do you buy two tickets to
Kickstarter yeah so it really kind of
broke down as we were we were ramping up
we actually have a Kickstarter video
that is all done that it will probably
post in a couple of weeks or something
that funny it's just me Russell and race
then and Michael lipson who's our like
tech guy sitting in the Hangout just
chattin it was funny but I'm gonna have
to cut out the bloopers because those
were the really funny yeah I've seen
some interesting events such as whoa
naming names somebody that may or may
not be close to the sánge mod team that
may or may not have chugged a lot of
beer to win a watch uh I saw us on
google+ the other day yeah yeah
apparently there's a challenge on the
table yeah you know I'm not gonna lie um
I've been known to partake in an adult
beverage from time to time I'm looking
forward to that event
here if it's there so you hear that
Benji uncommon for you yeah so so that's
the way it's working out this year is
we've got our developer days we've got
to developer days saturday from like 8am
we're still finalizing the schedule but
from like basically eight a.m. to three
pm we're gonna have developer sessions
but it's not just going to be developer
here's here's because we know while
we're about probably fifty to sixty
percent developers we've got you know
thirty-five percent enthusiasts who who
don't know anything about development or
maybe know a little bit enough to be
dangerous or enough to get themselves in
trouble but but not not professional
developers not people who are developing
apps not people who are hacking on roms
yeah but you know those type of people
we want to cater to everybody we also
know we have business people coming
people who are who are CEOs and app
companies or or maybe you know they work
for for a nap and and they want to learn
how to market their app better so we've
tried to create three main tracks um
we're still like I said we're still
finalizing this we've still got I think
97 days before the barbecues you know
there's still a lot of stuff check my
desktop my homescreen widget here yeah
yeah so there's still a lot of changes
we're working on a nap room work are
this app if we can get it done if we can
give it this app is going to be amazing
it's going to do some really cool stuff
some stuff that you haven't ever seen
before things like that make the event
itself a lot more interactive where
maybe you go and we have a scavenger
hunt and you have to go from booth to
booth in the conventional or in the hall
the showroom for and and and check in at
these booze and you get rewards and then
the first one to finish get something
you know we're talking about all sorts
of ideas this app is gonna be really
exciting i can't wait for us to finish
it and be able to pull this off so yeah
it sounds extremely exciting i said i
ordered my ticket earlier in the week
they i saw i assume you guys still have
tickets available Rex I saw the final
eight hundred year send that are
available we have eight hun it's eight
or nine hundred general
a mission that's the fifty dollar ticket
and that's the that gets you in I could
chew your shirt and I get you your swag
bag that also gets you into the after
party on Sunday night which is the
that's the actual barbecue that's what
that's what started it all and it's
grown into the rest of this event so so
the the party is sunday night so if I
were to attend this I'd be looking at
friday saturday sunday and then going
home Monday that's that's the best way
to do it yet okay alright and friday is
really there's nothing really organized
it's usually just we have kind of a pool
party we don't have the kind of space we
did last year because the hotel the
hotel last year was amazing and the year
before the same place the staybridge
suites in austin i should give them a
shout out because they treated us so i
mean just exceptionally well this year
were split between three hotels
fortunately they are literally side by
side now checking out the map it looks
like I mean everything's right there
inside the comp exempt do we go like I
said we're trying to make this as
affordable convenient and easy for
everybody i mean we three hotels within
walking distance of the of the
convention center they're all three
sides right next to each other so if
you're at one hotel and maybe your
friends are at another hotel that's not
going to be a problem at all yeah you
just walk over in fact when i went and
visited the hotels all i did was walk
from one to the other that's great and
to go set up our discount code so um and
our hotels are cheaper this year and
flights should be cheaper so you know we
did have to double our price basically
this year we went from $25 the previous
year's to fifty dollars this year and
really that'll work that it sounds like
the fifty bucks isn't bad the way I see
it you're getting your guaranteed all
you can drink and all you can eat on
Sunday night I don't know many places
you can get all you can drink and all
you can eat period for fifty bucks so no
you know you're also getting a developer
conference which if you compared to
other developer conferences I don't know
of any of them that are under two
hundred dollars in the first place so if
you've tried really I mean it wasn't
easy to increase our price we've been
twenty-five dollars since the beta
barbecued
it was it was a really tough decision
but it came down to we just we've got to
cover our cars we figured what we'll do
is we'll figure out what the cost is per
person and that's where about will try
and price the tickets so you're
basically paying for your free food and
drink and that's it the sponsors are
paying for everything else so thank you
thank you sponsors appreciate that and
almost regards to sessions what kind of
information are going to be in these
sessions and in these talks that people
are gonna be giving anybody you're on
google+ can be given some talks oh yeah
lots of people so one of our we one of
our biggest hits is always the cyanogen
saina saina german cyanogen I engine mod
round table I'll get it out eventually
guys it's bear with me the cyanogenmod
round table is kind of a Q&amp;amp;A session
where the guys there's usually like 10
of the guys sitting up on stage or at
the front of the room sitting at a table
and just answering questions um they're
probably going to give a talk at some
point to and more more informative
rather than reactionary just QA but
they'll definitely be there we've
already talked to them and they're
definitely going to be there in force
they're there one of our our
longest-running supporters Adam out
learn &amp;amp; jordan keys i think is his last
name from XDA i believe they did the
unbreakable mod last year I don't
remember for sure but they're speaking
again this year yeah an hour yeah I
actually spoke with in a few times with
Google+ seems like a heck of a nice guy
yeah we've got Marc Murphy I don't know
if you've ever heard of him but he is
very well known as a instructor in
android and and so getting all these
people out there at the end of October
the dates are night the night pink
through the 21st by the way that's
that's exciting we're really excited
about having these guys out to speak you
know we really want to we really want to
provide a good experience for all of our
attendees so we've got several different
tracks you know you asked me what what
what we have for you so so I'm I'm
considering you guys enthusiasts I don't
think you know maybe there's one
developer in the Hangout right now um
the thing most of us are in the knows
enough to be dangerous category yeah I
am definitely not a developer tinker
homegrown mod water yeah about right in
your own rounds but if you need a side
load ahead compiled some sort but that's
that's easy everybody we're all in the
same boat i think so knowing that we're
not going to sit in and listen to the
intense session you know yeah I me not I
don't need to know about you know I mean
I don't I don't deal with it making apps
silly and right so we'll have a session
like that and we'll have a hat we have a
hacker mater track pretty much going
where we'll have like the cyanogenmod
panel and and and like the maybe the
unbreakable mater the XDA guys are gonna
send some people and the roots with you
guys are gonna send some people and
we're gonna have lots of cotton will
have t.i talk and in samsung talking but
they were also going to have the
enthusiast sessions I don't want to get
too much into those but they're gonna be
they're gonna be fun they're gonna be a
lot know what know some of us see it you
know the see the hacking and modding
sessions the only know I love geeking
out though you know what I mean like
there's somebody oh yeah so hands down
our number one session every year is the
CM round table we know that and so what
we've done this year is that's going to
be since we know that's going to be our
biggest one we have we've never had room
for keynotes and stuff like that we're
doing that this year since we've moved
into a conference center so we have this
ballroom where we can have you know
keynotes and really if we have any
really big sessions we can accommodate a
thousand people sitting there so that's
how we're going to do the cyanogen
obsession very nice they're going to be
sitting in front of basically their own
keynote now they may be towards the end
of the event but they'll be yeah
there'll be room for everybody to fit
into the CM session for sure because we
know that's an event that pretty much
everybody wants to go to right you know
the the verizon session and the the
Texas Instruments session and the the
HTC and Samsung sessions were all packed
flashing the Sphero session man it was
completely packed last year and and I
know Spiro will be back those guys we
know them really well we're good friends
with the spear Oh guys the
or board bollocks they did on the ball
that you can control with your your
phone they they'll be out we've been
talking about some really cool ideas
with them too so we really are trying to
provide something for everybody if you
are in in the Android ecosystem
whatsoever there's something for you at
the be good so pretty much if you're
watching or listening to this chances
are if there's gonna be something for
you that Zacks see because you just like
to drink we're gonna eat three barb you
are cute now we will have vegetarian
availability during the lunches on
saturday and sunday but we don't cook
vegetarian BBQ vegetarian I apologized
we'll have potato salad and coleslaw for
there you go something for everybody BBQ
and potato salad ankle and the BBQ party
is always exciting um I don't know if
any of you guys have been to I oh but I
oh and I oh they always throw a party
the IO party is always a blast we
usually have a band there we haven't
ever had a band we usually do a DJ this
year we're talking about something
pretty cool that that will actually
involve everybody who's there so you
will basically well if the weight hurt
you at your table FM DJ the event
similarly no not really okay I'd take a
stab at right that was the idea last
year but we ended up with just getting a
DJ but this year a little bit nobody's
ever done anything like what we're
talking about this year a nexus q DJ
type of event you might be onto
something there I'll tell you what that
will be pretty it'll be pretty damn cool
that's if that turns out what it'll be
yeah we've got to get in touch with some
people at Google to see if we can make
it work and stuff like that so so the
cat may or may not have just got a team
out of the bag there but uh yeah you
might you might be onto something
specific I'd like to be real the way the
Nexus Q is right now it wouldn't work
dude yeah okay I mean the way the social
sharing works anybody could make the
next song and then we've got to worry
about something somebody put somebody
put enough you have some
really offensive or something yeah you
need to have a way to almost like
somebody sitting there approving you're
giving a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down you
know or voting maybe we could
crowdsource it there you go dad knows
you know I mean knows what could happen
yeah well very cool Aaron I'm I'm
excited to go so I've mentioned earlier
i'm feeling how about like ticket
earlier in the week John do you plan on
going to the BBQ have you uh by uh I
picked my ticket up on the twelfth i'm

hang out there and do some other things
too so very good barbecue too yeah how
about w scott what are your plans to the

upcoming Android BBQ feel free to leave
a comment will check the comments yeah
hit me up on google+ yeah aaron casting
or uh you know check out the BBQ website
big Android BB q com definitely
definitely all right Scott so else can
you talk about said we have some
software updates for for some pretty
popular Android phones right we had the
be what sit samsung de la cool stuff
over the past a week yeah samsung galaxy
s2 for AT&amp;amp;T is getting there ICS update
of the skyrocket users they can update
through Samsung's kies pc companion
software on which i ate
but not doing over the air so I don't
think anyone's actually ever said that
they love it in the same sense no yeah
that's someone never see I can't wait to
go home ugh my phone into a USB cable
and update it cuz it's 1999 you know you
know you know for whatever reason you're
doing it that way i don't know if it's
because they don't trust their network
or i think they got the company's up to
pay for some OTA updates and i think
that this is just Samsung's way you know
one don't want to pay for bandwidth
gotcha mm oh and then the AT&amp;amp;T galaxy
note gets updated to ICS so long with
your ICS updates for the notes you'll
also find and samsung's new S Pen
optimized apps enhanced me multimedia
features on s Note S Memo and my story
so now that is the part of the ICS
premium apps you know yep these are the
things that have been delaying ICS you
know for since the note was released
yeah so yeah they better be pretty darn
creepy I'll tell you that right now and
then this sprint epic 4g touch uh it's
there ICS update and this update is over
there so you have no problem installing
for dot 0 dot 4 on your epic 4g touch
that's coming a little sprint doesn't
care about that begins its you know
spring flights there over to the air
updates you know that unlimited data
plan they have faith in their network so
again if the ice rink quietly becoming
the best carrier to be on um once we get
out lazy he out then well i think they
announced either today or yesterday that
there i'll t they're starting in kansas
city oh yeah which are going revision
nine keep that in mind as we're
verizon's revision aid mmm that's a big
difference revision aid doesn't upgrade
easily to the revision nine revision
nine upgrades very easily to revision 10
which i will be in 2014 okay sprinters
don't always
starting in a better position and I
think they're setting themselves up for
the future um but as of right now you
know you have to have money remember
there any hole yeah bummer that you know
in order you gotta talk and talk but you
got to walk the lock and you don't have
many networks sprint Illinois many LTE
network so I'll start I'll start taking
sprint's LTE network a little more
seriously when the 3g network actually
becomes more reliable to begin with a
better than t-mobile and when i drive to
houston on tmobile i can't even make a
phone call half the time that is I
cannot give me those data on sprint
almost the entire way through well I
don't have a great way to elbow around
here so I'll just have to take the guys
words for it yeah technically
technically sprint still kind of Rome's
on verizon to for 3g so that could be
why I don't lose 3g be good for us I
don't care what they're roaming on as
long as I've got verizon and Texas has
amazing coverage that verizon has pretty
amazing coverage everywhere well you
know what exit affluent you have a
vision coverage i live in the mountains
i drive 10 miles in one direction and I
lose signals we have no mouth with Max's
they're just way on the other side of
the state so the AT&amp;amp;T and then sprint
galaxy s3's received a very tiny
over-the-air updates um and they were
saying that these are security updates
gosh Springs was from okay sprint was
saying it was a security update yeah but
it wasn't really a security update more
of a let's stop a legal issue before it
may or may not happen update I was for
their security not yours yeah best thing
what happened is the regular search
feature they basically replaced it with
a number one quoting that basically the
search only shows web results and with
no local results on being displayed
which is kind of a bummer from you can't
search your contact you can't search
your apps your email how is that even
patentable I mean come on I would
recommend thought i would recommend not
updating oh yeah it cuz remember
they're really really is not a security
update and apples not going to come beat
down your door and find you so i would
get it Scott said I wouldn't installed
an update keep the search out his
chances are it'll be updated it wasn't
pulled out for jellybeans jellybeans
skirts around that patent you know so
you know I don't stall that that's
that's our recommendation I would like
to present prior art to searching local
content no avail to get look at the
whole stack out I mean come on that's so
ridiculous oh yeah I I don't understand
this just an apple Sue's errand for
dissent yeah bring it wait though I take
that back I apologize Apple Apple sues
samsung for forcing people to update
their phones via a computer all right
you had to connect your phone to the
computer that is right if you had to use
keys than uh no no yes I write-ins are
they doing all of this at this point to
just bring more attention to the the
insanity that is the patent system
they're like look what let's just go
bananas with it raising so everybody
think we did they know that they're
getting away with it so why not go nuts
until someone says hey don't do that
let's try and patent a triangle oh they
let us oh it's so ridiculous oh yeah all
right so uh AOSP the android open source
project this week was released jar
jellybean was released to the android
open source project version 4.1 point
one and accompanying binaries for a few
Nexus devices the Torah which is young
risers Galaxy Nexus as well as the
Morocco the migoi hpsa plus and the
grouper which is the nexus 7 so the
binaries out there for those so if you
have one of those phones you can pretty
much get a complete AOSP build right
away since
are you starting to appear for many
other devices out there you know people
were hacking Andrea doing what they do
best and we're starting to see all sorts
builds you know for various tablet even
the kindle fires getting they must be
build a few things are still broken on
it the acer iconia a500 is good name is
Fiji on being billed there's roms for
fear and all in place with jelly bean so
just just give developers time and
you'll start seeing some more and more
stable ones in the near future like the
Galaxy Nexus is gsm version and cdma
version are blowing up with multiple
wrong some are more stable than others
summer you know doing a nightly builds
beta build whatever but they're they're
all over the place so it definitely it's
a good time to be on a Nexus device so
if you're in the if you're in doing a
customization and new operating systems
yeah and jelly bean for dot one dot 1 is
rolling out to the hspa+ Galaxy Nexus
and the nexus 7 currently and basically
the changelog to the nexus 7 kind of
boasts a few abilities such as
performance improvement overall system
responsiveness which is very nice and
the OTA update actually at Google Wallet
users are also reporting that the swipe
up to Google now is a lot quicker than
it was I think the X latitude with it to
latitude was broken I noticed and they
previous yeah google now lags a lot less
on my galaxy nexus as well for 11 yeah i
know i didn't think it was slow before
but it is i think it's faster now I I
didn't notice I didn't hate it before
but I it opens up a hair quicker now I
can't wait a lot like dragged up its
customizable you know we can add other
apps too yeah I think I think they'll be
pretty you know what I bet so we might
see that maybe in a in a future palm
build not that I have any inside
information on it adds just a guess yes
I i would really reminds me of it
reminds me of the app wave launcher
widow I mean I haven't used that a long
time but yeah it reminds me of that
almost tell you where you swipe off and
you can drag back and forth and kick a
nap so thats pretty neat if they you
know do allow target
to put on there yeah and all devices
that are going to get this are the Nexus
S and all Galaxy Nexus is slide means
gsm and cdma and the motorola xoom will
soon follow so if you have any of those
devices get excited because you're going
to be getting a little bit more of a
sweet tooth with chili gate that'd be
pretty cool now if you don't have any of
those devices you still want some jelly
bean action where do you go yeah we know
you don't go to your carrier here oh
yeah so you go to the android
development community right and cm10 one
of the most popular if not the most
popular custom rom for android uh gave
us some teasers this week they they said
that well right now we'll see him 10
they're in a very good place with their
coats if they had to redo everything for
ice cream sandwich so see them nine
every did everything they may they you
know redo their code base rebuilt stuff
from scratch and since jelly bean and
ICS are similar in nature it's going to
be not too bad for them to manually go
through and check and we help shit he'll
go in the back okay so what they're
going to do is they're going to go
through and manually merge a bunch of
update or a bunch of customizations
cherry picked some things they want to
add to the cm10 mod dead Becca said
something is really harder than others
like system you eyes like just be a key
restyled the lock screen and jelly bean
is obviously different now so it's going
to be restyled thieves are might be a
little bit messy might be harder to for
changes to custom launcher a trebuchet
might be a little bit harder to update
might be messy to merge some things in
there but generally it's you know it's
going to be easier and it is expected
that if your device currently have cm9
where you're on a cm9 night league right
now
our nature and we saw a nice teaser
actually earlier this morning he saw
cm10 running on the lg optimus 4x HD
just showing hey look look look we're
doing stuff it's out there uh it's not
that bad and this isn't even a Nexus
device it's running so that's good news
for the future and I bet we'll start
seeing some some nightlies in the near
future where I started to see tans you
know basically what people are doing is
they're looking at cm's review they're
going out looking at their garrix and uh
you know and pulling down changes and
manually merging the changes locally so
it's not an official build might have a
few cm changes in it but yeah I would
say he only might get nightlies here so
you know that I can tell you it's
running on the Galaxy Nexus how's it run
on the Galaxy Nexus Iran and now pretty
decent there you go okay any uh any
significant changes updates that you
might wanna be there's there's nothing
special right now they haven't even be
any the only thing that's cyanogenmod in
it that I noticed was there wallpapers
that's all they've added so far so it's
basically AOSP build right now yeah now
uh the jelly bean launcher a trebuchet
launch launcher no it's still jelly it's
the jelly bean water rightly being cured
jelly bean launch or nothing you can't
customize anything doesn't even have the
power widgets and the drop-down i'm sure
those like those changes will be merged
in you know i think right now they're
just focusing on combining the their
their source with with the AOSP source
once that gets combined then they'll
start adding in all the extra features
and stuff get the core done basically
and then build on top of it alright so
let's uh so if you have any questions
about any jelly bean or open-source AOSP
four point one point one stuff feel free
to go ahead leave us a comment will
revisit comments here at the end of the
show let's move on to some device
releases the verizon galaxy s3 is
finally available in
doors you have a color choice of pebble
blue or white ceramic you're not going
to get a garnet red like AT&amp;amp;T has a
special deal i like the read on pretty
nice on 16 and 32 gigabyte models
they're available for 199 or 249 with a
two-year contract and also if you order
it online verizon will only ship the
phone out by July sixteenth um and also
their shipping will right now they're
shipping one version and the version as
a locked bootloader um blasphemy okay
now it does have a locked bootloader but
it can be routed and you can put a
custom kernel on uh some interesting
fellows out there and the interwebs
found out that you could flash a custom
recovery and a custom a custom kernel at
the same time so the you know the system
partition not you know is still locked
or the beach you know it'd still be
better still lock but you can do a few
tidbits of customization but not not
everything as you can complete me unlock
device so what happens to all the same
samsung said hey behavor i got some news
for you they basically released a
different version of the phone its
galaxy s3 developer edition basically it
comes with an unlocked bootloader but
unfortunately it will not be subsidized
by verizon so you have to buy it
contract greed for six hundred dollars
or five hundred ninety nine dollars and
then the availability for this device
hasn't been really announced yet and we
don't know if we're going to be able to
only buy it from samsung developer site
or directly from horizon so so here's
why this is that um mean let's say I'm
an average guy I like to read maybe up
from time to time maybe I don't have six
hundred dollars to buy a phone that can
be routed and have a custom rom put on
it but a developer he laid up maybe
let's say Trey you know he's an Android
geek he wants to put
his own custom rom wanna get rid of
TouchWiz and he wants to run a custom
wrong so he's going to show up six
hundred bucks so for me to run a custom
rom like I really spent 600 bucks is it
worth an extra four hundred dollars for
me to run a custom rom chances are no so
but I don't think too many people are
going to buy this because besides the
price difference to just run a custom
rom it's going to create two different
development communities you're going to
have people making making wrongs and
doing customizations for for the locked
bootloader which will be half-assed
customizations and then you have then
you have full-blown roms to develop
edition so you it's going to split its
going to flip the development key you
know for that phone and it's still don't
know oh yeah it's got to be that severe
because like comes like we were talking
about before the show went off my life
honestly if you want to keep your
unlimited plan you're going to be buying
like full retail anyway and so I think
if you were going to have like a phone
that was not subsidized to the developer
community this was probably the time to
do it i think it was a smart move on
samsung spark in my situation of the new
plans factor out to be much more
expensive than if I were to retain my
planning by the retail personally yeah I
think that you know some people are
going to do that but you know not
everybody has that ability it's
conditional I mean it's not a good
long-term thing it's just kind of like
if you were in a situation of
contemplating buying retail they just
made your decision very easy for you
yeah i agree i still think it's a little
ridiculous that just run across tomorrow
let's spend four hundred dollars yeah
well i don't know i don't know what it's
like with the other carriers but like on
tmobile you if you don't buy a car
you're not on contract your your savings
are pretty significant per month and
verizon doesn't do that they don't
they'll there are different plans for
knock on tree it's one it's one plan
yeah so i wasn't it you might as well
get subsidized phones at that point then
yeah it's kind of like how do you
justify buying a phone that's locked
down to one care
here at the same price that you could
get a gsm phone that's equivalent that
you could take anywhere and you anywhere
in the world yeah exactly travel to
Europe you're covered when I would
community lies don't play whether they
have to do something in the future no I
really think that if it may keep going
down this line and in the future they're
going to have to change something I
think eventually LTE will be on all the
things and especially overseas um I
think the development is there but I
think that it'll be a while before we
get to that for a very very long is
everywhere but then there's multiple
frequencies in rosacea and then you're a
good problem then you have to have a you
know you have to have a cpu a chip
that's afforded like frequencies and
qualcomm building their chips to support
like you are you're right you're right
they are there they are doing that but
they're like quad-band now you have to
have a manufacturer or carrier that's
going to want to do that than some other
device news on the Garnett read the
galaxy s3 so the red version is
available exclusively from AT&amp;amp;T um it
will be available for pre-order start
starting July fifteenth and then you can
push it in stores on july twenty ninth
um the galaxy s three models you know
since all of them except for the verizon
version are locked for unlawfully they
they all received signed mod night
leaves as well so cm9 is available for
every other very in the world except for
verizon so if you have a galaxy s3 and
you're looking to get rid of a little
bit TouchWiz and a little stock he can
do that kind of power samsung they were
like we're not changing our phone this
time we'll just give you special colors
another link announced the white HTC evo
4g LTE 16gb but is available for two
dollars with a two-year contract
the white one looks cool it's like a
white and silver as opposed to the other
color scheme so I'm not sure with my
favorite android phone names is it LG
optimus 4x HD or is it HTC evo 4g ltd
incoming i'm still a fan of the samsung
epic touch 4g from sprint a hypernet
work with android phones we completely
pushed our columns on I mean Nexus you
know can we start calling something
different like I like Google's flood
let's name them after sushi maguro like
razr maxx with 2 x's it's like back when
they had the big extreme marketing kick
and uh you had extreme corn nuts you
could buy and like really well then you
have the razr maxx HD and then watch
Grey's maxx HD two in the least they're
not doing 3d anymore yeah for the Galaxy
Nexus global LTE 4G droid intern yeah
it's got the droid to who or something
hey Zulu so I so let's talk about some
upcoming devices the Galaxy Note 2 is to
be unveiled at Samsung unpacked the
event is on August 30th so not for a
while but according to rumors they'll
have a 5.5 inch screen touchscreen
obviously it'll be point 2 inches bigger
than its predecessor but it will have a
smaller bezel which I'm excited about
the smaller bezel fit through the bezels
please many backers and the device will
also have a rumored to have a quad-core
processor made by samsung and also have
s-pen support 3g and 4g LTE connectivity
and i don't know if it's going to have
jelly bean or not but hopefully it does
that would that would be nice or it
could do you know what the last note did
is shipped with the previous version
I'll be enjoyed and wait nine months to
get the most current version umm so so
moving on let's uh let's talk about
nexus 7 since that is all the rage as of
today because people are starting to
receive shipments unlike me you didn't
get a shipping notification who bought
13 hours before you could technically
buy it by a unpublished link but anyways
besides that yeah so yeah you can you uh
if you borrow on the first day on jun
27th chances are you're starting to get
shipping email on notifications there's
no gettin translations have you checked
your credit card did you get charged um
they pre off my credit card three times
over the past week today they pre off
again so may I just think it I didn't
get the shipping email but don't have a
shit on email either if it makes you
feel better I mean I awarded like 1145
the eastern time like it in the net you
know they then they took that link down
because I saw people founded and we're
starting to starting to order I've
ignored an l5 I ordered mind it like 518
p.m. yeah so hopefully nobody know
tomorrow I get shipping though the
patient I'd like to get it monday you
know you probably never get there
probably not going to central there's a
problem you know when you go kitty won't
go sunday and pick it up in the store
yeah exactly if I don't get one I can go
to a store and get one because people to
pre-order getting screwed basically you
pre-ordered so you know you could get
yours today that they're released nope
just go Sam's Club or bestbuy or
whatever go ahead and pick one up right
now I mean a lot of people are upset
about that um I i suppressed i expressed
an opinion about that as well Oh lamb
blast violating for you guys just got
blasted on google+ about being so whiny
and i was just like no all I'm saying is
why would I got an email saying hey we
know we're delayed you know we'll get it
to you soon as I can't just anything any
form of communication would make me
really happy whoa did you know what this
reminds me of it almost reminds me of
the Seinfeld episode where he goes with
Jerry goes to rent a car
you know he does a car reservations and
he's sitting there at the airport he's
like all we gave away your reservation
has like let's pretty much the most
important thing in the reservation you
know how to take the reservation beyond
how to hold the reservation you know
that reminds me of that you know even
how to take the pre-order but you don't
pull the you know where's our to fill
the pre-order yeah exactly oh so I i I'm
hopeful you know I'm gonna be happy on
me tickled pink when I get it but I
would like some type of notification the
mean you I mean you paid 14 extra bucks
to get a pre-order yeah exactly exactly
so well I'm not gonna watch your store
picked it up so no where's my where's my
info at sams club she had it in her hand
but they wouldn't sell it to her oh
really yeah and then some more nexus 7
related news it kind of came out of the
woodwork somebody was doing some
experimenting with magnets and figured
out that the Nexus 7 has a magnet sensor
and was actually released it at CES I'm
pretty sure that wasn't really that big
a deal but apparently it was a really
big deal why did I mention it Lola so
maybe so what the Iridium 037 TT at CES
was told there had one everybody forgot
about it for eight months exact whatever
was at six months and then a google i/o
they didn't mention it somebody's like
huh oh the MIMO was supposed to do this
let's hold a magnet over this to having
so I already I wonder why they didn't
mention it at Google i/o because that
could presumably be another feature with
a um you know like a smart cover type
thing well I think the case that they're
gonna sell it has a magnet in it well
what okay so it doesn't say specifically
known to be incorrect about things at
the times of my life I don't understand
why the magnet is on the left hand side
when I open stuff I open it from the
right to the left it doesn't really
matter though because when the case
closes or opens your magnet is still
gonna come flush with your screen okay
there you go see I I thought it was
silly they proved me wrong okay that's
but when you think about it I mean it
does it closes flush so it'll shut off
and then when you open it it's gonna
recognize magnets no no yeah yeah I
guess yeah you're right it's just a
versus having to be right on top of it
or not yeah yeah I just I don't think it
really mattered one yep makes sense
makes sense yeah I never think I just I
see something and then I just do off Lou
tangent but how r all right align I
agree it makes more sense to have it on
the right side but in the end it really
doesn't matter yeah yeah yeah it's
getting full away and then well okay
actually think about this this way that
way you don't just bump the cover a
little bit or pull the cover up a little
bit naff the screen Center turning on
and off on and off on and off which
would be battery power you want to know
probably really was Apple patented it
having it on now so I decided by fishing
a feature like that not a side thing
haploid patented magnet or the designer
was a lefty maybe maybe the guy that
designed it was a lefty no a question
was brought up by eric hoffman wondering
if they are going to sell the nexus q in
stores too I have no idea and I don't
see why they would because of the price
uh if it was a hundred dollars I would
say yeah they'd be mad not to put it in
stores but I think at the current price
I think maybe better not put it in
stores obviously better i'm watchin
y'all run are they actually going to be
able to sell the nexus i I don't know
what's happening to happen with the
Nexus Q it's a it's a neat thing but it
isn't neat enough to be worth three
hundred dollars no my fight for 99 bucks
maybe you think it's more along the
lines of being for developers because I
don't know that they know exactly what
they want to do with a home media
solution but after they see the thing
get hacked around and see you know maybe
we want to play games on it maybe we
want to stream music on it the
development will kind of give them an
idea of what the people actually want in
their homes because like the video game
consoles not as popular as a we're a
couple years ago says what do you focus
on what's so special about the nexus
you that a docked tablet could not also
do well if docs tablet is a tablet that
you can't use no I mean you could dr.
like for example the asus Trump okay you
have any amplifier built into your
tablet tray no you don't well I mean why
connected to your network it's a little
bit less of a hassle all I guess it's
basically a middleman in order to get it
to your devices yeah you're bigger
devices meaning your TV and your
speakers the future is not a world of
multiple devices the futures a world of
less devices doing more things now I
think the raht real traitor I would
argue that it's more devices that are in
intermeshed more nicely I would argue
that I'm better than everyone in here
and your argument is invalid yeah I
don't even have to go Trey back why
don't we invite you to these things I
forget because everyone knows that I'm
joking not really oh so now I guess the
question is what the sensor is the the
covers that google is selling are they
going to have it you know wasn't
mentioned I assume it would you know the
cover doesn't detail that in the
description or anything it doesn't call
smart cover or anything like that so I
assume it is going to have that if not a
little of the six of them that asus is
planning on selling are they going to
have the smart cover is a wide outs here
better lose anything so I guess only
time will tell don't I got your nut and
I'm in Devon with the cover today
tomorrow let me know I hit me up ba on
google+ and let me know the smart cover
works they're not even selling the smart
cover yet though I would love to buy one
but all I get a smart cover it would be
a snow mine cover the cake okay the
cover we're calling it something you
might not even be close this case is not
yet available for the next little role
of good names magneto cover there you go
well like that no can't do that DC
Comics do pal poppy Marvel though well
how about I covered I'm not I'm not a
good enough you do
I cover I'm not make it yeah how about I
cover I heard that cover I think hyper
cover extreme ooh poor nigga Leticia hi
ya ever extreme it's lat 4G LTE on the
on the bottom of that cover max with 2
x's with with documentation proving that
enhances your Wi-Fi signal line you know
a magnitude of at least three or four
times I mean there's got to be another
push behind it but because of the
magnets yeah the magnets it's the magnet
about a magnitude that's a bit of an
issue because like I said Apple whole
patented magnets so you have to like
come up with something different there
what happens with apple patents oxygen
are we all still going to be allowed to
breathe we just pay a small fee I mean
I'm thing that covers friend right there
so I wonder if dirty right now yeah I
think it'll be okay because actually we
breathe more nitrogen than we do oxygen
so it's good boy so the license will be
a little bit cheaper that way okay so
yeah be like a subscription service
right oh good point was brought up by
niklas there's no need for smart covers
or cases on a 7-inch tablet it fits in
all jacket pockets the magnet is for a
keyboard dock well I mean I don't walk
around with a jacket 24-7 no no but he
makes a good fight then I keep ladies in
my sock other things other than covers
oh absolutely well I mean if you have a
like a netbook or something you're gonna
have a case for that right you want to
carry it in the case when you go to like
your coffee shop whatever same thing
your tablet in my opinion it basically
by ployed turns on the if I put the
tablet in my coat jacket and have a
little hole for the magnet and then put
like a magnet on like a can of coke or
something you just put the candy coat
right there it's yes you all have done
that because yes I kept okay I'm going
to keep a case around for my zoom but
it's mostly the was that Motorola
business portfolio case that you can
just stack it up and actually prop it up
if you want to watch a video that to me
is convenient to have but
you know you don't want to have to hold
a tablet in your lap the whole time if
you're watching a movie or something
yeah that's the same one I have but you
know I think like a case for a tablet is
first and foremost a screen protector
because I don't want to put that plastic
wrap on the front of my screen I want to
put it in a case you know on a very good
yeah a tablet screen protectors look I
mean they're hideous to put on I won't
put one on my phone I'm just not a
retard I make sure that I don't scratch
my screen you know I don't drop my phone
so all right guys well says there's not
any other questions here would like to
thank errand for coming and talking
