Android authority and today we're taking
a look at the nokia 8c Roco now this is
the flagship of the new series of phones
from Nokia and the company makes that
pretty obvious with its high-end specs
and it's striking form factor the body
reminds us a lot of the Xiaomi me Note 2
with its curved glass which bleeds over
the edges now this happens on both sides
of the phone and it does leave the size
of the device filling a bit sharp the
buttons are also a little bit difficult
to press since there's not that much a
gripping area but I think Nokia was
thinking more about style in this case
well this looks really striking and it
gives the impression that this is a very
premium device we do have some worries
that it wouldn't be very practical in
everyday use everything about this phone
is premium though from it's nearly
completely glass body to its flagship
level specs list I don't think there's a
person on the planet that wouldn't see
this device as a luxury it might not be
the newest Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 but
with a snapdragon 835 six gigabytes of
RAM and 128 gigabytes of storage the
Sirocco really shouldn't have any
problems burning through apps and games
this is all powering a 2k P OLED panel
and it just looks fantastic colours are
striking and vibrant and I would
honestly take this display over my pixel
2xl any day of the week it's a 16 by 9
aspect ratio so it's not as bezel assess
other flagships but it's also a bit
shorter than a lot of the other
flagships on the market right now I like
it though because it makes the phone
feel a little bit more manageable to
hold the glass body also allows for
things like wireless charging and ip67
water resistance and it really feels
like nokia left out very few things in
this phone save the poor headphone jack
that we're all missing dearly this has
somehow become a trend for high-end
devices though so it's not exactly an
unusual move there is a fingerprint
reader inlaid into the back right below
the dual 12 and 13 megapixel telephoto
lens combo which is made by Zeiss optics
now I haven't had the phone long enough
to give you a detailed rundown of the
cameras quality we'll be able to do that
in the full review to come always
welcome a telephoto zoom option
/ a software crop though so this is
great to see there is an option to take
a both E which is kind of like a
simultaneous front and back camera
shutter now I can't see myself using
this that option but it does make sense
if you want to show yourself reacting to
a scene in front of you hardware is
really only part of this story though
and software can often be a huge part of
the experience this phones running
Android 1 and that means that it's
running one of the cleanest versions of
Android out there almost every one of
the apps on this phone is made by Google
and it feels just as if not more clean
than a pixel there's only 18 apps
installed on this phone by default which
leaves a clean slate for however you
really want to personalize your Android
device the Nokia Scirocco might not be
running Qualcomm's latest chipset but it
is a solid option for people who just
want to use a nice piece of art everyday
assuming they are willing to pay that
749 euro price point make sure you stay
