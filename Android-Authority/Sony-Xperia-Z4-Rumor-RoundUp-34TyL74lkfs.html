you by domain.com
so let's round up this rumor roundup and
talk about the sexy the sleek the sony
xperia is at four alright so you should
all know how this works by now
I gave probable thumbs up probable
thumbs down or just a who really knows
to the various rumors that have surfaced
here we go let's start with the overall
design aside from some leaked James
bond-like movie material that allegedly
shows off the Sony experience at four
there have been little concrete details
about what to expect that means you can
expect device that is generally
waterproof has front-facing speakers and
a metallic frame with metal power and
volume buttons judging by the evolution
scene within the Zed 3 we also hope to
see the bezels shrink down once again
and one can dream at least all right I
got a riff-off script here a little bit
because this teased me off what the heck
is this Sony and not just Sony HTC and
Samsung have done very similar things
with cryptic ads what is this is this
supposed to suggest that the phone will
perform well in low-light conditions
what is this is this to suggest that the
phone will render vibrant colors if so
kindly say so get us excited about your
features and benefits of your device
these cryptic ads mean nothing it's a
lot like watching these trailers from
video games right where they show you
nothing but cut seams they show you
nothing but actual gameplay giving no
valuable meaningful information
whatsoever come on save us from the
cryptic ads I feel better let's move on
to the display itself when the first
flagship started surfacing with 1080p
resolution everyone else quickly
followed suit making full HD the
standard when it came to flagship
devices so far it's unclear however if Q
HD will have the same level of impact
while we think it's pretty likely that
Samsung will introduce the q HD to the
galaxy s6 the HTC One m9 is also
rumoured to be keeping a 1080p display
so what about this at four well it
depends on who you ask
some rumors claim the phone will offer
the same 5.2 inch 1080p profile found on
both this is a two and said three then
again there are also reports that Sony
will jump up to the 5.5 inch and we'll
introduce a qHD display it's really too
early to say which rumors right though
perhaps Sony will increase the display
this time around in order to give the
set for a bigger boost and appearance
when compared to the z2 and z3 now again
take this leek with a grain of salt but
look at this photo right here you notice
that the lower bezel on this supposed
Zed 4 is almost non-existent or very
very thin and that's a big bonus for
those of us who prefer one-handed
operation because there's that much less
of a distance for us to reach our
content and apps well I'd say if the
phone stays at a 5.2 inch that's a
probable 1080p display but if it does
jump to a 5.5 inch display they might go
full ode with some qHD probable hopeful
thumbs up I have a big probable thumbs
up for the you know lower thinner bezel
on the bottom that's just pure hope on
my part we have no other evidence to
suggest it let's hope and see now let's
talk about what most of you care about
and that's the specs let's be honest
when you put the z2 and z3 side-by-side
it's sort of hard to tell the difference
thankfully the said 4 should finally
give us a substantial update there are a
number of rumors floating around
regarding the processing package Sony
will utilize with some saying it will
offer a Snapdragon 805 the same chip as
in the Galaxy Note 4 other rumors claim
Sony will offer up the 64-bit Snapdragon
810 the same chip that HTC and Samsung
and LG are expected to introduce in
their next gen flagships every rumor is
consistent in one area however and
that's Ram the experience that 4 is
expected to feature 3 gigabytes of RAM
rumors also suggest that the phone will
come in 32 gigabyte and 64 gigabyte
models even possibly a 128 gigabyte
model turning to battery life rumours
are a bit inconsistent we've heard both
a 3400 milliamp hour battery and a 30 to
20 milliamp hour mentioned as possible
sizes but it's too early to say for sure
now the only comment here is about
storage capacity and what I think would
be
art is if Sony gives us a default 32
gigabyte model an expandable storage up
to 128 gigabytes but that would be great
now let's talk about what I am
personally most excited about and that
is the possible new sensor in the camera
sony has been utilizing the same 20.7
megapixel IMX 220 sensor since the
experience at one so they are certainly
due for an upgrade while the new IMX 230
sensor is expected to show up sometime
in the future it perhaps may not be
ready for mass production in time for
the z4 so what does that mean for the
fate of the experienced camera now I'm
going to give the new sensor a probable
thumbs-up and that's because we've
received some newer news regarding the
possible release date for the Zed for
now you see originally we had expected
that Sony would release the Zed 4 or at
least announce it in or around the
Mobile World Congress but we've received
recent reports just in the past day or
so that Sony has decided to go back to a
year-long product cycle for the whole
Xperia Z line so that means that there
will be more time for these features to
be added to the phone now that's good
news for those of us who want the new
experience at 4 in the long run not so
much in the short term so we should
expect the phone to be release sometime
later this year so I've been thinking to
get in the Hindi man a gift in the form
of a domain name because I can get
really cool stuff that he'd like like
