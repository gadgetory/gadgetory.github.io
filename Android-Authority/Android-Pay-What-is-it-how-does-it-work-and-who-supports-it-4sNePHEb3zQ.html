last September Google released their
second attempt at mobile payments called
Android pay over the past few days I
visited tons of different stores to see
how exactly Android pay works how well
it works and how useful it actually is
hello everybody its crystal Ora and
we've all heard of Google Wallet but how
many of us have actually used it
according to Google not enough so they
can the idea of using Google Wallet as
mobile in-store payments the app is
still around but the point-of-sale
purchases have been removed and the app
is more of a way to send money to family
friends or other companies you could say
similar to PayPal now Google didn't
totally throw away this in-store mobile
payment system instead they rebranded in
May of 2015
calling it Android pay and finally
released it in September of 2015 so how
exactly does Android pay work and how
does it differ from Samsung pay or even
Apple pay if you haven't already checked
out Long's video make sure you check
that out it's a great fun video that
goes in-depth but essentially where
Samsung pay can work anywhere you can
swipe your card even without a store
realizing it Android pay will only work
in select stores that have an NFC card
reader and decide they want to
participate in Android pay very similar
to Apple pay now Android pay is very
easy to set up
lots of Android phones these days come
pre-installed with the Android pay app
but if you don't have it you can
download it from the App Store when
setting up the app all you have to do is
click on the plus sign button and here
you can just add a credit or debit card
store gift card or loyalty program so I
want to add a credit card and you may
see some cars already on here these will
be cars you used to purchase something
in the past on Google Chrome that you
decided to save if you don't see these I
want to add a different card you just
simply take a picture of the card and
instantly your card will be added Google
says not only is Android pay easier and
faster than stuffing your card but it's
also a lot safer when your phone says a
payment via NFC your credit card
information is not being transferred
instead and repave works on a
tokenization system the retailer is only
sent a randomly generated 16 digit
number so in the case that the company's
information is breached or somebody
intercepts the end of C signal no
valuable information will be stolen also
a payment will
be sent through NFC if your phone is
unlocked so even if your phone was
stolen you don't have to worry about
anybody spending your money a lot of
people think you need a fingerprint
scanner for Android pay to work but no
really any phone with NFC will work you
just need to create a passcode or
pattern log so how exactly is that
16-digit number created well unlike
apples payment system where it's
generated within a secured chip on the
phone itself Android pay creates this
number within the cloud but don't worry
even if you don't have internet access
and your pay temporarily creates a
limited number of these codes and stores
them on the phone so you can make
purchases in areas report data reception
so let's take Android pay out into the
real world and see just how safe and
easy it really is I'm curious to see how
well it's going to work and how people
are going to react to it so let me just
add my car to the app and we'll get
going so just line up your card with the
frame it'll take a picture and what
Chase isn't supported ah well I guess
thanks for watching guys I'm sorry this
didn't oh wait Dan what can I borrow
your card
okay so not the best first impression I
mean I understand that every bank is
going to be supported by Android pay but
a big bank like Chase I thought would be
so I don't know anyway I'm going to
Walmart now and I'm using my friends
Wells Fargo card thankfully he has one
so yeah let's see how it goes
the first place I thought of to test
Android pay was of course Walmart is by
far one of the most popular stores here
in the US you really can't go 15 miles
without seeing one here on the East
Coast so I figured why not play it safe
and try Android play at one of the
biggest stores in America I mean they've
got it accepted
you guys done a sub mobile payment
No so as you guys just saw I bought this
at Walmart and I held up my phone to the
car reader and it was not working and I
eventually asked one of the Walmart
employees and they do not have set
mobile payments so yes I have some
swedish fish next up well stop and shop
so far Android pay wasn't doing too much
to impress me frustrated I went to go
buy some veggie chorizo and mochi ice
cream but on the way to the counter I
noticed something stopped and shops card
reader looked just like the one at
Walmart with no NFC and after asking the
cashier there it seemed as though I was
right this whole thing is there enough
so I went to stop and shop and I got my
veggie chorizo and my mochi but once
again no Android pay you know what's
voice I'm like fumbling around for your
card and taking out your wallet and so I
pin the card is pulling out your phone
and holding it there and looking like a
fool when it doesn't work so from now on
I'm going to ask before I actually do
that at this point I make sure I asked
first before sliding my phone around the
card reader like a goofball you guys
have
I cannae no luck at Modell's so I tried
Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond
Darlene do we have no just like Android
pay and no luck there either
oh there doesn't seem to be many stores
out there that accept Android pay so I
decided to go to Android pace official
website and see exactly which stores
accept it finally I was able to get an
idea of how new Android pay really is it
wasn't as widely adopted by stores as I
thought so what it comes down to is if
you're at a store and you want to use
Android pay right now chances are you
can't so it's best to check the website
first to see so there is research
involved but once that's over with
hopefully then we can see how fast and
easy Android pay actually is finally
Android pay started working with staples
so staples worked thankfully it was
really easy I just held my phone up I
already had my phone on lock and it
accepted it right away and of course we
tried McDonald's
so McDonald's is really easy I just lock
my phone and boom it was paid for uh
I'll eat McDonald's so let's go feed
some birds next we drove to the corner
of happy and healthy
Walgreens your typical pharmacy store
but it also sells toys and I found some
things that I just had to have I got
this sticker thing and these socks and
now that I'm getting hang of this it's
like a lot faster than the card way
easier if you plan on using Android pay
at the mall you're going to have tons of
options here here I tried using Android
pay at Panera Bread and it was the
smoothest and fastest transaction yet
I needed some shorts so I stopped at
American Eagle to see if they had any
good deals I found my pair and paid in
seconds
Wow how's fancy she was impressed the
clothing store Express was a breeze to
finally for our last stop we went to one
of the best places on earth Toys R Us
when I saw Toys R Us on the list of
stores that supported Android pay it was
a great excuse to go buy something cute
like my friend Arlo here but
surprisingly this last transaction
didn't go so well
really
boys wrestling no film so as you can see
Toys R Us did not work even though it
does except Android pay usually but the
girl that worked there today said it
wasn't the chips weren't working so even
if you do your research to see the store
steps Android pay the day that you go it
might not work and you still end up
looking foolish so overall there was two
big things I wasn't expecting if Android
pay the first was how many stores still
aren't on board yet and the second thing
is in the stores that do support it
nobody thought it was weird at all
thanks to Android pay sampling pay and
Apple pay the world is starting to get
used to mobile payments it's just
another way to pay besides cash or
credit when it does work is insanely
fast and much preferable than the card
but as of right now I think I'm just
gonna stick to signing my card and
knowing it's going to work 100% rather
than try Android pay where it might not
actually work and will just end up
wasting more time but like I said before
Android pay is awesome and I really do
hope more stores adopt it but I feel
like phone manufacturers are going to
start making their mobile payment
systems more like Samsung pay just to
avoid all the confusion so what do you
guys think let me know in the comments
below do you actually use Android pay or
you more or less successful than I was
and as always thanks for watching make
