Andhra Authority now whether it's
because we've got clumsy fingers or we
weren't paying attention we've probably
all deleted a photo from our phone that
we didn't mean to delete now assuming
you don't have a backup the question is
is it possible to recover that photo
from your phone storage well the
answer's no but actually yes well maybe
let me explain in the way work is this
you take a photo with your camera app it
produces a JPEG file and that needs to
be stored somewhere either on the
internal storage or on the external sd
card depending on your camera app and
depending on how you've got it set up
now when operating system wants to store
a file on to storage it needs to
organize that storage so that it knows
where one file begins where another file
ends what the names of the files are if
there's a hierarchy directory structure
and so on now
that is called a file system that system
of organizing storage is a file system
now on Android you're bound to come
across about four different types of
file systems and four different ways of
organizing files on to the media now of
course Android uses Linux and the most
popular file system for dinner is exe
for the majority of Android phones use
84 for their internal storage but
there's also a file system with use by
Linux called the F to F s f-22s as F F F
s so that's the flash friendly file
system F 2 FS that were developed by
Samsung which is a file system which
takes into account some of the special
characteristics of flash memory now if
you're using a external microSD card
that could either be formatted using
fat32 or using exFAT depending on its
size so we've got exe for F 2 FS fat32
and exFAT now when a file is deleted on
each of these four different pulses and
what actually happened is different
because the way they're organized the
way
is structured is different but in
general broad strokes what happens is
that the space that was being occupied
by the file is just marked now as free
space so the data isn't obliterated is
not actually removed all it happens is
that where the file was before is now
says this is free space this means that
if you want to recover a deleted file
you have to have some tools that
understand the HT for F 2 FS exFAT and
fast 32 and no to search through the
free space to find files that were
previously in existence but have now
been marked as deleted so starting with
the internal storage this will be x HT 4
or F 2 FS there are two basic ways that
you can access these undeleted files and
that is using an app you install on your
phone and if you go over to the article
that accompanies this video then I've
listed some of the apps that might work
to do that or you use something like a
Windows program and you connect your
phone to it via USB now in both cases
you're going to need root access now why
is that well basically the file system
is a very important part of the
operators integrity is essential and
really you don't want just any program
mucking about with the low-level stuff
of a file system because that could
delete resolve in file deletion it can
result in corruption all your data could
be lost it's also a security nightmare
because once an app has access to the
low-level file system it can start
reading data from anywhere it likes so
it can start reading data from your
banking app and read your passwords and
it can do all kinds of things that you
don't want an app to do so whether it's
a malicious app or a badly written app
and app having access to a low-level
file system is definitely a no-no and
that's what we want and that's a good
thing except for in this case when we
want to do file undulation and that's
because we need access to the low-level
file system to find those files are now
residing in free space that used to be
the photos that we wanted that means if
you use these apps or you use these
Windows programs you're going to need
root access so you have to ask yourself
the question how important is this photo
that I've lost is it's so important that
it's worth
risking routing my phone and then trying
to find it or is it just it was a nice
hat but okay
I've lost no that's your decision and
you have to weigh that up carefully but
remember there are no guarantees because
it's searching through free space to try
and find a file that was once your photo
and if even the active routing itself
could actually cause other files who
have written to the file system which
could in fact overwrite that file
because it's now put in a free space and
the operation just right over it so
there is a risk here and you have to
weigh up the balances now if you save
your photos to an SD card then things
are slightly different because exFAT and
fat32 are relatively simple file systems
and you can easily take the microSD card
out of your phone and plug it into a
card reader and then on Windows or on
Mac OS there are lots of programs
available can have links um in the
article that goes with this video that
are able to recover photos from sd card
and they're not only for Android you
also find those programs work for
digital cameras and for other media you
might have stored on an SDK and I have
used some of these programs for an SD
card and I've been able to get over 90%
of the photos that were on an SD card
recovered so there is some success here
but again remember it's just searching
through the free space trying to find
things and it thinks might be a photo of
things might be a file that was
previously deleted of course at this
point is also worth makes it really you
should back up your photos now there are
two ways to backup your photos one is
you should regularly copy over USB cable
the photos from your phone onto your
computer onto a laptop and then from the
Asian make sure they're backed up maybe
on DVD or CD or a flash disk but some
ways you have a secondary copy or
alternatively use a cloud backup service
for example like google photos and the
idea here is every time you take a photo
at the right moment maybe when you're
connecting to Wi-Fi or when you're
charging the program will upload those
photos to the cloud you always have a
copy of them there now of course there
are security implications to this as
well I don't live in the US but probably
my photos are residing somewhere in a
server in the USA so that could be a
concern there's also the problem if the
server's get hacked then all of my
photos become available for everybody to
see so there are some concerns but
personally I use Google photos I've been
using it for years and it's a good way
to make sure you have a backup of all of
your photos of course it also offers
ability to delete photos from your
device's a clean up free space option on
Google photos that deletes the fire
photos that are already in the cloud so
you don't have to you can free up space
when you're dizzy don't worry about
having a backup of them now if you don't
like Google photos there are plenty of
other alternatives a Dropbox has Flickr
there's Microsoft one driver doesn't
loads of them you decide to choose the
service that offers you the best price
offers you the best features and the one
the company that you trust the most
so to recap there are four different
types of file system xt4 for internal
storage f - FS for internal storage x
fat and fat32 for external storage
depending on where your photo is saved
depending on what how easy it is to
recover the files a bit on internal
storage you only need root access if
it's on the microSD card then you can
just take it out and put it into a
program under Windows or Mac OS try to
recover the photos from there but you
should be backing up your photos that's
the key takeaway from all of this well
