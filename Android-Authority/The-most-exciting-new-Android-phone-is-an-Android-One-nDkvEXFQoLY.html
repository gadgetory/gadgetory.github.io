about them for a living but you know
what I like even better
good phones that most people can
actually get their hands on new me a one
the first Android one phone from Xiaomi
is aiming to do exactly that let's just
say the phone is a far cry from the
basic Android one phones of 2014
highlights include a 5.5 inch full HD
display snapdragon 625 processor 4
gigabytes of RAM a 12 megapixel dual
camera with optical zoom a 3080 milliamp
hour battery a dedicated amp USB type-c
and a metallic unibody design as with
all Android one devices you get near
stock Android experience with the
promise of fast updates some of the
biggest are India Indonesia Bangladesh
Vietnam Russia Ukraine Egypt Saudi
Arabia Mexico and Colombia now the only
market that is currently selling this
device is India and it's selling for
around fifteen thousand rupees that
translate to about $235 u.s. let that
sink in
remember those specs that read a moment
ago for two hundred and thirty five
dollars u.s. dang-son at two hundred and
thirty-five bucks us the me a1 offers
exceptional value for the money and I'm
not talking about the frugal type either
it's hard not to ignore the fact that
you could buy for me a once for the
price of a single Galaxy Note 8 now we
wouldn't go so far to call the me a1 the
new Nexus that's because Xiaomi has more
control over the hardware and software
of the device compared to LG and the
Nexus 5 for instance the me a1 features
certain features that Google would
probably never accept in a device it
fully controls including a microSD card
slot an infrared blaster and
capacitative keys instead of a software
navigation bar also Xiaomi ultimately
controls software updates on the me a1
Google promised timely updates for the
device but it's Xiaomi that gets the
final say on when OTAs go out case in
point the me a one will get Oreo by the
end of the year which is not exactly
fast
another reason to be super excited about
this phone even if you're not gonna buy
it is that it gives the Android one
program a shot in the arm
you see Android one was meant to attract
the next billion users right the next
billion users on the internet means that
we have a more democratic society it
means that developers can have more
thriving business model because they
have more people to sell their stuff to
that's all exciting we can connect with
people that haven't really been
connected with the rest of the world
that's a good thing you see Android one
sort of fizzled out a couple years ago
because they didn't have the partners
necessary to make it work
please Xiaomi and Google make this
happen because there are billions of
people out there who can't watch me and
they can't comment and they can't troll
and harass me and you know those are all
really good things so what do you guys
think of this phone you like let me know
in the comments below also if you get
the phone either next week next month
next year whatever let me know right
there on Twitter tell me what you think
about it I am excited about the Android
one program again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
