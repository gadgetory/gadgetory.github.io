at authority and today we're going to be
taking a look at the Galaxy Nexus
extended battery we're going to compare
that to the standard battery what comes
with the phone and we're also going to
take a look at the otterbox defender
case to see how the extended battery
fits in with that so what I have here is
the galaxy nexus with the extended
battery in it and if you're familiar
with the phone you know that there's a
tiny bump right here and that's the
extended battery so I'm getting about 12
to 15 hours of battery life and I'm a
heavy user that'll get me through the
day and then I always have my standard
battery that I can plug in to get some
more life but so I'm actually taking out
the standard battery because I keep it
in there but this is the standard
battery in the the back and on here we
have the extended battery in the
extended battery back so take a look at
the backs there's a slight difference
it's a tiny bump on the back of this one
you could tell by the inside there's a
little difference for no reason but
there's not much of a difference and
then compare the batteries this one's
clearly extended battery but as you can
see it's not much thicker and you're
going to get 250 mah more which puts you
about three more hours so it's pretty
good the extended battery back in and
battery back back in and
I have rocks defender goes in normally
tell us a little bit weird when you're
putting it in now but that's too short
once you pop it in nice and tight off
flip it into here good boy and there you
have it so I turned off my phone well
now we get to see the nice nice load up
screen I hope might have just run out of
battery nope here we go okay normal no
pumps no it fits normally nothing
sticking out so there you have it the
Galaxy Nexus extended battery does in
fact fit with the otterbox defender and
I'm going to put a video on here as a
qualm this post as well that'll show you
that it also fits in the Commuter Series
case so you should be good the extended
battery is good you had to go pick up
like I said you're going to get three
more hours approximately depending on
your use definitely good investment it
says 4999 on the box here but if you go
to Amazon you can get it for thirty-six
dollars and fifty cents i believe so
you're getting a pretty good deal that's
all i have for you leave your comments
in the box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
