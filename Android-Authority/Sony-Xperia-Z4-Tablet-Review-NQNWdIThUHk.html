Android authority and good Android
tablets are hard to find and great
Android tablets well those are even
harder to find and Sony's latest tablet
is bringing water and dust proof
capabilities a super high-resolution
display and PlayStation integration all
wrapped up in a super thin chassis but
does it do enough to stand out amongst
DC of Android tablets or does it simply
just fall in line with the rest well
that's what we're about to find out with
the Sony Xperia z4 tablet when picking
up the z4 tablet for the first time the
first thing that will strike you about
it is how incredibly thin it is it
measures in at a very slim 6.1
millimeters and is pretty lightweight
making it an absolute pleasure to hold
it is entirely made of plastic but it
definitely does not feel cheap and the
back is coated in a textured matte
finish at least on the white version
that gives the tablet plenty of grip the
rectangular shape silver trim and
somewhat angular design is very true to
Sony and depending on who you are you
may love the simplicity of Sony's design
or you may find it to be a little bit
bland the bezels on the front may also
not be the most aesthetically pleasing
thing to look at functionally they make
for great resting points for your thumbs
but it does make the tablet look a lot
like a picture frame when staring at it
head-on
when holding the device and landscape
you'll find both the power and volume
buttons on the left side which makes
complete sense on a tablet that's
primarily designed for landscape use
especially from an ergonomic standpoint
as they're very easy to reach it's
almost shocking more tablet OEMs haven't
thought of moving the power and volume
to the short side for larger size
tablets the remaining ports are in
typical locations with the microUSB on
the right 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
up top followed by a large plastic flap
that covers the microSD and sim slot
that you can take advantage of
on the LTE enabled version on the front
is pretty standard stuff with the usual
sensors a front-facing camera and a
multicolored LED notification light but
most importantly there are dual
front-facing speakers denoted by tiny
slits that are very inconspicuous to
keep the front looking clean one of the
main attractions of the z4 tablet is
definitely the display the screen
measures in at 10.1 inches with a
resolution of 2560 by 1600 making it
extremely sharp and it provides pretty
much everything you would want out of a
large beautiful super high res display
it's bright vivid has great viewing
angles and color saturation and it's
perfect for pretty much anything whether
it's web browsing reading news stories
keeping up with social networks gaming
or even the occasional movie being that
this is a Sony device you can also take
advantage of Sony's x-reality engine for
clearer sharper and more natural images
or switch to a super vivid mode that
really ups the saturation for a more
vibrant image with photos and video you
can also get more granular with the
display and make white balance
adjustments in these settings if you
prefer a much cooler or warmer color
tone but by default the screen is
already quite accurate in white balance
and color temperature performance on the
z4 tablet has also been extremely
impressive thanks to the powerful
Snapdragon 810 processor inside backed
by three gigs of RAM the overall
experience has been super fluid and I've
rarely encountered any instances of lag
or stutters if any to be honest and
switching between applications
multitasking and navigating through the
general interface has been fantastic and
gaming on the z4 tablet isn't a problem
at all obviously a lot of you guys will
wonder if the z4 tablet overheats due to
the Snapdragon 810 processor inside
which has been notorious for running hot
but so far I haven't ran into such an
issue the tablet has never shut down on
me or ceased operation of an application
and even though I primarily use my
tablets for gaming and watching videos
tasks I can typically generate a lot of
heat with the processor a z4 tablet has
done a surprisingly great job at keeping
its cool sony has also made a big
emphasis with audio on the z4 tablet
there's built-in high res audio support
for reduced
distortion and digital noise canceling
technology that is capable of reducing
exterior noise by up to 98% when paired
with a pair of digital noise cancelling
headphones the z4 tablet can also
optimize audio specifically for your
ears no matter what pair of headphones
or earbuds you use and I'm not an
audiophile by any means but audio
definitely does sound great on the z4
tablet and the audio enhancements can
all be done automatically or if you're
willing to go deeper the z4 tablet
offers manual equalizer controls and
surround sound effects for that perfect
listening experience now obviously we
can't talk about hardware without
talking about the front-facing speakers
on the z4 tablet while you aren't able
to take advantage of any of Sony's audio
enhancements through these speakers the
quality of the speaker's themselves is
actually quite good and really tops off
the media experience they're loud crisp
and clear and don't show any signs of
distortion even at max volume there are
easily some of the best speakers you can
find on a tablet right now although that
statement probably doesn't do the z4
tablet justice considering there aren't
many tablets with front-facing speakers
let alone having even two speakers other
Hardware includes typical connectivity
like Bluetooth NFC Wi-Fi and LTE if you
choose to go with the LTE enabled
version there's 32 gigs of on-board
storage that's expandable up to an
additional 128 gigs by a microSD if you
need more of course a sony product
wouldn't be complete without being
waterproof and dust tight with a rating
of IP 65 and 68 the z4 tablet can handle
the occasional splash and submersion for
up to 30 minutes at one and a half
meters but keep in mind this is fresh
water only inside of the z4 tablet is a
large 6,000 milliamp hour battery to
keep things running and battery life on
the z4 has been quite impressive I
primarily only use tablets for playing
games and watching videos so I suppose
you could say I'm a heavy user but even
so the z4 tablet consistently manages to
eke out five and a half to six hours of
screen on time with anywhere between 24
to 30 hours off the charger with lighter
more casual use you can expect a drastic
increase in these numbers and the z4
tablet should be able
easily go for a good several days before
needing to be plugged in cameras
historically have never been great on
tablets and I've always sort of felt
like an afterthought especially when you
compare them to cameras on smartphones
the z4 tablet doesn't necessarily change
that but what you do get is an 8
megapixel camera on the rear and a 5
megapixel camera on the front for
selfies and video chats the camera
software is typical Sony with a very
clean and easy to use interface and
among these standard modes like superior
auto and manual there's a bunch of novel
shooting modes like face and picture
sweet panorama multi camera and AR
effect the usefulness of some of these
features are questionable but some of
them can be a lot of fun should you
decide to use them picture quality
however is exactly what you would expect
from a tablet camera there are
serviceable photos and should do the job
just fine if you're in a pinch but
you'll be setting yourself up for
disappointment if you're expecting the
same level of quality that can be
achieved on a smartphone it takes decent
photos and good lighting but in any
other conditions like low-light there's
a noticeable level of noise and not
having a flash certainly doesn't help
the appropriate amount of color and
detail that makes for a good image just
isn't there and the camera tends to over
sharpen the images to make up for it in
software the z4 tablet is running on 5.0
point to lollipop with Sony's Xperia Y
which is arguably still one of the
better Android skins out there the
Xperia U I changes a few things from
stock Android like the color scheme and
customizable after err but it keeps much
of the material design elements of
lollipop intact and mostly just stays
out of the way
many of Sony's familiar features are
still here like these small apps for
easier multitasking this feature
typically isn't quite as useful on a
phone but it works a lot better on the
z4 tablet and it's much easier to use
due to the larger screen real estate
you've also got the life log application
which has become a standard app across
Sony's most recent devices and it's
great for not only tracking your fitness
data but also your general overall
lifestyle to see how much time you've
dedicated to doing certain things such
as sleeping or listening to music
throughout your daily routine like many
other Sony mobile products z4 tablet
also includes PlayStation integration to
remotely play ps4 games
directly on the tablet allow you to play
virtually anywhere you want in your home
this is definitely a huge selling point
for ps4 owners and it's something that
for the time being is very unique to
Sony and gives the z4 tablet a huge edge
over other tablets in the gaming
department availability and pricing for
the z4 tablet has yet to be announced
for the US but it is available direct
from Amazon for a starting price of
$5.99 for Wi-Fi only $6.99 for the LTE
version and there's also another version
that comes with an included keyboard
dock for 759 these prices put it
squarely an Apple iPad territory and
it's going to be purely up to you decide
if it's worth it but as the old saying
goes you get what you pay for and in
this case that couldn't be more true so
what is it about the z4 tablet that
makes it a great Android tablet well it
simply ticks off all the important boxes
with a large beautiful display thin and
light design fast performance excellent
software great battery life and exceeds
expectations by providing water and dust
proof capabilities high res audio and
Playstation integration there's no such
thing as a perfect product but there's
not much bad you can say about the z4
tablet like I said before it's been a
while since we've seen a great Android
tablet at the market and the z4 tablet
is a tablet that truly goes above and
beyond and it's about time and om
finally got it right
