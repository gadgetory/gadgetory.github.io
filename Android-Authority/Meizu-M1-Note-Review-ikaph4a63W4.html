becomes cheaper to produce the price to
consumers has a trickle-down effect
consumers are demanding more affordable
and unsubsidized phones some
manufacturers are fulfilling this need
like meizu they have produced several
affordable offerings over the past few
years and this is one of Mizzou's latest
offerings
I'm Kevin the tech ninja and this is the
m1 note ok let's address the elephant in
the room this looks like a larger iPhone
5c by its color choices icons and even
software the m1 note sports a unibody
glossy polycarbonate design the front is
very simple we have our earpiece and
also the front-facing camera to the
right of it at the bottom where we
normally find capacitive buttons there's
a black bar there but this black bar has
a few tricks up its sleeve walnuts later
the middle of the bar there's a circle
which acts like your home button and
notification light the main color covers
the back this also wraps around to the
bezels up top we'll find our power
button and the headphone jack on the
right side is just the dual SIM card
slot and at the bottom you'll find your
speaker grille charging port and on the
remaining side which is our left we'll
find the volume rocker going around to
the glossy back it's pretty plain just a
camera and dual tone flash right under
it oh and of course the insignia
designed by Mizzou made in China with
the back having a slight curve it makes
it easy to grip and comfortable to hold
the glossy plastic is not as slippery as
it was same from its appearance the
buttons share the same materials as the
back of the device in some cases this
makes finding the buttons a chore
thankfully with the m1 note the buttons
are raised enough where they're easily
located these buttons provide a tactile
feel to them and the button press covers
a lot of ground then OneNote brings you
a full 1080p 5.5
Corning Gorilla Glass 3 display may you
brought a very bright and vivid display
to the game the text pops off the 401
PPI display at times the colors are a
bit warm with a slight yellowish hue but
something your eyes will get used to
quickly the viewing angles are fantastic
on the screen as well you get a
consistent picture no matter which angle
you're holding it at I didn't see any
backlight bleeding or dead pixels or any
flaws at all this is one of the better
displays I've seen in a while the screen
cranked up gets pretty bright still has
a little bit of glare but the screen is
still viewable even in the harshest
sunlight for me 5.5 inches feels great
in the hand the screen is great for
media consumption gaming and just about
anything else the bezels are a bit
larger than what we've seen as of late
but it's not a huge distraction for me a
lot of manufacturers are providing color
tuning applications that lets you select
color profiles or make micro adjustments
but that's not the case here you are
stuck with the way it looks that's not
really a bad thing inside the m1 note
will find a very moderately spec device
the system chip is a mediatek mt6752
which is an 8 core 1.7 gigahertz 64-bit
processor also for the graphics
processor it's the Mali t67 MP 2 we can
also find 2 gigabytes of RAM and 16
gigabytes of on-board storage as for
battery it's a very large battery
onboard you're looking at 3,140
milliamps for me it works with my AT&amp;amp;T
SIM card I didn't have a great
connection and data connections were
very slow I was able to do hangouts and
a little bit of light web browsing but
your miles may vary speed is the m1
notes calling card navigating through
the OS with the m1 note that's just an
enjoyable experience once the device is
unlocked
you are instantly at the home screen
waiting for your next move launching
applications from the home screen is
just as quick as the latest flagship
phones I've used this year any normal
tasks that you would do on your mobile
device the m1 note can handle this with
little issues when it comes to gaming
the
one note can handle its own in most
games there are situations in some games
where you notice a bit of slowdown in
high action sequences games like dead
trigger GTA and Riptide GP we're in the
same when I compare them to other
devices nearly double the price quite
frankly I was impressed and blown away
especially for the device at this price
range also write a series of benchmarks
as well the scores were lower than last
year's flagships but real-world
performance it felt identical to these
phones battery is middle the role in
terms of life you can get a full day of
battery with this device with decent use
I was unable to fully test it due to the
signal I was getting with my AT&amp;amp;T SIM
card however during my normal benchmarks
I was getting consistent results as to
what others were reporting online the
speakers are located at the bottom of
the device flanking the USB port the
onboard speakers get plenty loud but
lacks Christmas when it comes to
speakerphone or anything that you hold
your phone portrait it sounds great
but when it comes to holding in
landscape that's when things become
muffled what I found myself doing is
creating a reverb with my hand to bounce
the sound back to my face when I was in
a noisy area which helped a bit mizu
taking a page out of apple's book was
not just for design but also when it
came to software the in OneNote as of
this recording is running 4.4.4 kitkat
with the skin on top by the name of
flame flame is an overhaul on android
starting with the lockscreen
you can unlock the device with a simple
tap or swipe up from the home button or
you can swipe up on the actual
lockscreen
swiping to the right takes you to your
camera and swiping to the left takes you
to quick applications once you're on
your home screen you notice there is not
an app drawer all your icons are spread
out on your home screen you're able to
set up folders to help with organization
or you can just toss a third-party
launcher on top of it just to get your
app to rebec
luckily widgets are still available and
behave accordingly
when going into your Settings menu
you'll find that all the settings are
still there but they're in different
locations with different icons being an
enthusiast who can normally breeze
through settings on most devices flame
made me work to get to the settings I
was looking for flame also adds a few
other settings as well but nothing
really that truly affects the experience
when using this phone for a lot of
consumers the camera is one of the most
important selling points maybe you
brought a decent sensor and robust
software to the table then OneNote is
touting a 13 megapixel camera as the
ladies say it's not the size of the
megapixel but is what you do with them
and meizu does a lot with them the
images that come out of this device are
pretty good
not quite the quality of the s5 or g3
but it's still a very passable camera
with the note lacks and image quality
they make up for it in software the m1
note has a manual camera mode built-in
this will enable anyone who understands
the basics of photography to take
fantastic photos you're not going to
replace your DSLR or even your pocket
camera but these tools enable you to
take better images manual mode isn't
perfect we're making adjustments to
shutter speed you don't have a live view
on how it's affecting the image it may
require some trial and error for some
people the auto mode lets you take
superb shots outside or with good
lighting but once you're in lower light
conditions manual controls are pretty
much required the usual suspects for
shooting modes are found within this
camera software as well you'll find your
panorama HDR Beauty mode and even
slow-motion for video the video quality
is nothing amazing it's pretty standard
it autofocus is pretty fast but you do
lose your manual controls the auto
becomes tinny if you're just a few feet
away from the camera as well but it's a
tremendous drop in image quality and
light when using it yet another great
offering for mizu they seem to find a
way to squeeze out these great phones
for a fraction of the price of the
competition the in OneNote was obviously
inspired by the iPhone in several
different ways
but it was executed properly the phone
feels to be built well and should be
fantastic for anyone when you factor in
the price of the phone at 160 dollars
it's tough not to call this
a true winner and there you have it guys
