not enough people even know what virtual
reality is and I quote the people who
have used or even know about VR at this
point is a rounding error it's
approximately zero percent of the world
but according to him what is the key to
mass adoption smartphones google has
been at the forefront of VR ever since
it released google cardboard since the
launch the company has helped prove that
you don't necessarily need an expensive
desktop PC to have amazing virtual
experiences with phones having such
powerful processors and amazing screens
in today's day and age the content can
be available to almost anyone anywhere
the company announced its first rankings
of 360-degree YouTube ads and an event
just as past Wednesday but they made it
clear that they're still just scratching
the surface when it comes to getting
virtual reality technology into the
hands of the masses Google's clay baver
president of virtual reality at Google
stated that yes not enough people know
or use Virtual Reality tech and he's
right if you were watching this show
right now you're one of the few people
who understand the power of virtual
media and that isn't all that surprising
as the platform is still very much in
the early days of development the
consumer editions of the HTC vive and
the oculus rift have really only been
available for a couple months and
they're still so expensive that the
average person can't get their hands on
one pair that with a high end gaming PC
and the total cost can easily reach two
grand which is just out of the reach for
many many geeks but that's why mother
Google is pushing the integration of VR
attack into everyday devices cardboard
is extremely cheap and it's actually
difficult to find a cell phone that
can't run YouTube nowadays the VR ads
that Google promoted at the Cannes
Festival this week should hopefully
spark the interest of people who didn't
know about the technology otherwise and
should be a lot more interesting and
effective from a marketing standpoint
since Google is releasing their daydream
mobile via our platform next fall now
seems like the perfect time to push this
type of commercial especially for brands
like McDonald's Oreo Hyundai and many
more once daydream is in full swing
Google believes the experience will be
much more accessible to people they
haven't reached yet the platform will
allow for users to have access to most
of their mobile device features without
having to remove the headset at all and
paired with an inexpensive cardboard
even those with little initial interest
for the experience can get in on the
action pretty cheap because of the words
of google and i quote we predicted as
much energy and talk and hype as there
is around vr right now it's going to be
a slower ramp up than people appreciate
riding the wave of smartphones is how
we'll get mass adoption today nearly
anything is possible if you can dream it
your team can build it makers of
collaboration software that helps your
team work better together create and
share content organized results with the
flexibility of confluence they even have
instant messaging and video chat with
hipchat you can also manage code in real
time with the power of bitbucket visit
