brought to you by domain.com now there
will be those who accuse Samsung of
simply copying Apple again with the
recent iteration of the flagship of the
galaxy s6 but we hear an Android
authority gonna make the case that maybe
Samsung should have considered owning
the differentiation that is in the
galaxy s6 edge and making that their
flagship let's talk about that so do you
guys remember this yeah Android
smartphones have come a long way baby
but as the budget end of the market
continues to new depths and unbelievable
specs at low low prices the premium end
is having a harder time capturing our
interest and persuading us to part with
our larger sums of cash after a
disappointing year last year Samsung has
taken decisive action to stop the rot
but with the s6 and the s6 edge it has
made changes that will not please
everyone so over the past couple weeks
we've been talking a lot about marketing
and how it relates to the smartphone
market but I wanted to give you guys an
example of how someone from way in the
back end they weren't top of mind they
weren't the first market in the industry
came from behind and performed what is
considered still to date the most
successful marketing campaign ever and
it was titled think small you see in the
late 60s there was a trend among car
manufacturers to make very big vehicles
they were massive in fact when I was a
kid in the 70s we had a name for those
types of cars they were called boats
because they were huge
Volkswagen did a fantastic job at
differentiating what made them different
they weren't just small they were
cheaper they were cuter and they said
something about the owner
they made the owner stand out from the
crowd to this day the Volkswagen Beetle
odd is considered to have revolutionized
the marketing industry because it taught
us that we can stand out from the crowd
and be top of mind without spending
billions of
dollars so how does this apply to
Samsung while Samsung could have owned
the edge instead of making the s6 a
simple option they could have made it
the flagship king and be known as the
company that's done away with the
old-fashioned flat-screen devices now
they're all multi-screen devices it
would have been braver of Samsung to
just simply release the s6 as its sole
flight ship that would have made a real
statement of intent it is always
preferred to offer more choice though it
did promise to tone down the options
this year when Samsung stuck to its guns
under pressure to go metal in the past
at least it was a decision you could
respect but the s4 wasn't exciting and
the s5s dimpled back cover was downright
ugly with a tough year ahead it was
definitely time for a change
you see if Samsung had just released the
galaxy s6 it wouldn't have been enough
people would have shouted copycat again
but the s6 edge combines the move to
premium materials and design with a real
innovation in form factor you can
dismiss the curved edges as gimmicky but
Samsung has some smart ideas for
features when developers get their hands
on the SDK we'll start to see the real
potential so what do you guys think do
you think the s6 edge is the best of the
best as the reviews and comparisons roll
out the s6 edge looks like it has a real
shot at the title the iPhone
traditionally punches above its weight
in terms of specs on paper but we're
already seeing credible reports that the
s6 edge has a better display camera and
far superior multi-core performance
Samsung has also improved the
fingerprint sensor toned-down the
bloatware and provided support for both
major wireless charging standards all
