a little bit of steam LG is also at the
forefront with its own version of the
curve however it doesn't just bend it
also bends the rules a little bit hey
it's Josh regard from Andhra Authority
what's going on everybody and this is
the unboxing of the LG G flex it's a
unique looking box that definitely is a
little bit eye catching and pretty much
alludes to what we hope would be a very
nice stylish and pretty good looking
device all right so let's go ahead and
jump into the LG G flex right here so
there is the LG G flex now this for all
intensive purposes does feel like a very
large phone and since its curve goes
from top to bottom having it in your
hand feels pretty normal it just feels
like a larger phone however the fear
index finger that comes up to the top of
the phone does curve in a little bit
there's no discomfort at all this is
this is by far not a uncomfortable phone
to have in your hand at least by my
first impression and it sits pretty
snugly a sim tool a sim tray tool that
is in the shape of a G so that's nice
and stylish and of course the microUSB
charging cable so put those right over
there and of course and always welcome
addition of earbuds in this case LG's
own brand of quad beat 2 premium
earphones
all right so quite obviously you did not
see that there was a battery inside of
the package and that's because this is a
unibody design that takes on that top to
bottom curve it makes for a pretty thin
device it's definitely not the thinnest
one out there but it is still noticeable
and like I said before it fits pretty
snugly in the hand and this is the the
back panel of the LG G flex that's
supposed to be self-healing that's
something we're going to take a look at
throughout our coverage of the LG G flex
and see how the scratches that could be
given onto the back of this device seem
to disappear after a while and of course
you have the button layout on the back
which makes perfect sense especially
considering that there is a bit of a
curve and your index finger will pretty
naturally just rest right on there to
provide support after that pretty much
you have the same type of experience
that you would have on say the LG g2
only this phone is of course bigger so
another thing that the phone definitely
has is a little bit of weight and the
reason why I mentioned that right now is
because after typing in my Wi-Fi
password I noticed that like I said
before the keyboard being around this
area allows for rocking back and forth
to be at not just a minimum but almost
completely eliminated it's only when you
are down here on the bottom or at the
top that when you press down pretty hard
you start to have a rocking motion if
big screens are going to be the trend
like six inch screen devices then I also
realize that these curves provide a
little bit of an interesting perspective
on the galaxy round by Samsung the
left-to-right curve I realize that even
though that curve was there and the
screen was very large with that curve it
allowed for slightly easier maneuvering
because since the curve goes upward a
little bit it doesn't take as much for
you to thumb to reach over to the other
side of the screen on the G flex on the
other hand you have a top to bottom
curve and it actually has the same
function since the phone is in your hand
and you when you go to reach for the top
let's say for the notification drop down
a little bit of a double actually quite
a bit of adjustment with your hand is
possible but I find it just feels easier
because the tilt of the actual device
due to that curve
allows you to reach the top a little bit
easier so now I'm starting to realize
kind of what the curve actually means
for these particular devices and in the
case of the LG G flex it works just as
well and then of course there is that
feature of the LG G flex that it is able
to become completely flat it's something
that when you test it out for yourself
if you ever do it's something that kind
of scares you because you're not used to
at least in my case putting an elbow
down on your phone like an elbow drop
just to make it flat and to see if it
will bounce right back
luckily though one thing you do notice
when you try to flatten the phone
yourself is that it takes quite a bit of
force so when it bounces right back it
makes pretty much perfect sense that the
shape is still retained and that it's
malleability while it does take a lot of
force is something that really speaks to
this phone's build quality overall
though the phone does fit quite well in
my hand and despite there being a little
bit more weight to it it doesn't really
hinder from the maneuvering at all this
is after all a very large screen so you
just have to kind of assume that you're
going to use two hands on it anyway
never really presume that you're going
to just have one handed usage on here as
easily as anything smaller than it but
that being said the glossy plastic all
around despite being fingerprint prone
does provide this thin profile with its
little curve a very very nice form
factor it's just a very nice looking
phone and with that black slate design
up front that now has a bend to it this
entire phone actually is quite the
looker so if we're going to be seeing
curved displays on much larger much
larger devices if they all look this
good well I think we're in for a pretty
good time so that was your look at the
LG G flex with its curved from top to
bottom it may feel like a pretty unique
phone but as you have it in your hands
for a little bit longer it begins to
sort of make more sense and with its
flexibility literally the LG G flex does
have a nice build quality that makes it
feel very nice premium and sturdy in the
hand it's quite nice stay tuned to
