everybody and this is this yummy me mix
to s s iterations are becoming
increasingly common in the Android space
and this one's kind of no different you
do have a couple of key elements that
are enhanced but for the most part you
get the same phone from before and the
good news is that this phone is actually
one of the more attractive ones that
we've used in terms of design you still
gets at this ceramic backing which
shines beautifully and it's still one of
the better phone materials that we
actually don't see a whole lot in
smartphones and we kind of wish that we
did you can already see the main change
on the back and that is with the dual
and setup this is a 12 megapixel and 12
megapixel camera package that is very
similar to the one that you may have
already seen on the Xiaomi me6
now this is a big deal because now the
size of the pixels is up to 1.4 microns
which should help with low-light and
just on its own it should provide a
little bit more detail we've done a
couple of tests already with the
original me mix and you'll see those in
the full review but we already see a bit
of an increase in detail and quality
that lens comes in at an F 1.8 aperture
and with the secondary lens you get a 2
X optical zoom they do use dual pixel
autofocus which means that the autofocus
should be faster than before now one
thing that do have to mention the
software on this global version of the
phone overall the OS and also the camera
software have not really been finalized
so there are going to be some things
that change between now my full review
and then a follow up review that I'm
going to do when I get my hands on the
completely finalized unit one of those
things that the new software will
finalize is AI assistants in the camera
basically what they're using AI for in
this case is to cut out the subject in
portrait mode a lot easier but also it's
trying to add in the beauty modes in
such a way that is not only reasonable
but effective these are things that we
can't really test out right now fully
and we will make sure to have that ready
for you with our follow-up camera review
what that said me UI is now at version 9
and it has been updated to Android oh
and that should mean a lot of different
features have been added onto here but
it still mainly looks familiar from
previous me UI iterations it is the
operating system that gets updated on
the regular because of feedback in the
forum so they're always going to be
certain features that are added into
here that you may not really expect for
example swipe gestures that are really
similar to the
found on the iPhone 10 but speaking of
that screen experience yes you still get
the traditional meme mix full screen
experience with the really good screen
to body ratio it is a six inch display
at 18 by 9 aspect ratio and it is a full
HD plus panel it's still a lovely
viewing experience and it's good to have
that much screen especially on the top
portions of the phone because of course
the camera has been moved down to the
bottom just like before having some
elements beyond this bottom bar is kind
of the antithesis to the knotch so
that's why I think it's kind of nice to
see this phone come out with this kind
of motif rather than move on to the
notches like everyone else seems to be
doing just like before this screen is
achieved by putting a very small call
speaker at the top and then an
ultrasonic sensor is what it uses for
proximity so that when the phone is next
to your face it knows that and will turn
off the screen but from there we can get
into the internals this is of course
going to be an updated version of the me
mix so it gets the latest Snapdragon
feed 45 and there are still those really
high specifications that you get on here
with models that range from 6 to 8
gigabytes of ram and then in this case I
have the 256 gigabyte of on-board
storage Edition one thing to note for
anyone that might be importing this
phone is that the global bands are only
available on the highest end model this
8 gigabyte RAM and 256 gigabyte storage
model it also supports dual nano Sims
and as far as the battery goes you get a
34 hundred million power battery on here
that supports quick charge 3.0 and
speaking of the battery one final thing
we'll mention is that even though the
ceramic on the back might not seem like
the best place for conducive wireless
charging that is exactly what they were
able to do here it is adherent to the Qi
wireless standard and one cool thing
that Xiaomi is doing is they are going
to be releasing their own wireless
charger that comes in at around 17 US
dollars if you're at all a fan of
shammies accessories lineup because they
tend to make pretty affordable
peripherals then this might be one you
want to look out for and the Qi wireless
charging of course supported by the me
mix 2s and so there you have it that's
Kao Mimi mix 2 I'll be reviewing it
while abroad over the next week or so
and I've been looking forward to using a
kind of in its own natural habitat
because of course Yami is not going to
be releasing this phone in the West any
time soon hopefully the enhancements to
the rear camera are going to be great
even if the front camera is still kind
of in a place that we're not too excited
about but also it's a 5 megapixel
shooter so it's
also not the most high-powered
front-facing camera but that's not
really something that they touched they
mainly worked on the rear camera
so with that keep it tuned to Android
Authority for even more about this yeah
me me mix 2s and you'll be able to see
some content from it while I'm out on my
travels and also I might be able to show
you some of the video samples from here
with the caveat of course that it is not
final software yet well let you know
when it is thank you so much for
watching and keep it tuned to Andrew
authority for more and head on over to
Android or t.com for all the best
because we are your source for all
things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
