Hindy from Android 230 comment today is
Sunday otherwise known as free stuff day
before we get started with this week's
contest let's look back at last week's
contest the winner of the samsung galaxy
s6 edge was chen p from hong kong if
you're watching chen congratulations on
your brand new samsung galaxy s6 edge
this week we're giving away the less
kirby brother of the s6 edge the samsung
galaxy s6 it features the latest
hardware specs including a 64-bit
processor a qhd screen and one of the
best cameras available on a smartphone
right now if you want to learn more
we'll have josh's review linked up in
the contest page and in the video
description below okay let's get you
folks enter to win the first thing
you'll need to do is head on over to the
contest page once there you'll need to
sign into the contest widget using your
email address Facebook or Twitter once
you're all signed in all you have to do
is click on each entry if there are any
instructions or steps to complete the
widget will let you know how to do that
and then automatically enter you in once
you complete them trust me it's easier
if you sign in with both Facebook and

right now to get started and best of
luck to everybody once again I'm Joe
