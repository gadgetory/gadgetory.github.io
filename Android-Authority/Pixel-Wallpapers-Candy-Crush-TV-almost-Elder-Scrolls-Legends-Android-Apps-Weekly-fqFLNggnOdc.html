Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number of 162 so let's get
started Google Play has updated their
metadata rules to help applications be
more user friendly some of the new rules
include a carpet ban on nudity violence
vulgar language and drug use along with
the new rules google has released a new
set of guidelines for applications to
follow some of those include a higher
focus on what makes an application
special less keyword stuffing and a
focus on making the content suitable for
a general audience these rules have
already gone live the Elder Scrolls
legends was briefly available in the
Google Play Store this week it's upload
was a mistake according to the
developers it's actually a tablet test
version of the game for those who don't
know Legends is a card dueling game
similar to her stone or clash Royale the
difference being that this takes place
in the Elder Scrolls universe it's still
available on PC and has been for a while
if you want to check it out google
revealed the winners of their 2016
material design awards this week there
are a few categories including charming
engagement focused efficiency expressive
layouts creative navigation and Brandon
fusion the winners of those categories
were fabulous Airbnb kitchen stories see
channel and asana respectively everyone
will officially receive their awards at
the span la conference later this month
so get this candy crush is going to get
a TV show reports say that the show will
feature teams of two people who will be
running around on a giant interactive
game board in order to play candy crush
it'll be aired on CBS and co-produced by
Lionsgate's it'll also appear during the
daytime around the same time as the
price is right there's no word yet on
when it'll air but it's going to be
interesting that's for sure Google's
pixel launcher was officially launched
in the google play store this week the
good news is that it's there the bad
news is that you won't be able to
download it unless you have a pixel
device this is very similar to how
Google did it with the Google launcher a
couple of years ago thus it'll be a
surprise if this doesn't show up on more
devices eventually for now it's a good
sign that it's in the Play Store and
pixel owners will certainly get updates
faster this way Mars bot is the latest
application out of the developers of
Foursquare this is a simple chat bot
that keeps an eye on where you're going
and tries to
recommend stuff that you might like
unlike Google assistant which resides
inside of a low for most people Mars
BOTS just send you actual text messages
that means you can communicate with it
on whatever SMS application that you
happen to be using it uses quite a bit
of battery if left to its own devices
but it otherwise appears to work pretty
well it's worth a shot if you're into
that sort of thing the bug butcher is
the latest game out of noodle cake
studios this is an action shooter where
your job is to kill lots bugs the bugs
also happen to be gigantic deadly and
numerous on top of that the mechanics
aren't ode to the old arcade shooter
super pang where you can only shoot
upward it's an action-packed experience
with plenty of play and no in-app
purchases it is experiencing some early
bugs which should hopefully be ironed
out over time surfy browser is a fun
little browser with a solid set of
features its biggest features include
security and privacy thus she'll be able
to lock your browser with a passcode to
prevent people from getting into it and
viewing your browsing history you can
also save sessions to lockable tiles so
that you can pick up where you left off
later and it's still totally secure it
works well enough when it comes to
performance and it loaded every site
that we throw at it it is an early
release which means that there are
likely bugs that you will find it is
totally free to try if you want to
plants vs zombies heroes is the latest
game in the world famous franchise this
one takes a more pvp perspective and
you'll be building teams of heroes that
have various powers you'll then be doing
them against other players there is a
campaign mode that you can play through
and there are several monsters that you
can collect it is a little bit of the
same vein as PvP titles such as
hearthstone and clash Royale except
without the heavy focus on card
collecting it's still not bad wallpapers
is the other Google pixel application
that was released to the google play
store this week unlike pixel launcher
this one is available to pretty much
everyone contained within or all of the
Google pixel wallpapers that you can set
as your home screen wallpaper at will it
can also see wallpapers already
downloaded to your device in case you
want to switch back later it features a
few extra functions for anyone who owns
a pixel but otherwise it's a fairly
simple little wallpaper app for even
more Android apps and games news updates
