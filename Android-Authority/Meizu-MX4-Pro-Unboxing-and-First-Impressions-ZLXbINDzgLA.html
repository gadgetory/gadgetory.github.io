pretty solid offerings as of late but do
they have yet to really hit that large
form factor market well they took their
recent flagship the MX 4 and just went
ahead and blew it up and we're gonna
take a look at it right now because it's
Josh lugar from Android authority what's
going on everybody and it's time to
unbox and give my first impressions on
the meizu mx4pro alright so we're gonna
go ahead and get right into it what we
have here is the meizu mx4pro
we did do an unboxing and the review for
the MX for proper is going to be up very
soon but I just received the pro version
which enhances some of the features and
I thought I will go ahead and do that
unboxing for you right off the bat so
here we go we're just gonna go ahead and
jump right in I shouldn't me bring that
over to the side closer to where you
will be able to see it and the unboxing
as I suspected is going to be much like
the MX for proper we do have the plug
adapter that is right here and on the
left side we are also going to have the
book motif that they had where the phone
is inside but it will tell you a lot of
the features that are a part of this
phone underneath earphones unfortunately
again are not included in this version
of the phone I suspect we're going to
have another sample edition this is
obviously going to be a review unit and
of course the microUSB charging cable
I'm gonna go ahead and put those right
here for now and get that out of the way
find me four and there is the phone
itself right there so go ahead and pop
that out and some manuals are underneath
and there we are we have a number of
elements already on the screen that
you're seeing the close-up of right now
not just that home button on the bottom
that has the touch ID as they call it
but also elements that show the
different things you can do swiping up
from the bottom that is of course what
the fly me operating system allows you
to do it's a different take on Android
if we come around to the sides we do
still have this sort of iPhone esque
iPhone 3GS let's say design right here
that's highly curved it has a metal
construction here this is of course a
larger device overall and the volume
rockers are on the left
you can feel right over here and the
power button is up at the top and with
this home button on the bottom yes
people are going to end up saying that
this has even more inspiration from
Apple's own product but nonetheless it
still provides a very nice look amazing
does a pretty good job with that
particular design language and well it
makes for a phone that despite its
larger size and its screen still feels
pretty nice especially with the curves
on the back but here we go just gonna
hit this power button right here on the
top and let's jump right into the
operating system well there's not much
of a setup at all and here we are with
the meizu mx4 seflie me OS it does look
a little bit less let's say refined
mostly because it doesn't have an app
drawer you're going to be putting all of
your applications in folders like this
but ultimately it still looks very clean
and as long as you keep things inside of
the folders well enough you will be able
to keep things looking very tidy coming
down to the notification drop-down the
toggles are right here and the
notifications will come down here open
up the shade a little bit and you'll see
a lot of the other abilities that you
have here but what makes fly me very
different is the fact that it's
navigation properties are a little bit
different of course we do have the
button right here in order to get back
to the home screen obviously if we hit
that but you aren't also able to swipe
down from the box wipe up rather from
the bottom portion of the screen in
order to bring up things like the recent
apps screen or if you happen to be in a
number of different places you also get
this little contextual bar that will
allow you to go backwards and to do a
couple of functions including having a
menu button but of course now as was not
the case with the original and mechs for
you now have a tactile home button right
here to be able to get back to the home
screens quite easily and if I get into
the settings which I'll do actually by
going the settings right over here we do
also have a fingerprint scanner you can
use it as an unlock method so you can
rest the finger on the home screen and I
can go ahead and go through the setup
right now so just keep putting the thumb
right here
and to test out the fingerprint scanner
we're going to unlock the phone right
here put the thumb right onto there and
it comes on very quickly I don't believe
that it is able to wake the phone but of
course you can always press the home
button have your finger on there already
since you're pressing down on that
button and it will get you right into
there so that's actually a pretty nice
way of getting into it just press down
hold your fingerprint onto there and is
really nice it kind of reminds me of the
oppo n3 iteration except instead of it
being on the baguette is of course the
tactile home button up front as we
talked about the device itself I really
do enjoy what I'm seeing right here
meizu from the mx3 that we saw a little
while back in then the MX 4 most
recently that is going to be reviewed by
Brian it does have a very nice look and
feel this curve that despite its design
language seemingly coming from something
a little bit more apple-like in nature
does do a very good job to make mazes
devices look quite nice and this curve
on the back does a really good job of
keeping the handling from getting a
little bit too out of the way because
this is a five point four six inches
screen but if we take a closer look at
this particular display right here we do
have the sizable bezels on the top and
bottom which makes for some easy
placement in the hand right here but
what I really enjoy is the fact that the
side bezels are so thin it's really
something Mazur has done a very good job
with in the past and continues to do so
now with this display it just makes more
a really easy on the eyes display
experience of course we have the
fingerprint scanner down here which is a
nice addition that allows for an easy
way of getting into the operating system
it's a nice idea to have it embedded in
there as a touch type that way you can
just press down wake it up and then as
your finger is already on there it
unlocks it
I'm pretty excited to put the mx4pro
through its paces I will be reviewing
this one in particular as you can see
the MX for review will be available very
soon so make sure you guys stay tuned
