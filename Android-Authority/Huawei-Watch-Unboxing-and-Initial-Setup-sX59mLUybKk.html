SmartWatch has finally made it into our
hands or our wrists or like a structure
of a car from Andhra Authority what's
going on everybody and it's time to
unbox and give my first impressions on
the Huawei watch now if there was any
pretense as to how fancy Huawei wants to
make this watch you only have to see
what box it comes in not only is there
an outer shell that slides up and has a
very nice text on the side that says
Huawei watch but opening up the actual
case is a very luxurious affair opening
up reveals the watch right underneath
the cover and the two nubs on the sides
will be able to lift at that small
leather area in order to get to the rest
of the accessories but the watch itself
already looks quite shiny the sapphire
crystal shines very brightly in the
light and the leather strap on the black
leather here looks really nice but we're
going to put that aside just for a
moment and see what else we have
underneath the surface getting
underneath that leather area in the
middle brings us to a pretty thick but
also multilingual manual that will tell
you everything you need to know about
the watch but if you have used Android
wear watches in the past well this one
shouldn't be too much different aside
from that however we do have a plug
adapter for the USB charging cable which
is actually proprietary you have a small
disk here in which the pins that are on
it will connect directly to the contacts
on the back of the watch now the fact
that this is proprietary is a little bit
of a turn-off I'm not going to lie
because you won't be able to use it with
just any USB cable but also if you need
an extra charger you need to buy a
separate one otherwise you just have to
remember to have this on you at all
times especially if you're traveling as
we expect this watch to pretty much go
for maybe a day and a half and require
charging pretty much every night but we
will go ahead and go straight to the
watch itself sapphire crystal on the
front is the kind of glass that you
would expect on a high-end regular watch
and then the metal housing has the nubs
on the top and bottom which are curved
a little bit to accommodate the leather
straps in this case now the side button
is up on an angle as is the case with a
couple of other watches as well but
powering up the watch and getting it
connected to the phone was a pretty
standard affair open up the Android wear
application and power up the watch and
then after pairing the code it should be
easy for it to connect even though I
have a couple of other Android wear
smartwatches already paired to my phone
the Huawei watch can be easily
selectable and you can use it once it's
ready but what's really great is the
high resolution at least for a
SmartWatch display on here this is an
AMOLED screen which we also think is a
pretty great choice for this watch that
comes in at 400 by 400 resolution and
underneath the surface is a Qualcomm
Snapdragon processor with half a gig of
ram and 4 gigabytes of storage
now donning the actual watch onto the
wrist brings a bit of heft it's not
necessarily heavy and it doesn't weigh
down the wrist but it is certainly felt
and you will know that you have this
smart watch on your wrist now getting
into different elements of the Huawei
watch is Android wear OS brings a pretty
standard affair with a few additions
mainly by way of a ton of different
SmartWatch faces there's so many of them
on here that you can customize it
exactly to the way that you want it to
given the 40 Plus that are installed
already and then of course there are all
of the different applications that are
installed on your phone already that
will then be brought over certain
applications like pomo to do are already
going to be sent to the watch and will
have Android wear specific versions
available and so there you have it for
this unboxing an initial setup of the
Huawei watch
we've already just gotten done with the
Moto 360 second gen unboxing as well so
you're going to be seeing a comparison
between these two smartwatches to see
which of them are better for you it is a
matter of style of course and moto maker
is going to be Moto 360s trump card
while the Huawei watch brings some very
premium materials at different price
tiers in this one is one of the lower
end pricing points the middle ones will
include all of
metal ones and the higher ones will
include the gold and even higher
materials that are available for this
particular watch like I said before I
would probably prefer the black on black
with the metal band but this one looks
very executive and very good as well so
keep it tuned to Andrew authority for
our full review of the Huawei watch and
comparisons between it and other smart
watches in Android today and when you're
done with all of that watch content from
the rest of my colleagues in Android and
head on over to android authority comm
and our Android app that you can see in
the corner there so you can keep up with
everything that we're doing because we
are your source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
