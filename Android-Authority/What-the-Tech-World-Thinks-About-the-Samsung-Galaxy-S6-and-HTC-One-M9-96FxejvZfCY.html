you by Citrix go to assist the number
one global market leader and remote
support boy how things can change you
have HTC One known for its premium
quality and innovative design on the
other hand you have Samsung known for
its repetitive and ho-hum design but boy
did that change on a dime this week
while the HTC One m9 is mostly a refresh
of the m8 design the galaxy s6 sees a
much more noticeable push forward in
aesthetic of course design is only one
part of the picture here there's also
the specs and features both phones are
packing and the list goes on so what
exactly are tech publications and web
users in general saying about the two
phones HTC is falling under some pretty
harsh criticism for sticking to the
overall design of the m8 with its new
one m9 both from everyday folks on the
web and from some tech publications as
well while some of this criticism might
be a bit unfair considering HTC has at
least somewhat polished the design it's
a pretty minor step forward and the kind
we typically expect from one generation
of the galaxy s family to the next not
an HTC one listen to some of the
criticism no optical stabilization 1080
screen pictures look terrible new HTC
flagship just a new processor doesn't
look attractive to me as a 2015 flagship
phone so basically the only thing is a
new camera and the ill performing
Snapdragon 810 but engadget did have
good things to say they love the metal
chassis and the feel in the hand they
said was better than the m8 and this
came from the comment section at android
authority calm I could care less if it
doesn't have a 2k display 1080p and a
Snapdragon 810 will make this phone fly
no I want to hold my final judgment
until I see josh's full review but it
should be said that all manufacturers
try and maximize profit from each
innovation so for example HTC might have
a whole lab full of awesome features and
innovations to add to their phone so why
don't they put it on every phone at each
new release well they're trying to
maximize the profit from each in
vation if they added features every
possible time it would just become very
cost prohibitive manufacturers do this
for cars Apple does this Samsung does
this they have iterative approaches so
you might see the same type of phone for
two or three years and then the fourth
year you see a big jump it's not
uncommon not good for consumers but it
maximizes profit for manufacturers now
moving on to the s6 and the s6 edge and
it turns out that a lot of media
publications had very positive things to
say about the s6 including both the
verge and android authority but some
viewers were not happy and here's why no
removable battery no SD card slot come
on Samsung you've got to be kidding me
and it turns out that a lot of you felt
that way that was the dominant theme in
our comment section but it turns out
that some of you did have some
insightful thoughts on the flip side
it's 2015 cloud storage and streaming or
a way better option than SD cards SD
cards were great when high speed data
wasn't plentiful and cloud storage was
weak swapping batteries is so 1990 we
have way better battery tech now now in
my mind we have to make up our mind we
can't have it both ways we can have both
a unibody metal chassis and a removable
battery I think the reality is and
removable batteries going the way of the
dodo bird so good on you Samsung the
hype seems to be somewhat justified and
the phone looks great but I wanted to
talk about a book this one called the 22
immutable laws of marketing it is a
classic still much referred to today but
you think of Jace what does a marketing
book have to do with a smartphone well
in this case a lot because one of the
basic laws of this book that has been
proven over decades is that when one
brand is competing with another brand
the competing brands shouldn't try and
copy the first brand so is Samsung
trying to create a better iphone because
the reality is the iphone is the leading
smartphone and it looks like that's what
Samsung's trying to do create a better
iphone but that's not how samsung came
to be so dominant in the past five years
remember their ad where they tried to
suggest that the
I phone was your mom's phone hey hey mom
dad oh thanks for holding us mom that's
where they saw some real movement not
trying to copy apple and it looks like
maybe that's what Samsung's trying to do
now as you can see here most of you seem
to love the phone so what do you guys
think I like the fact that they didn't
go phablet sighs 25.2 or 5.3 there's
sort of one-handed devices but is this
your next smartphone let me know in the
comments below now I'm sure you geeks
out there have had that moment where
you're on the phone with a co-worker
