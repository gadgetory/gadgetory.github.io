you by Citrix go to assist the number
one global market leader and remote
support boy how things can change
you have HTC one known for its premium
quality and innovative design on the
other hand you have Samsung known for
its repetitive and ho-hum design but boy
did that change on a dime this week
while the HTC One m9 is mostly a refresh
of the m8 design the galaxy s6 sees a
much more noticeable push forward in
aesthetic of course design is only one
part of the picture here there's also
the specs and features both phones are
packing and the list goes on so what
exactly are tech publications and web
users in general saying about the two
phones HTC is falling under some pretty
harsh criticism for sticking to the
overall design at the m8 with its new
one m9 both from everyday folks on the
web and from some tech publications as
well while some of this criticism might
be a bit unfair considering HTC has at
least somewhat polished the design it's
a pretty minor step forward and the kind
we typically expect from one generation
of the Galaxy S family to the next not
an HTC one listen to some of the
criticism no optical stabilization 1080
screen pictures look terrible new HTC
flagship just a new processor doesn't
look attractive to me as a 2015 flagship
phone so basically the only thing is a
new camera and the ill performing
Snapdragon 810 but Engadget did have
good things to say they loved the metal
chassis and the feel in the hand they
said was better than the m8 and this
came from the comments section at
Android authority comm I could care less
if it doesn't have a 2k display 1080p
and a Snapdragon 810 will make this
phone fly no I want to hold my final
judgement until I see Josh's full review
but it should be said that all
manufacturers try and maximize profit
from each innovation so for example HTC
might have a whole lab full of awesome
features and innovations to add to their
phone so why don't they put it on every
phone at each new release well they're
trying to maximize the profit from each
in
vation if they added features every
possible time it would just become very
cost prohibitive manufacturers do this
for cars Apple does this Samsung does
this they have iterative approaches so
you might see the same type of phone for
two or three years and then the fourth
year you see a big jump it's not
uncommon not good for consumers but it
maximizes profit for manufacturers now
moving on to the s6 and the s6 edge and
it turns out that a lot of media
publications had very positive things to
say about the s6 including both the
verge and and/or authority but some
viewers were not happy and here's why no
removable battery no SD card slot come
on Samsung you've got to be kidding me
and it turns out that a lot of you felt
that way that was the dominant theme in
our comment section but it turns out
that some of you did have some
insightful thoughts on the flipside its
2015 cloud storage and streaming are a
way better option than SD cards SD cards
were great when high-speed data wasn't
plentiful and cloud storage was weak
swapping batteries is so 1990 we have
way better battery technology metal
chassis and a removable battery I think
the reality is and removable batteries
going the way of the dodo bird so good
on you Samsung the hype seems to be
somewhat justified and the phone looks
great but I wanted to talk about a book
this one called the 22 immutable laws of
marketing it is a classic still much
referred to today but you think of Jase
what does a marketing book have to do
with a smartphone well in this case a
lot because one of the basic laws of
this book that has been proven over
decades is that when one brand is
competing with another brand the
competing brand shouldn't try and copy
the first brand so is Samsung trying to
create a better eye phone because the
reality is the iPhone is the leading
smartphone and it looks like that's what
Samsung is trying to do create a better
iPhone but that's not how Samsung came
to be so dominant in the past five years
remember their ad where they tried to
suggest that the
iPhone was your mom's phone oh thanks
for holding us mom that's where they saw
some real movement not trying to copy
Apple and it looks like maybe that's
what Samsung's trying to do now as you
can see here most of you seem to love
the phone so what do you guys think I
like the fact that they didn't go
phablet size to 5.2 or 5.3 there's sort
of one-handed devices but is this your
next smartphone let me know in the
comments below now I'm sure you geeks
out there have had that moment where
you're on the phone with a co-worker
trying to help them with a tech problem
but it never goes pretty this is where
Citrix can ease your frustration with go

little bit tempted to bite the bullet
and buy the galaxy s6 is my new phone
but I also got my hands on an Xperia z3
compact
what a gorgeous phone let me know which
one you would choose I really prefer
