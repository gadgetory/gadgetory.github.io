brought to you by domain.com it's been a
great week in the world of Android news
we got news on marshmallow the LG Nexus
on Android powered blackberry device
with a tactile keyboard you're going to
love that it's been a sweet week and
then this happened to my phone crunch
well as a big fan of the original Nexus
5 I'm hoping this is a good pick me up
now if you watch my Wednesday show you
know we covered this in some detail but
the picture here shows the back of a
white Nexus handset and at the base is a
sticker with a red logo that looks like
LG's logo this coupled with the mat
nonmetallic rear finish suggests that if
accurate the handset pictured is LG's
Nexus and not the metal clad hallway
Nexus at the top of the handset is a
camera lens and just underneath it
appears to be a circular fingerprint
sensor further credence is handed to the
fact that it loosely matches recently
leaked renders of the LG Nexus
suggesting that this is the design we
can expect from the upcoming Nexus
handset the LG Nexus is expected to be
the smaller of the two upcoming Nexus
devices with a 5.2 inch full HD display
amongst the rumored specs other notable
specs include a snapdragon 808 processor
and a 2700 milliamp hour battery there's
also a lot of other rumored specs but
we're expecting that the LG Nexus will
be a direct successor to the Nexus 5
which was pulled from sales earlier this
year now an android-powered blackberry
device with a tactile keyboard that's
something to talk about according to
perennial tipster Evan Blass aka evleaks
BlackBerry's slider will hit the shelves
in November and will be stocked by all
four major US carriers if true which is
likely given Evans pedigree for leaks
it's interesting that all the carriers
are willing to back the handset and it
could be a key step in making sure that
BlackBerry's new device cells in volume
the Venice is expected to have a large
display that slides up to reveal
BlackBerry's iconic tactile keyboard and
based on previous leaks we're expecting
the Venice will have curved edges on the
display similar to the samsung galaxy s6
edge it's believed that Google Play will
play a key part of the handset
which is expected to run on mostly stock
Android OS with Android M AK a
marshmallow set for release in the
coming weeks the Venice may even run
Google's new operating system at launch
and we'd certainly hope so given that
the launch is a couple of months after
Android marshmallow now for those of you
who own an Android wear device you can
expect a big update google has just
announced a big update for the Android
wear platform that will make your
wearable much more functional the
headline feature of this update is
support for interactive watch faces
which will make it easier to change the
watch face design get more information
or even launch a specific application
with just a tap developers will need to
utilize the newly announced interactive
watch face API to bring these new
features to their applications once
support has been added developers can
add additional information to their
watch faces that can be revealed with
just a single tap for example if you
want to see the weather tap on the
weather bubble if you want to see just
the time click on the clock bubble in
the center the last big feature coming
in the update is the expansion of google
translate to all Android wear devices
even if you don't have translate
installed on your phone on jets konnen
zie ganz einfach soooo bizet semana vota
off yo oh and about that google said
this flip your wrist to show the
translation to a friend when they
respond in their own language flip your
wrist back and you'll see in your own
language what they've just said Google
Translate will automatically recognize
which of the two languages is being
spoken so once you tap start the
conversation all you have to do is talk
naturally so my question is at what
point do these translation services
become so smooth so friction free that
it becomes a waste of your time to learn
a new language let me know in the
comments below I've got an idea for a
new Android related domain name help I
broke my phone com hell that's a
business right there that's a great calm
because no domain name extension tells
your story with the same level of trust
as a.com or.net domain name dot com
