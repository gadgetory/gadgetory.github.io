the mobile space let's due to the
incredible girth and the vast feeders
packed into them which probably why they
continue to be in circulation and the
space right now there are arguably two
that will be scrutinized more over than
most the iPhone 6s plus is still helping
to diversify Apple smartphone portfolio
but the note 7 shaping up to be the
phablet to beam as we head into the fall
season while they both have their own
set of specifications and features we've
quickly managed to spend a little bit of
time with the two when it comes to prime
designs these two don't disappoint a
keen eye and has been kept on every
aspect of the constructions the iPhone
6s plus has a unibody aluminum chassis
that manages to keep a cleaner more
uniform look which does nicely to repel
smudges and you get a stronger sense of
sturdiness as well more resilient to
scratches and minor drops what's most
apparent about the two of them though is
how Samsung has managed to slim down the
overall size of the note 7 it's narrower
shorter and even lighter which makes the
iPhone 6s plus a handful to use now even
though the note 7 still uses the glass
and metal construction which does make
it feel a little bit more fragile than
most phones and it is susceptible to
smudges and fingerprints they've added
water resistance and that's the biggest
introduction to the handset and very
people ones could say that so it's much
in the same caliber as the Galaxy s7 and
the s7 edge when it comes to water
resistance specs wise the note 7 has the
advantage because it crams in a larger
sized screen that's also higher
resolution it's a 5.7 inch quad HD Super
AMOLED screen of the note 7 and a 5.5
inch 1080p Retina display with the
iPhone 6s plus technically you do get
more detail and better pixel density
with the note 7 but you won't notice any
difference if you are to look at both
screens from a normal viewing distance
it's obvious that they exhibit the usual
characteristics we're familiar with the
Super AMOLED panel the note 7 offers
exceptional viewing angles and at the
pitch black color tone while the Retina
display mints a strong
illuminance and produces natural color
tones they even have their own
uniqueness as well like the 3d touch
feature of the iPhone 6s plus or the
curved edges of the note 7 now while
it's difficult to say which is the two
superior we can agree that they don't
disappoint either Apple's iPhones have
shown to us all that specs don't
necessarily dictate performance the 6s
plus is dual-core Apple a9 chip and 2 u
bytes of RAM deliver a buttery smooth
performance in fact it really exhibits
any stutter sluggishness the note 7 we
checked out it's powered by Snapdragon
820 one chip coupled with 4 gigabytes of
RAM right now it's buttery smooth but
it'll be intriguing to see if it'll be
like that at the months of use the note
7 also offers flexibility in the form of
its micro SD card slot something that
pairs nicely with its internal tally of
64 gigabytes while the iPhone is
available in either 16 64 or 128
gigabyte options
they both fingerprint sensors too but
Samsung has slapped a ton of other
features that you won't find in Apple's
phablet first of all the new S Pen is
even more precise when it comes to
measuring pressure but Samsung has added
water resistance to its design secondly
the most notable and newest addition to
the note 7 is the iris scanner which
offers yet another layer of security for
the phone and lastly you have the heart
rate sensor and wireless charging with
the note 7 again those are features you
won't find in the iPhone 6s plus Apple
and Samsung have solid reputations when
it comes to their cameras the iPhone 6s
plus is 12 megapixel iSight camera has
proven to be significant contender with
its all-around performance in low-light
situations even it is excelled in
producing sharp looking images meanwhile
the Galaxy Note 7 is fashioned with a
slightly tweaked 12 megapixel camera
which features an even wider
F 1.7 aperture lens and that's still
paired with optical image stabilization
knowing that the s7 line has been great
with its cam performance you could
pretty much expect and guarantee the
note 7 to follow in the same path as
well simplicity and straightforwardness
is something that's evident with iOS and
it's partly why people like it so much
we don't need to be a rocket scientist
to figure it out however the notes
evan is unchallenged when it comes to
meeting the mens of power users touch
which hasn't changed dramatically with
this iteration but it's true
multitasking functionality in all those
useful situations when the S Pen proves
to be invaluable proves exactly why the
note sevens customized Android
experience is unrivaled to Samsung's
credit they've added several new things
to note seven that continues to widen
the gap from its new water-resistant
construction to the addition of the iris
scanner and the new S Pen functions the
note 7 doesn't disappoint what will
matter most though between the two is
pricing even though Samsung has yet to
reveal its full price for the note 7 we
certainly hope it's not going to be
dramatically more than the iPhone 6s
plus at the moment the base unlock model
for the iPhone 6s plus is at $749 so we
really hope that note 7 will be around
the 800 to 850 more if you're more at
900 and above it'll be a tougher sell so
