today I'm reviewing quick note quick
note is an app available on the Android
Market for free or you can upgrade to
the pro version the lady are giving you
more features such as multi page notes
more nose styles and colors integration
with Evernote and automatic backups
when create a note it gives you a few
options such as colors styles fonts and
alignment the apps interface overall is
pretty easy to navigate is all like a
to-do list which makes leaving and
organizing your notes simple early wish
quick note had more styles to choose
from outside the Android guy the options
really are limited to different color
note pages maybe the creators of quick
note could create themes that you could
download separately or add minimum make
more options available moving the note
on your user interface is the same as
moving the widget pretty simple when
adjusting the note the options available
are add a page copy paste font color
configure fill with the existing note
and send all are pretty self-explanatory
here I'm adding a page to a note a note
page is just adding another note on top
of another it's a nice option if you
have limited space on your phone screen
going between the two pages creating a
note on your user interface is just like
adding a widget to your desk to your
space you get many options in size to
choose from small medium large and
extra-large and those range from grid
sizes one by one to four by four the
rest of the options are the same as
creating a note while in the app
with options that change fonts and
alignment
it really makes creating a note on your
desktop really easy to use
backing up quick note is quick and easy
you can either email yourself a backup
of all your notes or backup you know
it's directly on your SD card when
restoring your from your SD card it will
override previous notes created since
the last backup so make sure when
restoring you have all the information
needed off your newly created notes
quick note was overall was quick and
easy to learn I would highly recommend
this app for anyone who needs a little
reminders to keep their life organized</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
