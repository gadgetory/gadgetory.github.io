I've got a video comparison for you
between the HTC One X and the iphone 4s
first thing to say of course is the
screens this is a 1 280 x 720 screen
spread across 4.3 inches the iphone is
3.5 inches 960 x 640 the screen on the
HTC One X is much much better than on
the iphone 4s the retina display looks
great on the open for us but it's not
quite as crisp clear as is on the One X
it's a fantastic phone and the screen
just looks amazing second thing to cover
is sound quality the iphone you've got a
speaker in the base down here on the HTC
One X you have Beats Audio through this
speaker here and a secondary speaker
here it makes for amazing sound quality
the best I've ever heard from a
smartphone the front facing cameras you
have a 1.3 megapixel front-facing camera
on the HTC and only a VGA on the iphone
4s so it loses out there that's how they
feel in hand the One X is a little bit
lighter than the iphone 4 it's not
amazingly so but you know it's a
difference the real difference comes
when you sort of hold them in hand for a
long time for me the antenna on the
iphone 4s rubs against my hand and it
becomes a bit reorientation after a
while the HTC One X is a unibody crafted
so there are no edges it's a single
piece of these metallic plastic on the
rear and it then meets the screen
seamlessly so you don't notice it at all
both are really nice to use I'm going to
favor the HTC One X of course its larger
it feels better at hand it's got more
pirates of quad-core processor in there
1.5 gigahertz using Tegra 3 and this is
the only the a4 chip from Samsung in
most of apples devices the iphone series
anyway um yeah it's one gigabyte of ram
in the one x 512 in the iphone for us
and so yeah i would favor the HTC One X
it feels better in hand yes but for me
it's a better phone
and that's all thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
