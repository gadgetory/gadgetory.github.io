andrew authority and if you're looking
for a set-top box and a gaming console
combined into one then nvidia has your
answer this is the Nvidia shield powered
by Android TV the Nvidia shield might be
the most powerful set-top box today and
that's because it was designed with
gaming in mind so it only makes sense
that it somewhat resembles a gaming
console but unlike the ps4 or Xbox one
it's only a fraction of the size but
it's still bigger than most set-top
boxes the design isn't flashy but it's
functional and it works making it blend
in easily with the rest of your home
entertainment setup and considering its
size you should have no problems finding
a place for it there's a green light bar
to indicate that the console is turned
on and a power button on top denoted by
the Nvidia logo on the back side is
where you'll find all of the i/o there's
two USB 3.0 ports a microUSB port
gigabit ethernet a microSD card slot for
additional storage and HDMI 2.0 that
allows to shield to output content in 4k
so if you have a 4k TV you'll be able to
enjoy content from Netflix and YouTube
and all of its 4k glory also included
with the shield is a single controller
for playing games navigating through the
interface and controlling media the
controller itself feels really nice and
it's coated in a matte finish which
provides for a nice amount of grip
you've got your standard d-pad on the
left side and x/y a and B buttons on the
right side and two thumb sticks with a
rubberized coating that makes them very
comfortable to use on the top side are
the left and right shoulder buttons with
a 3.5 mm headset jack and a microUSB
port in between so you can listen to
audio without disturbing others and
charge the controller when necessary in
the middle of the controller is a back
home play pod and a Nvidia logo to wake
up the console or activate Google Voice
Search and towards the bottom below the
thumbsticks is a large silver button for
controlling volume
additionally nvidia sells two optional
accessories for the shield one being a
metal stand that blends in quite well
with the angular design of the shield
and it's meant to prop up the shield
vertically if you'd prefer
the second accessory is a fairly
standard remote for general UI
navigation MIDI controls and voice
search and just like the controller it
also features a 3.5 mm headset jack for
private listening being that this is an
nvidia product it's only fitting that
the shield is running on invidious
in-house processor so inside you'll find
the Tegra x1 with three gigabytes of RAM
to keep things running smoothly at all
times navigating through the interface
poses no problems whatsoever and even
the most graphically demanding titles
like asphalt 8 Skyforce modern combat 5
and dead trigger 2 run perfectly fine
without any lag stutters or dropped
frames the x1 processor is also capable
of delivering some excellent graphics
and I have to admit it made for a very
enjoyable gaming experience it's not on
the level of the ps4 or xbox one
graphics but it's definitely on par with
last gens gaming consoles if not a
little bit better as far as storage goes
the base model comes with 16 gigabytes
of storage which isn't a lot especially
if you plan on downloading a lot of
games but Nvidia does offer the pro
version which comes with 500 gigabytes
of internal storage or you can always
expand via microSD which is definitely
recommended if you opt for the 16
gigabyte version for the software the
shield is powered by Android TV which
means you get access to many of Google
services like the Play Store YouTube
google play music and many other media
applications like Plex Hulu and of
course Netflix Android TV has a very
easy to use interface with large colored
tiles and being able to conduct voice
searches to find what you need is a very
handy feature but it's certainly far
from perfect the home row of
recommendations seems rather random and
is usually filled with content that
didn't necessarily seem tailored for my
tastes and the selection of applications
is still pretty limited especially when
it comes to games although there are a
ton of games on Android there's only a
handful of major Android gaming titles
that are compatible with Android TV but
thankfully the shield allows our PC
titles to be streamed by and videos grid
service give you a wider selection of
games to pick from now I personally was
unable to test the service because I
don't own a PC but as long
you have a solid internet connection and
a PC with a fairly recent Nvidia
graphics card you should be able to
stream games without much of an issue
since this is an Android TV device you
also have built-in Google cast support
which means you can stream content
directly to the shield from your phone
or tablet overall though the software
experience is quite good whether you're
using the shield as a gaming console or
more as a traditional set-top box and
it's only going to continue to get
better as Android TV improves the Nvidia
shield starts at one 9999 for the 16
gigabyte version and to $99.99 if you
opt for the 500 gigabyte pro version
which will save you the hassle of having
to purchase an additional micro SD card
for extra storage
the optional accessory should you decide
to purchase them will run you an extra
$30 for the metal stand and $50 for the
remote
obviously there are cheaper set-top
boxes on the market like the Amazon fire
TV the Roku and even the Nexus player
that also runs Android TV but the shield
isn't your average set-top box it's
pretty clear that NVIDIA has put gaming
at the forefront with the shield
especially with their integrated grid
service that gives it a huge edge over
the competition at least when it comes
to gaming
so the biggest question is who is the
shield for well that's a pretty tough
question to answer but if you're on the
lookout for a set-top box with a big
emphasis on gaming and you're willing to
deal with the growing pains of Android
TV then the shield is going to be your
best bet however in order to take full
advantage of everything that shield has
to offer like 4k video playback and the
grid streaming service you'll need a 4k
TV and a capable PC I wouldn't run out
and buy one if you don't already own
both of these items but if you happen to
check all those boxes then the shield is
definitely worth considering as always
