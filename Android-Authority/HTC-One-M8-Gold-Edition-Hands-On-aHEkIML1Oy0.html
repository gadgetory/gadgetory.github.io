what's going on everybody and here we're
taking a look at the gold edition of the
HTC One m8 that was just announced and
you probably saw our first look and
hands-on with the the great version that
it has the brush metal on the back but
here we have the gold Edition that isn't
exclusive at Best Buy which means it
will be able to go on all the carriers
except for t-mobile because t-mobile
does not partner with Best Buy but as
you can see here the gold really looks
very nice on the top and the bottom with
the boom sound speakers you still have
the black bezel around the screen but it
doesn't do anything to detract from the
very nice look that it already has
whether you're looking at the silver
gray or the gold one which I have in my
hand here so we're just going to turn
off the screen and head back over to the
back and you'll see just how nice it
shines right through now this isn't
necessarily the hairline brushed metal
that you saw on the gray Edition but it
still looks really nice almost as a bit
of a matted look that's a little bit
more akin to the original HTC One m7
except it is now have a gold finish on
there a gold paper coat of paint on
there so for the most part you have the
same design it's just like this nice
color here that is going to probably
sell really well gold editions of phones
tend to sell really well and it
shouldn't be any different for the HTC
One m8 the screen looks really nice
through here the colors really come out
and just kind of going through some of
the elements here
but yeah just a quick look at another
color of the agency one m8 that is
available here's the Gold Edition once
again and will be sold at Best Buy which
means it will go on pretty much every
carrier that Best Buy partners with and
that does not include t-mobile so once
again this is Jorge Vergara from the
launch events by HTC here in New York
City for the HTC One m8 and we were just
taking a quick look at the Gold Edition
you can see it looks really nice and
there's a great alternative for those of
you who don't want to have the silver or
the grey which it usually comes in
another color of the HTC One m8 will
allow it to sell even more and also if
it is more your style then this is the
one for you so keep it tuned to answer
authority for all the best coverage and
remember that we are your source for all
things Android here at the launch event
in New York City</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
