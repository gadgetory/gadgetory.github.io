we're honor showed off our first little
glimpse at the honor of u-20 with that
punch-out camera but they dropped
another phone on us that we weren't
really expecting at the same time this
is the honor ten lights we figured we
just give you a quick hands-on of what
this phone is all about so if you start
in the back you've got this classic
Aurora design the honor is always using
I think it looks pretty good there's a
few different colors this is the
sky-blue model and it kind of
transitions from this light blue to the
silver and I think it looks pretty nice
it looks very premium right above the
fingerprint sensor you've got two
cameras it's honours classic and dual
camera AI camera set up the main sensor
is 13 megapixels and the second sensor
is 2 megapixels so that's really just
mostly used for portrait mode it's not
gonna really be used to do any other
special high-resolution photography or
anything like that
so if you drive to the front you've got
this little water drop style notch here
but it's housing a 24 megapixel selfie
camera which is like super high
resolution for a selfie camera and honor
really wants this to be made for people
that like to take a lot of selfies so
they've got this ai camera mode that can
kind of sense your environment change
the colors change the skin softening to
match what you want but obviously 24
megapixels this thing is definitely made
for people that take a lot of selfies
the screen is a 1080p LCD and it looks
so K it looks fine I think I mean it's
not gonna be as punchy as something like
an OLED but it's good for what it is and
this is supposed to be a budget phone
after all so most budget phones or LCD
anyway so from the outside this really
does seem like a pretty premium phone
but then you move to the bottom and you
see the microUSB port and that's pretty
much the main thing that shows that yeah
this is definitely a budget phone you've
also got a headphone jack and there's
not a lot of headphone jacks left in a
lot of flagships anymore so that's also
kind of a budget feature but I'm glad to
see it anyway and the specs on this
thing are definitely budget - it's
running a Kirin 710 processor with 3
gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of
storage but there is micro SD card
expansions so you could technically
expand this up to 512 gigabytes of
storage if you wanted to like store your
entire media library on here so it's not
gonna be as fast as something like the
curé 980 or even the curé 970 from last
year but I think it's gonna hold almost
tax pretty well because it is an
octa-core processor
and for software we've got emui 9.0
which is based on android 9.0 and this
version just kind of revamps Mui a
little bit it makes the menus a little
easier to navigate you've got gesture
navigations you don't have an app drawer
stock but you can add it later so
there's a lot of customization here it's
kind of a love it or hate at you I
especially don't have global pricing on
this thing quite yet
if you do translate the Saudi Arabian
pricing to like euros you get around two
hundred and ten euros I think that's a
pretty decent price for what you're
getting if you just want something cheap
that looks good and is gonna take some
nice photos and selfies then this looks
like a pretty good phone but obviously
we're gonna do a forward view on this
later so just wait for that on Android
authority comm and also go to a website
because we do have a full rundown of all
the specs some photos of this thing if
you want to see a little more in detail
so until the next video I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
