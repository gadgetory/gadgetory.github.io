going on everybody and once again we are
here at the Samsung booth here at Aoife
in Berlin and what we wanted to take a
look at what's the Galaxy gear now we
did take some pictures with the Galaxy
gear in just a few and we weren't able
to get a hold of them from the device so
we're gonna show you those in a little
bit but for now what we wanted to show
you was the gear manager and one
particular function that God is curious
and that would be find my device or find
my watch so we have the gear manager
right here and it comes right up and
there's a function right over here that
says finds my watch so since there is a
Bluetooth connection between these two
devices it is able to locate each other
so if you happen to lose your galaxy
gear for whatever reason what would
happen is you can go to your phone and
you can go to buy my watch and it should
be able to find it so when I click on
here it'll say to find your watch tab
start the watch will play the sound in
the screen will be turned on so I'll hit
start and you can hear
it is going off right now so it is a way
for you to find your watch if you happen
to lose it but if you happen to if you
have your watch on but you happen to
lose your phone that said you went
clubbing and you know you're not too
sure where it is the next morning when
in reality it's probably near your bed
instead of freaking out what we can do
oops I can go into the camera what we
can do is find it ourselves I can just
remember where it is
let's be there you go find my device so
I'll just go back over here we'll do
find my device and just like on the
phone on the other they around give
you're pressing start so you wake up in
the morning you're like oh my goodness
where's my phone maybe I left it nope
just hit start it should be nearby and
there it goes
all right so that would be and there you
go you find both of your devices and so
there you go that would be the gear
manager that allows you to find your
watch or find your device if it happens
to be your phone that you're looking for
and that's just a quick overview of one
of the cool features that does come with
the galaxy gear so like always stay
tuned to android authority for all of
the best coverage and we are here at IFA
in Berlin so make sure you stay tuned
we'll bring you all of the great stuff
coming from the show floor right now
we're at the Samsung booth but we're
gonna have a lot more for you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
