authority and we're taking a quick look
at the freshly announced samsung galaxy
note 7 and comparing it to last year's
note 5 despite what the number says this
is actually the sixth generation Galaxy
Note and the direct successor to the
note 5 the note 7 still retains the same
glass and metal design of the note 5 so
they're pretty similar in that regard
but Samsung has made some subtle changes
here to make the note 7 feel a little
bit nicer and generally more comfortable
to hold instead of the flat sides and
chamfered edges that we saw on the note
5 the metal frame of the note 7 has
pretty much been rounded off at every
angle similar to what we saw with the s7
edge the note 7 is also a tad narrower
than the note 5 by 2 millimeters which
may not sound like a lot but it makes a
pretty big difference in how much easier
it is to hold and operate the note 7 in
one hand even though there's some slight
differences in the dimensions the screen
size is still the same the note 7 still
has a 5.7 inch Super AMOLED quad HD
display just like the note 5 and just as
you would expect it looks absolutely
stunning the big difference here is that
the note 7 has a curved edge display
that's similar to the screen on the s7
edge but the curve isn't quite as
drastic and because the side rails are
much thicker you shouldn't have much of
a problem with accidentally touching the
sides of the screen with your palm or
fingers the curved edge glass also
brings the edge UX features to the note
7 so things like the apps edge task edge
people edge etc will all be available at
a simple swipe of a finger and so far it
looks and functions exactly the same as
it did on the s7 edge the note sevens
display also brings over the always-on
display feature that we first saw on the
s7 and s7 edge this can show you some
basic information like the clock and
calendar and it's technically just a
simple software feature so this could
trickle down to the note 5 with a
software update but so far we haven't
seen it happen on the bottom of the
phones you'll find the headphone jack
speaker and s-pen all in the same place
but you'll notice on the note 7 that
Samsung has finally switched over to USB
type-c it still supports fast charging
and wireless charging which will be
perfect for charging up that 3500
milliamp hour battery and it's a slight
bump from the 3000 milliamp hour battery
on the note 5 so on paper at least there
should be some improve
with a battery life on the note seven
last year's no.5 came in multiple
storage options with no room for
expansion but with the note 7 the phone
only comes in a 64 gigabyte version but
microSD card expansion is back with
support for up to 256 gigs of extra
storage the note 7 also adds water and
dust resistance and this includes
protection for both the phone itself and
the S Pen the S Pen has also been
improved it's a little bit shorter has
more pressure sensitivity and the tip is
exactly the same size as when you would
find on a ballpoint pen and all this
together results in a much more accurate
and precise writing experience as you
would expect the note 7 comes with a
fingerprint sensor embedded in the home
button the same way it was on the note 5
but where the note 7 has the leg up is
with the iris scanner which is going to
offer additional biometric security over
the note 5 it uses infrared scan your
eyes so it'll work in a well-lit room or
in the dark and it can't be spoofed with
a photo so unless you're able to steal
someone's eyeballs the iris scanner is a
very secure way of protecting your phone
internally the note 5 is packing the
Exynos 7420 and 4 gigs of ram while the
note 7 shares the same exact setup from
the s7 with the snapdragon 820 and 4
gigs of ram on paper this may not sound
like that big of an upgrade and if
you're hoping for something more like 6
gigs of ram you might be disappointed
but this is still plenty of power for
the note 7 and with Vulcan supporting
games being released with the launch of
the note 7 you're going to get a much
more powerful gaming experience over the
note 5 if you remember last year Samsung
took the 16 megapixel camera of the s6
and brought it over to the note 5 and
they pretty much done the same thing
here with this year's note 7 the note 7
features the same 12 megapixel camera on
the rear and 5 megapixel front facing
shooter and as we already know from the
s7 this reduction in megapixels allows
for better low-light and you're also
getting that extremely fast dual pixel
autofocus technology so I think it's
pretty safe to assume that the picture
quality on the note 7 isn't going to
disappoint despite being the same camera
sensor as the s7 the camera software did
receive a little bit of a facelift
Samsung has made the interface much
cleaner and it still offers all the same
features from the note 5 but it's a lot
easier to navigate now especially with
one hand by just using swipe gestures so
you can swipe to the left to get to the
camera effects to the right to access
all the different camera modes or swipe
down to switch to the front-facing
camera
both the note 5 and note 7 are running
on Android marshmallow and of course
being Samsung phones you have Samsung's
TouchWiz interface on top for the most
part the experience is exactly the same
but Samsung has done a little bit of
housecleaning on the note 7 so you'll
notice things like the notification
shade and Settings menu look a little
bit more streamlined and they're pretty
minor changes but it definitely makes
TouchWiz feel like a much cleaner
experience another area that got cleaned
up is with the note taking applications
back on the note 5 there were several
different apps like action memo
scrapbook and S note but with the note 7
all these apps have been consolidated
into one app called Samsung notes to
simplify the experience and also makes
the UI feel a lot less bloaty
you also notice that the note 7 comes
with some new and improved S Pen
functionality the screen off memo those
first introduced on the note 5 can now
be pinned to the always-on display to
let you see what you wrote without
unlocking the phone and the memo is also
now scrollable allowing to write much
larger memos the note said this S Pen
can also be used to translate text or
images magnify the screen and create
gifs which I could really see people
having a lot of fun with and it's
probably possible for these features to
come to the note 5 in a software update
but as of right now they're specifically
just the note 7 but what do you guys
think of the note 7 and how it compares
to last year's note 5 with an iris
scanner water resistance improved S Pen
functionality a bigger battery and a
slightly revamp design is it worth the
upgrade feel free to let us know down in
the comments below personally I think
this is the most refined galaxy note
Samsung has ever made and if you do
decide to make the leap to 7 I don't
think you'll be disappointed
