authority what's going on everybody and
we have the YouTube team here we have
Kevin on my right leg ninja and lon on
my left who you already saw had CES
etched into the side of his head but
right now we are coming to you live from
day 0 essentially of CES 2015 here at
Pep calm the digital focus words 80s
theme so there's Michael Jackson music
all over the place and I freaking love
it and also it's been a long last couple
of days so we're going to recount for
you the stuff that we've been up to over
the last couple days which is why we're
kicking back just a little bit while
we're getting all of the final work done
for these last couple days so I'm gonna
pass the mic over to either one of you
guys I want to hear from you guys your
experiences so far this is my third CES
and for you guys first right and for you
first so I want to hear from these guys
what their experiences so far we're not
even on the show floor yet this is just
a taste of what we're going to get so
far CES to me is really fun you know
you've seen a lot of these new products
out here not even all Android base but
all just walks of technology i'm gonna
technology fan you know i love android
but i love everything else and a lot of
things out here home automation is a big
deal right now everyone's pushing
towards that honda is here right now
with a with android auto and also blue
link where you can start your car from
an Android wear device and things like
that so it's just an exciting time if
you have opportunity to come out to sea
ES make sure you do it if you're a fan
of technology like i am enjoying myself
okay so for me this is obviously again
my first CS and it's so far it's been a
lot of fun but it's also been a lot of
work as well but I've I've enjoyed every
moment so far because I'm just trying to
soak it all in and I'm actually a little
under the weather right now and this is
not alcohol there's no alcohol in here
so if I know some of you guys are going
to say why is he drinking alcohol if
he's sick but this is just orange juice
so I'm a little under the weather but
I'm toughing it out and I'm just trying
to soak it all in and trying to
experience everything that I possibly
can I've seen a lot of really awesome
stuff a lot of really cool technology
here and I can't wait to see what else
is next I've been a really fun
experience so far and
a lot of work but I'm having a good time
doing it all right so as far as what
we've been able to do so far I wanted to
do a recap yesterday but the embargoes
for all of the items that we looked at
went live today they were lifted today
so you already saw footage of various
products from Lenovo from ZTE and LG oh
yeah from the LG how can I forget the LG
G flex 2 yes and then I did today these
two are actually able to go out and go
to a couple of events as well but even
though today is supposed to be
considered press today we have been
finding it just a little bit tame as far
as Android announcements go but right
now even though we are just in the thick
of it we're not even at CES right now
like I said we saw ZTE alcatel with
their new watch we saw lenovo sony and
we also saw LG with the G flex 2 which
arguably might be one of the best items
of CES so far Brooke what so far has
really been the highlight for you guys
in these first few days leading up to
the show honestly for me is what I saw
earlier from Sony today at their press
conference which was therefore K Android
TV and it's it's pretty sweet it's super
thin thinner than the xperia smartphones
themselves it's that freaking thing so
it's it's pretty cool like I know that's
probably the biggest thing here that has
gotten me excited and it was pretty
awesome to see it was unreal I'm a big
fan right now the asus zenfone I really
during the press conference they said a
lot of things made a lot of promises so
I love to see how they can back that up
and also loving the price point two
hundred dollars for 64-bit phone 4
gigabytes of RAM that really will put
pressure on other OEMs to maybe bring
the price down and you know kind of
trait create some traction going that
way so really excited about a suits and
their their new lineup alright well like
I said we were here at Pep com digital
focus you see all the commotion behind
us along with one of our writers andrew
grush trying to photo bomb as a bunch of
times but nonetheless we are here live
at CES 2015 bringing you all of the live
coverage of not only android but in some
cases we might bring you something a
little bit different lon over here is
really into the 4k display personally
for me I really do love the G flex 2 I
have to
the g flex was a great phone that i was
already a big fan of but it was just too
big for these smaller hands i know a lot
of people who really liked it because it
fit for them it just didn't fit for me
5.5 inches that's it for me but
nonetheless we just wanted to give you a
quick recap and vlog and here at Pep
calm you know there's they really do try
to take care of you a little bit here
obviously we have our little amenities
in our hands right here he's eating ice
cream and then over on the side we got
even got food around and it's just it's
a spectacle and I'm really excited
honestly personally to see these guys on
the actual show floor because this it's
like this turned up to 11 so I'm really
excited for that as I hope you guys are
so stay tuned to android authority for
all of the best coverage of CES 2015 we
are your source for all things android
but remember Kevin blonde Josh our whole
team here we are here to bring you the
best because we are your source for all
things CES 2015</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
