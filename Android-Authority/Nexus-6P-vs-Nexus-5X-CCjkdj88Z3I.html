line with two iterations the Nexus 6p
has p4 premium and then the exit Nexus
5x stands for what the hell does it
stand for again well Google is
apparently expecting the core experience
in the Nexus 5x so we're going to go
ahead and put these two devices
head-to-head it's Josh the regard from
Android authority what's going on
everybody and this is the Nexus 6p
versus the Nexus 5x as is always the
case if you want to be more my new
details including the spec sheets for
both of these devices you can head over
to the card that's appearing right now
to go to Android or 30.com to read up on
even more about these two devices the
story in design should be fairly obvious
as we're dealing with two different
sized devices with the larger one being
the Nexus 6p which does provides a
little bit harder handling for one hand
because of its 5.7 inch screen but
thanks to flat sides it is pretty easy
to grip nonetheless the Nexus 5x on the
other hand has a plastic design that
feels a little bit Hollow and is very
reminiscent at the very least to the
original Nexus 5 that everyone seemed to
love so much
including us here at Android authority
really the story here is whether or not
you want the premium materials the metal
body along with that large black slab on
the top of the back provide all of the
premium materials and design aspects
that you would want from a high-end
device and it feels really awesome in
the hand compared to the much lighter
and actually somewhat hollow feeling
plastic design of the 5x that's not to
say that the 5x is really all that bad
in its design however it just feels a
little bit more let's say generic we
don't think it's very much cheap at all
because it brings the same typical
design that the Nexus 5 had and that was
one of our favorite design phones of the
Nexus line in general we start to see
more differences in the displays as the
spec sheets start to rear their ugly
heads here and show that one device is
certainly much more premium than the
other the Nexus 6p has a quad HD AMOLED
display that as you can see in this shot
right here is already providing some
more saturated colors then the more
washed out LCD that comes in at full HD
resolution of the Nexus 5x now that's
not to say that the display on the 5x is
bad it's just that you really
you see the differences when you pit
these two displays against one another
the Nexus 5x does have that little bit
of washed out color on there across the
entire board but to the AMOLED display
with its deeper blacks is sort of
getting the advantage here higher
resolution is also nice on the 6p but
it's not necessarily essential when it
comes to the 5x because the 1080p
display still provides a pretty good
amount of sharpness and a lot of fun for
all media and play the Nexus 6p simply
is just the overachiever in this regard
and with the larger display if you want
more real estate you could definitely
get it in a more premium device in
performance the price you end up paying
for either of these devices actually
kind of reflects what you're getting
underneath the surface the Nexus 6p
provides the Snapdragon 810 along with
three gigabytes of RAM which with the
more demanding power users of Android
this is the package that you're probably
going to be going for but the Nexus 5x
provides the essential Snapdragon 808
which is a pretty good performer in its
own right so the more important piece of
information is the two gigabytes of RAM
that it comes with as well now it is
possible to sort of overload the Nexus
5x a little bit more but we do still
think that performance is kind of
neck-and-neck here we do think that the
Nexus 5x especially in loading up games
and certain applications is a step or
two behind as you can see here but
really it's not so much back that we
would pretty much take out the Nexus 5x
as a contender not at all really we
think that the Nexus 5x provides just
the right amount of performance for the
common daily user while the 6p simply
just performs a little bit more above
and beyond in hardware it's just as much
about what these phones have in common
as it is about what they don't
after all you get the same Nexus imprint
powered fingerprint reader on both of
these phones and they both work really
well
setting up the fingerprint is really
easy and then the motion is just as easy
as when you're taking the phone out of a
pocket or off the table you're just
landing your index finger on to the
sensor and the phone is awoken and
unlocked in a very quick way sound is a
bit different however as the Nexus 6p
does have dual front-facing speakers
here on the front while the Nexus 5x has
literally half of that and that's true
also for the quality it's just this one
speaker down here on the bottom and
while it is able to provide a little bit
of body it just isn't as loud and does
provide the same stereo quality that the
Nexus 6p does in battery we're obviously
working with two different sized
batteries here as 3450 million powers is
in the nexus 6p and 2,700 million powers
is in the five x now the 6p does get at
least two days worth of battery life
especially if you take advantage of doze
where you just leave the phone with none
of the sensors being triggered and it
puts all apps into a certain sleep mode
and you only get notifications if they
were prioritized
you get the same in the 5x also and you
will be able to eke out a little bit
more battery from it but for the most
part in the 5x you can pretty much
expect to have to charge it every single
night now what's really great is that
with the USB type-c cords that come with
these they do take advantage of a higher
power current from the plug adapters
that are included what sucks about that
is that you're not going to be using
Qualcomm quick charge anymore so if you
bought into that particular standard
unfortunately you won't be able to use
it with these new Nexus devices that
said however either of these devices
will charge up to 0 to 100 in under 90
minutes which is really great it only
takes about 10 to 30 minutes to get even
just enough power to get past the next
part of your day really so you should be
able to plug this in in the middle of
the day and when you do so you'll never
want for power with either of these
phones and in camera we have the same
package for both of these which once
again is a great thing about these two
new Nexus devices is that they both
provide very good experiences and it
provide a lot of the same features now
in the cameras we have a twelve point
three megapixel camera that is backed by
laser autofocus and a dual LED flash for
both of the phones and when you get into
the applications they also provide the
same experience a little bit bare-bones
let's put it so you get a good auto mode
that allows you HD are plus on auto if
you so wish to put so and from there you
also get UHD 4k video recording but what
we had a lot of fun with here was the
slow-motion recording that does 120
frames or 240 frames per second that is
recorded at 720p resolution but aside
from all of these extra modes including
lens blur panorama and photosphere you
don't get a whole lot of manual control
over your shots and videos that said
however the quality of these cameras is
honestly much better than any other
Nexus device and it actually is kind of
up there has a good
a companion to have onto the daily they
may not be the absolute best cameras
that are out there but they certainly
made us pretty happy in our usage of
them thus far the details are all
captured quite well and the colors have
that little bit of saturation that
should be able to please anyone looking
for punchy or photos low-light
capabilities are also quite good on here
but you're not really expecting too much
from super low-light situations but we
will say that these cameras happen to do
a little bit better than some of the
other flagship phones that only provide
you a big ball of fuzz when you try to
get a low-light shot honestly the
biggest story here is that finally
Google got the cameras on the Nexus line
right and in these two phones if you
really want the pure Android experience
you're also going to get a pretty good
camera and you're not really going to
have to want for any other phones if
this is the one that you want and
finally in software as these are Nexus
devices you're going to get the updates
and the software at the latest and
greatest on that is Android marshmallow
version 6.0 now there are a few key
additions to what is already a pretty
familiar Android experience here in
stock Android of course the app drawer
has been updated to a vertical squirrel
but also has a line at the top for your
most use applications doze is what we
already took a bit of a look at in the
battery section and as long as you keep
the phone from really moving you just
let it sit still for a little while you
should be able to get a great standby
mode and standby time that keeps the
battery from draining too quickly after
that you also have app permissions which
are all available in the settings but
when you install new applications and
they access a key part of the phone for
the first time then the app permissions
will ask you if you really wanted to
access that part of your phone and
finally there's Google now on tap now
this is not a replacement for Google now
as Google now still part of the home
screens but it is an ability for you to
be able to search anything on the screen
currently in a very quick way as long as
the text is plainly there in its
entirety and it's not part of an image
then when you hit Google now on tap by
holding the home button it should be
able to pull a number of the items that
are on the screen currently and it does
work pretty well when it does come in
handy it's kind of a sublime experience
when you are looking at let's say a text
message and you want to be able to
search something on there like an
address it does pull it down and when it
does it feels really awesome to do so in
the end however the reason why you're
even getting these two devices is
because of those updates and with
marshmallow we have a great start to
what might be a nice update cycle for
these two Nexus devices for 2015 so
we've explored these two devices and as
we have been finding out in each section
the premium moniker is definitely true
for the Nexus 6p while the essential 5x
is providing still a good experience
without really going too far and beyond
and it reflects this in the price four
hundred and ninety nine dollars is what
you're going to be paying for the Nexus
6p while the Nexus 5x will start at
three hundred and seventy nine dollars
but as is our recommendation for the 5x
you might want to shell out just a
little bit more money to make sure you
get the 32 gigabyte version if this is
the phone that you want and so there you
have it for the Nexus 6p and the Nexus
5x we're looking at two different ways
of looking at the Nexus line this year
which is awesome because normally we
only get one but this year we have a
little bit of choice with the Nexus 6p
you get the absolute best at Google and
in this case Huawei are providing for
the Android ecosystem in a great body
that has a lot of power underneath and
honestly it is one of those phones that
when you pick it up it invokes a bit of
emotion the Nexus 5x doesn't necessarily
have that same level of emotion unless
you are a fan of the original Nexus 5
and if you are this phone just might be
the one that you want to get because it
brings back all those lovely memories of
the Nexus 5 no the body is not premium
it actually has a bit of a hollow fuel
because of the plastic but it still
provides many of the same features
especially the camera and the Android
marshmallow underneath that's just maybe
one or two small steps behind because of
the slower performance package on here
but still the 5x is essential whereas
the P into the Nexus 6p might provide
premium and those are really the
differences between these two devices
and you couldn't go wrong with either of
this year's great Google Nexus
iterations keep it tuned to Android
authority our full reviews for both of
these devices are coming very soon but
stay tuned for Lon's the Nexus 5x review
and then of course the 6p is being
reviewed by me then you can stick around
and you can watch the content from all
my other colleagues in Android and then
you can stick around for even more and
head on over to Android or decom because
