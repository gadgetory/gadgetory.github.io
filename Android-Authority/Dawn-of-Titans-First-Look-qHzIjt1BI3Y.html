Android authority and we are here at e3
2015 and we are hanging out with Zynga
taking a look at a couple of their games
and I'm here with Torsten from Zynga and
he's gonna show us dawn of titans ok so
you want to go ahead and just tell us a
little bit about what this game is about
yeah I'll give you a quick overview so
don't have time this is a mid core game
it's a next-generation mid core game for
for iOS and Android and what we're
trying to do with this game is create
battles of an epic scale with literally
thousands of Units soldiers in battle in
real time all controllable on your
mobile device so let me show you what
that looks like we're quite excited
about this game what I'm showing you
here it's just a preview demo but this
is actually all running in real time on
the device and this is where you live I
hope you can see this on camera so this
is your this is your city and you can
see this is all realized in 3d based on
our own engine which is called the echo
engine which is a high-performance
essentially console great mobile engine
so you can see we have advanced lighting
effect we've got real-time trees here
all in all in 3d several thousands of
them here we've got already a city build
up as you can tell and hopefully you can
see it it's beautiful we have lens
effects we've got no kind of even
it's like irregularities on the lens
here so this is where you live and this
is the world but this game is all about
battles this is about battling other
armies and and you know other players in
the world so I want to show you what
that looks like as well and this year's
is our enemy and you can see that
they've arrived in force
that's a CEO on the right I think it's
fair to say that we are we're slightly
outnumbered but what I'm gonna do is
call him one of our Titans Kohala is his
name and these Titans are the big heroes
in the game right they're the ones who
need your army into battle and again
hopefully you can see that the visuals
here and the character design is really
quite also so so how does this work well
it's it's all fully interactive so first
of all I want to show you we have you
know a huge number of troops the oil in
real time all for the end
this is all completely interactive so I
can set up my battle pre battle and tell
characters what to do to do that I just
tap them and just draw whichever way I
want them but I can do that during the
battle as well so the entire thing
always stays fully interactive so let's
just show you what that looks like and
send them into battle you can see here
my Titan is already approaching the
other troops and it's pretty powerful as
you can tell he's doing his thing there
and you can see just the sheer number of
units that were able to support at all a
full frame which is pretty crazy so it
looks like these guys are in trouble
here so what I'm going to do is I've got
a bit of a secret weapon here which is
my epic and this is the mighty Hydra and
she likes to spew stuff of people and
she also likes to eat people actually
unfortunately doesn't mind who she sees
anyone including your own troops oh
she's solid everyone out here but
there's a huge you know battle going on
here as well so what I'm gonna do here
is just use some of my fireball spells
and again you can see they're pretty
effective but actually what the enemy
has done is just spawn and now they're
probably thousand troops in the
background so I think I think I need to
retreat so let me just grab my remaining
troops here and pull them back and I've
got one last one last trump open up my
sleeve
they're just my super weapon here
and hopefully you can tell the scale of
this game it's just it's just absolutely
amazing so several thousand troops all
control have been in real-time it's a
PvP game you battle against other people
and in the game who have built their own
armies and we think this is a whole jump
in quality form it came in a mobile yeah
it looks really awesome the graphics
look amazing and like as far as like
upgrades like what other upgrades can
you obtain like throughout the game as
far as building yourself up to play
against other players a good question
there's a whole bunch and you can
upgrade your troops you know that the
people you send into into battle you can
upgrade your Titans obviously buildings
but you can also upgrade the plinth
and the city that you live on all the
different buildings that plinth itself
the size of the pins and you can add
more cities and clings to your existing
and so we have upgrade past pretty much
everywhere because we wanted to create a
game that's really deep so here you see
it running you know on a mobile rather
than the tablet again hopefully you can
see just the visual fidelity let me just
show you a few things yeah just the
waterfalls it looks extremely immersive
just because there's that 3d aspect to
it's not just from the top down you can
kind of get every single angle that's
right it needs to feel like it's a real
well but check this out so one thing
that's really cool is I'm not just on my
own I'm actually in a world you know
full of people so these are all real
people all playing you know together and
these classes that you can see our
alliances so when people work together
in Alliance that cluster together so you
can actually see the might of an
alliance on the basis of of the size of
the Alliance which we think is a really
novel way of visualizing it and again to
your point it's about being immersive
it's supposed to feel like it's a real
world and so we're very proud of that so
this game currently isn't testing and
it's going to be released later this
year for both Android and iOS okay
awesome well really looking forward to
this game thank you so much for sort of
breaking it down for us and showing it
off here and thank you so much guys for
watching stay tuned for the rest of our
e3 coverage because we are your source
