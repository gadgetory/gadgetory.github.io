authority and we're here with a review
of the lenovo ideatab s 2110 this is a
hybrid style tablet meaning that with
the optional dock it can be used more
like a laptop while removing the dock
leaves you with the standard tablet the
s21 10 starts at four hundred and twenty
nine dollars for just the basic version
of the tablet and can go as high as five
hundred and seventy nine dollars for the
tablet with more internal storage plus
the optional doc let's start by taking a
look at the technical specs the idea tab
s 2110 has a 10 inch screen and a 1280
by 800 pixel IPS display inside we'll
find a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
Snapdragon processor and one gig of ram
there are two models of the s21 10
available featuring either 16 or 32
gigabytes of internal storage we also
have a 6340 milliamp hour to sell
battery inside the tablet and another
one inside the optional dock which
effectively doubles battery life lenovo
claims around 9 hours of battery life
for the tablet alone and up to 20 hours
with the dock attached in our testing we
didn't find this to be quite as high
with the battery life ranging from 8 to
16 hours depending on whether or not we
were using the dock now let's take a
look at the device itself on the front
will of course find the screen and the
1.3 megapixel front-facing camera on the
left side will find the mini HDMI slot a
3.5 millimeter headphone jack and the
left speaker port this is actually very
well placed as when you're holding the
tablet with both hands it isn't easy to
accidentally cover the speaker on the
back we'll find the 5 megapixel rear
facing camera on the right side we
simply find the right speaker port and
the volume rocker on top of the device
we find the power button and microphone
looking at the dock on the front we'll
find a full-sized SD card slot on the
Left we see a mini USB slot as well as
two foals
USB slots nothing else is found on the
rear or on the right side of the dock
the bottom of the dock is simply the
same surface that we find on the back of
the tablet which by the way is
surprisingly likely to pick up
fingerprints the dock itself works very
well the keyboard is especially
noteworthy with a nice solid field of
the keys and excellent spacing the
touchpad isn't quite as impressive it's
hard to put a finger on what exactly it
is but it just feels wrong and I found
myself simply using the touchscreen
quite often the sound quality of the
built-in speakers is generally good at
least as far as tablets go there
certainly loud and as we mentioned
earlier the placement of them means that
you'll find yourself covering them with
your hands far less often than you would
on some other tablets now let's take a
look at the idea tab s21 10 in action
the device runs Android version 4.0
point 3 ice cream sandwich it is skin
which may put some users off but we
didn't find that performance took much
of a hit as a result of this the main
launcher screen is grouped into widgets
with apps separated into different
categories like life social games and
media tapping one of these widgets
expands it and allows you to add your
own apps the icons on the home screen
can be edited by a long press on the
screen which brings you into edit mode
allowing you to delete items for example
if you end up making a mistake it's easy
to simply exit edit mode without saving
your changes scrolling on the home
screen can be a little laggy due to its
rotating cube effect which can't be
turned off in settings we said earlier
that performance didn't take a hit from
the launcher and this is true
performance and apps and games won't be
affected you'll only notice this
slowdown on the home screen and in the
app drawer the idea tab s 2110 comes
with quite a few apps pre-installed like
documents to go sugarsync and a handful
of basic games it's unfortunate that
these can't be removed unless you run a
custom rom luckily some of them like ES
File Explorer
are useful one thing that can be removed
is the Lenovo app shop since it was
discontinued in September well the app
shop is installed initially and
over-the-air software update removed it
soon after I began testing the tablet
the rear camera on the S 2110 takes
decent pictures especially in well-lit
situations it still functions well
enough in low light but pictures tend to
be on the grainy side the video isn't
quite as nice well it can look ok the
frame rate seems to be choppy and the
mic is easily distorted by louder sounds
despite being plastic the idea tab s
2110 is very solid feeling without any
of the bending or Creek enos we've seen
in some other tablets lately the device
doesn't twist in your hands at all in
general use or even if you try to do
this on purpose though it's solid the
s21 10 is surprisingly light and thin
being just a hair thinner than the
galaxy tab 2 10.1 in general despite
lenovo not really being a major player
when it comes to tablets this is a very
polished build despite the fact that it
attracts fingerprints the matte surface
on the back of the tablet in the bottom
of the doc give the S 2110 a very
stylish professional appearance ok let's
wrap up the review in the end the lenovo
ideatab s21 10 is a useful and solidly
built tablet with some great features
there were just a few things about it
that we didn't like but the good
outweighs the bad in this case the main
problem with the s21 10 is the price if
Lenovo drops the price a bit they could
find themselves with a solid competitor
to the Asus Transformer series now we
want to know what you think about the
lenovo ideatab s21 10 whether you think
it's worth the price or what you'd
prefer to see it priced at this has been
Christopher walk for android authority
and we'd love to hear what you think of
this and other android authority videos
