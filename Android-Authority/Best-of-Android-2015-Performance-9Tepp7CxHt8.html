authority now many times we ask
ourselves a question what is the best
phone that I could buy and we're taking
the guesswork out of that decision for
you with our best of Android series and
in this particular installment we're
going to be looking at performance which
phone has the highest performance suit
already let's go
now just to remind you of the foes that
we're testing our best of Android series
in no particular order they are the Sony
z5 premium the Nexus 6p the LG v10 the
samsung galaxy note5 the Motorola Droid
turbo 2 or the Moto X Fortis is known
internationally and the BlackBerry Prive
so before we look at the individual
performance results of these phones
let's just remind ourselves of what chip
we find in the internals of each of
these devices now the Sony z5 premium
the Nexus 6p and the Moto X force all
use the Snapdragon 810 which is core
comms system on a chip that uses four
cortex a 57 cause and four cortex a53
cores and the court it's a 57 cause are
used for the heavy lifting and the a
court it's a 53 cause are used for the
lighter stuff because the a 53 is more
battery efficient and so the more stuff
is gonna put on there the longer the
battery life however the court is a 57
calls are there when hard work is needed
to be done now the other octa-core phone
in our lineup is the samsung galaxy note
5 and it uses Samsung's own homegrown
Exynos 7420 now it's also an optical
processor and it also has four quarters
a57 cores and for cortex 82 three calls
and we'll see how they perform compared
to each other in the test results we're
going to see in a moment
now two phones in our lineup are
actually only hexa-core phones and they
are the BlackBerry Prive and the LGB 10
and they are both using the Snapdragon
808 and the 808 only has two cortex 8:37
calls and four cortex a53 calls and so
interesting to see how they perform
against the octa-core phones in our
lineup so let's start by looking at the
antutu scores now antutu is one of the
most popular benchmarks available for
android today but the thing we're going
to remember about this benchmark and
other benchmarks is that the work
clothes they put on the CPU are
completely artificial that it reflect
real life at all however they are a good
guide to see what performance levels the
CPU could reach if it was pushed
that's the CPU and the GPU of course
says have a look at the actual results
that we found from our antutu testing in
first place we find the Samsung Note 5
that was then followed by
the Moto X force buy the Nexus 6p and
buy the Sony z5 premium now that's all
of our octa-core telephones then we find
a separate category slightly lower
results for the BlackBerry Prive and the
LG v10 in fact what we find now with the
antutu scores in fact will be repeated
again and again for all the different
benchmarks that we have run but
basically the octa-core phones perform
the best out of those the note 5 tends
to be the winner and then slightly
behind you'll get the hexa core
Snapdragon 808 devices so it's carry on
another popular benchmark is Geekbench 3
and geek bates 3 gives us two results
the single core result and the multi
core result of the single core result
tells you how fast one core is on the
phone regardless it's got two calls or
four calls or eight calls or six calls
how fast is just one over those calls
and that's the single core result then
it has the multi core result when it
tries to use all the core simile to
produce an overall score now obviously
the hexa core phones are going to do
worse in the multi core test because
they're missing two cores
compared to the others however the
single core tests will tell us whether
individual cores are faster or not so
let's have a look at the results so
looking at these results what we find is
that the fastest individual core speed
goes to the galaxy note 5 following on
from that we get the Snapdragon 810
processor results however we have a
disappointing performance by the Nexus
6p and then in last place we get the two
Snapdragon 808 phones of blackberry
Prive and the LG v10 switching over to
the multi-core tests again we see the
Galaxy Note 5 scores the best very close
behind it was the Sony z5 premium and of
course in last place is their blackberry
proved again because it's missing two
calls which is really unfair when it
comes to doing a multi-core test our
next set of performance tests were
performed by the Basemark OS 2 app which
you could of course download from the
Google Play Store as you can these other
test apps that we've been using and
looking at the scores we find the same
story yet again the galaxy note 5 has
the best score then the three Snapdragon
810 devices fairly evenly matched and
then
last place the BlackBerry Prive and the
LG v10 up until now these tests have
really been a combination of CPU and GPU
tests
maybe Geekbench is more CPU focused
however there are some 3d benchmark
tests that really just test the GPU in
cooperation with the CPU to see what you
can get out of these devices when it
comes to 3d gaming now the first of our
3d benchmarks comes from the 3d mark app
using its slingshot test suite now the
slingshot test suite is specifically
designed for the OpenGL ES 3.0 one
graphic system which is something you
find in Android 5.0 and upwards so let's
have a look at the results here for a
change the galaxy note 5 didn't win in
fact the Nexus 6p gave the best score in
fact it won by quite a way after that in
the second place we get the galaxy note
5 then the other two Snapdragon 810
processors the Moto X force and the z5
premium and then again at the bottom we
find the hexa core phones the BlackBerry
Prive and the LG v10
another popular 3d benchmarking AB is
GFX and GFX results are again quite
interesting but tend to follow the norm
that we've seen up until now and here
things again return to normal the galaxy
note 5 is the overall winner and the
second place is the Sony z5 premium a
good showing where the Nexus 6p however
not as good as it was in the previous
app a poor showing unfortunately by the
Moto X force which is almost beaten by
the BlackBerry Prive and then in last
place we find the LG v10 now benchmarks
are fine they tell us something about
what the process have been doing so far
we've seen across all these benchmarks a
basic pattern merging about which phone
has the highest performance however
benchmarks don't really tell you much
about real life it's all about loading a
game how long does it take to load your
favorite app up well we load up six apps
and measured how long it would take to
load each one and then took the average
now those apps are brave frontier
summoners war
clash of clans farmville - Walking Dead
and Game of Thrones let's have a look at
the results in this particular test
again the No
five didn't win however the Moto X
fourth did however only by a fraction we
dive into the individual results you'll
see in the note five struggled on just
two particular gaming rather than being
farmville and it just took slightly long
with hello than it did on the Moto X
fourth and therefore the Moto X force
has the better average overall score
unfortunately the worst performance is
given by the LG v10 and the blackberry
Prive now overheating is a subject that
people talk about all the time with
their mobile phones how warm is the
device get on the back
how warm does it get when you're playing
3d gaming and more particularly how warm
does it get when you're recording video
so we've done some tests for you we
recorded some video to see what the
temperature rise was on each of the
devices and here are the results and as
you can see the Moto X force has the
biggest temperature rise across all of
our devices almost 13 degrees and in
comparison the galaxy note 5 is only a
couple of degrees the other phones seem
to perform pretty well the only one that
stands out other than the Moto X force
is the BlackBerry Prive which at some
point had an 8 degree temperature rise
when recording full HD video
well that was full HD video what about
4k video well we did that test as well
and here are the results as before the
Moto X force has the greatest
temperature rise however this time it's
joined by the LG v10 which also has a
significant temperature rise during the
time of recording 4k video the note 5
doesn't do so quite so well this time
with a 7 degree rise in temperature
which is similar to that of the
blackberry proved the winner in this
particular category is the Nexus 6p with
ownio 2 or 3 degree rise while recording
4k video and we have just one more test
for you which phone can record the most
video before the app stops either
because it has a prebuilt
limit that's built into the app that
stops it from recording or because the
phone overheat and the recording can't
continue so here are the results
as you can see for 1080p video the
galaxy note 5 is the clear winner
however also a good showing from the
Blackberry proof and the
z5 from Sony however when it comes to 4k
video the BlackBerry pre of the galaxy
note5 and the LG v10 are all limited to
five minutes of video and then the app
actually stops them from recording and
the winner for 4k video in this
particular instance is the zone Sony z5
premium which can manage around 30 or 40
minutes of video before it overheat and
then has to stop so what does all that
mean well clearly the Samsung Galaxy
Note 5 is the general overall winner it
won many of the tests didn't win all of
them but it really was the leader
throughout the whole of these set of
comparisons now behind the Galaxy Note 5
we find the three Snapdragon 810 phones
they are the Sony z5 premium the Nexus
6p and of course the Motorola Droid
turbo 2 now all of these phones did very
very well and there's not much to
separate them in one test maybe the
Droid 1 in other tests maybe the 6p one
in other tests maybe there's 8 v 1 but
overall you take the average they
basically perform the same throughout
all of the tests and then in a category
on their own you'll find those two hexa
core phones the BlackBerry Prive and the
LG v10 now the thing to remember is that
these are all high performers phones
none of them are going to give you any
problems in terms of gaming or in
general day a day to day usage but we
are comparing the best of the best here
and when you compare the best of the
best the note 5 is the winner well why
don't you use the comments below tell me
what you think about the performance
tests of these particular phones also
