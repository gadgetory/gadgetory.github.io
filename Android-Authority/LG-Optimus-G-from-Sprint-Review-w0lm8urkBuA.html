LG phone it probably wasn't a smart
phone and if you're anything like me it
was probably the chocolate since then LG
has struggled to break out of the
mid-range game and jump into the
top-tier smartphone market well now is
the time to get excited because LG has
just released their new flagship phone
hey I'm Joshua vagar for android
authority what's going on everybody and
this is the LG optimus G from Sprint
let's jump right in look how gorgeous
this phone is sporting what I call a
black slate style the Optimus G is quite
literally one of the smoothest phones i
have ever handled in terms of build the
optimus G employs a more squared edge
design and is just a smidgen smaller
than the samsung galaxy s3 the size and
shape of this phone allow it to fit
safely and comfortably in my hand and
there were never any fears of the phone
slipping from my grasp the top end has
the headphone jack and one microphone
the right panel holds the power switch
and the left side has the volume rockers
the bottom of the phone takes the
industrious look further with two Torx
screws flanking the microUSB port even
if these screws are removable you're
unfortunately dealing with a non
replaceable battery here the back
portion of the phone houses the speaker
near the bottom as well as a camera of
which has a popped out design that might
lead to some scratches down the line if
you happen to slide your phone around a
lot coming over to the front one can't
help but be impressed with LG's offering
on the Optimus cheese screen the true HD
IPS + LCD display can display a
resolution of 1280 by 768 at a 318 ppi
pixel density to provide a crisp and
highly enjoyable viewing experience as
seen here I was able to see the display
quite well under broad daylight kudos go
to the 0 gap technology which
essentially means that only the glass
window lies between you and the actual
LCD screen itself this also lends to the
incredible responsiveness of the screen
I felt as if the screen was responding
within a millisecond of my touching the
surface and navigating the phone as a
result was a breeze the hardware
underneath all of this beauty is just as
impressive LG is the first manufacturer
to widely release a phone with a
quad-core processor that's right a
quad-core 1.5 gigahertz
Snapdragon processors that provides a
snappy experience I had basically no
hiccups on the phone as apps opened
seamlessly and multitasking was easy to
do you get two gigabytes of RAM for
running multiple apps at once and the 32
gigabytes of internal memory should be
adequate for most users a lack of
expandable memory is a sacrifice you
make for such a well packaged powerful
phone nonetheless the performance of
this phone is definitely eye-opening as
this benchmark operates in among some of
the best current phones LG's Optimus G
on Sprint is capable of connecting to 3g
and 4g LTE though the problem here is
that sprint has yet to widely spread LTE
across the states if you happen to be in
an area that has 4g LTE coverage then
you will have unlocked essentially every
capability of this phone unfortunately I
did not have coverage in my location so
this is one of the few weaknesses
holding this otherwise amazing phone
back near field communications are
available on this phone and are worth a
mention due to the inclusion of LG tag +
stickers these can be used as a quick
way to change your phone settings simply
tap the back of the phone to the tag and
your phone will perform the program
tasks this is a quirky feature with
loads of potential imagine a routine
where you tap your phone to the NFC tag
at work to ensure your phone is silent
using Wi-Fi etc the Optimus UI makes a
comeback in version 3 point no on the
optimus G and is one of the most
customizable stock operating systems out
there even the lock screen has many
options as it is customizable with four
app launchers found on the bottom in
this case I am using the ink unlock
effect and the biz theme which are just
a couple of the different effects and
themes readily available despite my
usual pension for third party launchers
and customizations I actually found
myself enjoying the Optimus aesthetic it
was stylish organized and provided many
options such as the quick toggles found
in the drop-down of no is the quick memo
function which takes the basic task of
screen capture and adds a welcome layer
of editing to it simply go to the
drop-down notification area and hit
quick memo you can write right on the
resulting image with your finger and
even highlight to your heart's content
this is quite useful for when you
encounter something you want to save but
you need a quick fast and editable way
of doing so and all that brings me to
the camera one of the most exciting
features of this phone at least for me
at a whopping 13 megapixels this can
provides quite a punch and in my testing
is suitable for a multitude of different
situations you have basic ISO white
balance and touch focus settings here
and while image quality is
understandably below that of dedicated
cameras it is definitely a cut above
your typical Instagram food shots or
self portraits a few features sweeten
the pot however there is an HDR mode to
punch out more color in your photos and
a panorama feature that proved a good
performer in this particular shot time
catch shot is a worthwhile feature that
helps solve the problem of either
jittery hands or blinking subjects the
camera continuously takes shots shortly
before and after hitting the shutter
button and when the picture is captured
a listing of about half a dozen
different pictures are made available
for selecting the perfect one cheese
shutter is just a fun way of capturing a
shot kimchi
when it came to video I found myself
happy to have this phone available to
record videos of nearly any nature while
low-light capabilities of this camera
are admittedly but unsurprisingly
lacking video came out quite nicely
under good lighting conditions in an age
when I phones can be used to record
artistic indie and even some feature
productions it is nice to know that the
Android side is moving in that same
direction with a little bit of
creativity and some tools I was able to
get the shots you saw at the beginning
of this video and these as well my
satisfaction what the final videos has
led me to believe that the lg optimus G
is a viable backup camera solution for
amateur and even some serious artists as
a wise man once said the best camera you
have is the one on you and so there you
have it LG's coming-out party has just
begun and if you are interested in
celebrating with them the LG optimus G
will set you back 1 99 99 with a
contract on sprint with killer
processing power an incredible screen
and a more than capable camera this is
plenty to love packed into one of my
favorite looking phones ever just check
if you have 4G LTE in your area or at
least coming soon as it is one of the
only things holding back the lg optimus
G from my full written review head over
