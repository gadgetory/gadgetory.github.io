Andrew authority now if you want to get
into programming or you want to
encourage a young person to get into
programming then maybe the micro bit is
a good entry point so what is it and how
does it work well let's find out history
during the late 1980s in the early 1990s
there was a thing called the home micro
revolution where computers like the
Commodore 64 the Sinclair ZX Spectrum
and of course the BBC micro found their
ways into the homes of lots of young
people who got into things like gaming
and things like that but it also gave
them an entry point into understanding
computing in general and many many
people from that point including myself
went on to careers in computing and
software engineers or as other type of
IT related jobs and actually that did
actually spur on a whole growth at
university level of entrants people
coming in to study computer science
related courses at university however
once we got into the PC era then and the
games console era we think that the
PlayStation then that kind of drive to
get into IT kind of dropped down and in
fact lots of the universities saw them
the number of requests for people to
join computer science courses actually
went down significantly and there have
been a couple of attempts to boost up
that interest again amongst young people
to get into computing one of course is
the Raspberry Pi and the other is the
micro bit now earlier on I mentioned the
BBC micro and this is actually called
the BBC micro bit and that's completely
intentional because this is sponsored by
the British Broadcasting Corporation who
have worked with arm and with several
other partners to bring this device to a
whole generation of young people in fact
have been given away free to a whole
year group in the UK across the whole UK
for free to the teachers and in the
classroom they can learn about
programming using one of these but of
course they're also for sale you can buy
one you can use it yourself you can gift
it to somebody and it's a great entry
point into getting into
programming because it's small it's easy
to use doesn't take much to start
getting some lights flashing to write
your first programs so let's have a
deeper look so what is the micro bit
well basically it's a very small ball
that's got at its heart and arm
microcontroller the cortex n0 and it's
also got a 25 LEDs that act as a kind of
a rudimentary display but you can scroll
words and messages across
it's got accelerometer so if you detect
tilting and movement it's got a compass
and it's got bluetooth and it's got two
buttons so that you can interact with
the users now you don't need a
television to use you don't need a
monitor you don't need a keyboard you
don't need a mouse you just need to be
on a PC that you can program it on and
then once you've programmed it the
program stays in flash memory and it can
be put into any kind of project from
simple kind of you know badges all the
way up to complicated robot systems
powered by a simple battery setup and
once it's flat it runs in there all the
time so the programming done on a PC and
then you flash it over and you run the
program every time it starts up it runs
the same program so it's really easy to
get into programming it so how do you
program it well basically there are four
different programming environments
available probably the easiest for the
youngest people is a blocks system that
there are two ideas that Armour
partnered with different people
including Microsoft to provide these
kind of blocks and the blocks you can
drag them out from a collection of
blocks and they do things like set
variables do a loop test a condition and
it's all built in size it's very visual
for people to see how these programs are
put together now behind the block system
is JavaScript code JavaScript is very
very popular on the web and those blocks
are converted directly into JavaScript
effect inside some of the editors like
the maps of editor you can switch
between the block of you and the
JavaScript view and you can see what the
blocks are doing in JavaScript which is
a great way to learn the fundamentals of
JavaScript and if you want to then
switch over to JavaScript if you write a
fairly simple program it can actually be
converted back into blocks if you start
writing more complicated programming the
block system just is left behind but you
can just keep on writing some very
complicated JavaScript there now the
only downside of the JavaScript system
is that because there are two separate
ID
what the coals that you use to do things
like control the LEDs or interrogate the
accelerometer or see if there's been a
button press they're actually different
on both systems so there's not a
standard JavaScript API that would means
you can write it in one environment and
the other once you pick an environment
you need to stay in that environment
now besides blocks in JavaScript you can
also write programs for micro bit using
micro Python now Python is again is a
very very popular programming language
it's got a whole bunch of users out
there and micro Python is kind of a
subset that's designed to run on
microcontrollers unlike the other
environments you write the program on a
PC and then you flash it over onto the
micro bit and your Python program is
then running and the final way that you
can write programs for microvidia is
using C and C++ and that's because the
micro bit actually uses armed embed
system now arms embed OS is basically
their way of providing an operating
system and all the tools you need to
build products based on microcontrollers
based on armed microcontrollers and
basically it's all open source so you
can basically get hold of all of this
code all of these libraries and all the
compilers and tools that you need to
build an Internet of Things product or a
microcontroller product of which the
micro bit is one of them and that
basically means if you go over to the
embedded development environment you can
add a micro bit board and then you can
start writing C code and that C code
will then just get flashed on to the
controller and it will start running so
that you've got blocks you've got
JavaScript you've got micro Python
you've got senior C++ a really great way
to get into programming from all
different levels of experience now to
test out the micro Vic what I thought is
I've wrote a program that simulates an
electronic dice you shake the micro bit
and it comes up on the display with a
number between 1 and 6 and I've written
that using blocks using javascript using
micro Python and using C now if you've
got over to Android ROM website you'll
see all four programs there and how I
did and basically the blocks is the
easiest so really is a good way to get
into programming the micro Python and
the JavaScript I reckon around the same
level of difficulty and the C one is a
bit more calm
because you really are dealing with some
low-level events some low-level reading
of the accelerometer which is a bit more
complicated than what you get in the
higher-level languages but on all four
platforms it's very easy to write
programs and it was easy to take that
idea and port it across all four
environments so it really is a good way
to learn about these different setups
and so there you have it my review of
the BBC micro bit of course it's made in
conjunction with the BBC in conjunction
with arm and with a whole host of
partners now of course there are other
alternative like the Raspberry Pi in the
Raspberry Pi zero however this really is
almost foolproof and does offer a great
way to get into programming it also
makes a great gift around the holiday
time or around someone's birthday to get
them into programming so I really do
wholeheartedly recommend my own children
are really quite keen to start playing
with this now that the review is
finished
