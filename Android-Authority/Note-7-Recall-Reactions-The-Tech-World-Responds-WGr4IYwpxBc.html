know that some of you thought I was
being irresponsible by not immediately
suggesting that you just exchange your
note 7 regardless of whether or not
you've had a problem with the battery so
I thought it would be interesting to
talk about what the rest of the tech
world is saying about the note 7 recall
what's turning out to be a
heartbreakingly billion dollar mistake
well it looks like mr. tech Buffalo
himself received the same criticism I
did and said he will swap his note 7 and
document the process but mr. ultimate
himself aka mkbhd had no such gumption
and is now playing hot potato
and what about jerry-rigged everything
who made a video where his note 7
actually explodes on camera but not for
the reasons you think it exploded
because he perforated the battery
intentionally with his tweezers poof and
he had no gumption 'he's about the fact
that he was using some serious clickbait
to get you to watch the video to calm
down fogies we've almost all done it
well our own senior editor Grusha
himself has actually applauded Samsung
for the way that they carried out the
recall and what about our intrepid
reviewer lon he was too busy driving his
new pink car what about my brother Jaime
Rivera well he seems too in love with
the note 7 camera and using lots of
hashtags in Berlin
we just love saying that name I may be
better hey may be better
hi me Ravenna and our main man Joshua
Vergara wants you to know that he loves
his note seven still and has been
vlogging all week with it but now after
the thirty-sixth incident of a note
seven exploding mr. mobile himself
Michael Fisher has said that at this
point if you haven't exchanged your
recalled note seven it's sort of foolish
and her own Android authorities in
arrived wants you to know that he did
smell some burning but it wasn't the
note seven it was his own oven he also
wants you to know that he looks this
good even after three hours of sleep
no I don't have a note 7 I'm a Sony man
so I don't have this problem but in last
show I did note that it is statistically
highly unlikely that you will ever have
this problem even if you have a note 7
but because there is a minut chance that
it may overheat and that could have
serious consequences yes the most
responsible thing to say is exchange
your recalled note 7 just remember that
devices every year overheat or have some
sort of serious failure when you're
selling 2 3 4 or 5 million of them there
are going to be devices that blow up
it's gonna happen why did this get
someone's attention well it's a flagship
device and it happened three weeks after
the launch that's why just keep things
into perspective let me know what you
think in the comments below I know you
will and you know I'll be reading them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
