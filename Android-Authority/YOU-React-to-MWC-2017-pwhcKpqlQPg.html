2017 and boy was it quite the show we
had announcements from all of the
different manufacturers especially in
the absence of Samsung and the Android
Authority team was out in full force
bringing you some of the best coverage
of the Mobile World Congress this year
we hope you enjoyed all of that coverage
and then shortly after I got onto social
media to ask you to react to MWC 2017 we
got a lot of responses so we're gonna go
through them now it's Josh of regard
what's going on everybody and these are
some of your reactions to MWC 2017 now
we do have reactions to a number of
specific announcements and devices but
for now let's talk about the show at
large I think it's a very good show the
mobile technologies are heading to an
interesting future but to be honest the
fight between the best smartphone
flagship was kind of lacking a bit
because Samsung didn't get to showcase
their latest flagship model now I
understand where a lot of people are
coming from this was a very common
sentiment without Samsung it felt like
Mobile World Congress this year was
lacking in something but with that said
there were so many great announcements
from all of the other manufacturers and
we were quite excited for plenty of them
that personally I think that if Samsung
was there with a Galaxy s8 they wouldn't
have taken away from the other
announcements they probably would have
just added to what could have been
considered one of the best MWC s ever
think somehow felt muted or held back
this year nothing really impressive but
kudos to huawei who seems to be trying
hard with their p10 launch the rest
sadly were kind of forgettable I
actually don't think I agree with this
the p10 plus which is what I'm using
right now and I'm reviewing while it is
a very solid device it does feel like a
bit of an iteration after the p9 and yes
we're always trying really hard to
convince us of otherwise my full review
is on its way and we're going to see how
all of those thoughts pan out if things
felt muted or held back it's probably
because they want to play it just that
little bit safer this year after things
like modules and exploding batteries
happen last year let's talk a little bit
about Sony and mostly people were
talking about the design Sony was
disappointing mostly because it
demonstrates that they aren't able to
adapt to market I'm referring to big
bezels Sony didn't get the memo that
bezels are awkward now now I do
understand where this is coming from but
we did have other users that were saying
that
the 4k screen and the 960 frame per
second video recording are pretty
incredible features and that's the thing
about Sony things have to look pretty
similar throughout their iterations
because they put out phones every six
months or so that said however what is
beneath the surface is actually pretty
great Sony does do a good job of
iterating some pretty awesome features
and we look forward to really testing
out the 4k screen and the super
high-speed video recording soon I think
it's awesome LG is back love the tiny
bezels on the LG g6 other OEMs take note
LG g6 looks killer super cool screen
curved corners light OS LG has learned
it's lesson after its g5 blender now
this is all something that I think we
echoed in our coverage the LG G 6 is one
of the most memorable phones from MWC
2017 and that screen is one of the
reasons why 18 by 9 aspect ratio might
be a little bit foreign to some people
but it makes for a super wide angle
display that goes to pretty much as
close to the corners as it possibly can
and that means small bezels which like
we said what sony is kind of a thing
that everybody wants now with that said
we did have one concern I'm concerned
that these phones are getting too big
we're past phablets now and basically
have tablets in our pockets I want to
hold the LG G 6 to see what it feels
like but being able to put the phone in
my back pocket is a big deal rest
assured the LG G 6 is a phone that you
can put into your back pocket unless
you're wearing super skinny jeans it has
a phablet sized screen without truly
feeling like a phablet because the
device only bleeds outside of the size
of the screen just that little bit so
it's like I said a sight to behold but
once you get it in your hand you have so
much at your fingertips with that large
screen blackberry q 1 equals amazing
what is your thought about blackberry
key 1 is there any chance of blackberry
to come back my brother texted me the
day after the key 1 announcement saying
he wanted it an iPhone fan wanting a
blackberry it looks like blackberry is
back now that is a pretty awesome notion
that an iPhone fan wants to go back to
blackberry and that also means that
they're going to convert from iPhone to
Android which is pretty cool too however
blackberry is obviously focusing on a
nostalgia factor and with that in mind
we have a physical keyboard a QWERTY
keyboard that only Blackberry can make
and this might be kind of like the phone
of my dreams I remember having a
BlackBerry Bold
I loved that device and I wanted a
version of that that had a full
touchscreen along with Android as its OS
well that's basically what we have now
whether or not this is going to be a
true comeback for blackberry remains to
be seen but at the very least we know
that they're still sticking around and
well we have some new blackberries to
play with so that's always exciting
and speaking of nostalgia now let's go
to nokia nokia all around they are
coming back and coming back strong
however on the other end of the coin the
nokia 3310 was not that great now there
are a lot of different ways of taking
the nokia 3310 if you are focusing on
the nostalgia factor then of course
you're going to love this phone that
really is a throwback to a classic
device on the other hand if you look at
what it's capable of it doesn't seem all
that great when you compare two smart
phones this is really a niche device a
device that you're going to have
secondary to you're probably already
existing smartphone and while you are
able to do things like play snake on it
if you are really entrenched in our
current app centric world of smartphones
the Nokia 3310 might only work in very
specific situations and that said it's
not even coming to all markets so if you
aren't in one of those markets that gets
the Nokia 3310 well you might have to do
a little bit of sleuthing to get your
hands on one and then finally we're
going to talk about a couple of the
other device manufacturers that may not
have taken the spotlight at MWC but
still are worthy of a mention it was
quite disappointing
nothing refreshing or for that matter
innovative except OPOs 5x dual camera
zoom system for me have to give it to
meizu for demonstrating their rapid
charging efforts aside from the
nostalgic aspect of the Nokia 3310 I was
pleasantly surprised with opus 5 X's
zoom zoom quality has been a backburner
feature for a long time and I'm thrilled
to see this detail in the foreground
now soom last year became a huge deal
when it came to dual lands phones the
ogv 20 did a decent job at it but the
transition from wide to normal lens was
pretty drawing the iPhone 7 plus did a
better job of it with its zoom
capabilities and now we have Oppo trying
to further perfect that system now
whether or not that technology will come
on a new Oppo flagship that we're going
to actually get later this year or that
technology is going to make it to other
devices remains to be seen but we had to
give some props to oboe for making that
already
and then finally rabid chargin was
actually a huge deal at MWC I was able
to take a look at one phone by Joni that
had 18 watt charging and then of course
we had QC three for all of the phones
that we have in the main flagship market
and then meizu comes out of nowhere with
55 watt charging which is pretty insane
all of the tech to make that charging
work is in the brick which is cool but
from there I wouldn't be surprised if
some users were worried about all of the
power that's literally flooding into
their device all at once fast charging
is going to maybe make some leaps this
year if this technology really pans out
and if that's the case maybe we will
never have to want for power again and
so there you have it that pretty much
wraps up all of our MWC coverage and we
wanted to get your guys's opinions and
show them off here on android 30.com so
keep it tuned to Android 34 even more
about all of these devices like I said I
have the p10 plus right here that I am

we can't wait to get our hands on the
Nokia and the blackberry q10 and Rho
