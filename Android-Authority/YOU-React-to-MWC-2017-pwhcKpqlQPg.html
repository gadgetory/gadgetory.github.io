2017 and boy was it quite the show we
had announcements from all of the
different manufacturers especially in
the absence of Samsung and the android
authority team was out in full force
bringing you some of the best coverage
of the Mobile World Congress this year
we hope you enjoyed all of that coverage
and then shortly after I got onto social
media to ask you to react to mwc 2017 we
got a lot of responses so we're going to
go through them now it's Joshua Vergara
what's going on everybody and these are
some of your reactions to mwc 2017 now
we do have reactions to a number of
specific announcements and devices but
for now let's talk about the show at
large I think it's a very good show the
mobile technologies are heading to an
interesting future but to be honest the
fight between the best smartphone
flagship was kind of lacking a bit
because Samsung didn't get to showcase
their latest flagship model now I
understand where a lot of people are
coming from this was a very common
sentiment without Samsung it felt like
Mobile World Congress this year was
lacking in something but with that said
there were so many great announcements
from all of the other manufacturers and
we were quite excited for plenty of them
that personally I think that if Samsung
was there with a galaxy s 8 they weren't
have taken away from the other
announcements they probably would have
just added to what could have been
considered one of the best mwc is ever
think somehow felt muted or held back
this year nothing really impressive but
kudos to huawei who seems to be trying
hard with their p 10 launch the rest
sadly were kind of forgettable I
actually don't think I agree with this
the p10 + which is what i'm using right
now and i'm reviewing while it is a very
solid device it does feel like a bit of
an iteration after the p 9 and yes we're
always trying really hard to convince us
of otherwise my full review is on its
way and we're going to see how all of
those thoughts pan out if dings felt
muted or held back it's probably because
they want to play it just that little
bit safer this year after things like
modules and exploding batteries happen
last year let's talk a little bit about
Sony and mostly people were talking
about the design Sonya was disappointing
mostly because it demonstrates that they
aren't able to adapt to market I'm
referring to big bezels Sony didn't get
the memo that bezels are awkward now now
I do understand what this is coming from
but we did have other users that were
saying
that the 4k screen and the 9 60 frame
per second video recording or pretty
incredible features and that's the thing
about Sony things have to look pretty
similar throughout their iterations
because they put out phones every six
months or so that said however what is
beneath the surface is actually pretty
great Sony does do a good job of
iterating some pretty awesome features
and we look forward to really testing
out the 4k screen and the super
high-speed video recording soon I think
it's awesome LG is back love the tiny
vessels on the LG G six other OEMs take
note LG g 6 looks killer super cool
screen curved corners light OS LG has
learned its lesson after its g5 blender
now this is all something that I think
we echoed in our coverage the LG G 6 is
one of the most memorable phones from
mwc 2017 and that screen is one of the
reasons why 18 by 9 aspect ratio might
be a little bit foreign to some people
but it makes for a super wide angle
display that goes to pretty much as
close to the corners as it possibly can
and that means small vessels which like
we said what Sony is kind of a thing
that everybody wants now with that said
we did have one concern I'm concerned
that these phones are getting too big
we're past phablets now and basically
have tablets in our pockets I want to
hold the LG G 6 to see what it feels
like but being able to put the phone in
my back pocket is a big deal rest
assured the LG G 6 is a phone that you
can put into your back pocket unless
you're wearing super skinny jeans it has
a phablet size screen without truly
feeling like a phablet because the
device only bleeds outside of the size
of the screen just that little bit so
it's like I said a sight to behold but
once you get it in your hand you have so
much as your fingertips with that large
screen blackberry key one equals amazing
what is your thought about blackberry
key one is there any chance look
blackberry to come back my brother
texted me the day after the key one
announcement saying he wanted it an
iPhone fan wanting a blackberry it looks
like blackberry is back now that is a
pretty awesome notion that a iphone fan
wants to go back to blackberry and that
also means that they're going to convert
from iphone to android which is pretty
cool too however blackberry is obviously
focusing on a nostalgia factor and with
that in mind we have a physical keyboard
a qwerty keyboard that only blackberry
can make and this might be kind of like
the phone of my dream I remember having
a blackberry bold
I loved that device and I wanted a
version of that that had a full
touchscreen along with Android as its OS
well that's basically what we have now
whether or not this is going to be a
true come back for blackberry remains to
be seen but at the very least we know
that they're still sticking around and
well we have some new blackberries to
play with so that's always exciting and
speaking of nostalgia now let's go to
nokia nokia all around they are coming
back and coming back strong however on
the other end of the coin the nokia 3310
was not back great now there are a lot
of different ways of taking the nokia
3310 if you are focusing on the
nostalgia factors and of course you're
going to love this phone that really is
a throwback to a classic device on the
other hand if you look at what it's
capable of it doesn't seem all that
great when you compare it to smartphones
this is really a niche device a device
that you're going to have secondary to
you're probably already existing
smartphone and while you are able to do
things like place make on it if you are
really entrenched in our current app
centric world of smartphones the Nokia
3310 might only work in very specific
situations and that said it's not even
coming to all market so if you aren't in
one of those markets that gets the Nokia
3310 well you might have to do a little
bit of sleuthing to get your hands on
one and then finally we're going to talk
about a couple of the other device
manufacturers that may not have taken
the spotlight at mwc but still or were
they ever mentioned it was quite this
morning nothing refreshing or for that
matter innovative except opos 5x dual
camera zoom system for me have to give
it to mizzou for demonstrating their
rapid charging efforts aside from the
nostalgic aspect of the Nokia 3310 I was
pleasantly surprised with opos 5x zoom
zoom quality has been a backburner
feature for a long time and I'm thrilled
to see this detail in the foreground now
soom last year became a huge deal when
it came to dual lands phones the LG v20
did a decent job at it but the
transition from wide to normal lens was
pretty drawing the iphone 7 plus did a
better job of it with its zoom
capabilities and now we have Oppo trying
to further perfect that system now
whether or not that technology will come
on a new Opel flagship that we're going
to actually get later this year or that
technology is going to make it to other
devices remains to be seen but we had to
give some props to oboe for making that
over
reality and then finally rapid charging
was actually a huge deal at mwc I was
able to take a look at one phone by
gionee that had 18 watt charging and
then of course we had qc3 for all of the
phones that we have in the main flagship
market and then Mason comes out of
nowhere with 55 watt charging which is
pretty insane all of the text to make
that charging work is in the brick which
is cool but from there I wouldn't be
surprised if some users were worried
about all of the powers that's literally
flooding into their device all at once
fast charging is going to maybe make
some leaps this year if this technology
really pans out and if that's the case
maybe we will never have to want for
power again and so there you have it
that pretty much wraps up all of our mwc
coverage and we wanted to get your
guys's opinions and show them off here

of these devices like I said I have the
