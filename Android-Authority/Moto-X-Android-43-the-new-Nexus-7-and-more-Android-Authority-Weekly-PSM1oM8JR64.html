Authority for a free trial well once
again we have a lot about the Moto X a
little bit about the Galaxy Note 3 and
finally some real substantial news
regarding the new Nexus 7 hey it's Josh
of a guard from android authority what's
going on everybody and it's time for
another dose of the week's top Android
news it's android authority weekly the
beginning of the week saw an interesting
new feature being introduced in the Moto
X and it's called the open mic it's like
a beefed-up goggle now except you can
even use it from the lock screen using a
predetermined or custom phrase you can
make the phone unlock and do just about
anything Google now can and then
motorola continued taunting us with some
twitter pics and a sarcastic comment
regarding today's smartphone cameras
either the kid is too fast or the
cameras too slow if you ask me maybe the
photographer needs steadier hands later
in the week we saw more substantial
leaks a redditor hosted his own
experience with an alleged ATT branded
Moto X and posted some benchmarks the
scores suggest a high-end package but it
was listed as a dual-core snapdragon so
we were hopeful for an s4 pro but this
most likely points to an S 4 plus the
leaks continued when an official promo
by Rogers showcasing the upcoming device
was somehow released it basically goes
through all of the features in some
depth and is clearly an introductory
look for new customers the video has
since been taken down from their YouTube
page but of course you can find it if
you look hard enough the supposed event
that will likely unveil the Moto X is
set for August first but until then we
will likely continue seeing more leaks
in the coming days while this is only a
rumor at this point some new sites are
reporting from their sources that
Samsung is already getting Android 4.3
ready for their galaxy s3 and note two
devices with the official release of the
new iteration of Android impending
perhaps it shouldn't come as much of a
surprise obviously we're holding out for
Android 4.3 but we also can't wait to
get our hands on some delicious key lime
pie which samsung did say will also be
available for the galaxy s
three and the note 2 as well are you
ready for the return of the flip phone
last year Samsung did try to revive the
form factor with let's be honest an
insanely priced flip phone and of course
it only made sense for one person to
definitely have it Jackie Chan but it
looks like Samsung is looking to try
again with a phone currently call to the
Samsung Galaxy folder it will be
released only in Korea and sport pretty
low specs well that's a start what I
can't figure out is why no one has yet
to figure out flip smartphones we got a
little bit better idea of what the note
3 might be offering us in a sketch and
and in 22 benchmark tests a Dutch
website posted pictures from what looks
like the manual if they're true the
Galaxy Note 3 will be in line with all
of the new smartphones coming out these
days spec-wise after that a pic of the
supposed and 22 benchmark tests for the
note 3 was also revealed its scored
about 33,000 which puts it among the top
phones out today so it does look like
the note 3 is going to keep up with all
of these great smartphones that we're
seeing today it looks like the big leaks
are starting for the nexus 7 which is
likely to be unveiled along with Android
4.3 at a special breakfast event with
sundar Pichai a pretty substantial leak
with pictures and supposed release dates
was later seen it included the device in
the flesh and stated that the new tablet
might come out as early as this upcoming
week later reports put the tablet at 229
dollars for the 16 gigabyte model and
269 dollars for the 32 gigabyte model
prices that certainly aren't too far off
from last year's Nexus 7 in it's really
affordable price range specifications on
the new tablet are still up in the air
but a sticker pic gives us our best
Clues if correct the new Nexus 7 will
support the Snapdragon s4 pro a screen
capable of 1920 x 1200 resolution and a
5-megapixel rear-facing camera it is
indeed starting to look like a great
tablet make sure you stay tuned to
android authority for the full review

released all right everybody that'll do
