phone but bam i'll but a week or so ago
some poor guy posted a video on facebook
showing him casually working at his desk
when his phone catches fire and explodes
this was the xiaomi me for i Shami has
now officially responded to the incident
and vowed to replace the device assuming
the guy isn't emotionally scarred from
the experience and has decided to go
back to feature phones for good I guess
that's a positive thing Xiaomi responded
with the following statement and I quote
we take such matters seriously and we've
already been investigating in the matter
we've been in touch with the customer
and we'll be getting his device this
week to do further investigation in the
meantime we've offered a replacement
phone to the customer now should you be
concerned that your Xiaomi device is
gonna blow up in your hand well no not
really aside from a few Samsung devices
that blew up a few years ago this is an
extremely rare occurrence but as a
precaution it's always best to use the
original brands chargers and not some
cheap third-party charger that could be
defective now check out this photo of my
son he works at a horse ranch over the
summer and this photo looks fantastic
through the Prisma app Prisma is a photo
editing application that allows you to
take a photo and make it look fantastic
through prism as filters but it's really
unlike any other filters you've seen
before they look fantastic really
popular and it has just taken over the
Google Play Store now you may have
noticed that it was missing a key
feature and that's video support well it
looks like the wind is almost over as
the Prisma co-founder has promised to
introduce a new video tool inside the
app over the next several weeks to allow
you to edit video clips with the same
artistic style now I would love to see
your favorite Prisma photos just tag me
on twitter at Jase Broda
I'd love to see him I gotta say though
as excited as I am about this feature I
have my doubts a photo editing app is
very different from a video editing app
it is going to demand massive resources
on your device
it's not that simple it's an entirely
different ballgame when you talk about
editing video like this on your phone I
don't know he says it's gonna come out
the next few weeks this sounds like a
feature that would take a massive
overhaul of your app let me know what
you guys think in the comments below now
let's talk about why you will never
really catch them all on Pokemon go for
those of you who played the game you'll
may have noticed that when you get to
the really really high levels it
requires more experience points than it
takes to progress from level 1 to 25
combined that makes it exceedingly
difficult to get well above level 30 a
redditor named rig na Rios decided to
share his observations about Pokemon go
after hitting level 30 Ragnaros pointed
out that Pokemon go seems to scale
exponentially making it essentially
impossible to ever finish without
spending money another editor compiled
the data which certainly seems to
confirm this now what do you guys think
have any of you been above level 20 or
25 and have you found this let me know
