take
augmented reality to the next level hey
guys john be here with android authority
and we're checking out
Lenovo's brand new fab 2 line that
consists of these three new smartphones
that are coming here to the US that's
pretty important for them just because
for the longest of time there they've
only targeted markets abroad so yeah
it's largely uncharted territory for
them we have three smartphones in this
new line the Lenovo fab two the fab 2
plus and finally the tangle ready fab 2
Pro they pretty much share the same
fundamental design language following
that best better good strategy they're
big phones with 6.4 inch sized screens
now the main difference between them are
the materials used for their bodies and
their specs now being the entry-level
the bunch the fab 2 has a plastic body a
720p IPS screen and a media tech 80 735
processor
next up the fab 2 plus swaps the plastic
body for an aluminum alloy one while
also adding a fingerprint sensor dual
rear cameras a 1080p screen and a
slightly better media tech 87-83 trip
and finally you have the fab 2 pro which
boasts a unibody metal design a quad HD
screen the fingerprint sensor and a
Snapdragon 820 chip we would say their
original looking since they look like
many of the other metal phones we've
seen released this year already but it's
a nice distinction from its Motorola
stuff the BAP to pro is by far the most
intriguing of the trio since it has the
hardware that makes it tango ready
technically there are three major
components that validate it being tango
ready so that's a fisheye camera lens to
get a wide view of the space there's an
RGB camera that helps in sensing what's
around the room and then there's also an
IR emitter that sends an IR grid to
measure the time of flight or in
layman's terms it just helps to measure
distance while augmented reality is
nothing new let's work with project
tango goes the extra step by giving
freedom to augmented reality so you no
longer are restricted to just a static
experience
now we check out a cool few tango
experiences with the fab 2 pro like an
upcoming Lowe's app that provides
conceptual ideas of what your future
kitchen might look like by just simply
visualizing appliances right where you
intend on putting them and then there's
another demo it's a first-person shooter
which maps out a room with its sensors
and allows us to move around the room to
shoot down these aerial drones now it's
pretty neat because it makes us think
about the possibility of one day seeing
maybe a tango ready phone strapped into
a headset like Google cardboard but
rather than having a stationary
experience you're going to be able to
move around in the space overall the
tango experience is here with the fab 2
Pro establishes a new direction for
augmented reality as more developers get
onboard we can only imagine things
getting better and you'll have more
meaningful experiences as well
price-wise they all have their value at
$2 you're getting a mighty big phone
that should be ample for most users with
the fab 2 now going up from that you
have 299 for the fab 2 plus which
benefits from having a metal body the
fingerprint sensor and slightly beefed
up specs and lastly there's the $499 fab
2 pro which is still not too shabby
given that has the same specs as any
contemporary flagship right now but it's
the sole device on the market that
brilliantly showcases what tango is all
about
although should be available globally by
September but they might come here to
the US a lot earlier and those are all
the brand new phones coming to Lenovo so

of them you could check out our website
