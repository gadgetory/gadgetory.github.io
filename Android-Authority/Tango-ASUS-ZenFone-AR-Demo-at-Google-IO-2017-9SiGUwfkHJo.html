going on everybody and here we are
taking a look at a tango AR demo one of
the more fun demos that we got at i/o
2017 especially when you consider that
it is being powered by the azuz gen
phone AR Verizon in the US is going to
be selling this phone so you could get
your hands on tango sooner than you
expect a couple of them entertaining one
of them made for education and another
one made for some real utility now the
first one that we had here was welcome
to Oz and by Oz we mean the Wizard of Oz
so you can fire up the zenfone AR
application the tango app and be able to
just impose the characters from Wizard
of Oz on to pretty much any surface
after selecting a particular area that
serves as the boundaries of the tango
area then you will be able to have
either the lion or even the Tin Man not
only rendered on the floor but also used
as companions because you can take a
picture with them through the camera
application and because this is tango
you can walk around the characters and
see even more than just a
one-dimensional view moving into a
little bit more utility the gap' app
which is available already in the Google
Play Store and requires tango is a way
for you to take a look at clothing and
kind of put together a wardrobe of sorts
before even having to go to the store
render out a virtual mannequin and you
can choose all the different kinds of
clothes that it can wear you can even
see how things change when you go from
small medium large to all the different
sizes mannequins include of course men
and women sizes and then you will be
able to sort of put different
combinations together and walk around at
the virtual mannequin to see how
everything looks
what utility takes on a whole different
level when it comes to the constructor
now this is what tango was originally
touted to be which is an apparatus for
people that might be in construction to
figure out the kinds of layouts or to
even know exactly how everything is laid
out in a particular area now you can
just imagine a lot of contractors using
project tango in order to run around an
area and just see where the furniture
could be or where different pipes could
be or really just using your imagination
you can figure out anything about a
particular space a quick scan of the
people that were around us in the area
that was right in front of us brought of
a slightly low resolution render of the
immediate area however after allowing
the app to sort of go through the day
a little bit deeper what came out was a
pretty high-quality render of the
immediate area around us we thought this
might be a great tool for game
development after all you could make a
mock-up of the world inside of a video
game and then use tango and this
constructor app in order to virtualize
it and then finally we have expeditions
now expeditions is something that I got
a look at a previous Google i/o we're
using cardboard everyone was synced up
to the same audio source and were being
taught a number of different subjects
and details based upon what was being
shown in the cardboard application so
you would be able to actually experience
what was being taught to you and get out
of the books
now tango just made this a little bit
more interactive embedding graphics onto
the real world so that students would be
able to run around and actually see the
objects in front of them while learning
about them and after a number of
different announcements for tango AR and
just seeing how things have come in the
last year it makes us really excited to
see tango come on other devices this
zenfone AR is already a nice looking
phone that is coming to the US on a
major carrier and we can only hope to
see this become a trend in smartphones
today and in the near future tango has
come a long way and the high fidelity of
the rendering that we played with with
these phones and everything that we saw
was really impressive
so tango could become a very valuable
tool and something that might become
invaluable for a lot of users who want
to take their augmented reality to the
next level keep it tuned to android
authority for even more and don't forget
to check out our coverage on android or
decom on everything including tango AR
and you can see everything that we did
here on the youtube channel as well so
