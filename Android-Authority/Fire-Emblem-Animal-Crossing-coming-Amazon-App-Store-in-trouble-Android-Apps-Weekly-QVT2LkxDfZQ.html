weekly show is brought to you by weather
back wallpaper hello again ladies and
gentlemen I'm Joe Hindy the android
authority app guy and welcome back to
android apps weekly this is episode
number 138 we've got some good news for
you so let's get started natori
co-founder Nolan Bushnell has decided
that enough is enough he announced this
week during an interview with The
Guardian that he intends on stepping
back into the game development scene but
when they focus on mobile gaming he says
that mobile games piss him off and that
they all suck since a lot of them make
us feel the same way we can't wait to
see what he's got up his sleeve some new
leaked footage of Pokemon go surfaced
early this week which seems to have only
added to the major hype surrounding the
game the leak is about nine minutes long
and shows you far more about the
mechanics and the gameplay than any
prior video leaks so far as you can
imagine people are super excited about
it but there is still no release date
Nintendo has announced that animal
crossing and Fire Emblem will be making
their way to smartphones sometime this
fall this comes on the heels of me tamos
release which has been very profitable
for the company so far we don't know a
filthy full-fledged games or freemium
variants but we'll know more later this
year the Amazon Appstore is having some
growing pains this week they haven't
been properly labeling whether or not
applications have had in app purchases
which is a big no-no the FTC is now
going after them and have one similar
cases in the past with google play and
Apple's App Store expect a huge fine to
be levied and changes to be made before
the end of the year Google kind of let
it slip this week that it plans on
unleashing Android apps on Chrome OS
some people on reddit have found an
opt-in that allows the google play store
on Chrome which would mean all the
applications and games would be
available to a degree this seems to fall
in line with reports that Chrome OS and
Android would be folded together will
likely learn more at Google i/o here in
a couple of weeks for even more Android
apps and games news releases and updates
don't forget to check out this week's
ridiculously packed newsletter in the
video description below there you'll
find an abundance of news and info that
we didn't have space for time for here
if you'd like you can sign up using the
form in the written version which is
also in the video description below and
you can get this newsletter sent to you
every single Sunday
okay folks let's take a look at the apps
and games that made a big splash this
week as usual if you want to check out
any of these apps or games for yourself
we'll have those links for you in the
video description below super Phantom
cat is a platformer that pays homage to
the 8-bit and 16-bit platformers a bold
it has a goofy storyline that helps move
things along and you'll be treated to a
bunch of levels unlockable characters
and some retro style graphics that are
bright and colorful the game does manage
to invoke the same feelings that the old
platformers did although it could be
argued that it borrowed a little much
from the mechanics in any case it's free
to play and it's pretty fun radon is a
unique application that allows you to
share links with just about anyone
that's close enough to you the
application takes advantage of the newer
nearby api's and doesn't require other
people to be on the same Wi-Fi network
or Bluetooth connection or even have NFC
on for it to work the idea is that you
shoot a link out and anyone with the
radon application can accept the link
and open it there are a few early
release date bugs but the application
does work and it's pretty nifty orbitz
on to see as unique little puzzle game
where you must defeat replicating
monsters collect stars and take
advantage of the game mechanics to not
be defeated it uses mechanics that allow
you to kind of orbit around planets to
keep from being captured which was
actually rather enjoyable it also comes
with five characters ninety levels 100
stars in each level and some fun looking
animation and graphics it's two dollars
and ninety-nine cents with no in-app
purchases if you're interested random
flicks is a fun little application if
you have netflix and you're really lazy
the basic premise is that you hit a
button and the application will give you
a TV show and a random episode to watch
on netflix this solves the age-old
question of what to watch on TV the
application has access to every show on
netflix which also makes it a nice
reference guide if you want to just look
around think of it kind of like a TV
Guide for Netflix it's also completely
free which is nice Angry Birds action is
the latest game out of Romeo and this
game isn't like the standard angry birds
games it's essentially a pinball game
where you launch birds around the board
to rack up points collect valuable items
and save the eggs it features characters
from the angry birds movie and it's
likely this was made as a promotional
games as the movie is coming out next
month it has an energy system which
sucks a lot but otherwise it's a family
friendly game and it's free to download
