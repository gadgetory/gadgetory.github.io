Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome to the first episode of the
Android apps weekly show in 2016 this is
episode number 122 let's get started
after about a month google has
reinstated the little-known application
called cyber re this is actually an
educational application that will teach
you about cyber security it was booted
from the google play store after Google
mistook it for a hacking application
which it clearly isn't after tons of
angry user emails the application is
back on the google play store last week
we put up our picks for the most
controversial android apps of 2015 a few
of them included android pay telegram
and yet jack among others it was a
pretty dry year comparatively speaking
but you can check it out for yourself
and see which android developers caused
the biggest stir in 2015 at the end of
2015 it appeared as though t-mobile and
youtube were having a little bit of a
spat the issue is that YouTube accused
t-mobile of throttling YouTube videos to
480p with tmobile claiming that the
videos were being optimized as part of
their binge on platform hilariously
t-mobile flat out said that calling it
throttling is misleading but calling it
downgraded is apparently perfectly okay
YouTube is still not happy about it in
an effort to remain relevant facebook
has been testing multiple topic-based
news feeds for mobile devices it's a
tabbed thing that lets you check out
things like travel style headlines and
other topics very quickly it could be a
fun idea if it ever rolls out to the
public and we don't know if it ever will
square enix released a trailer this week
for final fantasy nine showing that they
plan on bringing one of the most iconic
and enjoyable Final Fantasy titles ever
made it to mobile Android users are
still waiting on final fantasy 7 as well
so we don't know how long the wait will
be but I'm personally excited the
trailer looks fantastic by the way for
even more Android apps and games news

2d beat-'em-up game that features fluid
gameplay decent graphics and an anime
theme you control a character as you run
through levels taking down as many bad
guys as you can the game includes boss
fights leveling up so you can make your
characters more powerful and there's
even a storyline that you can follow the
game saw some early release issues so
the ratings are a bit low right now but
the game is actually pretty fun we have
released a brand new application for

don't screw up is a simple puzzle game
that insults your intelligence and on
occasion also just plain insult you the
mechanics are pretty simple because it
follows the classic bapat style of
gameplay where you tap hold swipe or any
combination of those things when you get
it right the game insult you and when
you get it wrong the game still insult
you this is not for those who can't
handle a little verbal abuse and is
rated mature 17 plus on Google Play

beta tag and is now a full-fledged
application in the Google Play Store
