clean young Burt coming at you as always
from Android authority calm your number
one source for all things Android today
we've got a quick review of the incipio
SIL acrylic case for the Samsung Galaxy
s3 now this fits on any very into the
Samsung Galaxy s3 and you can pick it up
at retailers like Verizon or you can
also visit in CBO's website as well as
pick this up on amazon.com anyways this
is a two part case we've got our silicon
and our acrylic pieces hence the name
they sell acrylic case well the nice
silicon is going to protect and absorb
any damages from falling facedown or you
know on its sides or back and then the
hard acrylic is also going to protect
from those as well as scratches and
scuffs so anyways to install this case
you just take your samsung galaxy s3 and
fit it within the silicon right here
make sure all of our edges are nice and
tight and we've got all of our cutouts
in the right place as well as our volume
rockers and our power button and then we
simply just put it in me heart acrylic
backing we're gonna want to match up
just these little corner bezels there
did you see we got it on there perfectly
we have our nice corners on here to
protect from any damage falling on the
the corners of course and then we have
our nice silicone preventing and
protecting it with a nice bounce and the
impact for the bottom and the top now
we've got our great access to our power
buttons our volume rockers our headphone
jacks nice and exposed as well as our
small mic on top and then we've got our
microUSB and our small mic on bottom we
have our nice and CTO branding right
here and this is just really less
scratch resistant it's great and it
feels nice it has a soft rubbery you
touch to it and it's gonna protect your
phone from facing impact as well we've
got a nice bezel there it's gonna you
know protect me small objects from
puncturing the screen and then it looks
great on your phone and it's nice and
lightweight as well the installation is
just as easy you can simply just grab a
corner you don't have to worry about
bending your galaxy s3 or anything like
that and then you can just simply pull
it out like nothing just like butter
anyways guys that would be the CP Ocilla
crellick case
go ahead and check it out or check out
our other videos for cases if you're
deciding on which one you should get and
thanks for staying tuned with Android
authority calm guys we got more this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
