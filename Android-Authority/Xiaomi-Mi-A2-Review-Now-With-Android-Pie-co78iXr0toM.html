Android Authority and today we're taking
a look at the Xiaomi me a2 this is an
Android one phone and as of right now
you can find this phone for under $300
which is pretty affordable and if you're
not familiar with the Android 1 program
this is where device OMS or
manufacturers take care of the hardware
side of things and then Google does the
rest with the software and the security
patch updates and Google does allow OMS
a little bit of leeway when it comes to
customizing these Android 1 phones but
for the most part the experience is very
much stock Android so for example you'll
find shammies camera app pre-installed
on here you'll also find shammies me
remote app that lets you take advantage
of the IR blaster that's on this phone
which is a feature that we don't really
see on smartphones anymore but you can
use this phone to control your TV or
other peripherals in your home but for
the most part the experience is pretty
much just stock Android now because of
the price point this phone is missing
some key features it doesn't have IP
certification wireless charging and of C
expandable storage and it also doesn't
have a headphone jack so if any of those
features are a deal-breaker to you you
might want to explore some other options
the main reason why I wanted to talk
about this phone today though is because
it recently just got updated to Android
Pi sort of it's not an official OTA
update it's actually a leaked beta ROM
and if you want to flash it it requires
you to have root access so if you guys
want to check it out we'll leave a link
to our written article down in the
description below so you can check it
out for yourself if you want to try
Android PI on the me a too early but
because it does require root access
flash it at your own discretion
the Android Pi update brings all the
things you would expect from Android Pi
like adaptive display adaptive battery
and the PI gesture navigation controls
but one of the things that I like about
the me a 2 is that you actually have the
option of picking between the gesture
navigation and the now old-school
standard Android soft keys if you rather
use those instead but performance on
this ROM even though it's just a beta
has been very
smooth and very responsive I haven't
noticed any major bugs it's definitely
daily driver material if you want to use
it as your daily driver which I have
been doing for the last four or five
days and battery life on this ROM has
also been extremely good I'm getting
anywhere between five to five and a half
hours of screen on time very
consistently with what I would consider
heavy usage I'd play a lot of games I
have watched a lot of YouTube and this
phone still comfortably gets me through
a full day with around 15 to 20 percent
left at the end of the day as far as the
rest of the phone it has a pretty modern
design with great build quality
it's an all-metal build and the design
sort of reminds me of older oneplus
devices like a 1 + 5 or 1 + 5 t it also
has a pretty large screen on the front
with a 6-inch display an 18 by 9 aspect
ratio and it also doesn't have a notch
so this is a pretty solid option if you
don't like notches but the bezels are a
little bit on the thicker side but the
screen itself does look pretty nice it's
very vibrant very colorful I just wish
it was a little bit brighter because I
did find it to be a little bit tough to
see outdoors on the rear you'll find a
fingerprint sensor and dual cameras the
main camera is a 12 megapixel sensor and
the secondary sensor is 20 megapixels
which is for portrait mode photography
and also better low-light performance
and I was actually pleasantly surprised
by this camera it produces really great
colors has really good detail and also
pretty good dynamic range low-light
photos do get a little bit too noisy for
my taste but it actually does a really
nice job of maintaining a lot of these
shadow and highlight details and also
preserving a lot of the color the
front-facing camera is also 20
megapixels so there's plenty of
resolution if you want to take
front-facing photos and it also has
portrait mode and also a beauty mode for
softening the details in your face if
you're into that sort of thing it's not
really something that I really like on
my front-facing photos but it's there if
you want to use it so that's pretty much
it for the Xiaomi me a - it's a really
great Android 1 smartphone that's
extremely affordable
it offers a modern design
a lot of modern features and also has a
very streamline Android experience and
the early access to Android Pi on this
phone makes it even sweeter but if you

me a to make sure to check out our full
written review which will be linked down
