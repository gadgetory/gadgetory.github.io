with Android Authority and ZTE and
Huawei there are two Chinese companies
that have been in the telecommunications
business for decades but which one has
created a better affordable flagship
let's dig deeper with ZTE axon 7 verse
honor 8 right off the bat there's some
pretty significant differences with
design ZTE goes for a large aluminum
unibody free of any edges while Huawei
has implemented a more compact dual
glass panel design held together by an
aluminum band the nr8 is also a bit
thinner and lighter than the axon 7 and
is also free of any camera bumps the on
rate is a bit more comfortable in the
hand thanks to its smaller size the xn7
shape is notably ergonomic both xn7 and
on rate can be pretty slippery although
I must say I'm impressed with the build
quality of both phones is they've held
up quite nicely to numerous accidental
drops you should still probably find a
case and with the xn7
you're covered out of the box a case for
the an r8 would also eliminate the need
to constantly clean the phone's glass
panels of smudges and fingerprints which
collect like you wouldn't believe
unlike the exon 7 the honor 8 includes
an IR blaster for controlling
televisions and other household
appliances it's definitely a nice touch
but I'll let you be the judge of its
utility I prefer the uh narrates
on-screen navigation keys to the accent
sevens capacitive keys since the accent
sevens keys are not illuminated nor are
they easy to press because of their
close proximity I was happy to see that
both phones give you the option to
change the key layout in the software
settings the Exxon 7s 5.5 inch quad HD
display looks a bit better than the
honor rates 5.2 inch 1080p display
mostly because of the slightly greater
contrast and more accurate color
reproduction
they're both AMOLED panels so you can
expect some saturated and punchy colors
on both devices sunlight readability is
about average on both phones as well
just something to know the honor eights
auto brightness feature is currently
very buggy
send my unit and we'll actually reset
itself to the minimum value after the
phone remains idle for a few minutes
this is very annoying so I ultimately
decided just to disable the feature
completely so the axon 7 is being
powered by a Snapdragon 820 while the
ANA includes one of Huawei's own
in-house high silicon Kirin 950
processors there's also four gigabytes
of RAM in each and there's nothing
really to complain about with either
phone every day performance is some of
the best we've seen now for gaming the X
and 7 is the more future-proofed choice
as it employs a much more powerful
adrenal 5:30 compared to the utter
eight-mile 8880 and p4 GPU but gaming
performance today is overall very
similar so you shouldn't have to worry
about this too much
both of these affordable flagships are
unlocked and dual sim and in the US you
can use each phone with either AT&amp;amp;T
t-mobile or one of their respective
MVNOs and yes
both phones offer expandable storage up
to 128 gigabytes if you're willing to
give up the second SIM card slot both
fingerprint readers can be found in each
devices back and I found them both fast
and accurate the honor eights also
doubles as a tactile button so you can
program different shortcuts including
flashlight screenshot or voice recording
to tap DoubleTap and holds you can also
have it open an app instead if you'd
like it's a pretty clever addition and
great once you get it set up how you
like if you're looking for a great audio
experience the exon 7 is the clear
choice with dual independent type I
audio chips for both listening and
recording audio sounds noticeably better
with a good pair of headphones the on
rates single side firing speaker also
pales in comparison to the exon sevens
dual stereo front-facing speakers which
offer louder fuller more immersive and
less distorted sound they are truly
incredible when you hear them in person
especially once you consider the phone's
price so for the batteries we're looking
at 3,250 milliamp hours on the exon 7
and 3000 milliamp hours on the honor 8
in my testing battery life was about 50%
better on the exon 7 with 5 and a half
hours of screen on time compared to the
on rates
three and a half hours I should note
however that I had to change the honor
eights power profile to performance as I
was missing notifications from apps like
slack snapchat and Twitter in balance
mode I didn't have this issue with the
accent sevens smart power mode so I
didn't make the same change although the
honor eight offers about a 42% charge in
30 minutes with nine volt to amp fast
charging it's only compatible with the
charger included in the box
the axon seven on the other hand
supports quick charge 3.0 so it doesn't
really have this problem you can also
get a slightly larger 50% charge in 30
minutes
although the Exxon 7s 20 megapixel F 1.8
rear camera with optical image
stabilization looks impressive on paper
it's not as compelling as the honor
eights dual lens 12 megapixel F 2.2
setup with hybrid autofocus the honor 8
is using a single colored lens as well
as a monochrome lens which Huawei says
helps deliver better crispier looking
photos I'm not sure how much the dual
lens setup actually helps the on rates
images definitely appear better than the
axon 7s in a blind a be test a chose the
UH narrates daytime images about 65
percent of the time the other 35% can be
accounted for varying scenarios
objectively speaking the honor rates
images generally had better dynamic
range crispier details and more accurate
color reproduction well I did prefer the
X on sevens more saturated and punchy
colors in some cases how much you do
will depend entirely on your personal
preferences in low-light the honor its
camera does even better thanks to its
larger pixels allowing for more light
per pixel
despite the accents heavens wider F 1.8
aperture images taken with the xn7
well sometimes sharper generally
displayed muted colors and noticeable
than getting the excessive amount of
noise reduction also doesn't look great
although the honor AIT's low-light
performance isn't the best we've seen
due to soft details and digital noise
it's one of the best in this price
category for video recording the exon 7
does 4k whereas the NR 8 maxes out at
1080p at 60 frames per second this is
the single area where they honor rates
camera disappoints with poor colors and
inaccurate
exposure the XM sevens camera app also
feels more polished compared to the
honor aides both offer comprehensive
manual modes and a number of other modes
but the honor eights app can definitely
seem overwhelming at times both handsets
are running Android 6.0 marshmallow out
of the box and the axon seven runs ZT
ESB favor UI 4.0 well the honoré
includes huawei's emotion UI 4.1 me
favor UI feels much more like stock
android but with a few tweaks compared
to emotions UI iOS like feel and many
tweaks
look the xn7 software experience it's
not perfect there's definitely still
areas that could use some polish but
emotion UI is worse than comparison it
feels half-baked and clearly not
tailored for the u.s. it's not that
Huawei's iOS like approach is inherently
bad but rather that Huawei has executed
in a way that feels ill-prepared and
gimmicky for example there's an entirely
different scrolling mechanic compared to
stock Android which is smoother but
slower this is problematic as you have
to wait for the inertia scrolling to
completely stop in order to select
something that gets frustrating very
quickly and drove me absolutely crazy
during the honourees review period the
axon 7 does have a few quirks of its own
however for example you have to press
the notification bell each and every
time you want to view notifications on
your lock screen its software support is
the priority however you will be happy
to know that honor recently committed to
software updates for at least two years
they'll even provide new features every
three months for the first year
hopefully these updates will gradually
improve the software experience you can
purchase the ZTE axon 7 with 64
gigabytes of storage and either gray or
gold for $400 for the same price you can
get the honor 8 with 32 gigabytes of
storage either black white or blue if
you'd like the 64 gigabyte model instead
you'll need to pay an extra $50 honor is
offering 3 months of non-deductible
protection against cracks in addition to
a standard one-year warranty that's
pretty good but ZTE s 2 year axon
passport 2.0 warranty seems a bit
superior despite requiring a deductive
you can't go wrong with either one of
these affordable flagships as they both
offer commendable amounts of value with
that said you want to consider the honor
rate for its smaller form factor better
camera and IR blaster
if those features aren't as important to
you and you'd rather have a better audio
experience better battery life and a
better software experience you want to
take a closer look at the ZTE axon 7
