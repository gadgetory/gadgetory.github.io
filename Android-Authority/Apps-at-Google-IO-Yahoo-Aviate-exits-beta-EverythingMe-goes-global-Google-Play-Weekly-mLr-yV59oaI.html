Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to another episode of
Google Play weekly we have a whole bunch
of news to get to this week so let's get
to it first up this week we're going to
talk about a huge update for google play
services and a little bit about google
fits let's do Google fit first because
that's something that's been announced
yet but it's not quite out yet with
Google fit there will be a set of api's
that let developers create more
comprehensive fitness and health apps
that work on phones tablets and
wearables there will be fun features
like heart rate monitor support on
devices that support that and more but
we won't know much more than that until
it has been released oh and google owns
a purified now so that's something that
happened by far the bigger news is the
google play services update to version
5.0 was a mammoth update that includes
things like the ability to split
payments between wallet and debit card
app indexing wearable stuff mobile ads
and in-app purchases updates google cast
drive updates and a whole lot more
arguably the biggest is the google play
games update which now includes things
like quests saved games and game
profiles if you want to try out sailfish
OS then maybe you should give Jolla
launcher a try the application has begun
alpha testing which means we can see a
release sometime later this year if you
have a nexus 4 or a nexus 5 you can get
in on the ground floor of this all you
have to do is email Jolla dash launcher
at Jolla calm and they'll send you the
link to try it out next week but you
will have to submit bug reports and help
out in return this could be really cool
I'm one of those people who believes the
more experiences that are available the
better android is and if we get a
sailfish OS experience than hell yeah
why not at Google i/o this year a new
standard design for applications was
announced and it's called it material
design and frankly it's pretty awesome
some have said it looks a little too
colorful and childish but frankly jelly
bean and Ice Cream Sandwich had only two
colors so a little extra color is nice
the new design pays attention to the
details a lot more and if you want a
sneak peek as to what it'll look like
just look at the Google+ app because
that's pretty much the material design
in action we're sure there will be more
about material design as more apps get
released so stay tuned because there
will be more
even though Google i/o is this week it
did not get in the way of the usual
Wednesday update for google apps and
this week it was google search the
update contained one glorious new
feature and that's the ability to use
the phrase ok Google on almost any
screen you'll have to have google play
services 5 point 0 which we talked about
earlier but otherwise it seems to work
well for those who have gotten it so far
a nifty thing that was noticed was that
there may be the ability to say ok
Google with the screen off as long as
the phone is plugged in and charging
based on the wording of the instructions
but that has not been confirmed yet in
our last bit of news this week sid
meier's civilization revolution 2 was
announced and this time it's coming to
android fans of the civilization games
are currently jumping for joy because
the first iteration made its way to iOS
and even windows phone but not Android
that will not be the case with the
sequel is reportedly due out on july
second on iOS and then according to
reports soon afterward for android if
you're a fan of the civilization games
keep an eye out because we'll cover it
when it lands so who wants to see some
trending applications as usual if you
want to check any of these applications
out you can find the links in the briton
companion which is in the video
description below first up this week is
the google cast receiver if you want a
chromecast or you're someone who wants
to cast to someone else's chromecast
then you will need this application like
i just said this allows you to cast your
phone to a chromecast without being on
the same Wi-Fi network as that
chromecast it's free and that's always
good next up is another application from
google i/o and this time it's android TV
remote app now this is fairly useless
for right now until android TV becomes a
thing that regular consumers can buy
however if you do plan on getting an
android TV or TV set-top box you'll
probably want this application to turn
your smartphone or tablet into a remote
oh and it's also free hey it's about
time Google slides finally came out with
this the entire suite of Google powered
office apps are now available if you use
google drive to any extent you should
probably have this app around just in
case it's not a large download but you
will need it to review presentations
inside of Drive I've never been a big
fan of turning one application that does
everything into for single apps to do a
lot of things but at least that process
is now complete
but we reviewed everything me launcher a
while back and conclude it to be a
competent and fun launcher not only has
it received a recent update for things
like stability improvements and events
up for the World Cup but it's also now
available worldwide if you live outside
of the United States and you've been
wanting to give this a try you can now
get your hands on this free launcher
speaking of launchers a v8 has finally
left beta and it's been given a new
branding as Yahoo a v8 launcher you no
longer need an invite code to use the
launcher and it's also been updated with
some calendar add-ons and new favorite
people feature and another new feature
called daily delight which is sort of a
sleep tracker it's free and it's finally
available to all so go check it out once
