brought to you by domain.com so you know
that feeling when you've lost your phone
you've searched for it but you can't
find it what's the word for that that's
the word now most of you already know
that if you have Android device manager
installed you can use that to locate
your phone but what if you could just
type into Google search find my phone
and it would find your phone in search
results fun or scary
of course we've all been there we've all
lost our phone at some point but
thankfully there's a number of Find My
Phone type solutions that make locating
your phone a breeze including the
Android device manager of course getting
into the device manager requires a few
steps such as typing in your address or
selecting it from a bookmark menu but
what if you could just simply type find
my phone into Google and Google would
work its magic you can now simply type
find my phone in Google and Google will
bring up a card in search that will
allow you to find your phone and give
you the choice of ringing it you still
need to have the Android device manager
location services set up on your phone
for this method to work but it is
certainly a quicker way to find your
phone so the Galaxy s6 and the s6 edge
have been out for a little while and
we're getting some interesting reports
about the response industry sources from
Korea reports that the sales of the
Samsung Galaxy s6 edge are much higher
than anticipated with supply now likely
unable to keep up with demand
currently the s6 edge accounts for
approximately 50% of all galaxy s6 model
shipments worldwide according to
industry insiders which is far
surpassing the market estimates of 20 to
30 percent of galaxy s6 sales in Korea
combined s6 and s6 edge pre-orders reach
300,000 units this could possibly put it
on track to become the most popular
galaxy handset yet however Samsung
admits that it has failed to make
accurate predictions about the s6 and s6
edge sale volumes which may result in
some retailers being left out of stock
in the near future
Samsung estimates that the s6 and s6
edge sales could reach 70 million but
let's talk about news that we received
about the s6 and s6 edge battery
consumption
if you own a Galaxy s6 or s6 edge or a
number of other recent Samsung devices
head over to the Google Play Store and
select my apps menu there should be an
update available for an application
called Samsung push service if you have
an update available be sure to install
it according to Samsung's changelog
Samsung has applied patches to reduce
data usage and power consumption now if
you look in the article linked up below
there's an article from an android
authority staffer where he talks about
how he tweaked and optimize his s6 is
battery over for days he was able to get
up to 24 hours of battery life be sure
to check that out now let's talk about
the new flagship on the block
specifically the Huawei p8 the Huawei p8
the ascend branding has been dropped is
a five point two inch full HD 1080p
display octa-core 64-bit Curren 935
processor and a 13 megapixel rear camera
the IPS display offers really sharp
contrast and vibrant colors look
fantastic even in sunlight above the
display is an 8 megapixel front-facing
snapper capable of capturing Full HD
1080p video which also comes with
Huawei's Beauty level feature to
accentuate your facial features the
Huawei p8 comes in two flavors
the standard version is expected to cost
499 pounds before taxes and subsidies
and offers 16 gigabytes of internal
storage and three gigabytes of RAM in
two exclusive colors the titanium gray
and mystic champagne while the premium
version will cost 599 pounds with 64
gigabytes of storage three gigabytes RAM
and two other exclusive colors carbon
black and prestige gold this multiple
storage strategy is one we're seeing
other manufacturers adopt but unlike
other flagships the p8 comes with a
microSD expansion slot allowing you to
expand the storage by up to 128
gigabytes the micro SD card slot doubles
up as a secondary SIM card slot allowing
you to use either 2 nano Sims
both with 4G or a single nano SIM and a
micro SD card remember yesterday I said
that I wouldn't choose my company's name
until I was certain I could get the
dot-com that's because from a business
perspective I don't want to give free
try
to the person who does own the dot-com
dot-com matters when you buy domain
names from domain.com you immediately
get the power to control what people
find when they search for you online and
no domain name extensions tell your
story with the same amount of trust like
it does with a.com or.net domain name
dot-com and dotnet domain name
extensions and jet credibility and your
online presence and who doesn't want
more credibility and you can also say

army my name is Jace love to connect
with you right here on Google+ or
Twitter or in the comments below now
yesterday I talked about how the oneplus
one is still hard to get now I know like
hundred of you told me in the comments
that you still can buy it without an
invite every Tuesday that's right but
come on it's still hard to get I know
why they're doing it they're trying to
create artificial scarcity and thereby
build demand but the dominant narrative
at least among the press is that the
phone is hard to get it's difficult to
get not a great marketing plan but don't
forget about my brothers in Android Josh
Joe and the tech ninja Kevin Lana Chris
Gary Nash and Taylor all working super
hard to be your source for all things
