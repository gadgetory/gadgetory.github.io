we're gonna take a quick look at the
Google Play Store version 5.0 update so
let's get started the first thing you'll
notice is the colors have changed quite
a bit there is a more stark contrast
between the buttons the background and
other elements of the UI the colors are
also brighter and more vibrant and they
look really good whether or not it's an
improvement is based on opinion but I
think it looks a hell of a lot better
than it did before I'd even go so far as
to say it looks more mature than it did
before the hamburger menu has changed
quite a bit as well the icons along the
left side are now gray unless you're in
that category then the icon is green the
bottom options no longer have icons and
are just text now the actual hamburger
button on the top left is also larger
and pushed out further from the left
side of the screen also that animation
am i right Wyn browsing applications
you'll notice that the what's new change
log for the applications is now outlined
in green which very effectively
separates it from the rest of the app
description and it's a change that
should be applauded sometimes you have
to click read more to read it all and I
guess some people have had problems with
that for some reason but we can't
imagine it's very many that's really if
folks there doesn't appear to be a lot
of change but what changes they do make
radiates throughout the entire Google
Play experience if you want to get your
hands on the apk to install it yourself
we'll have that posted in the video
description below if you're running the
Android L preview we recommend you hold
off because there are reports that
things are going wrong for you folks as
always don't forget to subscribe to the
YouTube channel thanks for watching
everybody and have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
