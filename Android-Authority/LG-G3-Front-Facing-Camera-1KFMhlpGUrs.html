brought to you by the LG g3 well by now
we know about the rear facing camera on
the lg g3 which has the laser-guided
autofocus and also OAS plus optical
image stabilization that has been
enhanced for this new version of LG's
flagship smartphone but we're going to
take a look at the front-facing camera
now and show you some of the options and
modes and features that will allow you
to take even better selfies for your
self-portrait game we're going to start
off with the interface you know you see
here that the interface is pretty
simplistic you just have the elements on
the top and the bottom and I did trigger
the camera by just holding the volume
down button in order to easily get to it
so that's an easy way for you to get
straight to the camera for you to get a
picture off very easily and quickly but
if you wanted an even better interface
in terms of simplicity that is you can
hit the menu button right here on the
top right and now you just have a touch
to point a touch to focus and shoot
interface where you just have to tap
anywhere on the screen and there you go
you can actually tap with your thumb
right here makes it really easy to get a
shot off very quickly but there are some
features here that do greatly enhance
your selfie experience and we'll hit the
menu once take a look at those the first
one that is available well first you're
going to see the buttons here at the
bottom of the shutter button and also
the video recording button and 720p and
1080p footage is capable is available
rather a here in the front-facing camera
and it is an easy way for you to just
take a quick vlog for example if you do
like to record yourself doing anything
or just to take a nice video of you and
your friends using the front-facing
camera
but then right above it is a beauty mode
now the beauty mode is a slider right
here that goes from zero to eight and if
I bring it down to zero you will see the
features on my face a little bit better
you can see the wrinkles or otherwise
we're pretty young guys off you go on
too many wrinkles but as we bring the
slider up to eight you'll see that my
face gets a lot softer a lot of those
nuances in my face are now more or less
hidden but it's really just softening my
face in order to make it so that when I
take that photo there you go it is a
pretty soft photo that for some people
out there might be a little bit more
pleasing to the eye then if you have the
slider all the way down to zero I know
some people out there might find the
beauty mode very nice and it does come
with the LG g3 s front-facing camera but
I'll go ahead and just take you through
the settings now I'll hit the gear right
here and we have the HDR set to auto
right here and it does a pretty good job
of figuring out when it needs to trigger
in order to really make the subject that
might that may or may not be blown out
by a lot of light in the background if
it needs to expose the subject in a
better way you do of course have it set
to off or on but in this case Auto is
fine and in those situations not really
the one I'm in right now you need the
HDR on to make better use of the
exposure then it will do so after that
we have the settings for your formats we
have the picture at two megapixels which
is essentially a 1920 by 1080 resolution
photo or 1280 by 960 at one megapixel
for your pictures and like I said before
already the video capturing mode is able
to take 720 and 1080 p video there is a
pretty fun feature that comes in the
middle right here and it is the voice
shutter now you have these five words
right here that are able to trigger the
shutter to give you yet another way of
triggering the shutter for you to take
your picture and then even easier way
I'll go ahead and demonstrate that right
now
whiskey jeez smile
and LG and there you go turning it off
you'll see that the voice shutter is
really easy to use and just by saying
those words you'll be able to get a
picture off even easier than arguably
just tapping the screen in this
particular mode you have two very easy
ways of taking that photo after that you
do have a timer for three second or ten
seconds
countdowns are for you to get ready for
that particular picture when it goes off
at the end of that countdown but the
final mode that I'll show you how is a
gesture that allows you to take a selfie
in yet another way that is easy for you
that we don't have to worry about
fidgeting with your hand in order to get
the picture off and also it's just a
nice almost hands-free way of doing so
basically what you have to do is just
put your hand up to the screen and
you'll see that it already sees that my
hand is there nice and open and when I
make a fist it will create a three
second countdown that in that time I'll
be able to get ready and it will take
the shots so if I make a fist right now
oops there you go you see it's nice and
easy so if you were to just jump into
the camera and just bring your hand up
you will be able to have not only a
hands-free or rather a non fidgety way
of triggering the shutter button that is
way down there what you can also do is
you have that a little amount of time in
order for you to make it so that you can
set up the shot just the way you want it
to so we'll just go ahead and do that
one more time and actually if at any
point any of these pictures end up not
really looking the way you want because
of the lighting well without a flash on
the front-facing camera we end up having
to use the screen and that is the flash
option we have right here you'll see
this rim around here that has a soft
glow to it that will allow for the
lighting of your actual portrait to be
actually pretty good better than before
at the very least and after that we just
have to take the picture and there you
go and so there you have it for this
look at the front-facing camera of the
LG g3 now we already looked at the rear
facing camera but it's nice to know that
a great two megapixel camera is up front
to be able to take some great selfies in
an easy way a few very diff
easy ways as a matter of fact so stay
tuned for even more coverage of the LG
g3 we already have some great videos up
for you and also ones coming up like a
tips and tricks video for those of you
