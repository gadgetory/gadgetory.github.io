produce an manufacturer and as a result
of this it's pretty much everywhere in
every sector of the market the roomy ex
is an example of this current trend but
as a starting price around 260 pounds
here in the UK
what's it compromising on I mean it's
got to be compromising on something
right
well there are a few small issues like a
truly terrible vibration motor and the
speaker which is ear piercing lis tinny
but as an overall package they don't
hurt the device as much as you'd think
and we'll get onto that a little bit
later the display certainly isn't an
issue it's a really nice 1080p alert
child that gets bright and dim and
everything in between it's sharp and
clean looking with a natural color set
and it runs rings around the pocke phone
F one's woeful LCD it goes to show that
affordable phones can sport a good
screen the aforementioned
excellent hardware is similarly not an
area for concern it's smooth and curvy
rear plastic back may surprise you
because it looks and feels a lot like
glass I actually thought it was glass to
start with and know it's plastic it's
got this really cool pearlescent Sheen
to it and I think it just feels
fantastic if you just told me back in
2016 that this was a competitor to an
iPhone or a samsung note then I would
have believed you because it's crazy how
far we've come in a hardware design this
thing is a low end to mid-range
smartphone and it just looks stunning
the class external shell does cover up a
bit of a compromise on the inside
instead of a flagship Snapdragon 855
this thing uses the 710 which is an
exactly cutting edge although in my
opinion it really doesn't need to be
this chip benchmarks close to an 835 in
CPU performance and gaming at high
settings isn't a bother either it
definitely surprised me but this
mid-range chip just kind of does it the
rest of the device is SPECT fairly well
I'd say and it's becoming ever so common
for a device to have a minimum of 6
gigabytes of RAM these days and storage
doesn't seem to be an issue either
although you'll probably be using up
that storage quite quickly because one
this thing doesn't have external media
like a microSD expansion and to the
cameras pretty good ok ok is is probably
not a surprise to anyone that the I MX
586 equipped
smartphone could produce some decent
images but isn't that saying anything
about how smartphone hardware is so
cheap to produce when a phone that's a
quarter of the price of flagship
smartphones has a class Lee
Sonne IMX sensor in it sure there aren't
any wide-angle or telephoto lenses here
that extra lens on the back is actually
a top of a depth sensor but considering
this phone when fully spec'ed out cost
three hundred and ten pounds and that's
not bad the image processing is the
thing that lets this camera down the
most it tends to over saturate it tends
to make things look really unrealistic
and a little bit plastic and somewhat
like that but I don't and that kind of
sets the scene for the rest of the video
software the thing that runs the show
the reason you're able to use your smart
phone at all the main interaction point
software is important it's what you pay
for when you buy a high-end flagship
it's what makes oneplus devices so quick
iPhones so seamless and Galaxy phones
are so versatile so what happens when a
company skimps on the most important
part of a smart phone well you get color
OS imagine a phone released in 2019
shipping with such an old feeling
version of Android despite the fact this
algae running PI a phone that won't
close all active applications with the
one button that's actually meant to do
just that
a phone that despite feeling like a
class-leading piece of hardware
physically it seems to feel like more of
a toy as soon as you press that power
button that's what the real me X is and
it's the one crucial compromise let's
just quickly look at some examples of
when you really do pay for software the
pocket phone f1 + 1 + 60 sure the specs
are incredibly similar but the one plus
cost more because it's software is very
much heralded as one of the best on the
market or the pixel 3a with those specs
it doesn't look to be that good for the
money but that incredible software
allows it to compete with much more
powerful smartphones even ones that are
an order of magnitude better on paper
and then there's the real me X iPhone is
fantastic on paper but drops the ball in
one of the most important areas possible
I'm not saying that this phone isn't a
good one it has the latest flagship
camera sensor and X
display decent battery life doodles are
features a fantastic design but it feels
more like a platform that Roma's and
developers could use to create better
software and it just so happens to have
a semi user bull piece of software on
there right now you don't wanna keep it
on there and you're gonna replace it
with something different what you pay
for in a premium smartphone is the
software and from everything from the UI
all the way down to the camera
processing it's very clear that really
need to invest in this area in fact I
think that real me could learn a thing
or two from Asus just look at the
zenfone 6 compared to its predecessors
sure the hardware got pretty good but
you know what the real kicker was for
that phone the fact that that Asus
actively got rid of their bloated and
messy skin that no one liked and instead
stuck with the basics and just
sprinkling in their own features that
decision alone in my opinion is the
biggest thing the asus as our mobile
tech firm has ever made and what has
changed everyone's opinions on that one
brand and that one phone line if one day
real me just rinsed the software of all
the bloat applications and all the extra
rubbish that no one seems to care about
and just stuck stock software on this it
would do so well over here in the West
and that's a guarantee from me because
this hardware is really really good the
problem is the software and the problem
with that is that the software is the
most important thing in a smartphone and
that kind of wraps up this video in one
package the room X is a fantastic piece
of hardware let down by software the
most important thing and the real mix is
one crucial compromise I want to thank
