can call the 1+1 a daily driver
what with the invite system and actually
the ability to get the phone on Tuesdays
nowadays then you would know that it is
a pretty well designed phone especially
with the sandstone black material on the
back that is a premium feel for a $345
phone but for an extra $50 you can
replace the back with what is now
available a bamboo cover and that's
exactly what I'm about to do now because
it's Josh Berg our from Android
authority what's going on everybody
and my oneplus one right now looks like
this but soon after this video it will
look like this
oh yeah workshop angle so here is my
oneplus one currently with the sandstone
black that comes with the $349 Edition
obviously I haven't really been using it
too much on the daily as of late but
that's probably gonna change once I'm
done with this installation and we're
gonna go ahead and get started right now
just a quick unboxing of the actual
device itself or rather the accessory we
should call it the typical white and red
that the box has come in one plus-ones
style or oneplus of style go ahead and
slide it out and there is the bamboo
cover and here is what everything kind
of looks like now if you look at the
bamboo cover it has everything cut just
right but you'll notice here on the side
I remember correctly that the SIM card
slot right over here is a separate piece
now we have our instructions right here
to actually install the thing along with
a couple of tools that are available for
the installation this will separate the
back cover from the device frame itself
it's just this little guitar pick
looking thing that I'm going to be
poking and prodding all of the different
snaps out from the sides and then these
SIM card trays are over here oh there's
two of them oh that's awesome
so the SIM card tray is this one the
original one and I used to have to put
an adapter on my nano SIM card in order
for it to work in the oneplus one but
now there is a nano SIM tray
right here which actually makes it very
nice I don't have to use an adapter for
it but those are the tools that are
inside I will be going through these
instructions in a sec and we're going to
get started with this the other tools
that you are going to need come with
your 1+1 for the most part I have this
SIM tray tool right here that will pop
out the SIM tray and it's the first
thing I have to do here and then I'm
actually going to use a headphone jack
in order to pop up the first part of the
cover from here and then that blue tool
that you can see right here is going to
help me pop out all the other notches
the sandstone colored back is now
removed and we have access to the body
itself so there are the two covers so
you can see them side by side as
compared to the actual device itself and
you gonna see how the look is actually
changing quite a bit from here if you
know me already I love bamboo backing
this on my phones that's why I'm a big
fan of the Moto X and I use that on the
daily but now I'm going to have a bamboo
backing for my oneplus one now
installing the bamboo backing onto the
phone should be a matter of just
snapping it on which is great so I'm not
too worried about that removing the
sandstone cover however uh was a little
bit difficult but with the included tool
it finally kind of came out and it was
definitely a lot better than using like
a flathead screwdriver or your
fingernails god forbid but nonetheless I
wanted to take a quick look at the
insides of these two covers so you can
just sort of see the differences between
them one thing I will point out is that
the sandstone material does feel like
it's on the sides here but on the bamboo
cover you have bamboo on the back but on
the sides here it is a plastic lining
and of course the insides of both are
made of plastic so that's not much of a
surprise and really not that big a deal
I just thought I would mention that so
we're gonna put the sandstone aside and
it will probably sit in a drawer now
because now it's time to install the
bamboo one
and there you go after popping in the
replacement nano SIM tray over here on
the side I'm officially on my way having
this bamboo 1+1 in my possession and I'm
super excited to use it I love bamboo
backings on phones and right now the
Moto X and the oneplus one are the main
ones that have it especially if you
spend the $50 in order to get your
replacement backing to replace the
sandstone of the original oneplus one
and $50 is not that big of a cost to
have when you can change the look
dramatically of your phone I do have a
couple of remarks though the handling of
the phone itself is still mostly the
same the sandstone black still has a bit
of a better texture to it especially
when you have it sitting in one hand the
gripped feels just a little bit better
but not by to much and as far as the
look goes I will admit that that let's
say plastic lining around the bamboo
that separates it from the actual frame
of the phone is maybe a little bit
jarring you are expecting somewhat to
have a full bamboo backing but I
understand that that's not necessarily
the case but when you go from the bamboo
to the plastic and then you move over
more you also still have that metal sort
of frame around the screen so there's a
bit of a juxtaposition when it comes to
the look of this phone once you have
this bamboo cover on it's not a big deal
by any means but it is something that
you might notice that you basically have
well a three toned phone at this point
but nonetheless it still looks very nice
quite exquisite and I am going to enjoy
putting it on here testing out the
connectivity on this particular phone I
do see that I still get reception just
fine and the one thing that I knew I
really wanted to test out was whether or
not the end of see changes on here as
well well I tested it on my UE mega boom
and sure enough it was able to connect
to the speaker just flying using NFC and
then of course Bluetooth to get right
over so it looks like the connectivity
options are still going to remain the
same and you'll still have the same
experience when it comes to your oneplus
one experience on here so that does it
for this look and very quick review of
the bamboo style swab cover that oneplus
has made available now I did use an
invite in order to get it but according
to the website you don't necessarily
need to have an in
to get it for $50 off of their accessory
section in their store website so you
can pop over and buy it yourself if you
have a oneplus one and you just want to
change the look a little bit it is a
pretty drastic change from the sandstone
black but I think it's one that me at
least personally will really love so
