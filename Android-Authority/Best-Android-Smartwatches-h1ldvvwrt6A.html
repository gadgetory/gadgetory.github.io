market and you want to start with a
SmartWatch and you want to know which is
the best which is the most stylus which
is the most functional and which is the
best bang for your buck we're going to
give you our list of best Android
smartwatches so who currently owns the
SmartWatch crown well that's the Moto
360 and here's why it's sleek and
customizable the Moto 360 was one of the
first Android wear smartwatches
announced and while it took Motorola
more than a year to release it this
sleek circular device has been well
received featuring a large circular
screen that has a sleek brushed metal
build and several replaceable bands the
Moto 360 will look great on just about
any occasion on the inside the processor
is older than its competitors and the
battery is a little bit on the small
side
but still the Moto 360 will last a full
day of usage for all but the most active
users and you get wireless charging to
boot with a variety of cool watch faces
taking advantage of the round screen and
more launching all the time the Moto 360
is a great choice if style is your
biggest priority now for the more sporty
among you you may want to consider the
LG G watch are the other SmartWatch on
our list is the G watch R and as LG
loves to point out there's no cutout
here the full circular screen is
beautiful and everything will look nicer
thanks to the 245 pixels per inch note
that it's higher than moto 360 s while
the Moto 360 has a minimalistic flair
the G watch will appear to more fans who
like a sport watch feel with its beveled
engraved ring an aggressively sculpted
body the G watch are impresses through
its large battery and the Snapdragon
processor inside ensures steady
performance the device ships with a nice
leather strap also but if you don't like
that you can easily swap it out for the
standard 22 millimeter strap next up is
an option that many of you may not know
that much about and it's called the Asus
SmartWatch the Asus SmartWatch has been
one of the nicest surprises in the
Android wear ecosystem thus far thanks
to its good specs and stylish design
proving that you can make a rectangular
SmartWatch that doesn't look
with a smooth rounded two-tone metallic
body and a standard-size stitched
leather strap the Zen watch looks
sophisticated and timeless
there aren't any bells and whistles on
the hardware side however but Asus makes
it up with the software stack including
some nice watch faces and several
interesting Asus features like the
ability to double tap the screen to
launch a feature and all in all if you
don't want a round watch but you still
want style this looks like your best
option
now next up is the somewhat understated
Sony SmartWatch 3 runners hikers and
cyclists you can stop looking this is
the Android wear watch you need sony
used its own OS for the previous
generations but embraced android 4
SmartWatch 3 and we couldn't be happier
with that the Sony SmartWatch 3 stands
out through its onboard GPS module which
lets you track your activities without
needing a smartphone that weighs you
down just as easily you can connect a
pair of Bluetooth sports headphones and
enjoy your music straight from the watch
available in black white pink and lime
your SmartWatch 3 looks as sporty as it
acts the rubber strap is the non
standard but at least you can swap it
out in a few seconds without any tools
the watch is ip68 water-resistant and
the screen is transflective LCD which
means you can read it more easily in the
Sun all in all it's a great choice for
the active user now for those of you who
are a little bit more budget conscious
you may want to consider the LG G watch
one of the first to reference
smartwatches announced in the spring the
LG G watch has conceded the spotlight -
its round sibling the G watch R but
don't let that fool you the unassuming G
watch is still a perfectly capable
SmartWatch that gives you the exact same
functionality like the other entries on
our list the G watch looks well playing
and it's up to you to decide how you
feel about an all black slab with a
black rubber strap it's also devoid of
any real bells and whistles but with the
G watch lakhs and flashiness it makes up
for in price you can get it for $159 at
many outlets but we've seen it as low as
$80 as a part of a limited-time promo
perfect
the budget-minded buyer thanks for
watching and word I mean my name is Jace
I'd love to connect with you right here
on Google+ or Twitter you don't forget
about my brothers in andra Josh John the
tech ninja Kevin lawn and Chris Gary
Nash all working real hard to deliver
the best Android content on the web I
did tell you that I would use this part
of the show to answer some questions
that were in the comments and a number
of people in past a week or two have
been asking about the music I've been
using in the shows well there's a whole
bunch of music but they're specifically
talking about a song called iPad unbox
magic and the other one is called Solace
and they're both by a composer named
Andrew girl or her and I've linked up
his SoundCloud page in below he's
fantastic
I use it with permission he's a
fantastic guy and go check out his music
because he's really talented I shall see
you next week on Android community
