was really on its downward spiral Huawei
comes up with these two good performers
it's Joshua Vergara what's going on
everybody and this is the huawei media
Pad m5 in a couple of different sizes
ever since Netflix allowed downloadable
content while we noticed that their
tablet sales were kind of on the
up-and-up so they have a new version
here that comes in two different
versions the 8.4 inch and the pro
version at ten point eight inches both
of them sports 2.5 D glass and come in
at quad HD resolution that's an IPS
panel in both at 2560 by 1600 resolution
the pro series does come with a keyboard
which allows for a little bit more
functionality along with the Huawei pen
that allows for stylists like
experiences what is nice is that the
media consumption experience is really
being considered well you have our dual
speakers on the 8.4 inch or four
speakers on the 10.8 inch tablets all
powered by Harman Kardon and they sound
pretty great so if you are watching
Netflix quite a lot or even just YouTube
or any other media on these tablets
you'll have a great audio experience
and all of that is powered by the cure
in 960 and is rocking emui 8.0 as far as
battery life goes if you are doing those
binge watching sessions then the 8.4
inch tablet will get up to 11 hours of
1080p video playback
while the 10.8 inch tablet will get
about 10 hours but it takes less than 3
hours to get a full charge on these
large batteries for both of these
tablets as far as design goes there's
really not a whole lot to say about
these two tablets other than the fact
that they have that form factor there is
a nice screen on the front of both of
these devices but there's plenty of
bezel around it which could or could not
be a bad thing depending on what your
handling is like and both of them do
come with cameras and maybe you are
going to be the kind of person that
doesn't use the camera very often but at
least it is there if you want to take a
quick snap of whatever's in front of you
while you're enjoying your media while
we also took into consideration some
gaming in here as the Kirin 960 takes
the processing power and diverts it to
the gaming that's being done and
actually blocked social apps so that
you're not disturbed while you're in the
middle of a big sesh
but of course whether or not you're
going to want the media pad m5 comes
down to whether or not you use tablets
at all and that's actually a question
you wanted to pose to you do you use
tablets in your daily and let us know if
you do what'd you use them for
and is the huawei media pad m5 a
consideration that you would make
overall it's nice to see that tablet
still have a bit of a space inside of
the Android ecosystem but overall we
think that the media pad m5 is a worthy
addition to anyone who wants a big
screen experience especially for media
consumption keep it tuned to Andrew
authority for even more about Huawei's
announcements during MWC and even more
from over world congress here in
barcelona keep it tuned to yo for even
more and head on over to Andrew 30.com
