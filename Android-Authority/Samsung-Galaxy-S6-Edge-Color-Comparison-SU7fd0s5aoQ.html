Andrew authority and we are hanging out
at the Samsung booth taking another look
at the Samsung Galaxy s6 edge and we
just wanted to quickly show you guys the
colors that are available with the s6
edge and there's actually four different
colors here but I only have three of
them but the four colors that you get
with the s6 edge is a white pearl black
sapphire gold platinum and green emerald
so let's just take a quick look at the
green emerald first because this is
probably the most standout color and the
more one of the more unique colors with
the s6 edge so here's the green one here
and as you can see it has that
translucent element to it which gives it
a very nice unique look and this is
probably one of my favorite ones here
just because green happens to be a
favorite color of mine and this just
looks really really nice but here is a
gold one if you want to get a little bit
more fancy so it's really it sort of
sticks out quite a bit so it's very
flashy and if you like that sort of
flashy look the gold one might be for
you and the gold one actually looks
pretty cool too
all these colors look really nice but if
you want you really flashy looking
galaxy s6 edge this would be probably
the best one to get and then if you want
to go to more traditional you have the
black sapphire here but the black
sapphire it looks different from your
normal black phone just because again
that translucent element gives it a very
different look but again it just looks
it looks really really nice and it's
probably one of the more traditional
colors that most people are going to get
because it's very simple and very clean
again you have the white pro as well
which I will show to you guys in a
b-roll shot but it's basically just your
standard white phone but we just want to
show you guys all the different colors
of the galaxy s6 edge let us know down
below in the comments what you guys
think is your favorite color what color
do you guys plan on getting one the s6
edge comes out let us know down below
but this has been another quick look of
the galaxy
the s6 edge just taking a quick look on
all the different colors that are
available but thank you so much for
watching and we are still here at Mobile
World Congress 2015 so stay tuned for
the rest of the coverage that we have
coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
