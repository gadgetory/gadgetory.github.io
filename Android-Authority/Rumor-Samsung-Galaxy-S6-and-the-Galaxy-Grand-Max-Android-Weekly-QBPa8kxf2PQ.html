that galaxy grand Max and even rumors
surrounding the galaxy s6 but that's not
what's got me really excited CS coming
to town SI es dama de can come into town
but until that actually happens we
should start with the rumors surrounding
the galaxy s6 and you need to take this
with a massive pound of salt i'm talking
like whoa whoa ah to wake up in the
morning earlier last week Iranian tech
site to rungy leaked alleged photos of
the upcoming Galaxy s6 though the photos
are not of the best quality we do see
the alleged Samsung device posing next
ds4 and the s5 as well as shots of the
back and front of the device taking a
look at the photos we see the size
compared to the s4 in the s5 giving us a
pretty good indication of the potential
size of the device additionally though
the photos are not the most clear the s6
looks to be sporting an aluminum or
metal chassis as well as multiple
different color options we've heard
rumors of the company bringing a
metallic design to the phone so these
images are consistent with those claims
it also appears to be slightly bigger
now if you guys remember about 11 months
ago I was knee-deep in trying to sort
out the rumors surrounding the galaxy s5
so you can expect over the next six
weeks it is going to be crazy but take
it with a big grain of salt maybe half
of them will be wrong someone will be
convincing some of them won't be we were
really underwhelmed by the s5 so I've
tempered my hopes for the s6 so were you
a fan of the galaxy alpha bad news for
you despite the new look and higher-end
build materials of the galaxy alpha the
handset has not proven very popular in
Korea and the prices have been greatly
reduced over the past month to address
the issue the Galaxy a5 will be priced
at about 400,000 kwon which is about
three hundred sixty dollars us now for
what it's worth an industry insider
this the Galaxy alpha will be produced
until the materials currently in
inventory are used up its production
will end by early februari of this year
now that doesn't mean that Samsung is
not trying to hit a home run with new
devices we got some new news regarding
the galaxy a7 and the galaxy grand max
the rumored new addition to the line is
the galaxy a7 and according to a
magazine advert by Sam mobile the a7
will be a 5.2 inch device and not the
previously rumored 5.5 inch the same
magazine advert also has information
about a totally new phone called the
galaxy grand max the a7 is rumored to
have an octa-core processor perhaps an
Exynos 5433 or possibly a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 615 two gigabytes of ram 16
gigabytes of internal storage a microSD
card slot and a 13-megapixel rear-facing
camera and a 5-megapixel front-facing
camera it will also include a 2500
malaya Bauer battery as for the galaxy
grand max this is a new model for the
galaxy grand series according to the
magazine advert it has a 5.2 inch
display at one point two quad-core
processor 1.5 gigabytes of ram 16
gigabytes of internal storage and a
microSD card slot there is also a
13-megapixel rear-facing camera and a
5-megapixel front-facing camera now I
know what some of you may be thinking
you're thinking Jace just a couple weeks
ago you reported that Samsung claimed
that they would reduce the amount of
models that were producing aren't they
doing the exact opposite well perhaps
they are ah but you should remember that
Samsung at least in the world of Android
is dominant I mean crazy dominant HTC
and sony are distant second and third so
Samsung is doing something right even if
it is just the marketing thanks for
watching android army my name is Jace I
would love to connect with you right
here on Google+ or Twitter I read all my
comments and replies and I respond to as
many as I can you don't want to miss a
show that's going to be right there I'm
going to publish it tomorrow or the next
day when it's done you can click on that
and watch it it's five hopeful features
we have for Android in the coming year
and you don't want to forget about my
brothers and aunt right over here Josh
Joe and the tech ninja Kevin lon and
Chris Guerra Nash all working real hard
to deliver the best android content on
the web we've got a lot coming up for
CAS or CES you don't want to miss that I
should talk to you next week on android
weekly the biometric sensors so your
wife and baby we can know how your heart
like you like the other biometric
sensors I do not yet have the biometric
nipples but perhaps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
