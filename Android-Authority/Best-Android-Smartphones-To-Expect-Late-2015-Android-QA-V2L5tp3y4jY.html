brought to you by domain.com now it has
got to be the number-one pastime of
every tech nerd out there and that is
geeking out about the new gadgets coming
out just around the corner so what are
some of the best new phones coming out
in the second half of 2015 let's start
off with this samsung galaxy note5
recent rumors suggest unlike the note 4
and Note edge of last year this year's
note 5 and Note edge to won't be exactly
alike this time around talking
specifically about the note 5 the device
will reportedly have a 2k or 4k Super
AMOLED display along with the x 10 7422
processor and an in-house modem it's
also possible the note 5 could offer up
an all-in-one he pop solution this means
that the CPU GPU storage modem and RAM
will all be combined into a single chip
we haven't heard any recent rumors
regarding the note 5s chassis though the
recent switched to glass and metal and
the galaxy s6 makes us wonder if Samsung
will switch to more premium materials
with the upcoming phablet the switch to
an all glass design is bittersweet on
one hand the phone feels much more
premium but on the other hand Samsung
needed to do away with the removable
battery when it ditched the plastic in
the s6 Samsung has been experiencing a
ton of feedback both positive and
negative from die hard fans so we're not
sure what the company plans to do it's
also possible that the note 5 could
feature real leather back similar to
what we saw on the LG g4 speaking about
LG let's talk about the LG g4 note LG
filed for a trademark back in December
for products called the G pen and the G
scroll while the descriptions for these
filings were pretty vague there has been
some speculation that Japan could be a
special stylus designed to compete with
Samsung's s-pen from the note series as
for the G scroll it seems plausible that
this could be some kind of software
feature that works in conjunction with
the Jeep n not many details have been
outed regarding these two filings quite
yet we've also heard that LG is planning
to launch a smartphone in h2 of this
year that will stand above the g-series
whether the company's referring to a
phablet or not it seems entire
possible that the smartphone will have a
large screen seeing as how LG just
recently filed a patent for the name LG
g4 note now let's talk about the
hardcore geek fan favorite and that is
the motorola x 2015 unlike other
offerings from LG and samsung Motorola's
recent flagship devices have featured a
different philosophy instead of trying
to cram the very best specifications on
the market and the phone the 2013 and
2014 Moto X devices were somewhat
reserved on the spec front most likely
because Motorola wanted to keep the cost
down to a price point that more users
could afford combining decent
specifications a more affordable price
point the customization options of moto
maker and a vanilla Android experience
the Moto X 2014 was one heck of a
smartphone so what could change for
Motorola in the next flagship well
according to a reddit account by the
name of Android leaks a new mysterious
Motorola device has been spotted being
tested on verizon's network near the
Chicago area the phone is running
android 5.1 lollipop and sports a quad
HD display another rumor claims that the
new Moto X will have a 5.2 inch display
a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor 4
gigabytes of RAM a 16 megapixel rear
facing camera and a 5-megapixel
front-facing camera and a very
respectable 30 280 milliamp hour battery
both of these sources are relatively
unknown when talking about leaks so
please take this list with a grain of
salt now I know that many of you are
going to be excited about this let's
talk about the oneplus 2 while there is
very little known about the 1+2 Carl PI
recently revealed a pretty big hint on
twitter by asking how much people would
be willing to pay for a Snapdragon 810
powered one plus two he further hinted
that the company might be aiming at a
price point of around four hundred
dollars more recently cyanogen at 1 plus
have parted ways so we can expect that
the 1+2 to feature the company's own
in-house oxygen OS so now what about
Sony's new global flagship well the
Xperia z4 looks almost identical to the
z3
will it ever be available outside of
Japan sony has kept mum on its plans for
an international release for the Xperia
z4 leading to rumours that Sony might
have a more substantial global flagship
in mind with the Xperia z4 staying a
Japanese exclusive so what will Sony
deliver next it depends on which rumor
you get behind a new report from Evan
blast suggest that the z4 will make its
way outside of Japan and is headed to
verizon in the United States on the
other hand report service last month
claiming that Sony would resurrect the
Xperia P series creating a unique
flagship spec device with a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 810 processor 3 gigabytes of
ram 32 gigabytes of internal storage at
5.2 inch full HD display and a 12.1
megapixel rear camera a 5.1 front-facing
camera and a positively huge 4240
milliamp hour battery now I don't have a
lot of faith in that happening at all
but we do got to talk about the growing
giant that is shall me specifically the
Xiaomi me five among three other
handsets displayed on the road map
shamis me 5 handset is set to launch
sometime around November of this year
it's the most high-end device out of the
bunch featuring a 5.2 inch quad HD
display a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820
processor and a 20-point 2 megapixel
rear facing camera we aren't entirely
sure that the late can be trusted one
hundred percent so we need to take this
spec list with a very big grain of salt
now there's a whole slew of rumors
surrounding a possible new Nexus device
by wall way whether that's a nexus 4
Nexus 5 or some sort of Nexus device we
don't know but it is very likely and
that brings a whole new level of
excitement but I gotta tell you now that
I have a phone with a micro SD card slot
with all this storage I don't know Nexus
device kind of wouldn't satisfy me with
just 32 gigabytes what do you guys think

phone are you looking forward to the
most in the comments I'd like to hear it
