hindi the android authority app guy
today we revisit 1991 Square Enix has
rereleased the classic JRPG Final
Fantasy 4 for Android and after the
intro we'll take a closer look at it
let's talk about the biggest change
first which is the graphics gone are the
days of flat world maps and gone are the
days of flat out-of-focus sprites Square
Enix has revamped the graphics in a big
way and to put it bluntly it's much much
better than it used to be it's difficult
to pinpoint specifics when the whole
thing has been redone like this it's
very similar to the Nintendo DS remake
in terms of graphics except on Android
it's a little bit sharper so think of
all the graphics and animations you'll
remember from the SNES days and forget
about them because they're gone now
one thing we do want to point out are
specific things you'll see changed from
the old SNES version secret tunnels no
longer show up as grey instead of pitch
black so when navigating off screen to
find treasure or secret passages you
will no longer be guided by the slightly
off black giveaway as we saw in the SNES
version gameplay is also a lot different
however most of this is because you're
playing on a touchscreen rather than a
console controller you still have your
classic commands like attack black magic
white magic items and character specific
talents you just have to scroll and
click with your finger instead of using
a d-pad there are a few changes from the
core experience Square Enix brings back
the augment system from the DES remake
throughout the game you'll come across
augments that you can equip for
additional command options things like
auto potion which will make a character
automatically use a potion when they
take damage some of the playable
characters also come with skills that
you didn't see in the SNES version yang
has the brace command forum has the cry
command palem has bluff and edward has a
couple of additional bar techniques so
if you're coming straight from the SNES
US version you'll see a lot of stuff you
haven't seen before the last major
changes we'll mention in terms of
controls are the new battle commands you
can now choose Auto battle to have every
character perform an auto task as
defined by you the player this is great
for level grinding there are also
buttons nearby for skipping character
turns and escaping you may also notice
all the name changes names now follow
the naming conventions of newer Final
Fantasies I stood has turned into
Blizzard carrot too
turn into Kira etc this includes enemies
as M's have now become goblins and
bosses like me lon the Archfiend you
fight on Mount ordeals is now scar
meglio for those who are fans of the
original story you'll be delighted to
hear that there are now voiced over
cutscenes it's not amazing voiceovers
but considering that when we played this
game before we were reading these long
dialogues ourselves it's definitely a
pleasant change and they're actually fun
to watch when you get right down to it
the game is at its core the same as it's
always been
characters all know essentially the same
skills the world maps and dungeons are
still laid out exactly the same
including all the hidden areas and once
you get used to the touchscreen controls
even battles and strategies are the same
so here's what we liked about Final
Fantasy for probably the biggest thing
we liked is that Square Enix didn't
butcher the Final Fantasy for experience
the wonderful story and music remains
wonderful despite the additions and
graphical enhancements while they did
add some dialogue and the cutscenes are
essentially all brand new the classic
moments remain and longtime fans will
feel right at home we also loved the
Auto battle system any longtime final
fantasy fan knows there are points where
level grinding is pretty much necessary
while we wish there had been a way to
speed things up like the battles we're
certainly glad that Auto battle makes
the repetitive clicking go away lastly
the graphics and cutscenes were a nice
touch it would have been easy to just
pump out a pure SNES remake and pop it
into the Google Play Store however
Square Enix went that extra mile to
bring an updated experience that appeals
to both new and old Final Fantasy fans
so what didn't we like well the battles
feat for one thing while fighting feels
much better in the new version thanks to
the graphics the battle speed remains as
slow as ever since random encounters
happen pretty frequently this means you
spend a lot of time in battles at points
when you really don't want to don't get
us wrong it's great for leveling up but
we wish we could set the battle speed a
little higher also some of the new
dialogue sucks while the old dialogue
wasn't exactly going to win any awards
some of the new dialogue especially the
stuff spoken by the voice-over actors is
a little bland and unimaginative
thankfully it doesn't happen very often
overall we were quite happy with Square
Enix on this one people who have been
playing the game off and on for 20 years
will get everything they loved about the
original plus some new content new
the Final Fantasy series can experience
what we old fans had loved about the
earlier games in the series without the
terrible graphics it comes out a lofty
price tag of $15.99 us this is pretty
high for a game that came out 22 years
ago while we can't define the high price
tag we will say that nostalgia dictates
that 16 bucks is a small price to pay to
play this classic again still though we
understand if some people think it's a
little too high so the question is would
we recommend it the answer is yes we
would even if it's a little expensive
this is one of the RPGs that helped
define the genre and laid the groundwork
for more popular titles over the next
decade it's a classic and classics are
always worth picking up once again I'm
