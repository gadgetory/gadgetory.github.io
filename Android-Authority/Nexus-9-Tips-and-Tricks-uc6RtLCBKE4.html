right
actually yes it is my name is Taylor
Martin you are watching Android
authority and here are some Nexus 9 tips
and tricks so the first tip I'm going to
go over is something that's not exactly
specific to the Nexus 9 and that's going
to be a common theme among all of these
tips and tricks because lollipop brought
on a lot of new features and depending
on the hardware you may not have access
to some of those with the Nexus 9 you
can actually just double tap to wait
that's a feature that's specific to the
Nexus 9 and a few new devices but not on
older hardware that's helpful because if
the tablet is laying on a table all you
have to do is to tap the screen twice
rather than reach for the power button
the power button is a little difficult
to press on this because it's one so
small and too on the side of the tablet
and you actually kind of need two hands
sometimes to hit that power button if
you're not holding it it makes more
sense to double tap to wait and once you
get into the habit of double tapping to
wake a device you won't want to hit a
power button again the next tip is from
the home screen you can actually
activate Google now if you say okay
Google it will pop-up and as you can see
start a search that's pretty cool that
but if you go into the Google now
settings and select the voice submenu
you can actually toggle on the ability
to say okay Google and wake the tablet
from standby to perform a Google search
next is guest mode this is helpful
because you can actually share your
tablet or phone with someone who needs
to look something up very quickly but
with the tablet it makes even more sense
because you can actually have multiple
users rather than just guests so with a
tablet you're actually more likely to
share your tablet with someone say your
family your daughter your kids whatever
it may be you can share that with them
and keep them out of your personal
information while allowing them to still
play games and other things to activate
guest mode simply pull down the
notification shade tap the icon that is
your face profile image maybe I don't
know what it's called exactly but tap
the picture and you can select guest
mode you can also go into settings and
selecting users and switch between the
different guests or user accounts there
next is screen pinning now this is
another lollipop feature but this one is
helpful if you want to give someone your
tablet to do one specific thing so if
they need to look something up you can
lock them inside chrome or lock them
inside the dialer or one specific app to
activate screen pinning go into the app
you want to lock someone into and then
you hit the overview
scroll down to the bottom of that very
first card and hit a pin icon now you
can't pin an app that you aren't
currently in so to lock someone into an
app you have to go to that app first to
get out of screen pinning simply hold
the overview button and enter your
password if you activated that you can
do it without a password but if you
don't secure it with a password someone
can simply leave the pinning mode by
simply holding the overview button next
is smart lock this is a new a feature of
lollipop that allows you to lock your
device with a pin or password but not
have to enter that pin or password all
the time it's one of the most annoying
things about securing your device is
getting into your device but if you
connect it to say Android wear or other
Bluetooth devices NFC tags or you set a
home address you can quickly bypass your
pin or password by setting those as
trusted devices or locations you can
also set a trusted face so your face or
say your wife's face who ever wants to
get into your tablet and you don't mind
them getting into your tablet you can
register their face as a trusted face so
when they hold their tablet up to their
face it simply unlocks and it does this
from the lock screen automatically if
you have trusted face set up next is a
hidden game and Google does this with
every major Android release this one is
basically a flappy bird clone to get to
the game you go to settings go to about
tablet select the Android version number
and just keep tapping it and after about
five taps the lollipop logo will pop up
if you tap that five times will change
colors and then you hold on the lollipop
and you get to the game sounds like a
lot of steps but once you get to it it's
a pretty fun game just like flappy bird
but you have little Andy who's popping
up and down going through lollipops
instead of green tubes now on the Nexus
9 battery life is not exactly the best
it's not the worst in the world but the
standby time is absolutely horrible one
way you can fight that is by going into
the battery settings by pulling down
your notification shade and tapping on
the battery icon that will shoot you
into the battery settings from there if
you hit the action overflow button
select battery settings you can toggle
on a battery saver now this battery
saver mode will kind of limit what your
tablet does but you can also
automatically turn this on after your
device gets to 15 or 5% it will
automatically turn on the background to
save you some time and give you a little
bit extra juice another feature is
editing the notifications from the
notification shade so if you have an app
that keeps giving you notifications that
is annoying you and you don't want those
simply law
press on that notification hit the
information button on the right and that
will shoot you in the notification
settings from there you can actually
block the app notifications you can set
it as a priority notification or you can
say that it has sensitive information
and that sensitive information if you
select that it will block out any
sensitive information on your lock
screen when your phone or tablet is
locked
also in lollipop is the ability to turn
off all notifications set only priority
notifications to come through or all so
to get the benefit of actually having
priority mode you actually need to go
into your settings and set up priority
notifications to do that go to settings
scroll down to sound and notifications
go to app notifications and from there
you get a list of every application that
is on your tablet and you go into each
one and you can select priority for
things that you want to come through
even though you've silenced your phone
now this one may not be a huge secret to
most people but I actually recently
discovered it
if you pull down the notification shade
you obviously have quick settings right
there if you tap like Wi-Fi it will
toggle your Wi-Fi if you tap Bluetooth
it will toggle the Bluetooth but if you
hit the words that are below to
horizontal line it will actually shoot
you into Wi-Fi setting rather than
toggling Wi-Fi same goes for Bluetooth
now the ones below that don't actually
have that ability because they don't
have that horizontal divider line so if
you hit those it's actually only gonna
toggle the setting rather than jump you
into anything there's no way to quickly
jump into those but for Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth you can quickly jump to those
next and this one's kind of specific to
the Nexus 9 because it is not very
common on tablets you have a flashlight
and that's also a toggle in the
notification shade simply pull it down
hit the flashlight icon and the LED on
the back will light up that's not very
common on tablets because most tablets
if they have a rear camera don't usually
have rear flash but this one does so you
do have that ability to have a
flashlight I don't know if you'd ever
need that but if you do it's good to
know it's there finally use the search
bar it sounds pretty straightforward and
simple but I think people underestimate
the power of this search bar it is the
power of Google but it also works like
and you're gonna hate me for this
spotlight in iOS simply tap the search
bar and if you want to find an app
that's on your tablet and you don't want
to have to search for it through the app
drawer simply start typing what it is
and it will pop up after like one or two
keystrokes you can also search for
things on Google other information on
your device like contact
and it's just an all-around good tool to
use and I think people just simply don't
use it enough before the user experience
was just kind of okay we would tap the
search bar and then it would shoot you
into the Google search application now
when you tap it it does the search
straight from the home screen so it's
not that radical of a change but it does
definitely feel different and it makes
the user experience a lot better that's
gonna do it for this tips and tricks
