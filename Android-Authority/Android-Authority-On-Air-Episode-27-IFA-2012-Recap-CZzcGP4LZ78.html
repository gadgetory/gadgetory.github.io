original android hangout show on google+
I'm dare cross I'm Scott Anderson this
week we have returning special guest dan
Charlton of TM it kernels you may or may
not be running one of his Colonels right
now if you are on a custom rom and you
have an HTC device chances are you may
know who he is welcomed and thanks for
stopping by again always good to be here
so Scott what are we yeah can about this
week well we got a lot of different
types of app updates we also have new
and upcoming devices from IFA in Germany
we also have some ICS and jelly bean
updates and also some leaks and then
we're going to be finishing up with some
Pat more information all right good
let's dive into some of these app
updates here before we talk about all
the devices that dropped this week at
IFA so the google play store no harm our
bread and butter had a little bit of an
update this week recommendations which
is great so now you can see
recommendations personalized for you
based on apps that are popular with
people that have downloaded them popular
based on usage popular based on the area
that you're in is also popular with
users have similar use habits such as
yourself as well as in the past know
people you can +1 apps and then so forth
and those are all tied into
recommendations it's very nice i i i
noticed it then checked it out i was
able to see you know whoa i use for
example fancy widgets and look it's tell
me it's recommending you know beautiful
widgets because people that use fancy
widgets that have used beautiful widgets
you know i thought that was a nice
addition you know help me find a napper
too much likely find a gamer so yeah I
the only thing i don't like about it
necessarily is it would be nice to get a
number of how many people have +1 that
yes my friends or the people that I
circle on Google+ have recommended it
but it'd be nice to get a number yeah I
agree with that I get
what I'm looking do you yeah top item on
my list is nova launcher dare cross and
seven other people have +1 this I'm dare
cross guy he Plus Ones all the things he
does next one Sentinel three homeworld
dare across and five other people appear
across once that guy's each plus wanted
everything yeah that actually gets
pretty funny if you're following a
personal Plus Ones all the things yes
okay I'm not gonna lie I don't plus 1
all the things but a traitor across and
sicker okay no no you have to go into
the recommended apps quick thick Scott
Anderson and two other people plus 1
this there you go Scott's plus one and
all the things minus is plus 1 by your
friends interesting alright so Google
Play got some updates for
recommendations tied to your use habits
and your friends so it's very cool let's
talk a little bit about Google now
people search google search AKA google
now got an update this week those of you
that are rocking jelly bean on your
devices will notice that now movie
showtimes are now included based on days
that you generally search for movies um
which is a very cool i have yet to find
that uh have that card pop up because I
guess I don't really search for a whole
lot of movies yeah I say I just don't
search for movies right now what I want
to know is is if let's say I go to the
movies a lot on certain days like in I
check in there and Google knows that
that's a movie theater war also when I'm
near that movie theater why get the car
to pop up to you know if it knows him at
AKA you know local cinema what pop up
then you know oh look he's a block away
from the cinema let's show him what's
playing this stuff like that L becoming
a guy says it to ya I mean I just don't
go to the movies very often so I not
something I find useful but I can see
why for people that are big movies
moviegoers that's great yeah definitely
so Google now also got a sports update
you can now just go ahead and add your
team's you don't have to you know search
for your team to have it show up he just
go ahead and add whatever teams you want
to have show up as a car unfortunately
that asterisk on me whatever team yeah
unfortunately if you're a huge college
football fan I'm assuming also
basketballs and so forth but the college
football just started the this past week
you can't add any college teams that's
that's kind of sad yes but but maybe
it'll come in the future but still you
know whatever major league major
national teams and so forth you can go
ahead add those as well as international
and I like no football depending on what
what area of the world here I'll be the
other four I got bored so I find it very
disappointing yeah and also public
service announcement so you know if
there's a tornado hurricane earthquake
Amber Alert you know things like that
you know there will be in your area the
a card will pop up so that's actually
very much yeah yeah yeah very very neat
I I want to see more of these types of
you input something and it'll give you
inputs to where it is uh with me I use
public transport at transportation and
if it knows that I go to work at a
certain time it gives me all of the
relevant times to work and publicize it
would it would be nice to input
something that just gives me to and from
not like if I'm at work why would it
tell me to go home if I'm still at work
until a certain time I find that in an
annoyance but hopefully look at it tells
you all day long how how long it takes
documents then just popping up the end
of the day yeah yeah yeah I guess but
however it is smart enough to know that
I only play golf on Tuesdays in a golf
leg and on Tuesdays I get the card to
drive to the golf course I don't get it
on wednesday or monday i don't get any
other day of the week so it's smart
enough to know that I what day I play
golf on so it uh you think maybe that
you know might be added in the future
yeah bill for people that don't have a
very regular schedule right like you go
off every Tuesday and not wednesday
thursday or friday i feel like for
people that you know sometimes it's
Tuesday's sometimes it's friday
sometimes it's wednesday right like it's
not a consistent thing it's a lot less
helpful it more just kind of
to annoy well yeah I mean also I played
that golf course you know most of my
life yeah I played it for the past 20
years on how to get there how many
directions you but uh anyway so let's
talk about another google app update
this week we had google maps those of
you that are bikers you can rejoice
there is now turn-by-turn navigation for
bikes by Krauss and if the recent the
previous recent google map update growth
your HTC device made it randomly reboot
oh this should fix that this should
resolve that so thumbs up for HTC
devices not rebooting happen to my
friends s3 and would be update okay what
is given yeah oh that's not an HTC
device no I'm aware of that but it
actually broke a comparative I was a
pilot I made the galaxy s3 you actually
have it was just voicing I have this
reward you know your device was fine
yeah but then again I'm not exactly
running HTC software on it so why not is
that a trick question okay alright so
moving on those of you that use HBO an
HBO GO once again thumbs up if you're on
jellybean device HBO GO now officially
supports the latest and greatest version
of Android yeah I like the UI it's a
free pool hey there big paypal user I
know you know I've been hazed
occasionally but if he checked out the
latest update that came out this past
week whether it's a complete you I
makeover I know they've just recently
redid the UI on the website no but they
did on the mobile app and the funny
thing is it broke probably three times
so late they initiated app updates like
three times within an hour and it was
pretty funny but that respect is the big
massive update then like a bug fix a bug
fix the note about it at least I didn't
let it sit and I have given up palms
with it I mean I like the fact that
people update the wrap
with bug fixes so I mean that's good
yeah yeah that's that's one of the nice
things with the sort of the delivery
process of app updates it's so easy you
might as well just go ahead and push out
the fixes don't bother waiting if it's
something that's important exactly also
in a car scanning which I'm not her %
sure i didn't use it I don't know what
card scanning in it I think that's
support for their square rival isn't it
oh we out that could be yeah I don't
think it's like using the camera to scan
credit cards that would be impressive
don't then we had another rob a bit tags
like that let me have another appt
tablet SMS Derek you want to take this
one yeah katal SMS those of you that are
familiar with clockworkmod which pretty
much if you've ever rooted your phone
before you know or have heard of couche
and clockworkmod so or everyone's
managed ahmad since it comes bundled
with ya anyways uh while ago he came out
with a desk SMS which allows you to you
stall the app on your phone and connects
to website basically and then via your
desktop an app on your desktop browser
extension whatever have you you can send
and receive text messages well since you
know devices such as the nexus 7 are
extremely portable you can put in your
pocket it's basically like a bigger
version of the galaxy note maybe it's
just a it's a it's a big tablet but I'm
sorry it's a big big phone basically
except for the fact that doesn't have
phone capabilities so you know yeah you
can make calls on it with you know
groove IP yeah you can send text
messages with google voice but that
doesn't help you God doesn't have a
microphone yeah but I would hope so
ammonia of course you ran out clear kala
for video chats haha nope no Mike that's
right it's got out of my god so um yeah
that dirt just made me leave to check
okay so uh yes Qasim era tan SMS does
the same thing his desk a semester
does it allows you to send text messages
and mms from said device so you install
desk SMS on your phone then you still
tablet SMS on your tablet and by the
good guys over it clockworkmod it talks
to a server out there on the interwebs
and sends all your text messages back
and forth you can reply and compose
messages right from your nexus 7 or any
tablet for that matter i just use nexus
7 because it's the flavor of the month
and it's extremely portable like a big
phone so just yeah I've used it I do use
it a preemie I enjoy it now Derek is
there a use case for this if you are a
strictly google voice like a lot of
Google people are I mean is there a use
case for this at all oh yeah a lot of I
mean some people are strictly you down
question was if you're not already using
google voice is there a use case if
you're not already using google voice is
your main number that know if everybody
if you're all your friends and family
members have your carrier what your
carrier line number well these trends 4x
message the other one emeka number and
they send you text messages on that
number than yet you're gonna need
something like this of you but net but
as yeah as you guys are hinting at if
you're already a google voice user
problems or one-half get it everywhere
yeah some people don't you know don't
want to port their number or don't want
to give people a different number it is
nice to girl calligraphic it earlier
text messages through 14 different
servers and remember now until recently
Google Voice didn't play nicely with SMS
or mms messages I think it still doesn't
do mms I thought they were all done it
does but it emails that basically yeah
okay okay all right but either way both
apps are free so check it out if you're
not a google voice user I recommend it
remember backhoe a few months back
google i/o when the nexus 7 was demoed
and they were showing how awesome it was
they demoed a game called horn &amp;amp; horn
wasn't available yet but caught
everyone's attention and looked
absolutely amazing Oh 3d
masterpiece adventure game and it showed
the gaming capability of the upcoming
Nexus 7 so we've been anxiously waiting
for it for the past few months well it
was released just a few days ago on
August 30th costs 699 thanks to xanga
and you get on the google play store
right now and typical of games that from
zenga you can you know up do upgrades in
gaming game purchases if you want you
know upgrade your guy a little bit your
character horn himself making a little
more powerful at a few stats here and
there if you want but you don't have to
it's not needed um it's just as easy not
you know not doing it but it is very fun
game and it's a beautiful game as i said
the graphics are amazing it shows the
real true gaming capability of a Tegra 3
device now I've only played on my Nexus
7 I haven't tried to play it on anything
else how's the length of the game is it
one of those games it has an ending or
is it an ongoing type game well I'm not
only I'm only twelve percent into the
game so I'm assuming it's gonna be a
long ways telling you that you're a
certain percentage into the game i'm
assuming there's an end point yeah
hundred percent um yeah at least all the
world the world that I'm in right now
has a nice little twelve percent by and
I said I a lot of free time over the
past few days having issues in an
airport so I've become accustomed to the
game and all about it's pretty neat um
you know if you still have some people
play money left over from your next 27
your you know go ahead and give it a try
at seven boxing plate for a little bit
you don't like it you can always no
redeem it would you recommend it if you
had no google play money left from your
nexus 7 purchase would you produce it
with your own I am NOT an Android gamer
I'm a gamer anymore I don't have time
time to be right now you know all my
game sitting over on this side of mirror
crying in the closet but yeah I um I was
gonna buy it anyways after i saw a demo
i was like wow this is going to make me
want to play it I mean the only other
game I play that's a true game besides
the casual gamer games I
I play dead trigger you know something i
can play five minutes of time if i want
to go shoot some zombies but I I would
have bought it anyways just because i
was doing odd at Google i/o they know
they did their marketing right they
hooked me alright moving on we have a
microsoft skydrive was officially
released in the Play Store um I liked
the interface of it but it kind of
blacks a lot of features well uh
SkyDrive kind of likes a lot of features
no I missed Emily by his flock yeah um
but it was nice i like the interface and
hopefully they improve upon it yeah no I
mean as much i guess- dresses
Microsoft's getting about Windows 8 the
interfaces do look very clean mm-hmm but
if you note a fan of SkyDrive another
cloud storage device had their app
updated right Scott uh yeah it was
actually an experimental built by
Dropbox and basically they're releasing
a type of two step verification it's
available in their experimental built
and you can find all their experimental
built on their blog so i like the effect
of their security um now they did have
they do have a password authentication
if you want for booting up the app i
personally think that's nice and enough
for me but to step size to you know if
you are storing a lot of information out
on dropbox especially personal
information you're just using it to
store crap to download that's one thing
but if you're using it for PII
personally identifiable information yeah
you better be you better be protecting
it and thanks to the drop box allows you
to do that now I mean I don't worry
about mine but everything that's there
is also publicly available elsewhere
yeah and I see this useful for
enterprise people they're storing a
terabytes of information yeah yeah I'm
gonna want to step because they may get
access to it then I've got problems yes
for the drop box for James users don't
want a IFA 2012 the the germany berlin
technology conference of the past week
saw a lot of devices now men slaughtered
devices pop up that we were expecting as
well as so at least i wasn't expecting
uh let's get home with the galaxy note 2
that was officially announced earlier
this week it's going to be rocking a
1280 x 720 display on a 5.5 inch screen
so it grew just a little bit over the
original note 3100 mAh battery become a
jelly bean there you go with Jamie and
1.6 gigahertz quad-core Exynos processor
so this little beefier the galaxy camera
was announced as well it is a camera
just blown away by the camera with the
quad core processor I mean I get putting
a full touchscreen operating system on a
camera but you really need a quad core
processor in your camera you know what
yes you do you do need a quad core
processor in your camera that way you
can process the images faster and and
get the quad core processors that's in
the International s3 can't process a
faster than the single core image
processor in HTC's image sense chip okay
oh yeah that's right Oh Dawn has it and
you know what it's gonna be able to
process all the things and do all the
things you know I don't know you're
gonna apply filters to on Instagram
faster you know I oh boy yeah you know
what else can do that my original HTC
evo well you know what with a 0 which
makes it feel core one nigga there's of
some reason to play a gig storage not a
whole lot of
be the quad core processor would be like
32 gigabytes of on-board storage well
actually the kicker with this device is
the fact that you get um I think it's 25
or 50 gigabytes of dropbox storage yeah
and I mean Sam some of these days what
you could you get that with us three as
well I think that's not a you have to
verizon they frown upon that mouth yep
going on uprising sorry yeah no I'm
arrived but I'm with to be nice like any
other non verizon samsung you get that
so that I mean that's not like a big
special thing if you're getting a
samsung you're getting that yeah I mean
it's just add a feature that is nice so
unless unless you feel like wasting CPU
cycles you shouldn't get this I guess
according to dan no it does have a 16
mega camera and wasting lots of CPU
cycles Oh spoken like a you know what
when it comes out then I want you to
make a custom kernel for that you know
under the underclocked risky knows
what's up let me make a girl for that
crap exe how's that okay so you won't
okay calling our developer hahaha yes or
no yet oh yeah doesn't like those I'm
sure I can find you on how much does a
16 megabyte I mean a 16 megapixel uh
image file in bread costs you know how
big is a file is that decent size i
guess probably around with five
megabytes at least yeah I don't a pic of
megapixels usually 12 and a half yep so
I would assume it's about 500 txt fox
roughly five neg / image more than I
think it more than doubles to double the
mega pixel size well either way I
usually your CPU cycles are not a pure
Android cameras coming out there and
Samsung basically have external storage
with that little on board um I mean like
for a camera right I can see wanting a
lot of storage space no it does it does
yeah you can you can that they they had
that in mind so they could make people
like you
happy so let's talk about the next
device you know archos archos hasn't
been the greatest in popularity for
android tablets over now we're long past
two years year and a half whatever her
third quality of hats and hitter mrs.
maybe they've been slowing getting
updates out here we've actually been
talked about them getting updates in the
past from for jellybean on some of their
devices I'm sorry not jelly bean ice
cream sandwich on some of their devices
well hard to be impressed but an almost
two year old operating system at this
point sorry uh down negative nancy hold
on a second so the archos gamepad was
announced it's now you may use all your
cpu cores on this one and all of your
cpu cycles it's a 1.5 gigahertz
quad-core android gaming device it has
hardware-specific buttons on the left on
the right side specifically for gaming
oh you know gamepad buttons so you don't
have to use software keys you know
software buttons which we do now on
tablets and phones so it is specifically
built for gaming um there's no release
date yet for here in the US but across
the pond over in Europe look for this
device to come out towards the end of
October I like the artwork buttons for
gaming and it's opera but knows i am not
a fan of for agreed other types of
devices this might be the future of
android gaming who knows yeah but the
thing is if you buy the hardware harbor
buttons you're kind of limited to that
yeah just kind of way if you're a gamer
awesome if you're not a live with the
autumn screen i guess yeah ok the next
device rumor we'll talk about here the
aside from IFA 2012 motorola released a
flyer inviting people from the press to
come to a new event of theirs on
September 18th they asked people to join
Motorola on September 18
for an event that will let us take you
to the edge Bloomberg then reported that
Motorola was getting ready to release a
phone with zero bezel the bezel does you
that don't know is the thin or thick
depending on your device usually black
strip around your scrip you buleria on
your screen to this date there isn't a
device that is bezel less you know
completely screened from edge to edge
there's always a bezel on the styths on
the top you know it's a waste screen
space basically so Motorola has a flyer
out there that says let us take you to
the edge an intel inside logo is on the
flyer so it's a joint event between
Motorola and Intel and it's a bloomberg
reports that they're going to be
announcing a zero bezel device not know
what what's also yet to follow up on
this rumor the the flyer the text on the
flyer goes to the actual edge of the
flyer there's no margin like you know
most Flyers to have a one inch margin
around it it goes completely to the edge
so this might actually happen so is this
the upcoming razr HD is it a completely
different device all I know is this will
be the first device that has officially
launched after Google took over Motorola
so this might actually be possible also
on the bottom of the flyer they had a
hashtag on there that had hash moto edge
so is the device let me called Motorola
edge I mean is it who knows what's gonna
call but it sounds like something
something big is gonna happen here in a
few days so we'll find out in the 18th
the mall with them inside what's that in
the thing that makes me skeptical is the
Intel Inside if they're gonna do an edge
lyst display I don't think they're gonna
do it with something as sort of untested
unproven as a medfield chip but why
would Intel's logo be on the flyer
that's what's interesting that's what
I'm saying makes me skeptical skeptical
the rumors are skeptical of the Ferger
show
the hardware I don't think that they
would do something as big and splashy as
an edge list display with something as
risky as the Intel so maybe then it is
the first first motorola phone with an
intel core and it is called motorola
edge all there is it's not a bezel this
phone that's rumored that rude and still
pan out in the future but for now is
that rumor a lot of times before yeah
maybe the device is just called the
motorola edge I mean I think we've heard
that with what every device Samsung has
released in the last 18 months yeah yeah
when we heard about shrinking bezels no
bezels yes just the edge list it was not
the Narrows what's interesting about
this though if you couple this with the
patent that Google was awarded with in
the past maybe a little over a month ago
we had talked about on the show before
where they were awarded a patent that no
matter if you held a phone right side up
upside down you can talk into and
listening to it so there would be some
type of speaker microphone sensor on
each end and depending on the
orientation the device you software to
determine you know yeah which speaker to
activate which mike to activate so if
the device is edge to edge screen and
you throw in that hardware patent
software pattern that that could all I
mean that can become you know a super
device a game-changing device yeah I
mean we are we are still talking about
there being a bezel then at the top and
the bottom at very least for a speaker
prefer speaker battle react very large
also potentially for a front-facing
camera so you're probably still going to
get some bezel at very least a top but
especially with on-screen keys nowadays
you can strip away the bezel at the Sun
to left the right the bottom without you
know having any problems other than
obviously building that device so if
you're watching the show right now sorry
listeners that you can't watch the
listen to this later but if you're
watching and listening live here what do
you think is going to come out of this
rumor you think we're going to see a
yeah a device just called the motorola
edge do you think it's going to be a
bezel this device taking it to the edge
the screen to the edge no let us know
what your thoughts are on here
come back to this a little bit all since
we're talking about rumors let's talk
about HTC is latest rumor there HTC is
rumored to be coming out with a 5-inch
you know mega device because that's
that's the popular thing to do with
Samsung did it LG did it now HTC is
looking to do it at least according to
latest rumor pictures surfaced this past
week with a black device with red along
the side which resembles you know
verizon's colors for the HTC incredible
line you could you can see hardware keys
on the device which are similarly
located to other HTC incredible devices
so is it the new incredible is that the
rumor five incher or is it the HTC one
x+ you know don't know but okay we have
a new HTC device coming out but we have
no clue what it is right now well I
doubt it's the one x+ since that was
rumored to be going to t-mobile that's
when it's red and red is generally a
verizon thing generally generally and
the original neva was biking around bed
yeah so let's a move on to our last
rumor of the week here this is a big one
now I mean did it the motorola had no
bezel things bit too but this is big too
so paul bryant romanik hill reported
earlier that google and asus are ramping
up production on a device that's about
six weeks away from cumbia being
announced it's going to be the nexus 7
3g so a lot of people have said I and
outs of great tablet i love it but I
wish it had cellular data they want
mobile data they want to be able to use
the 3g 4g whatever a mobile data plan
with it so it can truly be used
everywhere instead of just places that
have a Wi-Fi hotspot which personally
the places i've used it I've never said
door and I wish I had Wi-Fi could every
where I use the add Wi-Fi but that's
just me and me maybe I'd like to use in
the car then maybe I don't want to
tether my
down or I'm at the beach you want to use
it whatever but anyways can't face
Olerud there is a 3g rumor coming out
now speculation on this a 3g radio cost
about 8 to 10 bucks so it might cost
twenty thirty dollars more than the 199
virgin guess it'll be 250 yeah 2 304 for
a 16 yeah so so we a we don't know on
prices but it I'd say 50 most you know
they'll make a little bit of money on it
but it doesn't coffee itself doesn't
cost much now this is all speculation of
course if this rumor does pan out to be
true I'm betting it actually you know
hearing 3g not hearing anything else I'm
betting it'll be hspa+ you know we're
not going to see a verizon 4g LTE
version we probably won't even see in
here we won't see it a sprint or AT&amp;amp;T
LTE birds and it will follow Google's
suit of Nexus devices it'll be an unlock
you know it will be an hspa+ device that
you can put on pretty much any character
except cdma carriers all part of this
hardware right they can't just bolt on a
4G LTE chip next to the to the license
yeah I understand so those of you that
are on you know sprint or verizon here
in the US you can unfortunately go ahead
and start frowning now if this does come
out you're not you have to activate this
from another network but city even if
that doesn't even happen is well no one
knows it's a rumor right now but those
of you that are on a 3g plan or no no
I'm starting up 3g plan rrna hspa+ plan
in this 3g nexus 7 does pan out well
there you go personally I just don't
wanna pay for more data you know I'm
fine with my tethering yes yeah you're
right you're right but then again you
know uh the if you have the new share
everything plans coming out from
eighteen t or um verizon it's really not
that at verizon what I said well not
verizon we just discussed the fact that
this will have to go a resident
yeah yeah oh yeah did this yeah this
won't come risin this will come to
verizon basically verizon is
unofficially burned Google with Nexus
devices they big birthday at Bridge so
this won't become an uprisin in my
opinion i I've been wrong way twice
before in my life so it's not just that
they aren't going to put LTE on it
resins not and release any more devices
that don't have LT heat so at that point
there's I'm gonna point of putting just
a cdma radio in it all right so it looks
like we have a few comments here device
named edge not a cop so if the device
named edge isn't copyrighted right now
the smart thing to do according to
comments is to is to go and go and
copyright right now try to bank on a few
bucks right mark not a copyright but
yeah yeah Nexus edge would be neat uh
yeah I agree you know call it Nexus edge
I doubt it'll be they use a Nexus device
though but you know you know anything's
possible and it's possible let's talk
about some ICS and jelly bean weeks and
updates here well an IFA will go back to
IFA news here and IFA 2012 samsung said
that the galaxy s three jellybean was
coming soon which we know we see every
four days you could see a new leak so
yeah we know it's coming soon and
speaking of leaks there was a week this
week more bug fixes yadda yadda added a
few features here and there and boom it
you can go ahead and download it and
flash it if you want to venture down
that route if you are rooted already if
not keep your fingers crossed that it
comes very very soon samsung also
announced that the note 10.1 the new
tablet from them as well as the original
note would be getting jellybean soon and
just a side note on the note 10.1 this
past week i was at vmworld on the san
francisco and for whatever reason
samsung mobile was there because
is their devices are good to monitor and
use virtualization uh I don't know how
that a phone company to come there
there's no text often you know they were
there you know they sell the best
monitors for viewing vSphere you know I
either way they were there they had that
the note 10.1 I used it for good 10
minutes talked a couple the sales
engineers about it they looked at me
like I had three heads when I was asking
questions no I just said okay I'm gonna
go about my own thing and I just
wouldn't i just went click with it
myself all right yeah I there's a lot of
doom and gloom about that device but
it's not that bad mia has touch with
TouchWiz is the smoothest stop Android
no is it the worst time whatever know
what i use it i don't like TouchWiz no
but for those of you this blank / group
it won an FN you might use the tablet
but you just wouldn't use it with
TouchWiz on it for very long I would
wipe and ROM that thing faster than any
other planet it's a beast it is it's not
that bad all right so let's get in the
big guy here at least for that Italy
Scott and I hold near and dear to our
hearts were verizon God's and Nexus
owners so a little bit of light was shed
on that subject this past week a build
for jellybean for the verizon galaxy
nexus was leaked and from now we're able
to steal the radios from it so we have a
new cdma radio new LTE radio for your
flashing pleasure you can go and flash
those chances are if this bill comes to
fruition and near future those radios
will be the radios you all be running
I've been running them this past week no
I have no issues with them speed is just
the same batteries I can't tell the
difference people are reporting better
battery life and people are reporting
faster Wi-Fi to 4G transition and 3G to
4G transition faster I haven't paid that
much attention to it well you cannot
have LTE where you live bill to notice
that one yeah yeah jack but that's what
I mean I just blew all week I Delta
there and at work you know I MLT so I'll
tested more work this coming week um the
OTA or the over the air leaked leaked
build was turned into a flashable wrong
so those of you that want to flash you
know as close to sleek stock Android as
possible on your Verizon Galaxy Nexus
that rom is available for your flashing
pleasure you can download it from
various places such as XDA routes wiki
so forth in and get your jellybeans on
if you're wanting to run that you have
to wonder these things are being leaked
on purpose at this point we are horizon
where somebody's just like you know what
I'm so freaking fed up with verizon and
their stall like fine we're just Malika
I I honestly don't think there really
are leaks anymores is there okay we've
internally tested the hell out of this
now let's leak it and have tech beta
testers yeah manchester's yeah exactly
all the bone is beta testing radios and
roms forum because we find bugs then
their engineers go out there and look at
all the Android blog news site so it
look with all these problems people are
finding you know like that's all it is
it's there's no such thing as a leak
people don't leave smartphones and bars
you know it was the way that when is the
iphone 5 gonna show up in a bar soon you
know i don't think at all okay alright
so that you joined stuff and talk about
that apple stuff least for an hour 30
seconds when we talk about patent wars
that's uh so the HTC HTC Thunderbolt del
on the last show you talked about how it
received a ice cream sandwich you know
almost your OS week well it was supposed
to drop by the end of august and my
calendar that was three days ago and it
did not drop so Thunderbolt owners keep
your fingers crossed that you come in
the near future hopefully here's logo
yep hey and last but up though we have
two things let's talk about four devices
uh till ice cream sandwich for the
t-mobile galaxy 10.1 is available via
kies so go ahead and get ice yes for
your tab 10.1 if you're on t-mobile BF
it put me at ease it's not coming over
the air update so yeah grab the USB
cable download go to samsung's website
download keys install it download be
updating and flash it that way last but
not least let's talk about kindle fire
rumors so here in a few days we're going
to hear about some kindle fires next
week or this week then the week we're
gonna be talking about them so far
rumors are putting it as 27 inch devices
no 10 inch devices so far but the
neatest thing in my opinion is one of
those going to be ad based similar to
the e-readers so we're going to have an
ad based kindle fire where the whenever
you turn on the display an ad will pop
up when the tablet wakes up you know so
I don't think about that it's supposedly
it's going to be it's going to be the
cheapest the cheapest 7-inch tablet to
date so it maybe it'll be a hundred
bucks because it's add support and they
would be 150 bucks because ad-supported
who knows but it's a very interesting
concept would you be willing to spend
fifty dollars or a hundred dollars less
to see an advertisement taking them you
know taking up your screen for on how
many seconds you may be in five seconds
three so one just to strictly get the
hard work yeah I was gonna say get the
memory of the hardware put us right yeah
well I think that's a by watching at the
the as important morning then just don't
you by the hundred dollars off yeah it's
important version wipe that bad boy in
put jelly on you know exactly wait a
month somebody will put jelly bean on it
you know I think that's a wise choice
you know what Scott I would never
thought you thinking that you know now
that you're running voices that are
routing wrong you're all about the the
routing in Roman aren't you a ruler
Robin my god you have to edit that out
the wasn't the people CEO that said
something about five tablets from Kindle
or from yeah that was an initial rumor
there was a rumor that we're getting
like a 10 inch version an LTE version uh
you know a 7-inch like very very
version and then a 7-inch like HD screen
version like there's all sorts of rumors
but I guess we'll find out about three
days I there for me too I think two is a
much more realistic target of them I
mean amazon Kelly please baby blanketing
the market like Samsung does it's gonna
be six out no one knows they're going to
be successful doing it people that
already have a kindle fire are gonna
want to get the latest and greatest one
maybe no you know we'll see I think
people on the market for Twitter dollar
device aren't necessarily looking for
the latest and greatest unlike let me
upgrade over year kind of asos you're
okay you're right you're right well
Emma's on did announced last week the
beginning a week that the kindle fire
original version had completely sold out
and it was complete success capturing
twenty-two percent of the tablet market
that's impressive for one device
manufacturer yeah definitely and one
Android especially for Android because
the Android tablets aren't as popular is
uh iOS tablets yet yet yeah so so let's
talk sense we talked about iOS let's
let's talk about patent wars here Dan's
favorite subject so we're going to hear
ranting there's not not yet alright so
Apple added the samsung galaxy s3 the
Galaxy Nexus the note 10.1 and note 2 to
the infringement list so they're seeking
injunction about devices that just came
out we're bound to come out and what
that would do is it would temporarily
ban said devices from selling being
imported here in the US until the actual
court hearing and my first initial
thought that is so they're going after
the Galaxy Nexus which is stalk and
drawing so they're going after Android
and some of the patents were around data
tapping which is why HTC's devices were
blocked a few months ago but
jellybean I thought resolved that issue
completely so I'm curious as to how
that'll how that will pan out you have
any thoughts on that banner Scott well
it's important to realize that this
isn't some kind of change to the case
that Apple just won a couple of weeks
ago it was a totally separate case that
is confusingly being handled by the
exact same judge Craig the exact same
court it is a totally separate set of
patents that are an issue this is the
one where they didn't add the Galaxy
Nexus to it the Galaxy Nexus was on the
list all along this is the case where
they got the preliminary injunction on
the Galaxy Nexus that then got tossed
all that they're doing is adding the
sgs3 and these newer devices to the lens
yeah in the note note to you the only
reason these weren't on the list in the
first place is because they would have
had to wait to file the case at all
until now until the devices came out so
everybody knew they were going to add
these to them when they filed the case
months ago because they had been on the
list when they filed the case months ago
and then we're basically told well you
can't add these because they don't exist
you know this is just following the same
argument with the design patents know
what what patents are they attacking
these are all software patents okay this
is the the data tapping two of them are
universal search related one of them
works towards Syria and one of them were
sort of just generically searching
everything across the device um and a
couple of other odds and ends of
software that's not design patents okay
this one should be interesting though
yeah it's also worth noting that the
Galaxy Nexus is only at issue for a
couple of them not all of them okay so I
think about half of the patents are just
touch with specific and then the others
are potentially core android okay all
right so let's talk about
the possibility of an iphone 5 with LTE
well let's stop right there and not
think that it's a possibility question
the next iPhone is going to have LTE or
they're going to lose their two biggest
carriers exactly 18teen verizon will not
release another device that does not
have LTE they have made that very clear
from very long time if they're so one if
you're still wondering then you're just
yeah we're doing so they are going to
have a refugee from rising will flat out
refuse to sell it if it doesn't have LTE
so later this week we're going to find
out the iPhone 5 has ltd samsung samsung
has said that they own roughly ten
percent of all of the 4g LTE pads and
Apple has repeatedly argued that the
certain patents that Samsung does own on
4G LTE should be made industry standards
due to their broad sweeping nature now I
think we've heard that before going the
other direction but we'll get to that
second so fast yes that's right
Paddington rectangle is not broad and
sweeping in nature but patenting a very
specific radio technology that's too
broad sorry though Samsung Robin really
is that Apple didn't invent any single
part of any of their I devices that
allow them to connect to anything else
their innovation has been in product
design and to a lesser extent within the
operating system anything that allows
any of those devices to in any way shape
or form connect to anything else in the
world was built by somebody else exactly
so so Samsung has confirmed that they
will seek immediate legal action if
Apple releases an iphone 5 with LTE
since they own a large portion of those
paths so the problem Samson's going to
have here is the Apple is legitimately
buying its LTE products right like they
are just infringing and making their own
illegal infringing
te radio they're buying it from somebody
that mixels earrings I would assume
qualcomm because they're really the only
option well done sangel and confirm that
but there's actually going to go after
it iphone 5 in and you know if the iPad
Mini is announced you know time if
they're going to go after that now
apparently the wording is they didn't go
after the ipad LTE version because they
then feel they needed to they but now
after recent recent developments but you
know the billion-dollar lawsuit they
decided that they're you know they're
gonna fight back there they're not have
any more of it I'm not sure about that
strategy on Samsungs part I mean if you
look at the the new iPad with LTE right
the chip that it's using to habits ltd
compatibility built by Qualcomm I'm sure
Apple has some agreement whereby they
buy these chicks from Qualcomm with the
understanding that they sort of get well
cons IP from it too great lake I don't
see Samsung going after every other
device that's been released with that
same chip which the list starts with the
Thunderbolt so there's a lot of LTE
devices using that exact same ship from
you and I'm not a lawyer but if you go
after one device you'd have to get your
company to have to go after them all
correct but not necessarily but if
you're saying that Apple's LTE is
infringing and all of apple's LTE is
encompassed within their agreement with
Qualcomm to buy those physical chips I
mean I don't know if that's if that's
the case right there might be some sort
of other gray area of for genus that's
not covered by the hardware I just don't
see those being likely wait I mean
they're getting their their hardware
from the same place that everybody else
in the industry is getting their ltd
hardware they're getting a Qualcomm and
I I just don't see Qualcomm not being in
a position to have the ipod back up that
product samsung may hold ten percent of
all the patents on 4G LTE good Qualcomm
has a big chunk to ya
uh Eric Kaufmann has a question won't
know what data tapping dad is capping is
the intense so when you click on a phone
number it pops up and says do you want
to open this with phone or with google
voice or with groove IP are you tapping
a Lincoln pops up and asked you want to
use Chrome browser or Firefox oh my god
are they going to attack their iOS
platform for or actually uh Chrome on
iOS four heading up well reply you know
oddly enough a google search you know
the new jelly bean Google search was
supposed to come to iOS and for some
reason it's still a lot there so yeah he
said we mean sitting in Apple Apple
approval hell yeah but thrives that
chroma was allowed to do that now that's
time Joe and I wonder if Apple will tout
the Google search if they do accept it
into the App Store if they will tout it
as one of their features of their phones
well it's better than their own search
it's better than series agreed but
women's if they just help that as a
feature and say hey we just released the
amount it might add is a feature then
they gotta pay Google every time they
say Google's name okay what are they
gonna say that they have a new search up
I mean they could say something like
hundreds of other voice storage apps
including yeah and like just show a
panel of search results that include the
google voice thing you'll ever show up
in the store I do just because at some
point Apple's obstinance will draw the
ire of higher powers yeah Apple tried to
to keep google voice out of the market
for quite some time as well until
basically became clear their choice was
allow this in or watch the FCC
beat the crap out of here yeah I mean
when your flat said it well you're not
allowed to sell anything in this market
that we have hedge amount of control
over because it competes with us it's
pretty hard to stand up to head
anti-competition suit when your entire
purpose for not allowing it as saying I
don't want there to be competition makes
it pretty clear that you're behaving in
an again too competitive way yeah I
agree well I have one last thing to say
about Pat Wars there's a there's been
some talk around the bay area that
apples Tim Cook and Google's Larry Page
about patents so they're those rumors
that they're playing meet playing to sit
down talk to figure out you know where
to go from here what to do is remember
google is also our ramsaran motorolla
which is it which is google it is
fighting back as well they are seeking
injunction against every device but how
do they offer you every device that uh
that apple owns no wait I think not the
what is it the mac mini and the tower
max they're still making them yeah if
they're still making the edge with
mobile devices would throw the ipod
touch the i bring back the power and air
every ipod every iphone or ipad that is
on the market so there yeah in my
opinion if Apple is willing to talk they
think they may they may lose that suit
so that's good you know we need to get
rid of software patents or change the
system or something so finding a common
ground the settlement a resolution
outside the court system that's what we
need to do a great yeah well uh let's do
some wrap up on this holiday um you guys
enjoy your weekends you know what I do
enough you notice how long weekend you
guys get work off yeah over stuff like a
five or six day weekend and I had a
problem with not an airline so that's
why we didn't air the show friday night
it happened well basically I got I got
stuck at the airport because the the
first officer decided not to show up for
work so so you know 250 people on how
many people on the plane you know
decided to mijita he decided to screw
everybody over right now shut up for
work and backup pilots for that kind of
thing yeah I would assume I would assume
our backup pilot or the other so there's
you know a dude you can call we know but
not that flight was delayed for like two
hours so I missed my connecting flight
and was stuck in the year old stomping
grounds dan I was down
DC area stuck at Dulles Airport i
couldnt get a flight home to the next
day so that was awesome um so yeah so we
didn't do the new show friday night
because the United Airlines now
interesting enough United Airlines just
released a google play app so yeah maybe
your problems would have been solved if
you got i could probably like contacted
the copilot by the app for something
right one day earlier but yeah so
