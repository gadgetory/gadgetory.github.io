covering the launch event of the huawei
mate 20 and mate 20 pro but while we
announced another phone that I really
wanted to go see this is our quick look
at the huawei mate 20 RS porsche design
edition so really the main differences
between the rail erm 820 Pro and the RF
course design Edition is aesthetics the
porsche design model has leather on the
backside which is kind of surrounding
this one sheet of black glass and it's
got that porsche design logo centered in
the middle of the phone also we've got a
bit of a camera bump on the regular
huawei mate 20 and May 20 Pro the RF
porch design version is flush with the
phone's so the phone is just a tiny tiny
bit thicker but you're not getting that
camera bump that you're getting on the
regular phone so those are pretty much
the only aesthetic differences that
you're getting between that and the mate
20 pro but the other changes are on the
inside the mate 20 RS Porsche Design
Edition that comes with a gigabytes of
RAM and either 256 or 512 gigabytes of
storage but it's a lot more expensive
this one's gonna cost you 1595 euros for
the baseline model and you're paying
almost 400 to 500 dollars more just to
get the 512 gigabyte model other than
those extra specs you're getting some
custom wallpapers that Porsche design
has included with the phone but we were
able to rip those off of the phone and
I've uploaded them to a shared folder so
you guys can use them if you want and
besides those few things there's not a
lot different here because it is using
leather it's definitely not a
fingerprint magnet like the regular mate
20 and mate 20 power so that's a plus
but you'd only probably really buy this
if you were a huge Porsche fan or you
just wanted to spend your money on
something
really expensive anyway it's that's
pretty much Finn it I do have a hands-on
with the wall we meet 20 and mate 20 Pro
if you want to go see that and they did
announce this new mate 20x that no one
was really expecting and there's a 7.2
inch phone so go check out a video for
that as well until then I am working on
the full review of the mate 20 Pro right
now so stay tuned and I'll catch you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
