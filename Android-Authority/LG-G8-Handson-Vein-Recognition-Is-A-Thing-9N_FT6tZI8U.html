briefing for MWC 2019 and this year they
are showing off a new phone which you
probably expected this is the LG G eight
thank you now the G a thank you has the
usual upgrades that you would probably
expect from a year-on-year
update like the snapdragon 855 more ram
that kind of stuff but the biggest
things that are upgrades in this
generation are a new time-of-flight
sensor which enables some really
interesting features as well as a
crystal sound OLED display which
basically puts the speaker below the
display now first off let's talk about
that time of flight sensor so what's
really interesting about this is it
enables kind of like a face ID unlock
mechanism that is very similar to the
iPhones it uses infrared lasers to
create a 3d scan of your face and then
unlock your phone but the other thing
that this can do is actually sense the
hemoglobin in your blood so what LG is
enabling here is the ability to wave
your hand over the phone have it read
your veins read the hemoglobin in your
blood and then use that as a unique
identifier to actually unlock your
device now I'm not sure exactly why
everyone would want to use this
especially if you could use a 3d face
unlock our face ID as well as that
fingerprint sensor on the back of the
device but it is kind of interesting
because no two people have the same
hemoglobin pattern in their veins so
that's just another interesting way to
unlock your phone
the other cool thing you can do with
this type of light sensor is use it to
manipulate your device without actually
touching it so you can wave your hand
over the phone and it'll unlock after a
few seconds after reading your palm and
then you can use it to like manipulate
music skip YouTube videos to the next
video do a whole bunch of different
things I can't really see this as being
incredibly useful on a day-to-day basis
but say you were cooking or something
and your hands were greasy maybe this
would make it pretty easy to be able to
skip songs without actually having to do
anything else now the other thing was
that crystal sound OLED and basically
what that means is there's no actual
speaker grille on the phone you've just
got the screen and then there's speakers
below the screen and what this kind of
enables is it makes it a little bit
easier for LG to make this ip68
compliant so it's completely waterproof
it does have a couple microphones on the
side of the phone but it basically
vibrates the display and push
the sound through to display since it's
an OLED which actually works pretty well
in our testing so far
just a quick note that our MWC coverage
is brought to you by digit daily your
daily dose of tech straight to your
inbox check out the description below to
learn more now officially enough on the
back you're still only getting a dual
camera array here you're not getting the
three cameras that we saw in the LGV 40
but you can kind of assume that they're
saving that triple camera setup for the
v40 series which is kind of interesting
considering a number of other
manufacturers have actually put three
cameras in the back of their phones this
year but we might see that next year on
the front you've still got that
wide-angle camera that we've come to
expect from LG so you can take those
white fees or wide-angle selfies that a
lot of people really loved from the LG G
6 and it's been passed on through the g7
and the g8 besides that you've got
everything you've come to expect from LG
like eye physics CA water resistance
wireless charging all that kind of stuff
that's pretty much the same those are
the main key features of the g8 thank
you let us know what you think we'll
have a full detailed post down on
Android or 30.com with a ton of pictures
tennis packs all that stuff and make
sure you stay tuned to Indra 30.com for
all of our MWC 2019 coverage and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
