less centered around one device an
update to a curved phone that seemed to
address many of the issues we had with
the original after about a week of
testing I've learned one thing about
this iteration it's basically a few
steps forward and one big step back well
it's time to find out because it's
Joshua Vergara from Android authority
what's going on everybody
and here is my full review of the LG G
flex 2 the design of the G flex 2
focuses on one particular aspect the
curved screen that makes for what some
might call a banana phone but there are
a couple more high points when it comes
to this phones aesthetic the screen
itself has been brought down from its
original large size to an accessible 5.5
inches taking this phone into the
territory of current flagship devices
there are no buttons on any of the sides
though the headphone jack and the micro
USB charging port are found on the
bottom the button layout instead now
takes on the iconic LG placement on the
back the volume rockers flank the power
button and the whole thing is under the
camera optics having the buttons here
has already helped the previous phones
for LG but the curve makes it feel even
more natural as index fingers easily
rest on that area the curve on the
screen makes the entire phone perch up a
bit when lying on its face but the point
of this phone is that you can flex it
flat without much fear of anything
breaking and the backing has the
self-healing material that is supposed
to make superficial scratches fade over
time the only real problem with this
backing is that the sticky material is a
real fingerprint magnet and will collect
dust quite easily because of its static
clean but the back is also removable
giving access to the sim and microSD
card slots the curve was already pretty
well received in the original G flex but
with this smaller 5.5 inch screen it's
even easier to handle getting from side
to side is not that difficult at all
because of the thin bezels and then
performing hand gymnastics is pretty
easy because of how comfortably the
phone rest of the hand and even though
this red Edition might be a little bit
flashy for my taste this brushed look on
the back that goes from the button
layout and spreads out adds to what is
already a very attractive device if you
are worried about the curve being hard
to fit in a pocket it still fits nice
and comfortably in all but the tightest
of jeans so really it's not that much of
an issue a 5.5 inch screen on the G flex
2 brings
higher resolution than before to the
quality standard of 1080p in this IPS
screen the brightness is quite great
even in broad daylight and the curve
does make the experience that little bit
more immersive seeing elements scroll
along the curve is an effect that still
hasn't gotten old though in real usage
it is still subtle enough that you won't
notice it all the time but without the
phone being so close to your eyes the
immersive experience is something I'm
convinced is only true for huge
high-resolution televisions and in house
coated screen claims to have even more
protection available compared to Gorilla
Glass but thankfully there was a screen
protector already installed because I
found a scratch on the top right of it
after a few days of usage nonetheless
colors do tend to have an adequate
saturation to them and this can be
adjusted further in the settings but
keeping this 1080p keeps sharpness
constant compared to the over smoothing
that was present in the LG g3 s quad HD
screen all in all I've had a very good
time with the G flex 2 screen enjoying
media on the screen large enough to do
so but also for handling all other tasks
like text reading and navigation one of
the surprises at the announcement was
the processing package found within the
LG G flex 2 is one of the first widely
available phones to rock the snapdragon
810
backed by an Adreno 430 and up to 3
gigabytes of RAM everyone was expecting
the performance to be off the charts and
for the most part I can tell you that
playing games and performing just about
any in-app tasks is an absolute breeze
even working with the dual window
functionality works quite well with my
typical combination of YouTube and
Chrome working well enough for me to
work and play comfortably it's also
worth mentioning that issues with
overheating when gaming for example were
not observed in my testing the phone did
get a bit hot but I never noticed any
slowdowns and certainly no shut offs
where I see the problems is in the
operating system where LG took an
updated lollipop and slapped it with
their GUI and let me tell you the
results are uneven at best where the G
flex 2 was supposed to be a showcase of
the Snapdragon 810 we get a choppy
experience and even the most basic of
tasks within the GUI multitasking what
the recent apps screen will have a
routine stutter and even when scrolling
through various elements like the
homescreen customization screens I
noticed a lack of smoothness that many
of us probably didn't expect with this
next-generation processor I even went so
far as to install the Google now
launcher to see if things would change
and sure enough I thought that the
animations in it moved along a little
smoother and I overall preferred that
experience to the
GUI now perhaps I'm being a little harsh
on my review unit which came chock-full
of bloatware that is typically installed
on the Asian handsets with that in mind
I will definitely check out a Western
release of the phone when they come out
and report back if anything has changed
hardware on the G flex 2 brings the
essentials and not too much more which
does tend to be a good thing
removing the back cover gets you access
to the microSD card slot which allows
for expansion of the 16 or 32 gigabytes
of on-board storage and it should come
as no surprise that the curved battery
is not replaceable all of the
connectivity options are available
including NFC and Bluetooth though this
review unit from Korea didn't connect to
LTE networks on t-mobile for me call
quality was pretty standard getting out
of quickly loud on the receiving end
with no complaints on the other side and
the rear facing speaker is just about as
standard as you can get though the
upward curve on the bottom portion does
keep it from getting completely stifled
by the table that it's sitting on in
battery life though there was mostly a
standard affair with the 3000 milliamp
hour unit installed my time with the G
flex 2 over the last week brought me
through full days of work with few
problems getting down to power critical
levels before bedtime the power usage
day where I took a lot of pictures and
then played quite a bit of GTA chinatown
wars remains my main example allowing me
just over three and a half hours of
screen on time which is pretty good
considering that lowered usage will get
you pretty far if you are a little bit
more frugal with it I won't go as far as
to say that the LG G flex 2 is an
overachiever in the battery departments
not by any means but having the screen
kept at 1080p resolution something a
little bit more conventional makes this
even out its longevity when compared to
the LG g3 which had quad HD resolution
though the camera experience in the G
flex 2 has gotten a bit of an update in
mostly speed quality seems to still be
on par with other high-end competitors
the app is quite simplistic taking on a
minimal interface that requires you to
tap the point of focus and once it's
focused well you get your shot this is
due to the laser-guided out-of-focus
that makes this one of the fastest
cameras to use in the market today
unless you have a subject running around
the frame you'll get your picture in
seconds flat with little issues other
modes include a burst mode that is
triggered by holding down the shutter
button panorama mode a dual shooting
mode that uses both cameras in the same
shot and HDR that does enhance backlit
subjects and puts a little bit of extra
color into the phone
the biggest subject to the camera
experience centers around the
self-portrait taker who will be able to
use the 2.1 megapixel front-facing
camera to quickly and easy review the
shop by moving the phone downward in the
natural curve picture quality though is
pretty uneven considering the lighting
in one scene in my camera shootout I
found that while there were good shots
captured in broad daylight going indoors
already showed a big change in the
detail capture and even the color
saturation subjects that were supposed
to have very vivid colors tend to get
washed out for example as the scene
loses lighting the pictures get noisier
making this a less than ideal companion
to have in lower light indoor situations
like at parties despite os+ helping with
the general jittery movements in photo
and video it and the laser guided
autofocus are about all that
differentiates this camera from others
considering its mostly standard quality
as I already mentioned before it's the
software on this phone that seems to
make up the performance issues with the
G flex 2 even though it had been updated
to lollipop it just doesn't seem as
though the GUI has really been optimized
to its fullest potential on the
Snapdragon 810 that said there have been
a few changes to the way it looks
because of lollipop the recent apps
screen has been changed to a Rolodex
lollipop style and the notification
drop-down now uses cards but seeing the
original style and the quick settings
atop those notifications already alludes
the GUI is biggest detractor that it is
still mostly the same inside and out the
app drawer has the same style now very
cluttered by the sheer amount of extra
applications that were installed on my
version of the phone the settings area
is tabbed and it houses the many
different options that you can turn on
to tweak the experience one-handed usage
some gestures and a section to mess with
the NOC code are available speaking of
the NOC code it returns and is still a
pretty nice way of unlocking the phone
from the prone position really the main
enhancement here is the addition of the
quick peek activated on a turned off
screen by dragging one's finger down the
screen to see the time and the
notification bar if you're already a
veteran user of the GUI and some of the
aspects like the dual window really
speak to you then you're probably going
to have a pretty good experience with
the G flex 2 what gets me is that
despite some of the aesthetic changes
that did happen with this new version of
the GUI we didn't get that many
optimizations to really showcase the
Snapdragon 810 and as it stands now this
is simply not the right place for the
Snapdragon 810 to really show
itself and to me that's the biggest
bummer in the software section so though
the LG G flex 2 is now on pre-order with
Sprint in the States we have yet to see
where and at what price the phone will
be available on other carriers in the
West the off-contract price on Sprint
for the moment is listed at around $500
though the LG G flex 2 has proven that
curved displays can definitely work for
flagship smartphones the only
competitors will the curve displayed
thus far is the Samsung Galaxy Note edge
and whatever edge device we might see
from them at the upcoming Mobile World
Congress at Barcelona and so there you
have it the LG G flex 2 the updates to
this phone's design and the somewhat
faster camera experience are quite nice
to have but the day-to-day usage of this
phone is too uneven to call this a true
winner while I'm pretty sure that more
localized versions of the phone will
probably fare better in my testing I
still think that the GUI is just a bit
too cluttered for its own good and
doesn't really show the performance that
the processor is capable of as I always
say when you keep it simple you keep it
fast and in the G flex 2 that just
doesn't seem to be the case this is
still one of my favorite form factors
available now with it's much easier
handling due to a smaller screen and the
curve is not only different but proves
it's worth as a design choice I will not
go as far to say that this isn't a
worthy phone for daily usage but without
some real optimizations in the software
it's pretty clear to us that this phone
goes a few steps forward but loses
footing in where it counts most as
always thank you guys very much for
watching and I hope you enjoyed this
review of the LG G flex 2
despite the steps forward that it takes
in its design unfortunately in key areas
especially in the software and the
performance of it given the Snapdragon
810 it takes one big leap backwards and
unfortunately that's why I can't really
give this phone the high rating that I
was expecting to give him when it was
first announced at CES 2015 but
nonetheless hopefully the more localized
versions of the phone will fare a little
bit better but until we get our hands on
those keep it tuned to Android authority
