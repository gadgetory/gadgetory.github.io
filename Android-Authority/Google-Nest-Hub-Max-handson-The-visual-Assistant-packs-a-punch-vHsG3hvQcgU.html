today we are checking out the new Google
Nest hub and Google Nest hub max and if
you've seen this before it's probably
because it used to be called the Google
home hub but they're rebranding it to be
part of the nest ecosystem and there's a
few reasons for this one of the big
reasons actually is because you can use
it as a nest camera so if you've got one
of these in your house you can open up
the nest app on your phone you can see
what's going on in your home you can
connect to all your nest cams and just
kind of works as a nest cam as well as a
Google home hub which was already really
useful of course because it's like a
Google home hub you can use it as a
visual Google assistant so you can do
things like play YouTube you can play
music on it and it's just kind of this
combination between the Google assistant
the Google home hub and a mess so if
you've got the nest ecosystem populated
in your house this will slide right into
that ecosystem so one of the big changes
on the Google Nest hub Mac is the
addition of this camera and we didn't
see a camera in the original Google home
hub I was actually one of the main
features of the home hub because they
said that people didn't really want that
kind of security issue in their home but
because this is basically a nest it
really helps to have this camera here
but if you don't really want to use it
there is a physical switch on the back
of here that actually turns the camera
off but it doesn't just cover the camera
it actually just connects so you can
have this peace of mind that it's not
actually going to be recording with you
and you don't want it to know one of the
other changes here is obviously the
camera allows you to make things like
duo video calls and this is really
useful because the camera will actually
crop in and follow you around the room
while you're moving around the room now
we saw this on the Facebook portal so
it's a really similar concept but it's
really nice to be able to do a do a
video call and kind of be able to follow
someone around the room without having
to look at them really small on your
screen and because the nest home max is
a lot bigger than the original Google
Home Hub you've also got more speakers
you've got two tweeters in the front of
this thing and you've got one in the
back so it gets really plenty loud and
it's gonna be a nice
the home overall if you just wanted a
nice smart home speaker in your house
alright so if you want to get your hands
on either a Google messed up or a Google
Nest have Mac's they will be available
later this summer
for 129 dollars for what used to be the
Google home hub and $229 for the new
Macs so make sure you stay tuned to
Android authority comm and our YouTube
channel we're gonna have a ton of stuff
from Google i/o we've got a lot of new
hardware here a lot of new software
updates here there's so much information
so States you tour our website and I
will catch you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
