device does have some new design choices
that make it feel even more premium it
does omit some of the features that we
loved about the one from last year this
josh'll 4 guard from android thority
what's going on everybody and here is
your first and quick look at the samsung
galaxy note 5 versus the galaxy note 4
normally the Samsung Galaxy Note series
differentiates itself from the Galaxy S
line on the design front but this year
that just isn't the case comparing the
two devices you can already see where it
gets his inspirations from the note for
seem like a phone that really tried to
be executive with it's leather on the
backing and the metal frame that we
already loved in the note 4 but the
metal frame returns down the note 5 and
takes on the design from the Galaxy s6
but that also means a dual glass panel
design that might make this one of the
most delicate and also most expensive
phones you don't want to be dropping
anywhere the galaxy note 5 though still
retains everything that the note 4
already had in its design including the
button layout with the fingerprint
scanner that's embedded into the home
button up front that now is of a pressed
design instead of the swipe design that
the note 4 started from last year and
the press design does seem to fit very
well and it does allow for an easy way
of unlocking the phone but also the
galaxy note 5 does shed a millimeter
about in all directions so it does feel
a little bit more narrow and a little
bit smaller just that tiny bit from the
note 4 nonetheless though the material
choices make the note 5 feel a little
bit more premium and a little bit denser
that's not to say that the note 4 feels
cheap anymore it's just at the premium
editions of the materials in the note 5
are the upgrade that it needed in this
year's edition where we see the same
features return are mostly in the
display the Galaxy Note 5 features a 5.7
inch quad HD Super AMOLED display that
is just as good if not even better than
the one that we found in the note 4 and
it's enjoyable for everything from media
to text reading to all of the
multitasking and work that you would be
doing on either of these devices and
really we do think that the Super AMOLED
construction is still doing very well
for the note series now in performance
we now have a bit of a change in the
note line because after the Galaxy s6
Samsung decided to put Exynos processors
across all of their devices and that is
now the case in the note 5 now it's
going to be very
Artful especially with 4 gigabytes of
RAM that is made for all of the
multitasking that you're going to need
and that is a bit of a bump up from the
galaxy note 4 that have the Snapdragon
805 processor backed by three gigabytes
of RAM but it is but still the note 4
should be able to provide all of the
performance that plenty of users still
need so it doesn't lose too much ground
on that front and then of course we have
the construction of the s-pen which we
will cover a little bit here the note 4
S Pen did Nestle itself into the bottom
right corner pretty well and it was
pretty easy to pop out but now the
construction of the s-pen on the note 5
allows it to be flush with the design
and the reason why is because the top
portion is now of a clicky design you'll
be able to even click it like a regular
pen but it clicks into the chassis and
kind of keeps itself out of the way
until you pop that thing out and then
you're able to pull out the S Pen from
there now while you're probably going to
find some real holes from the note 4 to
the note 5 is in hardware and that's
because the note 5 taking on the design
of the Galaxy S six does have to omit a
couple of key features and that is the
expandable storage and also the
removable battery expandable storage is
something that I know a lot of users are
going to have some problems with and
because of that the Samsung Galaxy Note
5 will come in 32 or 64 gigabyte storage
options no 128 unfortunately and I'm
sure a lot of people will be planning
for what should have been a micro SD
card slot somewhere on this design in
the note 4 it was underneath the back
cover which also allowed for the
replacement of the battery and this time
around the note 5 has an embedded
battery that comes in at 3000 milliamp
hours we're not too sure if that will be
enough to make this phone go the
distance but should be enough for a full
days of usage with all the optimizations
underneath that the galaxy note 5 should
be bringing to the table now if we had
to pick one moment in Android wear
cameras seem to be evolving and
providing the picture quality that we
really wanted it most likely would have
been in the galaxy note 4 the galaxy
note 4 still boasts one of the better
smartphone cameras available in the
market thanks to its 16 megapixel rear
facing shooter with optical image
stabilization it produces really clear
very detailed photos with great colors
and the galaxy s6 only continued that
trend and that same camera from the s6
comes in the note 5 16 megapixels in the
rear-facing camera as well with five
mega pick
on the front trumping the note for which
only had 3.7 megapixels on the front
facing units now of course we're going
to put these two cameras against each
other in a camera shootout most likely
to see what the enhancements have been
made aside from just the front-facing
bump up in megapixels but really you can
expect that either of these phones will
still provide the great picture quality
that you've come to expect from the
Samsung lines and finally in software
what we had in the note 4 was kind of a
Renaissance of the s-pen because it was
made to be not only the great companion
for jotting down everything and also
making notes of what is on the phone
screen but it also was used as a bit of
a mouse on the note 4 much of that does
return in the note 5 but as has been the
trend with Samsung's new software
iterations it has been toned down a
little bit
that's not to say that the s-pen has
lost any functionality on the contrary
it has been given a couple of new
capabilities now in the note 5 you will
be able to make a screen memo when the
phone is locked you'll be able to take
out the s-pen when the phone is locked
and it will create a black slate that
you can create a quick screen off memo
with and even then the screen write
capability that was originally brought
from the note 4 has been enhanced to
become a scroll capture so you can get
multiple snapshots of the same webpage
you can get the entirety of the webpage
and be able to jot down all of your
notes on top of it from there you still
get the action memo and the Air Command
menu has been enhanced a little bit to
give it a much better look and you can
access and not only by pressing the
button on the s-pen like you did before
but there's also a floating button that
will allow you to get to it so you can
get to the three main functions of the
s-pen and also three frequency
applications with the even more powerful
processor and the four gigabytes for
multitasking we have no doubt that the
note 5 is going to continue the
multitasking prowess at the note 4 head
only is going to dial itself back a
little bit so it's not always in your
face with all of its features if there's
one thing that's clear it's that the
Galaxy Note 5 got the update that it
needed from the Galaxy Note 4 but the
more substantial and robust design
upgraded internals and of course and
improved software experience including
the new s-pen there are the little
details of the s5 that really make it
the phone that we know is going to
really sell well this year it's just
that a few of the choices that it made
especially in design
means that some of its features that
probably a lot of users really want it
are no longer in the note 5 you might
have to go back to the note 4 for those
that being said however both of these
phones still provide some great
experiences and the note 4 with a lower
price point from being last year's model
still might be one of the most viable
options in Android today but we're going
to put these two into a more in-depth
comparison so make sure you stay tuned

Galaxy Note 5 here at Android authority
