authority what's going on everybody and
last week we were able to go to South by
Southwest in Austin Texas but I was also
able to have a LG g5 with me including
the camera module and I really use the
LG g5 as kind of a vlogging camera in a
way to be able to test out the two
different lenses on there and also see
what the camera quality is like now we
do have to preface that this is a pre
production unit so we're not really able
to give you a review of the camera
samples but in this video we can show
you how good it is a video especially
when using the wide angle lens and show
you some examples of the normal lens
when compared to the wide angle what
sucks is that the front-facing camera
doesn't do 2k recording but the rear
camera does porque and if you want to
make sure that you're in the shot he
could do the wide angle lens
855 is still have like 45 minutes maybe
about an hour before i got to be on my
flight it's awesome i also decided to
try my hand at some of the time-lapse
videos now on the LG g5 the time-lapse
video mode is basically a regular video
sped up and in this case it was sped up
about 15 times at this point the
wide-angle lens was nice to use because
i did have to frame the actual scene at
least in this case myself and I could
pretty much be certain that I was going
to get everything I needed in the frame
because it has a 135-degree angle of
view is that rick ross that might be
rick ross
we risk it
every day ever for real alright alright
sounds good oh right behind me right
around there is a panel that includes JJ
Abrams and if you don't know who that is
that you're not a star wars fan and we
can't be friends the talk has been going
for at least a couple of hours now
people are still trying to get and we're
still trying to light for it the person
that is directing everybody pretty much
said you're here for the five o'clock
feel free to stick around for everybody
else JJ Abrams this close but of course
one of the main staples in austin texas
is its food and we had a lot of fun
eating all the barbecue and pretty much
anything that we can get our hands on in
between panels and also for dinner the
rest of the guys finally make it into
austin texas and one in particular
writer john died impressed us with one
particular thing you brought to austin
we're going to south buying style of
course for anybody that knows anything
about South by Southwest it's one huge
party the music festival and the film
festivals are incredibly fun to go to
and there's live music all over the city
we learned a lot at South by Southwest
but the thing that I learned when using
the LG g5 it's at the wide-angle camera
is a lot of fun and we look forward to
bringing you our thoughts on the camera
quality and bring you a full review of
the LG g5 when the time comes but for
now we hope you enjoyed this look
through the eyes of the LG g5 of South
by Southwest keep it tuned to Android 34
even more and remember to stay tuned and
watch our South by Southwest coverage
talking about VR cameras and 360 cameras
and then you can stick around for even
more because we are your source for all
things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
