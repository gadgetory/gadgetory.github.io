by bitdefender mobile security one might
be curved and one might be flat but they
are similar in size and they bring a lot
of the same things to the table hey it's
Josh magar from Android authority what's
going on everybody and this is your
first look at the LG G pro 2 versus the
LG G flex now while both of these phones
are quite big we did say that in the G
flex that curve from top to bottom did
help with the handling of the large
display now we are dealing with a 6-inch
display on the G flex and 5.9 in the G
pro 2 however both of these phones have
pretty much the same handling across the
board the G pro 2 does have a matted bag
instead of the glossy plastic that you
have on the G flex but the G flex also
did have that self-healing back that did
work for at least shallow scratches all
on although the build quality on both is
quite nice and you have to very
attractive devices in the hand you do
see a change in resolution when it comes
to the displays as the G flex does have
a slightly larger screen at 6 inches
over the 5.9 inch 1080p display found on
the G pro 2 however the G flex only
sports 720p resolution when it comes to
the G pro 2 you do have a great display
quality no matter what you are viewing
whether it's media or reading but the
same can also be said about the G flex
that curve does provide a very subtly
different experience when it comes to
viewing content on there but it really
doesn't change the experience all that
much and it still packs a very very good
experience so despite the difference in
resolution you'll have a great time
using either screen performance across
the board is pretty much the same
between these two devices because they
both come with the powerful Snapdragon
800 processor backed by the adrenal 330
graphics however the G pro 2 does
support more RAM with an extra gig
bringing it up to 3 gigabytes of RAM you
don't get expandable storage on the G
flex however when it comes to the
hardware but it does come with a decent
32 gigabytes of storage whereas on the G
pro 2 you are able to expand it with a
microSD card slot now both of these
phones do Sport 13 megapixel cameras but
we will say that the G pro 2 comes with
not only the OIS that we loved from the
g2 but also OIS Plus which has a
software boo
which makes it probably an even better
camera overall when it comes to the
software however finally we do see that
it's the same experience in either camp
even though the G flex does run Optimus
UI along that curve that it has in its
screen it really doesn't take advantage
of it much at all
the only real feature that you'll find
is that when you turn on the lock screen
you can tilt the phone back and forth
and then the lock screen will move along
the curve but that's really just about
it other than that the Optimus UI is
pretty much the same between these two
phones but the G pro 2 does introduce
some new software features one in
particular that we had fun using was the
NOC code in which you can unlock the
phone turn on and unlock the phone
rather by using a pattern of sequence of
tabs onto the turn off screen after that
the Optimus UI is pretty much what you
would expect it to be but it is in need
of an update whether it's on the g pro 2
or on the g flex we do what we would
like to see a new aesthetic look for the
Optimus UI as right now it is still a
little bit bloated and is a little bit
in your face with all of its features to
curve or not to curve that's essentially
the main question when it comes to the
differences between these two phones
while the G flex does have lower
resolution in its display I have no
doubt that you will still have a lot of
fun on it just as much as you might on
the G pro 2 these two phones are about
the same size so when it comes to the
handling it's about the same so really
it's kind of your pick if you want
something a little bit more classical or
you want something a little bit more
different and probably a little bit more
special in the LG G flex but in the end
it's up to you keep it tuned to Android

pro 2 and for all of our Mobile World
