much older than the other both are the
best phones you can buy right now but
which one is the better bye
hello everybody its Krista Laura and
this is a Samsung Galaxy s7 edge versus
the iPhone 6s plus first we have to talk
about this sizes of these two devices
the Samsung Galaxy s7 edge offers a 5.5
inch display and the iPhone 6s plus
offers a 5.5 inch display as well
however take a look at the actual sizes
of these two phones the iPhone 6s plus
towers over the galaxy s7 edge why is
this well it all comes down to bezels
whether we're talking about the top
bottom or even side bezels of the iPhone
6s plus their dimensions are much larger
than the s7 edges it makes for a much
harder time with one-handed use or just
gripping the phone over all your finger
has to stretch further Traxxas higher
parts of the screen and also this extra
width makes for a less secure grip in
the hand some argue that these large
bezels are needed to make a room for the
fingerprint scanner and to keep the
phone symmetrical but Samsung was able
to maintain thin bezels with a
fingerprint scanner and symmetrical
design which helps with one-handed use
and of course the s7 edge offers almost
non-existent side bezels thanks to the
curved display the glass of the s7 edges
screen is slightly curved on the left
and right sides which makes this device
one of the most beautiful phone designs
out there the way the light reflects
onto these curved size creates a
stunning look and also makes content
seem to pop off the screen both devices
have aluminum frames however on the
iPhone 6s plus this aluminum also wraps
around to the back of the phone where we
have an all-metal backing the aluminum
feels fantastic is very smooth and it
looks nice too on the galaxy s7 edge
instead of an aluminum backing we have a
glass backing which looks beautiful in
its own way once again it reflects lots
of light which looks beautiful but there
are some cons to this glass backing
although it's made from the strong
Gorilla Glass 4 with a hard enough drop
this will shatter and the glass really
shows off fingerprints which eventually
will defeat the purpose of having the
beautiful glass back when holding these
two phones side by side the iPhone 6s
plus is noticeably heavier at 192 grams
versus the s7 edges 157 grams but the s7
edge is slightly thicker than the iPhone
6s plus at 7.7 millimeters versus 7.3
millimeters volume buttons are on the
left side but on the iPhone we have that
silent and vibrate switch which is very
handy both companies managed to make
beautiful devices out of different
materials and of course cosmetically
comes down to personal preference but in
terms of functionality the s7 edge wins
by a large margin now let's get back to
that curved display that's the main
story with the Galaxy s7 edge a
beautiful 5.5 inch curved Super AMOLED
quad HD display and like I said the
iPhone 6s plus offers a screen size at
5.5 inches but there's a lot of
differences here first we're only
talking Full HD with the iPhone and now
that does sound pretty silly to say only
Full HD because Full HD is perfectly
fine here on a 5.5 inch display but this
is a comparison and when putting these
two phones side-by-side the s7 edges
display is in a whole other League we
get over 100 pixels more per inch which
creates crazy sharp texts and images and
this great resolution also opens up
other doors like the gear VR which
transforms the galaxy s7 edge into a VR
experience but when just doing normal
phone activities like watching videos
reading articles or looking at pictures
the galaxy s7 edge wins by far
especially thanks to his AMOLED
technology and this leads to other cool
features like using the phone as a night
clock without lighting up your room or
eating up your battery colors are also
much more vibrant on the galaxy s7 edge
which a lot of people will love however
bright in settings you can tone this
down to a more natural look which is
good for editing pictures color
temperature varies between phones so the
S of an edge does appear slightly warmer
and pictures have a little extra
contrast it seems but it's all up to
preference and like I said I really do
prefer the extra boost in colors extra
sharpness and overall nicer image the
AMOLED technology displays as I
mentioned both phones have fingerprint
scanners and they work great
they're both built into the home buttons
which are found on the bottom of the
device the iPhone 6s plus has very slow
unlocking animations where all the apps
slide into their places and it looks
nice but this animation alone allows s7
edge users to be able to unlock their
phones and get to work a little faster
than 6s plus users the bottoms of the
phones look very similar with the
headphone jack on the left charging port
in the middle and speakers on the side
the s7 edge still uses micro USB to
charge which is unfortunate because it's
not reversible like the lightning cable
on the iPhone 6s plus the 6s plus the
speaker is louder clearer and also has a
bit more bass to it yes both speakers
are pointed away from you which is
unfortunate and are very easy to cover
up but at least the sound is decent on
the 6s plus but there is a reason for
this weaker sound coming from the s7
edge behind the speaker is a protective
coating the hampers a sound but thanks
to this protective coating the s7 edge
is ip68 water-resistant so the phone has
been tested to survive within 1.5 metres
of water for at least 30 minutes if you
do this on the iPhone 6s plus well you
probably shouldn't a great feature you
get on the galaxy s7 that the iPhone 6s
plus does not have is a micro SD card
slot so storing large movies and lots of
songs or pictures is very easy and cheap
however on the iPhone 6s plus if you
want more storage you'll have to spend a
lot more money you can pick up the SM
and edge with 32 gigs of internal
storage for around 750 dollars
however the base storage size for the
iPhone 6s plus is 16 gigs at this same
price point which is a little ridiculous
especially for a phone that needs to
store large 4k video clips if you want a
total of 64 gigs of storage on your s7
edge you can pick up a 32 gig microSD
card slot for about 10 bucks
putting your price at seven hundred and
sixty dollars with the iPhone 6s plus
you're looking at 849 you are not going
to find two faster phones on the market
right now you can take a look at the
spec sheet between these two but with
different types of companies using
totally different types of processors
GPUs and even operating systems this
isn't going to need anything
so I ran these phones through some
benchmarks and they scored very
close however the s7 edge scored higher
on the Geekbench scoring while the
iPhone 6s plus scored higher on in to
two scoring
although these phones are on different
operating systems and the apps they run
are not identical both phones seem to be
just as fast as one another but when
opening up apps s7 edge seems to be a
bit quicker with most apps frame rates
while gaming is great on both which is
good for the s7 edge because it has a
lot more pixels to push however game
loading times are at least three times
faster on the iPhone 6s plus and now
let's talk about battery life it's very
interesting because the galaxy s7 has an
almost 1,000 milliamp hour larger
battery capacity than the iPhone 6s plus
yet both phones managed to get very
similar battery life but yes the galaxy
s7 still beats the iPhone 6s plus by a
small margin both phones can easily last
me all day with moderate use at the end
of a normal day of moderate use my s7
edge would have about four and a half
hours of screen on time with about 20%
left or my 6s plus with moderate use
would have 12 to 15% left
charging via cable is easier with the 6s
plus as Apple's lightning cables
reversible however it takes a long time
to charge usually around 2 hours from 0
to 100 the s7 edge can charge much
faster at a little over an hour and 15
minutes also you can charge wirelessly
which is very convenient and fast too
sometimes it doesn't matter which phone
has the best display or best design of
best features it comes out to what
operating system the phone is running
the iPhone 6s plus is running iOS 9.3
and the galaxy s7 edge is running
Android marshmallow 6.0.1 two totally
different operating systems and what's
great about iPhones is that when Apple
releases a new version of iOS no matter
which type of iPhone you have or which
carrier you have you'll be able to get
that update the day it's release whereas
on most phones without stock Android
you'll need to wait sometimes up to a
year which is unfortunate for some of
course iOS is more limited to what you
can do for example you can't place apps
anywhere you'd like you can't add
widgets onto your home screens you can't
download icon packs simple things like
setting default apps are nowhere to be
found
and of course more advanced things like
changing
launchers or creating gestures are not
available sure some users might not need
any of these features but it's nice to
know with Android if there is something
you'd like to do you pretty much can i
OS is a great operating system but my
biggest gripe with it is a notification
system at any given moment on Android
you can glance at the top left corner to
see which notifications you're missing
you easily slide down the notification
panel and swipe them away but with iOS
you never know what alerts you have
unless you look at the red bubbles over
apps or pull down your notification
panel and swipe to the left also getting
rid of them takes a few extra clicks
with iOS each phone has a big softer
feature like 3d touch on the 6s plus and
edge panels for the s7 edge both of
these features act as a way to add
shortcuts without cluttering interfaces
3d touch is a software and hardware
feature because the iPhone 6s plus is
display is pressure-sensitive so
pressing down on apps with force allows
extra shortcuts to appear edge panels on
the s7 edge allow you to swipe in on the
curved edge size to access apps app
actions widgets news and other things
but both are a great feature to have
iPhones have always been known for
fantastic photos but last year Samsung
stepped up their game and delivered a
smartphone camera that could compete
with the iPhone and although they've
made fun of the iPhone for having a
lower megapixel count this year they
lower the galaxy's megapixel count both
phones now have 12 megapixel cameras
however the actual pixels on the s7 edge
are larger which allows for more light
to come through which helps in low-light
photos the theme here is going to be
softer darker and less contrast the
images will be taken with the iPhone 6s
plus while the s7 edge will have a lot
more sharpening contrast and vibrant
colors going on on paper that sounds
like the s7 edge destroys the iPhone 6s
plus and although there is a big
difference between the two a lot of this
comes down to preference immediately
you'll notice much more toned down
colors on the 6s plus with s7 edge
boosting these colors to create a much
more yellow image the s7 edge seems to
stick out of your first glance with
these extra colors but the iPhone does
do a better job at exposing the photo
and this extra softness looks very
natural if we zoom in here you'll notice
s7 edge over exposes and loses some of
the texture also within the shadows we
lose information here you can see that
the s7 edges lens is a little more wide
angled which helps get more information
in the shot I didn't move my feet
between taking these two pictures this
is without HDR on and you can see that
the 6s plus is a better job at exposing
keeping the blue sky present while still
having the subject bright if we zoom in
to these four bolts above these rocks
you'll see that the s7 edge is a lot
more post processing sharpening going on
which does look very nice creating a
sharper image colors also pop a bit more
with the s7 edge if you compare the red
mulch on the bottom the only thing I
enjoy more with the s6 plusses photo is
a deeper blue sky in this photo I've
really tested the HDR capabilities with
each phone with an extreme test this is
with HDR off and this is whip-it on HDR
on the iPhone 6s plus is very subtle
really whether you have it on or off
it's not going to take a horrible photo
and make it amazing or take an amazing
photo and make it horrible with the s7
edge HDR can hurt the photo sometimes
but in this case HDR allows for a much
nicer photo it's much brighter you can
actually see the trees in the background
whereas on the iPhone they're almost
black in this test you can see the
difference in focal lengths and also how
that large aperture on the s7 edge comes
into play the iPhone 6s plus can't get
as close to objects as the s7 edge and
also has less of a bokeh effect and also
the s7 edge has full manual controls
which help with this shot the iPhone 6s
plus is not capable of this all this
talk of Samsung lowering their megapixel
count and creating larger pixels really
doesn't make a difference in the test we
just saw but in lower light there's a
big difference in low light areas the 6s
plus will appear to have almost a haze
over the photo when compared to the s7
edge the s7 edge creates much brighter
photos with punchy colors and lots of
detail this extra boost in colors takes
these low-light shots to a whole new
level and when zooming into small
objects in these photos the s7 edge
retains a ton of detail so you can
easily make outwards or even individual
buds on trees that layer of haze on the
iPhone 6s plus is always present making
the s7 edge a clear winner every time
there's a big shift in color temperature
as well but the
sevens warmer colors always seem to
represent the scene better of course we
still have the beloved galaxy wide-angle
selfie camera my taking group selfies
with the iPhone you never get enough
context as to where the shot was taken
which is kind of the point of taking
selfies with people with the s7 edge
you'll be able to include much more
context show more of the background
which really gives no reason to use
something like a selfie stick you can
get much more people into the shot even
if the post-processing seems to soften
the face is a little both phones take
great 4k video and thanks to optical
image stabilization video comes out very
smooth but the iPhone is much smoother
it's really incredible how smooth your
shot is with the iPhone almost like
you're using an expensive Steadicam the
s7 edge does a great job too but the
software does warp the video a little
more and the optical image stabilization
does a little less to get rid of
shakiness but in terms of quality though
it's the same theme with being used to
the s7 edge has very bright and vibrant
colors which looks really good but has
some trouble with exposure and the 6s
plus its colors and brightness are toned
down more but with that you get a very
natural-looking video one area with
video where the s7 edge clearly has the
iPhone beat and pretty much any phone is
its focus feeds it instantly locks onto
objects never letting your audience wait
for your footage to ease into focus like
a dozen the 6s plus both devices
showcase their operating systems in the
best way possible the best iOS device
ever made and to lots of people the best
Android phone ever made although I'd
have to say the Galaxy s7 edge without a
doubt beats the iPhone 6s plus in every
aspect better display better battery
life water-resistant expandable storage
and wireless charging then we have the
preferences like design camera and of
course operating systems it's hard for
users to switch to something they're not
familiar with like operating systems but
with the s7 edge besting out the 6s plus
in almost every area I'd say it's easily
worth the adjustment and that is the end
