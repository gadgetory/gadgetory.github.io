authority and how does Motorola's
inexpensive flagship fare against
arguably the best Galaxy S samsung has
ever produced let's find out with the
Moto X pure edition versus the Samsung
Galaxy s6 the first thing you're going
to notice right off the bat with these
two phones is how different they are in
terms of design and overall aesthetics
starting with the Moto X you have a
phone that looks pretty similar to the
2014 Moto X except it's grown quite a
bit due to the bump and display size but
otherwise it's still pretty much the
same there's a metal band that wraps
around the entire body and the corners
and backside are curved which gives the
phone a very comfortable in hand feel
it's not the easiest phone to use in one
hand but the thin side vessels and small
top and bottom chin makes the phone a
lot more manageable than you might
initially think for a phone with a 5.7
inch screen the Moto X is also quite
easy to keep ahold of especially if you
opt for the standard grippy silicon back
but if that's not your cup of tea you
have plenty of other options buy a moto
maker moto maker offers some pretty
extensive customization from different
material back choices like wood and
leather accent colors and personal
engravings or greetings to truly make it
your own
with the galaxy s6 there's only a
handful of color options to pick from
but the big story here with this year's
Galaxy S is Samsung's decision to
finally ditch the use of plastic for an
all metal and glass design it still
looks like a Samsung device through
through but it feels a lot more solid in
high-end just the way a flagship device
should the metal and glass does make the
phone feel somewhat slippery and the
glass back can be a fingerprint magnet
but being that it's a much smaller phone
in the Moto X it's much easier to hold
and use in one hand moving on to the
displays you have a 5.7 inch LCD display
on the Moto X and a 5.2 inch AMOLED
screen on the Galaxy s6 both are coming
in at a resolution of 2560 by 1440 so
they're both extremely sharp panels but
you are getting a higher pixel density
on the s6 due to the smaller screen but
it's a difference that you're most
likely not going to notice where you
will notice the difference is in the
display tag with the AMOLED screen on
the Galaxy s6 you're getting those
vibrant saturated colors and high
contrast
that we've all come to expect with
amoled and you're also getting those
inky dark blacks which is not only great
for battery life but it just looks a lot
cleaner compared to the grace looking
blacks on the LCD of the Moto X that's
not to say that the Moto X has a bad
display by any means it's a great
looking screen overall with surprisingly
great colors viewing angles and
brightness and even though I missed the
AMOLED of previous Moto X's I don't
consider the switch to LCD to be a
deal-breaker you're also getting more
screen real estate on the Moto X and if
you're big into gaming and watching
videos on your mobile devices you're
going to have a much easier time doing
both of those on the Moto X specs wise
you're looking at a Snapdragon 808
Adreno 418 and three gigs of RAM on the
Moto X pure edition and over on the
galaxy s6 you're looking at the Exynos
7420
and also three gigs of ram but on the s6
you're dealing with you much faster ddr4
ram over the ddr3 of the Moto X the Moto
X may not be the most heavily Specht
Android device on the market but
Motorola's focused on the Moto X has
always been more about providing a great
user experience and it definitely does
exactly that thanks to a mostly stock
Android experience and lack of bloatware
the Moto X is fast fluid responsive and
hardly ever skips a beat swiping
scrolling opening of applications
multitasking gaming the Moto X does it
all very well and to Motorola and the
end user that is what's going to matter
most the Galaxy S line on the other hand
has always come packed with whatever is
currently deemed as the latest and
greatest specs but performance
historically has never lived up to
expectations but Samsung changed all of
that with the s6 not only is it being
powered by a very powerful chipset and
fast memory but it actually performs the
way a flagship device should much of the
performance improvements lie in
Samsung's optimization of their TouchWiz
software and with less bloatware less
unnecessary features the s6 is easily
the fastest and smooth as performing
Galaxy S phone Samsung has ever released
it isn't perfect by any means that still
has some flaws like the aggressive RAM
management but it still leaps and bounds
better than what we've seen from Samsung
and years past for storage the Moto X
comes in 16 32 and 64 gigs whereas the
galaxy s6 starts at 32 and goes up to 64
and 128 gigabyte options from there even
though the s6
128 gigs and you're getting a much
higher baseline storage capacity
the Essex doesn't have any room for
expandability like previous galaxy s's
the story is the exact opposite on the
Moto X previous models didn't support
expandable storage but this year's Moto
X has a microSD card slot embedded in
the SIM tray so if you opt for the 16
gigabyte model you might still be able
to get away with it by popping in a
microSD card another advantage of the
Moto X has is in speaker quality the
Moto X features dual front-facing
speakers which sound awesome and it's
easy a much better experience for videos
and games over the single bottom mounted
speaker of the s6 the essence of speaker
is not bad or anything and can actually
get quite loud for a single speaker but
when you put it next to the Moto X a
pales in comparison one piece of
hardware on the galaxy s6 that you won't
find on the Moto X is a fingerprint
scanner if you like the added benefit
and security of having a fingerprint
scanner then the one on the s6 isn't
going to disappoint it's fast reliable
and easy to set up and the touch and
hold method is much more accurate than
Samsung's previous swipe gesture as for
the Moto X well you're just gonna have
to wait and see if Motorola decides to
add one next year with the battery
you're looking at a 3000 milliamp hour
cell on the Moto X and 25 50 on the s6
or 2600 milliamp hours if you're using
the edge variant another one is
removable which is nothing new to the
Moto X but it was quite the change for
this year's Galaxy S battery life is
definitely better on the Moto X it isn't
by much but I can get a full day out of
it at the least whereas with the s6 I
typically find myself having to recharge
at least once throughout the day both
phones however do feature fast charging
by Motorola
turbo charger for the Moto X and
Samsung's adaptive fast charging for the
s6 so they're extremely easy to fill up
and in the case of the s6 you also have
the option of wireless charging the
camera on the Moto X this year is a 21
megapixel sensor with phase detection
autofocus and F 2.0 aperture and with
the Galaxy S six you have a 16 megapixel
camera F 1.9 aperture and optical image
stabilization the Moto X has never
really been known for its camera but
it's improved quite a bit this year and
can finally stack up to the rest of the
competition
both the Moto X and the galaxy s6 are
capable of taking some pretty excellent
looking photos in most lighting
situations but I would give the edge to
the galaxy s6 for its better
range and low-light performance thanks
to the built-in oh is where the Moto X
really falls short is in the camera
software it's just too bare-bones
especially in comparison to the s6 which
offers quite a few more options and main
controls and tapping on the viewfinder
to take a photo on the Moto X just
doesn't feel as intuitive as having a
dedicated shutter button both the Moto X
and galaxy s6 are running on Android
lollipop but there are two completely
different experiences with the Moto
actually have a pretty close to stock
build of Android with just a few
customizations from Motorola all of
which are really useful you can do
things like twist your wrist to open up
the camera chop twice to turn on the LED
flash glance at notifications with moto
display or discreetly perform voice
commands just to name a few
the s6 features Samsung's typical
TouchWiz interface on top of Android and
even though it's still a far cry from
stock it's a much cleaner and slimmer
build of TouchWiz than we've seen in the
past there's a lot less bloatware and
Samsung's got rid of a lot of the
unnecessary features but you still have
many of the more useful ones like multi
window and motion gestures like swiping
your palm over the screen to capture a
screenshot or flipping the phone over to
mute a phone call Samsung still utilizes
the same blue and green color scheme
from previous versions of TouchWiz but
if you're not a fan of that you can
easily change it now with the built-in
theme store it's extremely robust with a
ton of themes to pick from now and you
can even make it look more like stock
Android if you want and to me the theme
store is probably one of the best
features on this new version of TouchWiz
if you're concerned about updates my
money would be on the Moto X to get
updated to marshmallow first since it
has a more stock like Android experience
but fingers crossed that we don't have
to wait very long for either device to
get updated as with any smartphone price
plays a very important factor with each
passing year phones seem to get better
while becoming more affordable at the
same time and with endless customization
through Moto maker a large queue HD
screen front-facing speakers and a
pretty decent camera the Moto X is
easily one the best bang for your buck
smartphones of 2015 at $400 the galaxy
s6 is clearly the more expensive phone
at several hundred dollars more but it
does offer a few things that the Moto X
doesn't like a fingerprint scanner
wireless charging and more powerful
specs you'll have to ask yourself if
those features are worth the extra cost
and if they are then you won't be
disappointed with the galaxy s6
if you're looking for a smartphone that
can provide a lot of value for not a lot
of money look no further than the Moto X
pure edition as always thank you guys so
