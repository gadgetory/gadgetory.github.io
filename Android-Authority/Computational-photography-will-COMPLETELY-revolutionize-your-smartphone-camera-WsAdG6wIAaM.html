computational photography because
honestly this technology is going to
completely revolutionize the quality of
your smartphone camera okay so when I
say computational photography
you might be thinking those AI or Scene
Recognition modes that companies like
Huawei have introduced in their phones
and that's part of it but that's not
what I want to talk about I want to talk
about the computational photography that
makes all of your photos way better so
one of the examples of computational
photography that you're probably
familiar with is Google's hdr+
technology now this was developed by a
dude named Mark Lavoie who used to be a
professor at Stanford but he actually
left to work at Google to develop this
technology for the Nexus 6 his share
plus works by taking a bunch of photos
with really short exposure times this
means that the highlights are never
gonna get blown out and really they're
just very underexposed but it takes the
cleanest of those images and then stacks
all the other images on top and that way
it's able to take the average of all
those pixels raise the shadows and come
up with an image that has really great
dynamic range now this process actually
took quite a bit of time on the Nexus 6
in the Nexus 6p
you probably remember hitting the
shutter button and then waiting a while
for that circle to go around and round
before you could actually look at the
image it took the Google pixel got
around this by stacking the image sensor
directly on top of the DRAM chip this
made it so it could read out the data
way faster put it through that
Snapdragon processor and produce an HDR
Plus image before you even knew it was
taking one this is what's led to the
amazing photo quality of the Google
pixel and the Google pixel - and you
probably didn't even realize that you
were taking an HDR plus image but you
were but let's look into the future a
little bit you know CSI they can zoom
into an image and enhance it to suddenly
make the image way more clear and just a
lot cleaner
well Nvidia is actually working on a lot
of similar technologies that are gonna
make that a reality
a really cool example that I saw from
Nvidia was this new denoising algorithm
that they've got so basically you take a
really noisy image like any regular
image that you
would get in photography and they can
completely denoise it by running through
a machine learning algorithm this could
actually make hdr+ way better because
when you raise the shadows of a really
underexposed photo
it generally adds noise so now Google
could take even shorter exposures get
darker images raise the shadows and just
get rid of any of the noise that they've
got there that way you've got more
dynamic range in a cleaner image over
all the other cool party trick that in
videos got is a new enhanced AI content
to work fill so if you're not exactly
privy to what content aware fill is
basically in Photoshop or another
similar program you can scrub over an
portion of the image and the program
will basically fill in that part with
whatever it thinks should be there well
it's never really been that great in the
past and you've had to use some other
techniques to clean it up Nvidia showed
off a version of it that is just
mind-blowing
basically you could scrub it over
someones face and just completely get
rid of wrinkles get rid of that chair in
the back of the room or annoying
painting that you don't want to be on
the wall it'll basically fill it in with
what it thinks based on the AI machine
learning algorithm said it's got running
and this is way way better than anything
we've ever seen before now we saw Google
start to do this before about a year ago
they had a new feature in Google Photos
that they called remove object now this
hasn't exactly come to fruition yet but
the whole idea is that you could be at
your son's baseball game take a picture
of him through the grate and then just
get rid of the grate in post and that
way you just see your son and all the
air around him there's nothing actually
obstructing your view now the craziest
part about all of this is none of these
techniques actually use that much extra
hardware in your phone
Google's pixel and pixel two phones are
still considered some of the best camera
phones on the market right now and
almost all of that is software it's only
gonna get better over time and I can't
wait to see what Google does with the
pixel 3 the nice thing about most of
this being software is that even lower
end phones can get some pretty stellar
cameras xiaomi recently released the me
a 2 which is a 250 euro phone that has a
really good camera it is an Android one
phone which means that they worked in
very close association with Google and I
assuming that Google sprinkled a little
bit of their software magic in there to
make it compete with the Google pixel
one and even the Google pixel two you
can probably expect more low-end phones
to get some pretty good cameras in the
future but I'm even more excited with
what you can do with a really high-end
phone with a great processor anyways
thanks for watching guys let me know how
you like the format of this video I'm
trying to be a little more narrative
with the videos in between all these big
phone launches so leave your comments in
the comment section below I'll jump down
there and talk to you guys soon and I'll
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
