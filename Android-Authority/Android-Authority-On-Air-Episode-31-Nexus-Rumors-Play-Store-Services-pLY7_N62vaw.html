original hangout show for android on
google+ I'm dare cross I'm Scott
Anderson this week we have returning
guests dan Charlton of timett as well as
fellow android enthusiasts John Franklin
welcome back guys glad Evie again again
except everybody that's good though so
Scott what fun stuff we're gonna Ram a
ramble about this week we got some big
Android ecosystem information uh
according to like place for downloads
Play services some new stuff that Google
is kind of building on right now we go
over some app updates and new releases
devices ICS updates and jelly bean
updates a little bit patent wars or do
some routing in ramen and we going over
some other stuff towards the end so
special stuff for at the end so yeah
alright so this little party hats and I
wouldn't have which was a party after
this announcement I said everybody put
your party hat on its do you have your
party hat you have your little uh your
your champagne to toast or your know
your beer whatever happy birthday
Android the Android SDK is now
officially four years old as of sep
tember 23rd earlier this week four years
ago the Android SDK released one for
Android more what was it now so
depending on what date you want to
celebrate say the Android is now
officially four years oh and for
something that's being four years old
they had a milestone this week Google
Play formerly in droid market had 25
billion downloads that's law balance so
in comparison iOS when did they reach
that how long it take them to reach that
unix we keep hearing a google play as
verbal content ah bad so celuyu no
comparison here so I less it took them
1334 days which is just under three
years and eight months to get 25 billion
that's 1334
android it took 1435 days or three years
and 11 months so just about pretty much
longer to just about three months apart
here you know I mean that's that's not
bad um and because google is amazing
they are celebrating this week by
offering 25-cent apps hobo jack some 25
movies muff own 25 banned books 25
albums that change the world and so
forth basically they're 25 and all the
things and you should check it out it's
it's nice to get some cheap contents and
achieve apps that generally cost a whole
lot of money like office suites are
normally 15 bucks running yet you know
quarter that's oh yeah it was a steal
you have to check it out definitely it's
good i have to admit I've games you like
I saw me to cut the rope was on there
you know take a paper camera was one I
use that a lot actually yeah yeah old
facebook mmm and also you guys have a
credit lying around from that nexus 7
purchase uh now enter it's a very good
way to use your additional small amounts
oh yeah and every sense left at
ninety-seven cents long ago leave us a
message yep there you go yeah you can
easier i mean what one else you gotta
find a 25-cent hapless to do uh you know
another ten cent deal but that was ten
billion downloads last year or so film
people see ten for a while but he had 25
cents go ahead and spend your last few
remaining nickels and dimes on here with
your credit so speak at Google Play
google play yet yesterday started to
roll out something called google play
services and this actually brought you
pretty awesome isn't it it's a it's a
nice game changer in my opinion it was
showcased at i/o a few months ago and it
was yeah it's not soft for developers um
right now it's an automatic roll out if
you haven't noticed yet chances are you
may even have the app installed on your
phone or your tablet you didn't even
install
it's already there but for whatever
reason you know if you didn't have it
you can go to the Play Store and search
for google play services and installed
if you didn't get it already so now so
if this thing is such a badass no you
know what does it do well doesn't it
does three main things oh right now in
version one it does Oh auth 2 point 0
google+ sign-in and google+ +1 button
yeah those are three little features in
the beginning and those are kind of
minor to the the whole mindset of what
this is going to do so we all know that
you know carriers and OEMs are the big
Debbie down when it comes to pushing out
Android updates and in New api's come
out for Android that offer such and such
feature allowing access to the latest
and greatest people product api's and
takes forever for people to get those so
what if they bundled those api's and
service and it that service didn't need
to rely on updates coming from you know
your carrier or in your OEM if they came
directly from google so this will allow
you know like i said allow access to the
new product api's instantly basically i
was in a couple days everybody will have
them um now a little bit about OAuth so
Oh offer those either don't know it's
it's a temptation right so when an app
needs to access your your private data
in your google account this new tool
will allow that application to securely
access your account information without
requiring you to enter your account
information in plus you know we all have
super secrets secure passwords right you
are oh you know very conscious about
security so who wants to enter a really
strong letters and numbers you know
password all the time just when you
install new back so this is great this
is a great for security and it's great
for users to know that you know that
they they don't have to worry about
affecting their privacy or security
online
um so the next version is rumored to add
even more core services you know more
than just Google+ integration and you
know more than OAuth eventually more
products will probably be taught into
this but right now it's you know like i
said no authentication applications will
be able to access your you know your
plus one maybe you'll be able +1
something in an app and the app itself
will be able to have a Google+ sign-in
I'd be interested in seeing an app that
has all the plus ins but categorized I
think that'd be very cool um to do I
mean it would show all the different
types of things that people that you're
following and with their movies books
websites websites related to doing
certain things how you be pretty cool so
I'm looking forward to this yeah it's
nice having just just in the Play Store
what people recommended every single
almost every app that I go to download
has got somebody from my circles they
recommended it yeah it's nice to see
more of it though yeah okay so let's
move on to apps a new app that came up
today is one baahubal our a section of
Google as we kind of figured out it's
called field trip basically it gives you
location-based nations of locations that
may or may not pertain to you basically
you can based on their location or
recommend certain things and you can
select everything that you want to be
alerted about you get your notifications
off my personal view is Google Maps
works better in field trip that it does
in the Google Maps app I don't know why
but it does and I don't think it's at I
mean I only played around with a field
trip for a little bit so or I don't
think it's that much faster you don't
good here I give it credit I tried it
for a little while haven't driven around
but I've seen some people that are so
gotta say lived in Louisville and he was
running through town and eat while he
enabled it where the voice actions would
announce
pop up the cars while he was going down
town and it actually gave him
notifications of a couple of venues that
they had and they had a concerts in the
area and gave a little link where you
can go to Psalm cake and find more
informations pretty cool the one thing
that upsets me and it's kind of shame on
google for not sticking to the holo
theme and I mean that I mean if you are
building op it's a beautifully designed
app now it is a beautifully designed app
but the thing is that does not promote
what if they're trying to teach the
developers into developing as a standard
and if you're trying to make a standard
you need to do it yourself I agree with
that idea but also I saw some of those
transitions and i use it for a few
minutes in and I was like a little kid
in candy store grinning you know I
thought so that the animation was pretty
cool but what's up you know
functionality you know are you I I mean
user interface aside here let's talk
about replicating existing services so
field trip some right it automatically
provides you information when you're in
an area now doesn't that sound familiar
don't we already have an application to
kind of provide you information when
you're in an area now Google now Google
now tells me hey Derek you want to check
into this restaurant in this bar so you
know yeah it's already it's already
telling me that it's already knows my
little my G patients are you in here now
field trip will say did you know that
this bar was built in 1817 in its bulova
law historic landmark okay well that's
cool by only two apps doing the same
thing as 2 apps getting you take it sir
it's actually three apps cuz the thing
that's telling you to check in is
latitude then there's places another
sort of division of a nap cuz both
latitude and that are parts of males the
way now no plus about field trip hey
about schemer because I can pull ups
seamer and hitch and open it up and when
you get mighty quick and say look and I
could type your bar or food it'll be
like Oh your friend wants to go to this
restaurant wants to go to this bar bill
de Beauvoir so why
why did I mean why don't have so many
apps to do the same damn thing I
understand that you know they each one
does something a little bit different
but they have both features overlap in
so many different places thank ya
there's a lot of things they could
afford to converge think it is a good
test app for growl feel or at the mine
that's the thing that's the I think
that's the future of phone UI in general
is contextual stuff how long is it going
to be before Google now is powerful
enough and has enough of an API to
become your home screen yeah and I think
that right now since Google now doesn't
really have a whole bunch of settings /
notification that it gives you once this
once they figure out what field trip if
it works well and how to implement it
will then they can add deeper
integration on that specific
notification for google now so I guess
we might see another app by a smaller
team of people that dives into specific
features maybe movies or something like
that that will then eventually add more
functionality google though well you
know i don't know about you but my
battery life is one of my biggest pet
peeves with my phone I don't know I have
the same phone movers have the same type
so I rochas Snapdragon s4 in it and gets
great battery life well well you know
what being that's I'm gonna give you a
high five yeah me you're also on a
carrier that doesn't force you to sit
you know through three months of a
Google Experience device stared anybody
else carrier that allows going to get
relatively fast speeds without having to
maintain two simultaneous connections to
two different network architectures
those pretty nice advantage saying here
that we have multiple apps running you
doing geolocation services and automatic
data services and that's definitely
going to cost a little bit of battery
life I'd rather have it bundled into you
know one half instead of for absolute
lapping services in my opinion
eventually is going to be done on the
hardware level
okay so Colin Tom's been preaching it so
another app that was updated I'm not a
new app but one that we has grown near
and dear to our hearts as YouTube it got
a whole new UI refresh some people like
it some people don't like it what are
you guys is initial opinions together
guys like it you guys not like it
personally I dude how like it but it's a
subjective I'm in the comments section
and they're related physical I'd like to
go the Plus app does he like it John
because it reminds you google plus no no
it's not because it reminds me of google
plus i think google plus is a
well-designed app it kind of has that
card you I I think that's the where
they're taking the UI I may not that
swipeable tabs on also hollow compliant
and either but uh I personally I jumped
as a comment it's nice to just scroll
through a list rather than swiping all
over the place but the I guess the other
good thing is they say it brings that
you I down to with a 40 and above so
yeah I mean I that's another good thing
that came so a lot of people aren't on
Ice Cream Sandwich it so I don't like it
yet because you know i don't like a
whole lot of change in my apps and less
you know it's as drastic change its
gonna it blows me away right now like
swiping from left to right to see you
know comments related videos you know
whatever scrolling down is great too but
i prefer swiping because i thought that
was easier that's just me I'm you know
ask me in a month I'll be like this is
the best thing ever but from but right
now right now I don't like it the one
thing i don't like about it is the fact
that you don't look it just you know
likes and dislikes when you go to video
you mean you had to click the you down
type yeah I so let's move on to some
devices um we recently i think it was
like four days ago released in iphone 5
drop tests versus the samsung galaxy s3
um it's got a lot of views and
we just like reading one well I'll tell
you what last last week whenever we were
doing this video I got some insider
information during the show last week
about which 11 and I was not surprised
because you know the 4s versus the
galaxy s3 it was never one even a
contest and won and this time around it
wasn't even a contest again but it was
the other one winning you know like I
was amazed um it's a solid device I want
my next device to be that solid you want
yours your joint your next device to
have paint that'll chip and show a
different color i got i have that one my
incredible to did to say i think it
shipped off real nice hey there's a lil
silent along yeah but the thing is I'd
rather a stick personally just because
you know you scratch plastic when you
get under it Oh plastic events the same
color so you want a phone with scratch
it or you don't want to film scratches
you'd rather have all the smashed face
that you can't use no no i'd rather not
drop my phone yeah i would rather not
drop my phone too but if i had to drop
my phone what do i want a phone it's
scratched what i want to phone with a
broken face i'm going to choose a
scratch every time although I you guys I
mean yeah oh yeah if you take it over
that but it's hard to predict that I
mean even in a drop test it's on cuz you
could drop a phone five times and it
will land differently every single time
it's hard to say oh no you saw it will
shatter to a million little pieces Oh
kind of like if you looked at the drop
test iphone fell on its corner almost
every single time so and you know it
maybe it's prone to maybe that's where
the weight is distributed but you can't
guarantee it's gonna happen I also think
I see through the galaxy s3 out of it
out of his hand the one time instead of
actually dropping it but I'm not blaming
him when your watch hours later listing
later Darcy I'm just saying that uh it
it you definitely dropped it harder than
you did the iphone but i couldn't do any
better I mean it's really hard to hit
the same amount of pressure and drop to
anything that's what all that all
approve does a whole bunch of money was
wasted and and it has like five million
views or something right now so so go
watch it if you haven't they did to help
a job it's got like about actually
almost eight out good that I guess the
main thing to take out of it as it is
more durable than the 4s was in that
area not that it took a lot to be like
that but it does hold up to the back
hasn't made out of regular glass Gorilla
Glass know the front of it was grilling
us the back was just playing on a glass
worse exactly why do you think it broke
so easily it's just I just don't those
videos are just great because it
actually gives a real-life situation
something that actually happens and I
mean he dropped it from his pocket he
dropped it from you know like pulling it
up to his ear he dropped from his ear
and then you know no one actually stands
there holds it three feet out from their
body and says okay let's drop this phone
you know so then they did real world
drops which everybody and let's uh here
you know certain people that have you
know Bionic spider-man fingers that can
hold onto your phone you know yeah we
dropped your phone right mmm what's
their tests against a nokia device yeah
in all though texas instruments uh-oh
map not really gonna be investing a
whole bunch of money in 20 map yeah it's
kind of surprising there I mean they
haven't been entirely clear on it but
they're pretty much closing down the
whole map shop you know that clear if
the omap five is going to happen or not
um which is a little disappointing
because it's supposed to be really
really compelling offering in the market
so it's it's kind of disappointing
they're pretty much rolling that up but
there hasn't been a lot of details about
how quickly they're shutting it down the
promising continued support for existing
devices which includes the Galaxy Nexus
includes all of the Kindles it includes
all the nooks includes a lot of
motorola's includes a lot of ties
so yeah and it is for those but really
unclear about what's going to happen
after that after that yeah and I it
seemed like they wanted to do more
integrated things like with machinery
and cars and things like that which i
can understand but I in this booming
mobile market I don't understand it
right now and I just can the other warm
I mean they they're facing harder and
harder competition NVIDIA has really
exploded onto the scene in a big way and
Qualcomm is continuing to just eat up
the marketplace especially in the US and
T I was never big outside of the US in
the first place so motorola was one of
their biggest customers and they're
getting there well i got multiple year
contract with intel at least yeah well i
mean they're they're committed to making
some devices with in town but even still
nobody can sell a chip in the united
states that's going to go into a device
that can't support LTE and right now
qualcomm is the only player in that game
to your Chanel's man starting abdel just
analog radio they can do the same things
that's what the iphone is using but
that's just now hitting the market so
nobody heard canal de stella chip in
America for the last six months other
than Walt I'm happy and don't forget
about the the Intel medfield the
processor you not look around where is
it in America it's going to the UK it's
coming here with LTE house that was
reported this week that's something
we're going to talk about little bit
later yes reported is coming months and
months away the last six months there's
been no alternative but Qualcomm not
just it just makes me when Samsung is
you mr. Lee wasn't alone chips in their
products that they're selling in the US
it makes me feel a little bit sad to see
TI go out right now because the automat
five was so promising you mean like
better than samsung exynos 5250 promise
again it I've been a big time because
they put a lot of rd in the thing
because it was probably the first
example of a Texas Instruments processor
that they went one hundred percent in
far as the graphics processor and
everything will they used to use older
GPUs and kind of overclock them but
it's cut out a nostalgia too because the
first android phone HTC g1 had a nomad
process you can original droid had a
nomad processor and filling it they're
capable was just kind of sad to see if
you know what do you want how to
Qualcomm processor are you sure yes
research uh I know the wrong once before
do it later yeah unless t i started
making MSM processors and not home at
processors and I didn't and I shouldn't
even said anything because you're the
you're the cpu god you know everything
about itís yeah that's a second time
ever been wrong it's fine so this week
we also got some leaked pictures of the
HTC One X plus my personal view is we
need to stop doing buttons our buttons
soft touch buttons buttons but Lisa
didn't do a legacy Menu key like Samsung
did agree agree no but they're doing the
same sort of options yeah yeah after
Corey Knebel in settings it's just
developers need to get on board yeah i
mean that's that's something where HTC
has really taken the teeth I mean I get
why you're staying the on-screen buttons
I like having capacitive buttons on my
phone I honestly do i get my HTC
continues to put them there and and
they've really taken the teeth on that
but it's really not their fault that
somebody apps to look like crap in that
setting they don't make those apps it's
facebook's fault it's Twitter's fault
its major companies that are just too
lazy to update my biggest gripe about
them is they're not customizable I can
flash a rom and have as many button as
as I want in whichever order I want
Scott everybody flashes wrong yeah well
yeah we got those buns mr. argument you
shouldn't have to root if you want to
show off the quality of the platform you
should be able to have it bone stock and
showed off and and I kind of liked the
back home recent I haven't changed it
honestly in a while I I used to down
like wood okay this recent what does it
do I use it all the time now yeah I mean
I I customize the
customize the functionality my buttons
but I customize the way that they looked
all the time I like I like the ability
to do that I can't only I do get some
nail polish or something and do that to
my my hardware buttons fair enough oh so
uh wait Scott it's not tell me about
ruining it's this new thing right no no
dan we do root and ramen already put
Scott on schedule to talk about this
please I'm you know I'm on the Dinosaur
the new bloods moving in now all right
so let's talk about some remote wiping
ability Scott oh yeah I saw this um I
don't know a whole bunch about it so I
knew that it was possible with a sgs3 if
you got a malicious link that you could
potentially wipe the person or get your
phone wipes is that correct yes a quick
and dirty version is some phones have
the ability you type a super secret
phone number to your phone you know it
with you know asterisks and pound and
then numbers and when it factory resets
your device it gets for support purposes
really and some TouchWiz phones as well
as some HTC phones it was found
initially on the galaxy s3 this week too
if you went to a website to have this
link embedded on it or and you clicked
on the link and the native dialer would
come up and try to call that link
because that's that's how he enjoyed
works well if the if your phone was one
of the phones that could launch a link
to a number and factory reset your
device well a noob's could have happened
so so some people checked it out a
couple devices were found to be
susceptible to that yeah s3 actually um
and over the air update had actually
patched that but the AT&amp;amp;T galaxy s3 the
galaxy s advance as well as the galaxy
s2
I believe the HTC Desire I could be
wrong on that but now at least one HTC
phone was found to be susceptible as
well and um hopefully you know the other
devices are being addressed but right
now you know the big guy the galaxy s3
did you know make sure you have your on
a custom rom or your or your running the
latest firmware over they are updating
and you'll be fine I did say they do
have an application on the market now
that the developer put out to you can
stop that a lot with a number from
that's like two dollars and sixty-seven
cents I'm sure he's about to make some
bank on that thing well anyway another
way to do it is don't use the stock
Android Browser use chrome and I think
it really the best way to do it is don't
follow strange links that you don't know
what are well yeah so basically general
email rules apply great like the bottom
line answer in this is when somebody
says they're from Nigeria and you 15
million dollars don't follow the link or
or if they have a magical way to make
money on craigslist alright so let's
let's get into the fun stuff at least I
think it's the fun stuff it's this it's
the fall every week hopefully fingers
crossed confidence hi we're gonna have a
nexus rumors a section and this week
we're going to start off with a whole
bunch of fun stuff so today actually we
got some reports from DigiTimes that
we're going to have a $99 nexus 7 by the
end of the year as well as a 199 version
so you know now and that's all we don't
know anything else but you know then you
know every talking head including
ourselves you know starts to figure out
well you know how can we get down to
that ninety nine dollars it is it going
to be the mac same hardware if so is it
going to be ad supported to get down to
that price they're going to be a loss
leader is google going to know cut the
cut the fifty dollar product costs on it
then is a loss and make it up by you
know app sales because there you know in
the
Google Play content is making a lot of
money now or is there going to be
carrier subsidized because remember that
there's a 3g variant rumor two so is it
going to be in the ninety nine dollar
version going to be the carrier to your
contract edition that's why it's 100
bucks because you're going to pay a
monthly data fee so there's a lot of
things that this could also not even
happen to but if it does you know how I
didn't get down to that hundred bucks
you know or is the current version Wi-Fi
version going to be bumped down to
ninety nine dollars for whatever reason
you know somebody got a good deal
somewhere in hardware and and the 199
version is going to be the new the new
version that comes out in six months you
know I'm sorry that comes out for
Christmas or something which puts the
puts the nexus 7 it's six months too old
then so yeah we we could see something
the rumor could be true well what do you
guys think on that I don't see them
stepping up the hardware at the same
price point in the in that's faster time
yeah do a like an upgraded water I see
the 99 now I one being possible because
there's a lot of relatively highly
powered and relatively inexpensive chips
about to hit the market so I think that
they can drive down the price it won't
be in the same performance category as
the nexus 7 right i mean that's got a
quad core processor it's a pretty
powerful machine I think it'll probably
be a much lower clock dual core or even
a high-class single core processor but I
think I mean I think that they can hit
that price point and so you know be at
least right around breaking even oh yeah
remember right now that the building
materials was sitting at 152 dollars I
think yeah yeah it's a guest in the
obviously one yeah when you factor in
marketing and later everything else
they're probably right around break even
on the Nexus 7 yeah so al-amin make a
profit on the telly time will tell and
you know is anything it's a device is
gonna be six months old it's time to
update so who knows maybe that maybe the
new Nexus 7 will be part of their
upcoming five rumored Nexus devices yeah
I'll me that there's also there's all
sorts of leeway here but another rumor
we can talk about is the LG optimus
Nexus which
is based on or supposed to be SPECT off
of the optimus G a Spanish Website
translated to using google translate
this week said that someone close to
Vodafone says that the LG Nexus will be
based off of something similar to the
Optimus G you'll have a 4.7 inch screen
and it'll offer extremely high screen
qualities and detail and detail
extremely high such as apples Retina
Display so it could be in comparison to
that so that's nice in that kind of goes
off of other devices that we've seen up
in a rumored you know so far to have
what 440 448 you know pixel density on a
1080p screen so yeah you know apples
retina displays only 326 I believe so
that's it yeah is that a Genesis this is
the same 4.7 inch I think it's 1280 by
768 or something that LG's using for the
optimus G that's at like four hundred
and twenty six ish one second so we
don't know what's going to happen right
there right to have that rumor out there
mean that but that's a it's an i SPECT
phone oh yeah i mean that's have the the
s4 pro the new Adreno 320 GPU with the
quad-core Krait processor that's gonna
be a beast in not any other things I'd
like that the LCD displays it 720p look
a lot better than like the LEDs right
now just because of non pentile like
them yeah 1x display all the other ones
I mean they're just beautiful dis
probably it's a beautiful display but
maybe if you go compared that you know
even a Galaxy Nexus or even as three
yeah I was so you're not depleting of
whether or not a high-resolution screen
would be good but if you use it all the
time and it's with you all the time why
not have you know a really high
resolution screen battery life cannot be
concerned by it's gonna take more juice
to push all those pixels so you have
battery is definitely gonna be
sorry but as tech gets better and you
know our conception will go down and
eventually batteries will slowly like a
slug get better um but you know what oh
in four different geolocation services
on top of that did you know yeah they
just think if we have a lunatics
territory just like communication
devices just think if we had a limited
battery just think of the possibilities
that we could do with yes yes just think
if it we lived in a world where there
were about it energy how much more we
could do it without having to worry
about things like oil or coal over its
nose every hour you get on that you
invent perpetual motion and haha next
week next week you can be can we could
talk live on the chip about patent troll
all the energy companies so uh Samsung
Galaxy Nexus to had some fun stuff this
week I so flashback to the nexus s it
was leaked via images on on picasa and
the nexus s 4g images leaked I'm sorry
images from a camera camera shots and
the Galaxy Nexus known google+ and
picasa images of the nexus 7 images so
this week three images appeared on
picasa with exif image data stating that
it was the the GT I 92 60 and that is
the rumor device that could be the
galaxy nexus two is it we don't know
does that device exists probably but is
it the next Nexus from Samsung who knows
all we know is that images most likely
appeared they the exif data could have
been faked but I'm kind of sensing a
pattern here since every Nexus device
has shown up on picasa yeah there there
are a lot of interesting patterns with
all of these Nexus device rumors
actually it was on the house luggage but
these had some interesting ones there's
there's a lot of really interesting
stuff
coiling around these this army of necks
I yes so I i mean i remember of the
nexus 7 images were leaked on google+
and and picasa as well since is pretty
much the same thing for images you know
those images disappeared later that day
you know after everybody blew up saying
look these are pictures taken with a
nexus 7 so if these images disappear um
other pretty much guessed and then
confirm themselves that then no this is
that uh that is true but who knows up
history may not repeat itself we don't
know and last but not least this week we
had rumors and information about the HTC
nexus 5 i'm not going to say that word I
hate that word it is a smartphone it is
a mobile device as a mobile computer it
is not any hybrid word is a phone well
when is three is four point eight inch
screen what's the yeah what's like two
inches of a difference I mean how does
that quiz into that hybrid category all
of a sudden well like so so yes so this
this hybrid category of the word that
shall not be named um usually working
for more than five inch device in this
life but it the droid incredible X or
the idea HTC dicks but the vix I took
the bus gonna be called hahaha call that
down here for that reason if they're
bringing the wood to market the good
doesn't good slogan let's be on a poster
somewhere and what that device is
rumored to be the device that the Nexus
5 is going to be based off of its going
to be a 5-inch 1080p display Snapdragon
s4 pro quad-core twenty five hundred
million power battery possibly up to
64gb of storage LTE and the nexus 5 i
like that name because it it clearly you
know plays on the nexus center all right
what's that i said i don't think that's
what it plays on i think that it's
interesting that there
rumor is a nexus 5 from HTC built off
the droid incredible acts because the
next one from a sea was supposed to go
to verizon and didn't because i realized
google and verizon couldn't gretel
couldn't get it together use that which
we can see again with ya the next
challenge the nexus one was a precursor
to a lot of great device destroy it
incredible was the spin off of that for
verizon the desire kind of came out of
that fold the evo kind of came out of
that fold yes both of those are the Earl
yeah those are all in riveted the same i
started edge to you in a nutshell let me
do a Nexus device and have a droid
incredible as the verizon spin-off since
clearly google and verizon aren't going
to be happy together again I think that
makes a lot of sense and I think that
that kind of lends credence to the rumor
plus the number five is not so much a
play on seven but there was the nexus
one second device was the s third was
the Galaxy Nexus fourth was the seven
that'd be the fifth Nexus device they
need nothing they honestly need a device
like this for a nexus because yes the
nexus s and the Galaxy Nexus don't get
me wrong they are honestly great devices
but there was almost if you look at the
nexus one HTC did put everything in that
phone yeah I mean that phone the very
first with an AMOLED display the first
with the one gigahertz cross they pushed
the limits on that and the Galaxy Nexus
and s we're kind of on par with whatever
samsung had that here in some cases
under par they need somebody that's
hungry to make an essence ya know I just
want to take it to the next level and I
think you know give give one of the
other people a shot give it the HTC or
LG motorola because they'll they'll put
something out there to get their name
and get their reputation back up yeah
Samsung has nothing to lose they have
nothing to gain by out doing their own
devices with the Nexus the others kind
of do right so let's talk about some
jellybeans in an Ice Cream Sandwich
updates ok well the transformer prime of
the tf201 jelly bean update is rolling
out now on
this takes away flash support takes away
Wi-Fi directs the direct support adds
all the other jellybean goodness but how
is that functionality but you're getting
jelly bean you know sister walk faster
update button if you if your system
update button is not worn out right now
he's gonna wrong they're mashing that
button and on for the transformer pad
infinity they delayed it for us and
canada it should be available early next
week so if you guys got those um check
into that and we also do have the
android binaries were updated um this is
really nice p for developers the galaxy
nexus for verizon specifically was
released other up other devices were
updated but they're all available at the
next download site so if you want to
flash back to stock you can flash those
also the nexus to the nexus 7 get
updated to no no dude didn't it no the
nexus 7 did not get updated we got
buying new binaries though yeah it's on
talking about the libraries for updated
but that means that like you go and
download ones their current what's on
the device yeah but so the binaries dig
it updated and newer than what they were
yesterday but they aren't newer than
what's on the device and Jamie she said
that the latest binaries should add
precision touchscreen firmware so all of
you that are having no III person
haven't seen if a lot of people complain
about touchscreen issues after you use
the device for a while the touch screen
starts to suck so I'm guessing that that
these new binaries for touchscreen and
based off what he says should fix that
problem but uh if you're not rooted
you're not going to know but you're not
gonna test it right now you have a
custom wrong you're wrong developer has
to download the latest binaries slap
them into the rom and you know compile
it
it over to you um and over the air
update it comes out in the future for
the nexus 7 will probably have those in
there but the average Joe or the average
god that doesn't reap their devices
won't uh won't be able to so the sgs3
the galaxy s3 it got the international
version they're going to soak test of
jelly bean some screenshots and devices
getting jelly bean specifically in
Poland the Atrix 2 is getting an ICS
soak test so I should be coming up soon
um you know update updates are sometimes
funny because what happens is is is it
you know people expect they're gonna get
them soon back sooner than later and
wait and it and they just keep mashing
that I update but honey and and they
don't get them but let's talk about some
updates at that people do get um so the
ICS uh updates from Motorola were
announced and the Bionic a lot of people
actually earlier this week we're talking
about it yeah Bionic and they said by
quarter three it was going to have ice
yes well in quarter three is done and
you know I just don't have ice yes but
Motorola came out remember Motorola's
now Google came out and said hey Bionic
owners we're sorry that your phone has
been the redheaded stepchild of the
bunch um we're we're going to do you
write eventually and you should have ICS
by sometime in court for so it's really
really hard this time I mean as I was
quarter four starts wasn't quarterly
quota for started a cup a day no wait no
money i'm a bit fun day yeah goober
October yeah so it gives me a little bit
more faith because peanut Sony was over
Google
Plus in a lot of areas and everything
he's been pretty interactive with the
people about it so that's a good thing
to see anyway you know is it just comes
straight out and say you know we look we
know you've got a raw deal with this
we're going to try to make it right yeah
that's great they're going to do that
you know and remember if your phone
doesn't get get enough if your motorola
phone does get an update you need a
hundred dollar credit to get a new one
yes so but do we have any other updates
uh for jelly bean and ICS this week
Scott nope you still can't get it okay
I'd say um samsung also released there
around the devices will go ahead put the
link on the on when we post the show so
you can check out and see if your your
device is listed there if it is going to
be getting jelly bean or not so patent
wars then I defer to you because you are
you're you know besides our CPU expert
you're also our legal expert so so what
I guess what Samsung files customer do
not take my words as legal device simply
Samsung filed motions uh I guess uh
misconduct or something this past week
yeah they base held a motion to
basically giving the judge the option of
either setting aside the jury's verdict
and re ruling the case in Samsung's pay
her or route to setting aside the jury's
verdict and sending it back for a new
trial on in the filing they sighted over
100 different instances of misconduct
things along the lines of Apple being
given the opportunity to cross-examine
this deposition hence am so not that's
that's kind of a constitutional
amendment that you're supposed to be
allowed to cross-examine witnesses go oh
yeah but there's that whole law thing in
the way of that isn't that a lot to do
with time allocation though it did some
of it was and that was another one of
their points is that there's a time
allocation but Samsung's plan on that is
you know what it takes a long time to
explain some of these things and 24
hours each two percent of these
arguments is just not realistic and I
mean they're right it's
there's a lot of detail and what these
patents are about in 48 hours of
depositions just is not enough to get
into that and um I mean there were a lot
of rulings that were very inconsistent
there were times when the judge barred
samsung from presenting certain evidence
and then Apple presented that evidence
anyway which is fine but that's supposed
to open the door for samsung to then use
whatever argument was originally barred
and she'd prevented Samsung from doing
that so there were a lot of legal issues
and then there's a big chunk of redacted
parts of the claim that are more or less
about jury misconduct and Samsung has
moved to suppress it and suppress
continuing documentation on that front
in an effort to protect jury members
from public reprisal but basically
they're saying that the jury did not do
their job in a lot of different ways
based on some of the other appendices
and things that they're attaching to it
they're pointing out the fact that part
of the jury instructions was to
specifically not like rely on personal
experiences or your personal feelings
about patents or your personal
understanding of patent law and yet to
have repress outlet that he can find the
jury foreman has been telling the story
of how the entire decision hinged on his
personal experiences with Padma and
owning patents so I mean they pretty
obviously did not follow the rules that
they were giving so yeah well Apple is
filing to add on another three quarters
of a billion dollars to the verdict
Samson's basically saying this product
was ridiculous one of their other claims
in there is that no reasonable jury
possibly could have found sent apples
utility patents to be valid or design
patents excuse me they also questioned
the utility patents but they flat out
said no reasonable jury could have found
these valid and they're right I agree on
that especially some of them in like the
prior art that went really high art
right there is another misconduct
problem the jury members a flat out said
they just didn't bother considering
well this all kind of go with the trial
was about and they just didn't bother
considering whether or not patents
reveled in the first place and skip them
right on to whether or not they're
infringing so yeah you might be
infringing on this patent but if it's
not valid then what does it matter I
just like how much the cherry statements
have shot their own verdict in the foot
because they have opened the door wide
open for its on appeal had they been
quiet it probably would have stood like
it was is the bad guy but the jury just
basically gave Samsung an appeal on a
silver platter oh yeah I mean that you
have edit guys he'll this is before even
it gets to an appeal this is basically
Samsung saying this trial was so
horrifically bad that we don't want to
waste the Court's time with an appeal we
need to just go back to square one and
start all over be interesting to see Lou
yeah I mean it's the motion is in front
of judge Koh so as being a problem
because she's not likely to endorse a
motion that basically says she wildly
mismanaged the case but it's a very
strong motion so it's going to be hard
for her to kind of weasel her way out it
now let's talk about rooting in ramen
and in this week in only a segment that
I cover but root and ramen noodles this
week will be covered by Scott since I
created a monster about a month ago the
guy's flashing different roms every week
test them all out he's flashing kernels
he's flashing recoveries he's
customizing to where he breaks his soft
keys and has to be factory images I mean
this guy's a monster so Scott what we
got rooting around in this week uh yeah
do flash ever really yourself um but
yeah I mean it's it's nice um okay p
jelly bean version 3 added some
functionality and a lot of bugs are gone
there was some notable features that we
have are in the drop-down notification
when you get a text you can quick reply
to it which is really nice um also some
extra calculator features are also
vibrate and ring
well you can put in the name rate as an
average target which is nice and the
biggest implementation I think are
adding with the quick reply is the
stopwatch and countdown in the clock app
so instead of going and changing like a
setting on the app um you switch from
side to side and you go to a stopwatch
countdown and a alarm timer now I don't
really stop watching countdown is from
sizemode a actually released it and then
aokp is using that that code in their
wrong so steep cm10 as that as well they
are the ones that actually put that out
they release the app on the market
though and you know open source it did
it they put it on the Play Store so it's
anybody can uh and then uh Derek you're
running cm10 right all right yeah I'm
run cm10 and you know what Oh y'all bad
for a little bit what what version was
bugging and whatever you want out so
well CCM yummy is its Knightley's right
so they're breaking something and fixing
something every day because I mean
that's what night bazaar it's bleeding
edge alert they're constantly adding new
code and everything um so wow this is a
great seal oh so uh it's too so sit
asiento those are you watching a
wondering why we are laughing Google
Docs when you're doing a show of one
person talking and other people typing
can get very distracting and very
humorous because people had things that
shouldn't be set we use the they hang
out google doc plug in and have a dock
with our show notes our agenda stuff
like that we're really professionally
didn't know we did that and sometimes
we're really unprofessional and edit
what someone's supposed to say even you
know they put some things in there and I
yeah it leads to fun okay so um to see
another nightly cm10 yeah nightly is
yadda yadda yadda i installed the m1
want to came out two weeks ago roughly
something like that the the milestone
the monthly bills whatever you know it's
cm10 is great i love it you know tons of
customers a
eventually it'll be extremely stable
extremely fast and then in my opinion
will be the best rom to run right now I
know it's still growing it's still in a
nightly state the m1 you know I'm happy
I don't have that doc opened anymore i
minimized it clear see you guys laugh so
um 10 was was uh was laggy it was very
laggy and I ran for two days and I
couldn't handle anymore now I'm back to
bugless beast uh I had some insider
information from my my wrong groupie she
told me that cm10 lag was fixed she had
heard so i installed the latest nightly
yesterday and lo and behold it was fixed
there was no lag it's nice and fast and
i decided i was going to stick with it
until i realized that my battery life
was absolutely horrible and a toss it
five o'clock today I'd ten percent
battery left with only 50 minutes of
screen on time in 15 hours of all yes
owner yet it's the thick I'm not this is
the impossible I mean III love what the
developers do or doing what they're
doing and like I said this is eventually
going to be the best rom there is in my
opinion but right now it's it's a
nightly build that's that's happened
why'd you get to that point it's not
really daily driver usable if it's not
metal better Lawson so no I said no
without looking into it Ivan what I've
had a chance to look at you know
wakelocks or anything to figure out what
it is but I'm pretty sure my every time
I phone goes to sleep I'm pretty sure
the Wi-Fi is cycling because I see it
connect to 4g and Wi-Fi constantly I see
those cycle constantly every time i
unlock my phone so that that's just a
guess without looking into it i'm going
to geek out with it maybe later after
the show tomorrow at some point try to
figure out what exactly is causing that
just because i want to know but uh you
know chances are in a day or two that a
night we could fix that you know and
that's the beauty of nightlies you might
run something that for a day or two
but it's going to be great in two days
you know until the next thing is you
know but let's see it would see Emma me
not they've added
everything that I can think of that was
in cm9 he got the map navigation um at
the bottom about the buttons you can
customize the notification drawer is
completely customizable again lock
screen widgets lock screen sliders so I
mean the notification LED which is very
nice you have custom LED notification of
colors yeah I mean I like it I love it
no it's I just wish my battery you know
I can do more with my phone and have it
last an entire day but that would get
fixed sure you know you know by the time
next week who knows it could be fixed
but if I yeah that's not that's been my
experience but Scott said century new to
around the block to routing and ramen
noodles um I want you to I want you to
do me a favor I want you to try
something completely different cuz
you've been sticking pretty close to a
OSP based wrongs um you know bit of
vanilla looking wrong yeah cm10 cna
bugless beast aokp want you to try mi UI
for me some over the next week doing the
android run it for a day see if you like
it or not i just thought you know I mean
the decks that rom is still near and
dear to my heart because I was the first
run that I love to do all sorts of
Android hackery on that's where I met
Dan but uh I I like em on us yeah I want
you to try then let me know what you
think um just uh and then way we will do
a jellybean miui show them your future
that should be interesting yeah all
right so uh real quick to wrap up here
if it's not on the Android BBQ oh yeah
that's a shame I'm going to be at the
big Android BBQ a lot of people are
going to be at the big Android BBQ
John's gonna be at the big Android BBQ
gonna be there's gonna be a lot of
learning a lot of vendors giving out
free stuff a lot of fun you know maybe I
don't drink beer maybe another person
will that would be so awesome okay I'm
sure somebody will ya uh could be a good
time anyways my point is in celebration
of the 25 billion play downloads and
Google you know 20
iving all things the guys over the big
Android BBQ decide to 25 all the things
as well and they're either giving a
twenty-five percent off the ticket
prices right now so if you if you're on
the fence of going you want to say a
little bit of money that's a good time
to do that and if you're into collecting
things and want to collect stuff it will
eventually be on Pawn Stars and then you
know down the road the Android
collectibles the series 3 is you know I
came and say it's now available it was
available this week if you're new
collecting things not really so much for
you after all you can still find him its
doors and I'm sure in the near future
we'll have another run by triple the
price yeah well you know they might they
said they're gonna have more stock
eventually but right now they're all
sold out they were eight bucks apiece 16
in a whole block or box you can buy them
individually if you want it sold out at
11am in the first 10 minutes um then a
little bit later they had a second batch
sell out and then it 11pm they had the
next run vailable nuh and that sold out
as well very very quickly so yeah I
ordered some I I can't wait to get mine
here a couple days I maybe we'll do an
unboxing you know video showing them all
off your nose but yeah so if you didn't
get them you want them you know in the
near future you'll be able buy them
amazon other places well we'll have them
most likely for a lot more money if you
want quicker um our galaxy note 2
