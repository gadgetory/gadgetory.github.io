an update it's Joshua car from android
authority what's going on everybody and
here's your first look at the second
generation of the moto 360 Motorola has
finally unveiled the second generation
of their very well received round
SmartWatch and in the Moto 360 we have a
few different options two of which are
going to be seeing here as the Moto 360
sport unfortunately at our booth was
going to be just dummy units but here we
have the 46 millimeter and the 42
millimeter sizes in the Moto 360 all
available with a bunch of different
options in the band's and even the
finishes what we have in the 46
millimeter option which is touted as
being the one for mostly men is a 400
million power battery underneath a 1.5 6
inch LCD display at 360 by three-thirty
resolution now the 42 millimeter variant
is the one that they did say it might be
a little bit more fashion of a little
more accessible by those with smaller
wrists not necessarily just women but
that is what they showed in their
particular presentation the 42
millimeter Varian comes with at 1.37
inch LCD display with 360 x 325
resolution but both sizes are covered in
gorilla glass 3 now if you look in the
back of these devices you still have the
same heart rate monitor that's available
there that will be used across the board
with moto body which is the particular
ecosystem that is being used by moto for
health but it still taps into google
fits and the actual design of the body
itself we still have of course the great
touchscreen up front but now the power
button has been moved up to about the
two o'clock position which gives it a
somewhat different look from the Moto
360 a little bit more distinguishable
but what might be even more
distinguishable are the lugs on the top
and the bottom now the original moto 360
was a little bit tough to actually
change the watch strap on because of the
positioning of the bars but now with
these lugs it'll be a lot easier to get
them out and that's especially
considering the quick release pin that's
on the side there for both of the straps
on the top and bottom which allowed them
to be released very easily then you can
put any watch strap that fits on there
that you wish now that's really nice and
the lugs do make this look a little bit
more like
invention will watch especially more
akin to the SmartWatch we've seen from
other companies recently that have this
type of design but really it looks quite
nice and the Moto 360 is now part of the
moto maker family so even today you will
be able to already customize a moto 360
and have either leather straps or even
metal straps and change the finishes and
colors a little bit on the actual body
itself which is really great as moto
maker should provide a lot of
customization options even in the watch
face for everyone out there the non
sport variants of the watch are
available for pre-order already starting
today in the Google store motorola calm
and even best buy the ranges of the
price are between 299 + 40 and is
depending on which style and which band
that you select but the new watches will
be available in late-september across
the board so we're really excited to get
our hands or rather to put the Moto 360
2nd gen on our wrists and really see if
this brand new version lives up to what
the Moto 360 started in the round
SmartWatch revolution so keep it tuned
to android authority for that and even
more as we bring you the best coverage
