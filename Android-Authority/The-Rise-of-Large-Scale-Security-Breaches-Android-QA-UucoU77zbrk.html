you by Norton security so you've been
surfing the interwebs enjoying your i
can has cheezburger puppy pics when you
have a thought I think I'll check my
match.com account to see if that russian
hottie has responded to my love poem hmm
yeah you're gonna be perfect for each
other but when you login you realize
your password doesn't work and while
you're at it you notice that your credit
cards being used to buy dead rats for
someone's pet boa constrictor now you my
friend are up poop creek without a
paddle what to do what to do so here on
android to a i try and cover topics that
affect as many of us as possible and
when it comes to large-scale data
breaches that affects a lot of us in
September Home Depot confirmed that
hackers had broken into its in-store
payment system and stole the credit card
numbers for as many as 60 million
customers target also fell victim when
someone installed malware into target
security and payment system designed to
steal every credit card used at the
company's almost 1800 us stores now for
those of you who may be rolling your
eyes at that saying hey I don't shop at
home depot or Target or I don't live in
the US so that doesn't affect me do you
have a steam account I know a lot of you
are gamers will steam to have their own
problems to the steam attackers used
login details from the forum hack to
access a database that held ID and
credit card data and if that doesn't
convince you of the severity of the
issue even the US Postal Service fell
victim to hackers when hackers had
access to over 800,000 of employees
private information those hackers aren't
too smart though because you never mess
with the mailman now a recent survey
done by creditcards.com found that forty
five percent of users polled said that
they would definitely not or probably
not make purchases or retailers that had
known security breaches so that security
breach at target cost target a total of
a hundred and forty eight million
dollars ouch
hurts that hurts like so much like a
technophobe that confuses his facebook
status bar with the google search bar so
what to do what to do well today we're
going to talk about how to protect your
credit card information in particular
and let's start with number one
immediately report to your bank or
critic our company when you suspect a
suspicious transaction you're much more
likely to successfully plead your case
if you have reported the transaction
soon after the transaction happened if
you've waited weeks or months it's much
harder to make the case that that is a
fraud on charge and not a legitimate one
on your behalf now I am questioning this
because the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau in the u.s. claims
that if your credit card number is stole
but not the actual physical card you're
not responsible for those fraudulent
charges but how do they know what the
frontal in charge is by just taking your
number unless of course the the
fraudulent charge is in a different part
of the country or different part of the
world how do they really know I don't
know about that one what do you guys
think in the comments so number two be
wary of anyone trying to contact you via
email or phone to quote verify your
personal account information companies
like eBay and Amazon repeatable web
properties don't do this so watch out
for this this here is an authentic ebay
login URL it's real and legitimate this
is a fake ebay login URL if you were to
go to that address or click on that link
and then login your personal account
information you've now given it to
hackers and you can be sure they will be
using it for nefarious means so you have
to be really careful that the URL that
you are going to is an authentic one
hackers do a good job at taking or
piggybacking off of reputable web
properties like eBay or Amazon Facebook
and stuff like this where people do
login with personal information like
credit card and passwords and stuff like
that and because most people trust it
they don't look very carefully at that
you are
you want to check that out all right and
number three if you haven't already done
so is check this vid out I did a couple
weeks ago all about online privacy and
protecting your personal information
especially password protection really go
check that out take care of it and take
care of the rest of your family because
I take care of you in this bed now you
guys should know that when it comes to
online security issues like backing up
your data or scanning apps that have
privacy risks Norton security will have
you covered make sure to check it out
