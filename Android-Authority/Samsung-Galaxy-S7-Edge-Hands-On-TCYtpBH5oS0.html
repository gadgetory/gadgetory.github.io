Authority and this is the s7 edge it's
one of two of samsung's latest flagships
and this year's Galaxy S line is more of
a refinement than a complete revamp
which is perfectly fine because there
wasn't a whole lot wrong with the design
of last year's model it's still made of
glass on the front and back with an all
metal frame but everything pretty much
has been rounded off at every angle the
back tapers down on the side similar to
the note 5 and all the corners and sides
have been rounded off as well which
means it doesn't have that sharp feel in
the hand that a lot of people complained
about with last year's s6 edge and
overall it's just a very comfortable
feeling phone Samsung has also heard the
complaints and added back a few features
that were stripped away from last year's
s6 and s6 edge there's still no
removable battery but it's ip68 dust and
water resistant again and Samsung has
brought back microSD card expansion
built into the SIM tray but you also
have the option of running two SIM cards
instead if you don't care about the
expandable storage another big issue
with last year's Galaxy S was battery
life but with the s7 edge packing a huge
3600 milliamp hour battery inside there
should be no reason why this phone can't
go a full day if not a little bit more
it's a little bit larger of a phone this
year as well and most of this is due to
having a bigger display it's a 5.5 inch
quad HD screen and it's AMOLED just as
you would expect from any typical
Samsung phone so of course you're
getting those super vibrant saturated
colors wide viewing angles and inky deep
blacks it's an always-on display now too
which means you can peek at your
notifications calendar time and weather
all without having to wake up the phone
and samsung says it drains less than 1%
of the phone's actual battery life the
dual curved edges still give off that
really cool waterfall effect and Samsung
has added some additional software
tweaks to further take advantage of the
edge display you still have the people
edge and apps edge just like before but
now you have two columns of apps which
makes it a lot more useful new to the
edge UI is the tasks edge and what
Samsung likes it called the edge panel
the task edge is pretty self-explanatory
unless you add a shore
cut to specific tasks like adding a
calendar event composing a text message
or taking a selfie to make things that
you would normally do on a daily basis
much quicker and easier the edge panel
on the other hand is basically a bunch
of customizable widgets that you can
pick and choose between such as stocks
Yahoo News Calendar or whether to
quickly give you information at a glance
the software is TouchWiz on top of
Android marshmallow and this is probably
the cleanest version of TouchWiz we've
seen yet the squared circle icons aren't
the most eye pleasing things in the
world but they're definitely a big
improvement over Samsung's previous
icons and they finally ditched the
blue-green color scheme for a much more
simple looking blue and white the camera
has also seen quite a few improvements
first off the large camera bulge is
pretty much gone for the most part
there's still a slight bump but it's
nowhere near as drastic as before and it
definitely makes for a much cleaner and
more streamlined design the camera
itself is a 12 megapixel sensor which
may sound like a downgrade from last
year's 16 megapixels but this reduction
in megapixels allows for a much larger
pixel size at 1.4 microns for improved
low-light performance which is augmented
even further with the wide F 1.7
aperture the camera is also utilizing a
dual pixel setup which is the first of
its kind in a smartphone and this allows
for much faster focusing even in
low-light and trust us when we say this
it's pretty damn fast now as far as
specs go during our meeting Samsung
would not mention the processor or Ram
we're assuming the Exynos 88-90 but
we'll definitely keep you posted on
android authority com1 samsung confirms
this information
so until then hopefully you enjoyed this
quick look of the Samsung s7 edge and
stay tuned for the rest of our MWC 2016
