watching the Android Authority Channel
today I'll be comparing the two kinds of
jelly bean Android 4.1 and Android 4.2
some love the newer version others find
it overhyped and prefer the previous
jelly bean what are the differences
between the two is one actually much
better than the other
watch this in paracin and find out let's
begin by talking about the interface the
very first screen that greets you after
booting up your Android phone or tablet
is its lockscreen Android 4.1 SLOC
screen has a modern and sophisticated
look Android 4.2 s lockscreen is
essentially the same with some cosmetic
changes to the digital clock which now
looks slimmer and has moved to the
middle the hour is now set in bold and
the day time line has turned to all
uppercase the lock icon is still down
here and it still looks the same as in
the earlier jellybean in Android 4.1
you'll slide this lock icon to the icons
in the outer ring to either unlock the
phone launch Google now or launch the
camera in Android 4.2 only the unlock
icon is present on the outer ring to
unlock the device just slide the lock
icon to the outer ring but how do you
launch Google now or the camera Google
now has its own lockscreen icon in
Android 4.2 a dotted circle right here
in the center of the navigation bar just
slide it upwards to launch Google now
it's one of the new things on the
Android 4.2 lockscreen
as for launching the camera from the
lockscreen pull the right screen edge
towards the center this is one of the
big changes in the Android 4.2
lockscreen
in fact the edges of the Android 4.2
lockscreen are now functional the top
edge of course is for the status bar and
notification shade the bottom edge is
for Google now right edge is for camera
launching and left edge is for viewing
the other lock screen widgets
lock screen widgets are also new in
Android 4.2 in Android 4.1 you get only
one lock screen but in Android 4.2 you
get multiple you can place widgets on
the lock screen so you can view content
such as email SMS calendar events and
more without having to unlock your phone
also Android 4.2 for tablet supports
multiple users these icons here stand
for the user profiles available on this
tablet before unlocking the tablet
you'll need to choose which user profile
to load navigation is exactly the same
in under 4.1 in Android 4.2 both
versions still use the same virtual back
home and recent apps buttons the Android
4.2 home screen is practically a
carryover from Android 4.1 with only
minor differences such as the
arrangement of default app shortcuts or
folders and a redesigned analog clock on
the main home screen the notification
shade is still around
but in Android 4.2 it has a new partner
for quick settings you can now access
frequently used settings by simply
pulling down the quick settings menu
from the status bar the stock keyboard
in Android 4.1 is an excellent keyboard
it's easy to use and it is a lot of
useful features such as voice-to-text
multilingual support next word
prediction auto correction and more the
stock Android keyboard has become more
amazing in Android 4.2 especially with
the introduction of gesture typing this
works like swipe just slide your finger
across the keyboard no more tapping
Android 4.1 has features that make it a
more accessible mobile operating system
including talkback text to speech output
large text and the light you'll still
find these features in Android 4.2 plus
a few new accessibility options have
been added including magnification
gestures which lets you magnify the
display explore by touch for touch
navigation coupled with voice feedback
and accessibility shortcut for quickly
toggling the accessibility features with
a button and touch combo
let's now shift our attention to the
communication features in both the
jellybean versions both jellybean
versions use the people app for managing
and organizing contacts not much has
changed here save for the app version
number similarly both jellybean versions
use the same stock Android phone app so
you'll still get three tabs here for the
dialer call logs and people Android 4.2
however offers a better call logs list
because you can now filter your call
logs the messaging app handles
composition sending receiving and
managing SMS and MMS messages Android
4.2 S messaging app works essentially in
the same way as Android 4.1 s but the
newer Android includes a cell broadcast
option which lets you receive important
alerts about emergencies and threats to
life and property gmail is still the
reigning default email client in both
Android versions but for those who don't
want to use Gmail or Gmail app the stock
email app is also available the email
app in both Android version supports
pop3 IMAP and exchange protocols the app
drawer is exactly alike in both versions
of jellybean not much has changed here
either the app icons are still arranged
on a grid and you still get separate
tabs for apps and widgets absent widgets
management hasn't changed much in
Android 4.2 installing and removing apps
is still very much like in Android 4.1
the Google Play Store of course is still
the primary and preferred source of apps
you'll still need to grant permissions
to apps that you want to install and of
course you can still install apps that
you got from other sources other than
the Play Store among the changes I
noticed is the absence of a latitude app
in Android 4.2 however latitude can
still be accessed from the maps app like
in Android 4.1 the analog clock widget
in Android 4.2 also underwent some
transformation from Android 4.1 I
actually like the new one Android 4.2
also comes with a digital clock widget
which Android 4.1 was deprived off and
while we're talking about clocks the
clock app in Android 4.2 has greatly
improved it now includes tabs for a
stopwatch and a countdown timer
I also noticed some improvement in the
app info screen in Android 4.1 although
the app info page remains essentially
similar to that in Android 4.1 I
appreciate the improvement of the list
of app permissions I find the new
permissions list easier to understand
that the one in Android 4.1 for a long
time androids default browser had been
the stock Android browser but when
Google Chrome for Android started
appearing we suspected that it would
eventually take the stock Android
browsers place and it has it is now the
default web browser in android 4.2
though the chrome takeover will not come
as a big surprise among tablet users
chrome has been the default web browser
on tablets starting with Android 4.1 it
is actually the default browser on the
Nexus 7 running Android 4.1
search is handled by Google now by
default in both Android 4.1 and 4.2 it
brings together into just one app
several of Google search services such
as voice search Google Goggles web
search videos and more launch Google now
from the home screen by tapping the
google search bar or from anywhere by
swiping the home button upwards
accessing Google now from the lockscreen
however differs in the two androids
in Android 4.1 you do it this way in
Android 4.2 you swipe the Google now
icon upwards like this among the several
differences between Android 4.1 and 4.2
but changes in the camera app are among
the most observable for one lockscreen
access to the camera has changed a lot
in Android 4.1 it's like this but in
Android 4.2 it's like this
the new camera user interface also looks
different in fact I find the Android 4.2
camera more appealing and less cluttered
as you can see here the viewfinder takes
up nearly all the display area and the
buttons do not occupy too much screen
space and are not obtrusive unlike this
one in Android 4.1 the square focus
indicator in Android 4.1 has taken on a
circular shape in Android 4.2 long
tapping on the viewfinder in Android 4.1
does nothing but in Android 4.2 the
action brings up the circular settings
menu panoramic shooting mode is still
available in both androids of course but
in Android 4.2 you also get the
photosphere feature which lets you
capture 360 degree photos of your
surrounding the silly faces and
background effects in Android 4.1 have
been removed in the Android 4.2 video
camera time lapse mode though is still
available in both versions both
jellybeans use the gallery app for
storing photos and videos the functions
and behavior differ little in both
androids photo and video thumbnails are
still displayed in grid view by default
although you can also switch to
filmstrip view by zooming out on the
photo in Android 4.2 however you can
switch between views through this
drop-down list the gallery app also has
a built-in photo editor in Android 4.1
you can switch to the photo editor by
tapping the menu button and selecting
edit here you can adjust the
black-and-white and contrast values
apply photo effects apply color filters
and choose photo transformations in
Android 4.2 the photo editor is more
accessible just tap on its icon at the
corner of the screen the new photo
editor offers more features here you can
apply new filters and effects custom
frames photo transformation options and
adjust image color and contrast values
the new gallery app in Android 4.2 also
includes a built-in video trimmer
there's no trimmer in Android 4.1 scalar
II app
the gallery app is the default photo
viewer in both Android versions it is
also capable of displaying photos in a
slideshow in Android 4.1 it's easier to
display album photos in a slideshow just
tap this play slideshow button here in
Android 4.2 though the slideshow command
is tucked away inside the menu here
straightforward and simple video
playback is handled by the built-in
video player in the gallery app in both
jelly beans it's a no frills player
there's no difference in both players
music playback is handled by the Play
Music app both in Android 4.1 and 4.2 so
you can enjoy features such as the music
organizer for your local and online
music files sorting your music files
according to playlist artist album and
so on a 5 band equalizer equalizer
presets creating and managing playlists
and more the Play Music app can play
music in the background even if you
navigate to other screens and if that
happens music control buttons appear on
the notification shade and lock screen
as for security the features that we
appreciated in Android 4.0 Ice Cream
Sandwich are still present in both jelly
beans such as different lock screen
protection types displaying optional
owner info on the lockscreen device
encryption SIM card lock for phones and
preventing installation of apps not from
the Google Play Store in addition to
those security features Android 4.2
tightened security further there's a
built in app verifier that's supposed to
alert you if you're about to install a
malicious app the list of Android
permissions prior to app installation
has also been improved a bit
I find the permissions easier to
understand in Android 4.2 even the
permission list in the app info page in
Android 4.2 is better described and
easier to read compared to the bulleted
list in Android 4.1 each permission and
the list is also described if you tap on
it like this there are also new or
improved features in Android 4.2 that I
believe are also important for instance
the changes to the developer options
menu this menu is present and visible in
Android 4.1 settings menu but in Android
4.2 it is hidden and for good reason I
believe an average user like me will
hardly need to fiddle with developer
options doing so just might even cause
my device to function below optimum
level there are additional developer
options in the developer options menu -
another new thing in Android 4.2 is
support for multiple users this one
though is available only on tablets and
understandably so the establish are
usually shared devices the multi user
feature lets you set up several profiles
each one with different settings a user
profile can be secured with a password -
you can select which profile to load at
the lock screen Android 4.2 also brings
customizable screen savers in the
feature called daydream the screen saver
activates when your device is charging
or when it is placed on its dock you can
choose to play a customizable cloth a
wallpaper with changing colors trends
from Google Currents your photos in a
slideshow or a photo table
also through Android 4.2 wireless
display feature you can wirelessly
stream slideshows movies videos or games
from your device to a supported HDTV
Android 4.2 certainly brought several
new features and improvements especially
in the camera app support for wireless
display multi-user support and tablets
tighter security and several changes to
the interface while some argue that
these changes are not major ones I do
find them significant and important I
personally don't think Android 4.2 is
the biggest wave of change in jellybean
which is why I'm looking forward to the
next major update key lime pie what
about you is Android 4.1 good enough for
you or are the changes in Android 4.2
attractive enough for you to want it so
bad let us know in the comments get more
