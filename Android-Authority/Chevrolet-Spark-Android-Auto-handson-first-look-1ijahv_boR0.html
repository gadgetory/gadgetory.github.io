Android authority and we got a chance to
check out the Chevrolet event in Detroit
Michigan also known as the Motor City
and the reason for our visit is because
Chevrolet is showing their dedication to
Android auto by bringing Android auto to
14 different vehicles in the upcoming
year in 2016 and we got a chance to go
hands-on with one of the most affordable
vehicles the Chevrolet Spark Chevy spark
we're gonna look at the foam projection
technology here which is we're gonna
start with Android auto here so we
plugged in this device plugged into USB
so we're cabled in so we're gonna get
all the communication and the the
charging of the phone through there
there's your your android screen and it
comes up and what we're doing right now
is we're we've provided an interface so
that you can work with Android auto so
the data is gonna come from your phone
and then going through your either your
cellular connection that you've got on
your phone or in our cars that are
capable of 4G LTE you can also Wi-Fi
pair this phone to the OnStar and get
your data coming through there but the
music and the content is all gonna come
from the phone and you're projecting it
up on the screen here so we start in the
first year you've got Google Maps in
here you can you know go in and put an
entry in here for a destination you can
set that to wherever you want to go
it'll it'll pull up the map and then
you're running for that shirt take me
home take me home
you don't have a home address safe so
yeah
testimony I was wondering if her home
was gonna be where you try another one
maybe Comerica Park or something
Comerica Park here is Comerica Park
across the line and we're looking at
some 7 inch displays that's what you're
featuring in this car you'll see in the
car this evening we do have some
vehicles that'll have the 8 inch MyLink
system as well that's a really
accessible price point for a lot of
people yes so this is a Chevy spark
right this is kind of our entry-level
vehicle and what we're trying to get at
here and bring in things like Android
auto and also car play into here's we're
offering these on cars that really at
that price point you're bringing quite a
value in right you've got the ability
now to pull up navigation on the screen
you can bring in the music the content
on star capability 4G LTE you could
bring all of that into the vehicle here
at really a quite an incredible price
point into the market then you also have
the capabilities to do steering wheel
controls here you can launch into voice
rect
yeah it'll pull it up over there and you
can make your commands there so same
thing on the Android auto and on car
play I mean the idea is to connect your
phone and set it down right we don't
want people doing texting on the phone
the idea is the text messages the phone
calls you can do through voice you can
do it through the screen here put the
phone down connect it once set it down
and you're good to go there's no actions
you'll need to take on the phone signs
and stuff so in addition to the things
we've already offered on there I think
from infotainment before is added on and
I think customers really going to like
this to be honest I add the infotainment
systems got me really pumped up here but
I personally drove a 16 Corvette sitting
out in the parking lot convertible
pretty happy about that one right now we
could talk
all right well thanks great thanks a lot
