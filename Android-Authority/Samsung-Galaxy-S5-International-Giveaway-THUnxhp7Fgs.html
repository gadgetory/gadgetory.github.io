rafflecopter widget but this time you'll
be asked to download a copy of
bitdefender's mobile security and
antivirus so you can give that a try I'm
a fan of their battery saver app
personally but their antivirus app is
pretty darn good too once you install
the application using the rafflecopter
widget you'll get five entries and that
is all you need to do to officially
enter the contest if you're particularly
ambitious you can like bitdefender's
facebook page and follow them on twitter

entry if you really want this phone

entries if you so choose we'll give you
a unique URL which you then share on
your social media networks for each
person who enters using your url you
will get one additional entry for a
maximum of ten additional entries

a few minutes and you're well on your
