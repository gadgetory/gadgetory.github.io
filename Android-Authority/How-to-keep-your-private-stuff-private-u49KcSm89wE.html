brought to you by Atlassian check out
that pic oh yeah don't look at the rest
of photos why were you hiding and having
the wrong person swipe through your
photo gallery is just the tip of the
iceberg when it comes to digital privacy
and first up let's talk about focus it's
an app and we're focusing today on the
apps ability to hide images let your
friends and families swipe left and
right because they will find nothing
after you've set up everything on focus
the catches though that not all features
are free it costs just over $30 for the
premium features once you've paid your
way in you'll be set the most relevant
feature to today's show is quote the
vault users can easily pick which
pictures they want to put in the vault
which only the owner can access by using
a pin code of his or her choosing now I
know what you're thinking you're
thinking Jase I don't care about hiding
pictures what about securing other files
well whether it's documents videos audio
files or anything else using a third
party app like file hide expert will be
your best bet for keeping things private
file had expert is free and works like a
charm
and it helps that the app is actually
very easy to use it pretty much works
like a file manager but gives you the
option to hide other documents or files
on your smart phone alternatively you
can hide them all seems pretty extreme
but you may like that and it's just as
easy to restore them all by pressing a
single button but what if you want to
hide a complete app although apps are
important after all these are really
what make or break a platform there are
well over 1.6 million apps in the Google
Play Store as of July 2015 so it's only
obvious to some that these are not for
everyone's eyes to see some
manufacturers will give you the option
to hide apps in your app drawer those of
us who are not so lucky have to rely on
two third-party launcher a couple
popular ones that support this feature
are apex launcher and nova launcher but
then again you could go so far as to
create a completely new user profile
Android 4.2.2 jelly bean also brought
forth one of the most requested features
user profiles this was great for
families and other people who enjoy
shared devices but it also marked
another step and mobile privacy sharing
all your files and settings is now
a thing of the past the best part is
that you don't really need to create a
whole new user profile simply use guest
mode if you need to keep things secure
and let your friend borrow the phone for
a while and since your personal profile
can stay secure with a password
fingerprint scanner or pattern you don't
need to worry about them going into your
stuff piece of cake
unleash your team's potential with
Atlassian collaboration software so you
can work and communicate better together
you can assign the track manage tasks
for any project no matter how complex
create and share content organize
results and bring team members up to
speed now two reasons I like it lassie
and so much is that it allows me to
communicate in a way that I feel most
comfortable
I can type it out in chat or I can do
one-on-one video and communicate
verbally I like that a lot
the second thing is that it's a great
tool for collaborating and managing code
in real time regardless of where you are
in the world go to Atlassian comm to
learn more and see how JIRA confluence
HipChat and bitbucket give your team
everything you need to organize discuss
and complete shared work that's
Atlassian comm unleash the potential of
your team build what's next so guys if
you care about the stuff and you should
you really should do a search on the
channel where I've done lots of shows on
privacy internet security mobile
security all that kind of stuff search
those keywords and you can find a wealth
of content that I worked really hard at
researching you also don't want to
forget about my brothers and sister and
Android we're working super hard to be
your source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
