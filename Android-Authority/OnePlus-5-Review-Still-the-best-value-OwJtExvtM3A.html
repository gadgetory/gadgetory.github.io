Authority and for a company that hasn't
been around for a very long time
oneplus has certainly made a lot of
strides over the course of just a few
years
we're only a little over six months
removed from the 1+3 T but whether
you're ready for or not one pluses
newest flagship is here unlike a 3t this
is more than just a minor spec bump and
it's the true refresh that we've all
been waiting for
so let's find out what's new what's
different and if oneplus still provides
the most value for the money this is the
one plus five oneplus has always been
about delivering a powerful smartphone
with excellent build quality and a great
user experience all at a price that
undercuts the competition and all that
still holds true for the oneplus 5 but
that price has slowly trickled upwards
over the years as the phone has gotten
increasingly more popular and more
powerful the base 64 gigabyte model with
60th of RAM starts at 479 and for an
extra $60 that will double the storage
and bump you up to 8 gigabytes of RAM
which is just insane to think about
especially when four gigabytes of RAM is
still be standard on most flagship I've
been using the more expensive model with
eight gigs of RAM and with Qualcomm
slated Snapdragon 835 this phone is just
crazy fast it performs every bit as well
as you would want it to and it's
probably more power than anyone would
ever need in a smart phone which is
certainly not a bad problem to have
absent games open extremely quickly
scrolling is very smooth and moving
through the interface is nice and fluid
touch response also feels much improved
over previous one plus phones and seems
to track my fingers a lot better when
I'm typing scrolling or swiping put so
much RAM on board this phone can hold a
ton of apps in memory without ever
breaking a sweat and it always felt
snappy and responsive no matter how many
apps I had open
for the screen oneplus is sticking to
1080p and even though most high-end
Android phones have moved up to quad HD
it's not that big of a deal that oneplus
hasn't made the switch because the
screen looks gorgeous and it's probably
the best 1080p panel you'll find on a
smartphone it's incredibly sharp and
unless someone told you or you read the
spec sheet you wouldn't be able to tell
that it was 1080p the screen size is 5.5
inches which is a good sweet spot for a
big screen that's still comfortable
enough to use one hand it's also AMOLED
so colors are vibrant full of contrasts
and deep dark blacks and it's plenty
bright that reading it outdoors in
direct sunlight isn't an issue
while the oneplus 5 still undercuts
other big flag ships like the s8 g6 and
HTC u 11 in terms of price you don't
have to look very far to figure out the
reasons why there's no wireless charging
no expandable storage and the phone
lacks any sort of water and guts
resistance while it's charging and
expandable storage are by no means
make-or-break features especially since
a phone comes with plenty of internal
storage and while it's charging while
nice-to-have isn't entirely necessary
but with so many phones nowadays coming
with some sort of ingress protection it
will be a feature worth thinking about
especially if it's really important to
you
oneplus does make up for this in other
ways the fingerprint sensor on the front
is extremely fast it's definitely one of
the fastest fingerprint sensors I've
ever used and it's covered in ceramic so
you don't have to worry about it getting
scratched up oneplus is ever so useful
alert slider and make switching between
different notification profiles and
effortless experience and although this
isn't new it's the features that's still
very unique to one plus it's also dual
SIM and comes with the latest Bluetooth
5 which is currently only supported by a
couple of other phones the biggest
change the one plus five is the new dual
camera system dual cameras are becoming
increasingly more common on smartphones
but every smartphone that has dual
cameras does things a little bit
differently and the one plus five is no
exception
most dual cameras either have the same
resolution across both lenses or the
secondary sensor is lower resolution but
with the oneplus 5 it's the exact
opposite the main sensor is 16
megapixels with F 1.7 aperture and
electronic image stabilization the
secondary sensor is a 20 megapixel
telephoto lens
with a smaller F 2.6 aperture but
there's no electronic stabilization on
this lens and neither lens have oh is
similar to Apple's implementation on the
iPhone 7 plus the telephoto lens will
let you optically zoom in by 2x without
any loss in quality oneplus has also
included a new portrait mode that
simulates that nice blurry background or
bokeh effect that you would normally get
from a disel R while keeping the subject
in razor sharp focus the manual mode has
now been replaced with a new pro mode
that offers more control and a few nice
enhancements you can control all the
usual stuff like ISO white balance
shutter speed focus and exposure but
what it really like is the built-in
histogram and a horizon leveler to help
you gauge when your shot is perfectly
straight the camera is capable of
recording 4k video and EAS does a decent
job of smoothing out any unwanted shakes
and jitters you can switch to the
secondary sensor while recording to get
closer on a subject but because these
second sensor lacks any form of
stabilization the footage is noticeably
more shaky photos from the oneplus 5 are
well detailed sharp without looking over
sharpened and color reproduction is more
on the natural side and not overly
saturated have any secondary telephoto
lens is great for getting those closer
up shots without losing any of the
detail that you normally would from
digital zoom it's perfect we're getting
closer up on anything you want but I
found it to be especially great for
macro shots it does however produce
slightly different colors from the main
lens and is a little more inconsistent
with exposure the portrait mode pretty
much works just as advertised
as long as you're following the camera's
guidelines you can get some very
convincing bokeh that creates a nice
separation between the subject and the
background
low-light performance will depend on
which camera you decide to use but it
wasn't all that surprising that the
second sensor doesn't do all that well
in low light after all it has a smaller
pixel size a smaller aperture and no
stabilization photos from the telephoto
lens are much more washed out noisy
full of lens flares and overblown
highlights and it has a lot more trouble
with white balance the main sensor will
give you much better results especially
in terms of detail and color accuracy I
haven't talked about the oneplus 5
design yet and although there's a
significant amount of refinements it's
not a complete overhaul it's an
all-metal body just like the
three and three t but the five is the
thinnest phone that oneplus has ever
made coming in at 7.25 millimeters and
the aggressive taper or curves along the
sides makes the phone feel even thinner
than it already is the antenna lines
have also been redesigned to go around
the perimeter instead of cutting across
the back making them a lot less
noticeable with the rounded corners and
curved edges the one plus five is nice
and comfortable to hold but because the
sides are so thin you don't have a lot
to hold on to and the phone is already
pretty slippery as is with the all-metal
body the new design changes are nice and
I'm certainly a fan of most of them but
it's hard to deny the oneplus 5 heavily
resembles an iPhone 7 plus especially
with the addition of a dual camera
system that similarly shaped has a lot
of the same functionality and sits in
the same location despite the phone
getting thinner and some of its
similarities to the iPhone thankfully
those similarities did not include the
headphone jack which can still be found
on the bottom of the phone next to the
USB type-c port and the single speaker
the speaker is above average but it's
not amazing it's a lot louder than I
expected but it can get slightly
distorted at max volume and it's pretty
easy to accidentally muffle with your
palm when using the phone in landscape I
suppose the only compromise to the phone
getting thinner if you can really call
it a compromise is the battery getting
smaller but it's only marginally smaller
than last year's three T and it doesn't
seem to have made much of an impact to
the phone's battery life because battery
life only one plus five is exceptionally
good the 3300 milliamp hour battery left
me comfortably through a full day even
with heavy use that includes using the
camera playing games watching youtube
streaming music at the gym and doing all
the other usual stuff like reading
emails and checking social media on a
much lighter day I'll typically end the
day with around 50 percent and when that
happens I won't charge the phone until
the next day so it is totally possible
to get a day and a half out of this
phone I honestly have no problems going
to bed without charging it overnight
simply because this phone takes no time
at all to charge it only takes 30
minutes to get a 60% charge and roughly
an hour and 20 minutes ago from empty to
full one Pleasence - charging is just
insanely quick and power efficient
making the charging process so much
easier and convenient one of the
best parts about using a phone from
oneplus has always been the software
it's running oxygen OS which is
basically stock Android but with more
customizations than what you would get
from Google much of it we were seeing
before on previous versions of oxygen OS
you can customize the accent colors
switch between a light or dark theme or
enable on-screen navigation keys there's
a variety of off screen gestures to open
the camera turn on the flash or open up
any application of your choice and
there's other useful gestures like
double tap to wake just like every new
version of oxygen OS oneplus adds in
more features to further enhance the
experience there's a reading mode now
that turns the entire screen to
grayscale to give you a similar
experience of what you would get on an
e-reader and a lot of other nice little
touches like a do not disturb mode made
specifically for gaming and the updated
app drawer that swipes up from the
bottom just like the Google pixel
there's no denying that the 1+5 is
impressive and it's really a no-brainer
on whether you should buy or not sure
it's gone up in price but there's more
packed into the phone than ever before
and that makes it completely worth the
price hike and it's still cheaper than
most other flagships it is missing a few
key things that I mentioned earlier like
expandable storage and water resistance
and the design is a little uninspiring
but none of these are deal-breakers by
any means overall it's a complete
package and oneplus proves once again
that they can deliver a phone that goes
toe-to-toe with the best Android
flagships without charging an Android
flagship price as always thank you guys
