of the displays here we're going all the
huawei for you at mwc in porcelain is
vain to bring you all the best coverage
of the Mobile World Congress so right
here we have a new device by wall wave
as you guys if you remember correctly
back at CES we fell in love with the
huawei as the ascend mate and be 72 and
they were just wonderful phones that you
saw together all the time on the show
floor CES but now we have a new one on
the block and this is the huawei ascend
p2 and so like i said before is a 4.7
inch display so it's a 720p display with
corning gorilla glass 2 as the covering
wow it does make its own SOC s however
so what you're seeing what you will find
underneath is a high silicon k3v2
quad-core 1.5 gigahertz so that is a
pretty pretty good spec for the phone
that is supposed to be sort of a
mid-range i guess you could say this is
more of a mid-range mood to top tier in
terms of our hallways line of phones so
what you're seeing here on the p2 is
just sort of the design aspects it
really is sort of i'm getting a little
bit surprised just looking at the phone
myself because I'm actually seeing that
the slightly matted back if it's a nice
fields a nice industrious look and then
right over here I all the sex is at 13
megapixel camera so maybe mid range is
starting to not necessarily be the best
work for the sfp to Africa reason it
actually packs some good specs
alright one gigabyte of RAM is what you
get inside and 16 gigabytes of onboard
memory is available the battery is 24 20
milliamp hour so you do get quite a bit
of battery life on this 4.8 we'll put a
4.7 inch screen should be able to get
quite a bit of power from that so just
kind of looking over here let's head
over to there you go android version 4.1
jelly bean which seems to be the typical
one you'll find I'm pretty much all the
phones that are round here at mwc so in
the hand obviously a 4.7 inch screen is
is what was commonplace in our market
however five inch and 5.5 inch screens
is going to become the norm so after
handling all of those bigger phones this
4.7 inch main really does feel quite
refreshing because it's easy to reach
pretty much anything on the phone
without really doing too much that being
said you kind of see that the battery
here not the battery the button layout
rather is pretty much largely the same
you do have a dedicated camera battery
right there seemed so that's really nice
oh yeah that's definitely it because it
goes halfway then all the way and you
also have a micro SD slot right there so
you have expandable memory of this so
that is the huawei ascend p2 here at mwc
just to kind of taking a look at it you
do not have the topmost tier specs of VP
too but you still have some really good
ones that should make this phone go the
distance especially for those of you who
are looking for a little bit more of an
affordable phone and you don't need all
the craziness that the other phones
offer this is definitely a really good
middle ground that you'll find so kudos
to LA wait for that all right so
finally it's joshua pagar from mwc down
in barcelona spain they were bringing
you all of the coverage from the final
day on the trade show floor so stay
tuned and subscribe to our channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
