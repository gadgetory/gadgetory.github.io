lot of smartwatches that support the
Android wear especially butts by moto
now we have a round face and also an
accessible design that might be
applicable for plenty of people out
there aah Joshua Garf majorda thority
and this is our look at the Moto 360 and
here it is the Moto 360 we're taking a
look at this brand new SmartWatch from
moda with the round face sporting
Android we're here in Berlin for Aoife
even though we weren't able to be there
in Chicago we're getting a wonderful
look at it here in a beautiful Berlin
day what we're looking at here is the
round face now of course everyone has
been talking about this little area on
the bottom that doesn't make it a
perfect round but you know what I don't
think that really makes too much of a
difference because the usability and the
fact that you have a pretty large
diameter right here edge to edge when it
comes to the display really makes it
quite great already what we have here is
a android wear of course you're going to
get all of the difference cards for
notifications and whatnot here's a
stock's one that you're looking at here
but we're going to take a quick tour
into the actual watch faces that reveal
because after all we are looking at a
round face so you're going to be taking
advantage of that round face quite often
as you can see here there are quite a
few watch faces that basically are the
analog look if you want to use something
a little bit more digital it's going to
look something like that it's just going
to be a circle and then you have the
time right there but still looks really
great now one of the things that I
really love about the Moto 360 that I've
seen so far is the fact that it's a
pretty accessible build you do get it in
a silver or a black which is the one
that i have here right now but basically
when you have it on because it is of a
round face it pretty much blends right
in the way that you would with any other
watch but i do think that it is
accessible for pretty much anybody out
there as long as you're ok with having
you somewhat large face on your wrist
which is perfectly fine as far as the
thickness go it is a little bit thicker
than maybe you're more conventional
watch just one to think of ones out
there but it actually doesn't take too
much away from at the usability and also
the way that it looks they probably
won't cramp your style at all but we're
taking a look at all the features here
now one of the best features about this
I think is the fact that when you put
the watch on to the charging cradle now
there is wireless charging on here you
will be able to use the watch as a clock
on your bedside table for example so the
watch this android wear watch will
continue to be useful even when
you are asleep and not being and
actually wearing the watch which is I
think pretty brilliant we look around to
the back here we have the moto styling
there is some plastic right here but
that's fine the basically you have a lot
of the features that already sort of put
out over here you have the wireless
charging also a heart rate monitor and
even the pedometer underneath and of
course this entire watch is water
resistance now there is also a button
over here but it has a pretty simple
function you're pretty much just going
to use it to wake the device one of the
many ways to do so other than the sensor
that brings it up to your face or also
tapping on the screen itself of course
you can hold the x in order to get to
the menu as well but that's about the
gist of it there now heading back to the
actual operating system I have a watch
face right here that actually looks
pretty cool it's a kind of a mix between
analog and digital but we'll take a look
at the rest here we do have the black
leather version right here in my hands
at the moment and it does look really
nice you will be able to change the
straps fairly easily as well but this
one actually looks pretty utilitarian
pretty simplistic but also still elegant
at the same time now we've seen plenty
of people wearing the Moto 360 here at
the presentation for moto and I have to
say no matter who i saw this watch on it
blended right in with what they were
wearing and it wasn't too intrusive at
all so that's just a look at the Moto
360 I'm going to be getting my
particular unit pretty soon and I will
bring you the full review very soon once
i get back from Aoife in berlin but we
really do like what we see and what I
love the most about this particular
watches it sounds like it's pretty much
accessible for anybody out there because
the styling is about as let's say
simplistic and also it's able to blend
in with pretty much anything that you
might be using so keep it tuned here at
Android Authority for even more access
and coverage to the Moto 360 this might
be the one that you guys are really
looking for and I know everyone's really
pining over this round face and I do
think it is implemented quite well so
keep it tuned to you for even more from
Aoife in Berlin but also beyond
especially the future of view of this
the Moto 360 because we are your source
for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
