handy the Android authority app guy it's
Friday and before you start your awesome
weekend let's talk a little bit about
the app news this week first up this
week is an update to s hook that helps
measure your stress levels like your
heart rate the app uses the heart
monitor on the Samsung Galaxy s5 in
order to compute what your stress levels
may actually be it is an odd catch-22
because the stress level feature is a
tad gimmicky but it extends the
functionality of the heart rate monitor
which actually makes it a little less
gimmicky in any case I wouldn't use it I
probably should but there are some
things I really just don't want to know
so a new leak was released this week
that may finally show us the actual
Gmail redesign yes I know it's another
rumor about the google apps redesign and
i have a feeling that after Google i/o
this stuff won't be a mystery anymore
this leak came from the same person that
all but called the Google Plus UI
redesign and that may help the
credibility a little bit especially
because the leak looks nothing like the
other ones
things like theming and color scheme
appear to look pretty much the same with
the major differences being in these
small UI tweaks such as the new email
button on the bottom right it looks like
the hamburger menu has gone as well and
replaced with the same kind of drop down
menu featured in the Google Plus update
until the official app launches it's
just a rumor but the similarities
between this and the Google Plus update
are pretty clear-cut so this may
actually be pretty close
oh man it's time for another humble
bundle because humble bundles are
awesome this humble bundle is called PC
and Android tenon currently features
seven games that can be played on an
astounding four platforms including
Android PC Linux and Mac with one more
game coming soon if you pay any price
you get symphony at draw a stickman epic
and gal con legends if you pay the
higher than average price which is 487
at the time of this video's production
you can get skulls of the shotgun Metal
Slug 3 fieldrunners 2 and breach and
clear so two things to keep in mind here
the first is that you can play these
games on either Android or PC if you
want to the second is that the 487 is
wildly less than you would spend for
these games if you bought them
individually oh and I guess there is a
third thing some of the money goes to
charity and to indie developers and
that's good enough for me to check it
out
his own Spotify got hacked and instead
of releasing an update to the
application they simply released a whole
new application the unfortunately
amusing part is that only one Spotify
user actually got hacked
however this prompted Spotify to fix the
weakness they found and are now
prompting users to download the new
version called Spotify music and get rid
of the old version good on Spotify for
caching an early being open about it and
fixing it quickly to that one dude sorry
man
that really sucks and our last bit of
news this week let's take a quick look
at some app stats from Android and iOS
in a company called swerve performed a
study to see how people interact with
the Google Play Store the Apple App
Store and how they interact with their
applications in general the conclusions
were kind of nifty on average the report
stated that Android users use their
applications 18% per month more than iOS
users but on the flipside iOS users
spend a staggering forty-five percent
more on in-app purchases and are 32
percent more likely to make a purchase
whether it be in app or just a paid app
a lot of people both professional and
readers alike have commented on why this
may be unfortunately without more
numbers and without data specifics no
one can really know for sure
Apple has toppled Android in most
regions an app developer revenue for
years despite their plummeting market
share and that's actually pretty sad
hopefully next year's numbers will look
a little more promising who wants to see
some trending applications as usual if
you want to check any of these
applications out you can find the links
in the written companion which is in the
video description below first up this
week is an application called peak peak
is a standalone application that mimics
the Paranoid Android feature of the same
name the premise is simple the
application lets you check your
notifications without pressing a single
button it's loaded with additional
features as you can see in this review
video by chris naka and if you like to
deal with your notifications quickly
check it out in the Google Play Store it
costs four dollars and nine cents next
up is ad apt and this is actually a
really cool application here's how it
works the app is a contacts replacement
app that helps you manage your contacts
you get your friends to use it and when
you connect you no longer have to worry
about updating your friends information
say your friend gets a new phone number
they updated an ad app and then that
change syncs to everyone that person is
connected to in the application it's
free in the Google Play Store and it's
cross-platform so it works with iOS and
Android
next up is an application that's a
little bit brainteaser and a little bit
time-waster what you do is connect all
the boxes with the other boxes but you
can only create so many connections per
box so if a box has two you can only
connect two other boxes to that one
individual box it's easy to start out
and gets progressively more difficult as
you keep playing it features over 200
free levels with more available and
there's also a new speed round where you
must solve as many puzzles as you can in
under three minutes it's free to
download in the Google Play Store the
tapi chicken is a flappy bird ripoff and
probably the only one I'll ever talk
about there's a reason tapi chicken was
actually made without one line of code
being written the developers were able
to create this game using solely mouse
clicks and pre-existing presets I just
wanted to talk about it for a minute
because I thought it was kind of funny
that you can create this game without
using one line of code the last up this
week is the official watchdogs companion
app watchdogs had quite the release the
last week and a lot of people have been
talking about it the companion app lets
you stay connected to the game and I
mean the actual game it's actually kind
of impressive you can do things like
play live with other people according to
the app description you don't even need
to own the PC or console version to play
so if you're a fan of the game this is a
free download and why not now don't
forget folks if you ever get tired of
hearing me talk you can always just
mosey on over to Android Authority comm
