authority now I'm fairly sure that you
know that your smartphone can run more
than one program at a time even when
you're running just a game or something
you've got an app in the foreground you
realize there are things going on in the
background you get notifications you've
got an email
someone's mentioned you on Twitter and
app is being updated all these things
are happening while you're using the app
in the foreground so therefore your
smartphone is actually running multiple
programs now if you've ever wondered how
that works and please let me explain so
first of all bit of background
information inside your smartphone there
are three very important components when
it comes to running apps but of course
it's the CPU the other is the round the
random access memory and the other is
the memory controller which is the
interface between the CPU and the RAM
now when you have a simple computer
let's say a microcontroller used to
display numbers on your microwave oven
life is really simple there's one
program to run all of the CPU time is
given over to that program and all the
RAM is given over to that program really
easy but when you want to run two
programs or ten programs things now
become more complicated because the
memory and the CPU time need to be
divided up amongst those programs so how
does the Linux kernel do that well this
is where we get the idea of a process
it's a logical container which holds all
the information about each of the apps
that are running on your smartphone so
in there will be the name of the app
it's binary where it can be found it's
priority each one has its own unique IDs
called the P the process ID there is the
list of its memory where is it available
in memory and it has a state is it
running is it sleeping as it stopped
is it zone beat now but once the kernel
has all this information about all the
apps that need to run it can start to
schedule different resources for each of
those apps so when an app is sleeping
it doesn't need any cpu time we can just
leave it alone but when an app wants to
run the kernel says ok you can now have
a slice of CPU time and then another app
says hey I want a slice of CPU time so
the colors
well you can have a slice of cpu time
now this is all happening at the
millisecond level and like a cartoon
which shows one frame after the other
frame very quickly and gives us the idea
of animation running little bits of each
program very quickly gives us the
appearance that's actually running
things in parallel now of course a day
we actually use CPUs with multiple cores
four cores or eight cores
so the CPU actually can run things in
parallel but the good news is the
concept of a process and the fact that
it needs memory the faculty needs CPU
time remains exactly the same but now
the kernel has more CPU resources to
give to each of those processes now
normally when a process is created there
is a single thread of execution through
that program every process has a life
cycle is a beginning
it runs goes through the middle of it
runs around and whatever it needs to do
and then finally there's an end where it
exits and goes away now if you have a
game for example that you're writing and
you're displaying lots of things on the
display but at the same time you want to
send information up to the internet
about the position of your character the
state of the character it may be a
massive online playing game then now
that app needs to do two things at once
now there are ways of programming that
where you can do two things at once but
there's also a system provided by the
kernel that allows each app to have
multiple ways of execution through the
program so while one path through the
program is updating the game another
path through the program is sending the
network information up and that's called
a thread multiple threads of execution
now if you've been understood what I've
said you may come and say to me but hold
on Gary what happens if the same two
threads come to execute the same bit of
code and you would be right
that would be disastrous because one
throughputs let's say the number 10 into
a particular variable the other 3 puts
zero in there when the first thread
comes back there again it was expecting
a 10 but now it's a zero
and always goes wrong there's just
absolute chaos so to get round this
there's the idea of locking that means
that when a particular piece of code it
is important it can be locked and there
are a whole variety of different locks
that are available and the way they work
is different but the basic idea is this
thread one comes into an area that is
sensitive it will lock that area and say
no one else can come in here it will do
its work and while if that's happening
thread number two comes along it will
wait until threat number one has
finished and then exits out the other
end but of course then if that's not
done right then the whole idea of
multi-threading just disappears because
rather than having multiple threads all
running in parallel in your program what
actually happens if they all end up
queuing up one behind the other because
they're all waiting for this important
section so actually getting your locking
right in a thread is very important and
there are other problems for example
what happens if a thread leaves that
section under an error condition and
because of a bug in the program it
forgets to unlock the code then now it
will wait forever because the code
remains locked there are also other
problems one if you've got two threads
thread number one enters into a section
of code that's locked and it then starts
waiting for something from thread number
two straight number two comes into a
program area it locks it but it can't
proceed until it's able to go into the
code that is currently occupied by
thread number one or thread number one
is now waiting for threat number two and
thread number two is now waiting for
thread number one and we get deadlock so
although these operating systems Linux
and so on
give us multi-threading that give us
multi processes actually from a
programmers point of view it's important
to get them right because if you get
them wrong your app actually won't
behave any better in fact it will behave
much worse so let me give you a brief
summary because a Linux kernel Android
can run multiple apps the Linux kernel
needs to have a logical container that
tells it which app terrain that's called
a process and the presence has an ID has
a priority it has some memory space it
has a status zone and the kernel uses
that information to give slices of CPU
time to every single app that wants to
run and because it does is a millisecond
level each app gets the appearance it's
running similar
seriously with all the other apps and
even on multi-core machines that's
exactly the same just now there are more
calls that can execute each of the
programs inside each process there can
be multiple threads of execution so that
each program can do multiple things at
once update the internet while updating
the game and to make sure there's no
conflict of interest inside those
threads is a thing called locking and
locking allows the program of the app
developer to ensure that data isn't
modified by two threads simultaneously
well my name's Gary Sims from Android or
throaty and I hope you enjoyed this
video if you did please do give it a
thumbs up I really would recommend you
go to the Android or 'ti forums there's
a whole section there where you can
connect with me you can talk about
threads you can talk about kernels we
could talk about processes I'm there if
you want to talk to me about any of
those also please don't forget to use
the comments below to tell us what you
think about multi-processing
Linux threading have you ever done the
app development using threads let me
know in the comments below also don't
forget to stay tuned to android
authority because we are your source for
all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
