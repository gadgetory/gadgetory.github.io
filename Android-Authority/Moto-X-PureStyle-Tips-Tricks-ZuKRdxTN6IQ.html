Authority and if you've been a longtime
motox user like I have then you most
likely already know exactly what to
expect with the Moto X pure edition or
the Moto X style but if this is your
first time using a Moto X then you're
probably going to want to know a little
bit more about how to use it this is
tips and tricks for your Moto X so we
already know that the Moto X pure
edition and the Moto X is from previous
years are running a basically stock
version of Android with the exception of
a handful of really useful custom
features from Motorola so naturally a
lot of these tips and tricks are going
to revolve around those Motorola
features we're going to start off with
the display the Moto X pure edition has
a large bright beautiful 5.7 inch quad
HD display and even though Motorola made
the switch to a TFT LCD this year the
screen is surprisingly vibrant and
saturated but if you don't like that you
can actually change it and it's very
easy to do just jump into settings by
either opening up the app or using the
shortcut in the notification shade tap
on display and then select color mode
from here you'll notice that it defaults
to a vibrant setting for enhanced color
and saturation but switching it to
normal will give you a more natural look
any much flatter image if that's what
you're looking for
tip number two is creating a custom key
phrase for Moto voice and if you don't
already know moto voice is an always-on
listening feature that lets you dictate
voice commands from anywhere even when
the phone is asleep creating a custom
key phrase not only lets you create
something that is unique and different
from everyone else but it also makes it
harder for other people to trigger your
Moto X to create a custom phrase just
open up the moto application go to voice
tap on manage launch phrase and select
change or improve launch phrase from
here just follow the on-screen prompts
to record your custom phrase which it'll
ask you to repeat three times over just
make sure you're in a quiet room and
that you speak normally so that it can
probably capture your voice it should
take only a minute or two tops but once
you are done you can immediately start
using your own custom launch phrase next
up is Moto actions and Moto actions are
all gesture based controls that you need
to activate certain functions of
own and you can turn them all off within
the Moto app if you'd like but I would
suggest leaving them all on because
they're all extremely useful you can do
things like wave your hand over the
front of the phone to wake up the
display to see any notifications you
might have without having to touch the
phone chop twice to turn on the camera
flash and my personal favorite double
twisting your wrist to quickly launch
into the camera which can really come in
handy if you take a lot of photos
finally if you put the phone to your ear
this will discreetly activate moto voice
and will respond to your command or
question through the earpiece instead of
blasting it through the speakers in
order to not disturb others another
really cool feature from Motorola is
called moto assist which can do various
things like read your text messages out
loud when you're driving - who's calling
or stay completely quiet when you're
sleeping or in a meeting setting it up
is super simple and easy to do once
you're in the assist section of the Moto
app just hit the plus button in the
corner and select which activity you
want to add whether it be driving
meaning or sleeping and you can even add
a location to have the phone
automatically trigger your activity so
for example if you add one for meeting
you can add the location of your job so
that when you walk into work it'll
instantly put your phone into meeting
mode and you won't be disturbed tip
number five is attentive display and if
you've ever been reading a web page or
an article and get annoyed by the screen
constantly dimming while you're in the
middle of reading it then this feature
is for you it's pretty simple just go
into settings and under the display
section you'll find attentive display to
make sure the screen stays on when
you're looking at it make sure that box
is checked and you want the screen to
sleep sooner when you're not looking at
it you can check that box as well but
once you have this feature enabled
you'll never have to deal with the
screen timing out before you want it to
ever again next up let's talk about
audio the Moto X pure Edition has some
of the best front-facing speakers on a
smart phone right now and the default
out of the box settings are already
pretty good as is but if you want a
little bit extra bass treble or just a
more balanced sound overall you can
easily tweak it in the settings under
settings just go to sound and
notification and right at the top select
audio effects from here you can select
different equalizers and by default it's
on base punch but if you want even more
bass you can set it to extreme bass or
conversely if you'd rather have a bigger
emphasis on
treble you can set it to brilliant
treble there's also a balance setting
which will give you the most even sound
possible and vocalizer if you want more
emphasis on the vocals and finally you
have the option to turn the equalizer
off entirely which I don't recommend
doing if you're more of a headphones
type of person there's audio profiles
that you can select from like 3d stereo
home theater and live stage or you can
create your own to perfectly tailor the
audio to your ears our final tip has to
do with the camera and how to control
focus and exposure Motorola made quite a
bit of improvements to the camera on the
hardware side of things but the software
still leaves a lot to be desired in
terms of manual controls and by default
there isn't much we do except aim and
tap on the viewfinder to shoot to enable
focusing exposure control just swipe
inwards from the left side to reveal the
control wheel and tap on the icon that
looks like a hand with a square bracket
once enabled you can change the focus
point by dragging the green circle
anywhere on the screen
and also dial in the exposure this still
pales in comparison to full-on manual
controls from other smartphone cameras
on the market but turning this feature
on will at least allow you to get the
most out of your Moto X's camera and
there you have it guys this has been
