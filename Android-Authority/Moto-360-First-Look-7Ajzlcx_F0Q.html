authority what's going on everybody and
here i am with our first hands-on with
the Moto 360 now one thing I will tell
you right now is you can probably see on
the screen already is that pretty much
every device are going to be seeing on
the floor today is in demo mode so
that's exactly what we're looking at
here but I will be able to scroll
through a few of the elements as you can
see right here so the other thing too is
even though it is in a demo mode we will
be seeing this same operating system the
Android where you I on the LG G watch
which I will be picking up tomorrow so
I'll give you more in-depth look on that
tomorrow but for now we just wanted to
take a look at the actual device itself
it has the nice round look to it and
actually I'm going to go ahead and just
put on the device right now and we have
premium premium materials all around
including this leather that i have just
looking really lovely and i will tell
you this i have been told by one of the
moto representatives that this watch one
of their favorite features of it just
effect that it is actually really light
compared to even analog watches i go see
today by and i heard the name michael
kors thrown around a little bit but
nonetheless we have a pretty tall device
actually it's actually a little bit tall
right here but what I've been told as I
it's not going to make much of a
difference when you're having your
clothes on and whatnot it really isn't
an impedance and also the other reason
why the round design was really gone for
it in the Moto line was because this
little bone right here that you have
here won't be won't be impeded with your
wrist movie so that's really a nice
that's a nice feature in terms of
comfort but all around we have a very
nice feel this is the leather right here
and if it was really nice on the skin
here please excuse my wristband for
tonight's party but let's go and go
through the up the operating system just
a little bit here's your watch face and
you have the really nice looking watch
face that goes around obviously when it
comes to the round face you have the
wonderful looking clock right here and
here's what an example of a notification
and it's ala saying and if I were to
scroll up from there you not only see
the contact picture in the background
but you also see the actual text itself
and if I move over to the right will be
able to reply very quickly and be able
to reply via voice obviously I'm not
saying that right now it is in demo mode
like I said
I'll go ahead and get back to it but
here we are back here and since I
dismissed the text notification and now
have a weather area that shows London
and I will be able to see some extra
information on that the five-day
forecast here is a pedometer that is
available on there and it's Vega and if
we keep going we'll be able to see
various other cards that are available
using this uy 36 minutes to get home
here is the flight information for a
flight that might come up a little bit
later and you will be able to have
information from that particular email
or rather from google now sent to the
watch so you'll be able to use that and
of course a music player that is
available right here going to next
previous being able to change the music
track calendar entries and that pretty
much does it for at least the ones we're
able to look at in this demo coming up
to the end right here what I just wanted
to show you one last time was right here
saying okay Google ok Google and better
go actually said in the sentence oh
there it is go straight into google
voice and you'll be able to not google
voice google now in the sense that
you'll be able to use voice activated
searches and any functionality after
that so that's just a quick look at the
Moto 360 it will be out later this
summer and they are being pretty
tight-lipped about the actual date
keeping a pretty vague but this summer
could mean anywhere from the next week
to next month so we're really looking
forward to getting our hands in the mode
316 will give you an in depth of view on
it once it comes up but this was just
your first look at one of the first
smartwatches to have Android wear this
is josh with a car from android
authority coming to you live from google
