Android Authority and while a lot of the
team is in Barcelona covering Mobile
World Congress I'm here in New York City
at Samsung's first look event taking a
look at some other aspects of the galaxy
s7 and galaxy s7 edge in this video I'm
going to focus on the different color
choices we have for the galaxy s7 first
off the design of the galaxy s7 is
pretty similar to last year's s6 so we
have very similar color choices as well
thanks to the glass still being used the
colors this time around seemed a little
more toned down you're not going to see
any bright blues or greens but instead
very neutral colors the galaxy s7 comes
in three different colors black onyx
gold platinum and white pearl however in
the United States will be stuck to black
onyx and gold platinum as the white
pearl variant is not going to be
released for US markets now the first
thing I noticed when holding the black
one right here is that wow it's actually
black this time last year's as six was
more of a bluish color especially in
certain lighting which I know I wasn't
too much of a fan of but this film looks
really sleek in this true black color of
course we still have this very
reflective glass backing that looks
really nice although some may still find
it a little distracting especially given
that the front of the phones are also
made from this reflective glass but here
on the black s7 we probably have the
least distracting front this is
definitely still going to be a
fingerprint magnet but in the little
time that I had playing around with the
phone it didn't seem to be as bad as
last year's it could have been due to
the temperatures of the room or the lack
of oil on our hands but it seemed to
hold up very well today next we have
gold platinum which will be your only
other choice if you do not enjoy the
black onyx and this here is a really
flashy and fancy color that is extremely
reflective you could almost use the back
of this as seven as a mirror which
definitely gives it an elegant look
although some may say is a bit too much
especially as it appears above and below
the screen but if you can get past this
a gold platinum version of the s7 is
surely to catch one's eye it really is
gorgeous in my opinion and that's for
white pearl it does seem a little
strange that such an iconic and simple
color front on previous galaxy s phones
is no longer an option within the US but
it still does exist for other areas of
the world and looks fantastic it's not
as showy as the other colors and not as
distracting when viewing the front of
the phone
especially with the white having less of
a mirror look to it and you'll have a
very tough time being able to make out
finger prints with the white pearl model
as well so that's all the colors for the
galaxy s7 they look really nice and I'm
sure a lot of us will prefer the true
black of the black onyx version over the
bluish black sapphire color of last
year's s6 in the US this is a color
you're going to be seeing a lot of
people walking around with as the gold
platinum maybe too flashy for some but
anyway that'll do it for this video of
the galaxy s7 s colors make sure you go
check out the galaxy s7 edges colors
comparison as well as they do differ a
bit and make sure you stay tuned here at
Android Authority for more coverage on
the galaxy s7 and more as we are your
