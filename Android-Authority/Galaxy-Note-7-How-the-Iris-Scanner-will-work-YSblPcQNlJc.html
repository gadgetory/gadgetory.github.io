the rumored iris scanner how exactly
will it work well it will start by
employing three lenses at this point
it's pretty much in the bag that the
upcoming Galaxy Note 7 will debut
Samsung's long-awaited
iris scanner and we know now how it will
work
patently Mobile has uncovered a new
Samsung patent that outlines the way its
iris scanner works and what devices it
can be used with the list of compatible
devices is actually surprisingly long
considering the size and expense of an
iris scanner the triple camera array can
potentially be used in laptops tablets
smartphones wearables IOT devices and
digital cameras and more according to
the patent and I quote the iris
recognition system employs three lenses
to capture the image signal and then
checks the iris of the user based on the
image generated as well as other
information unquote this other
information will be the users face for
additional identification now below the
three lenses in the diagrammatic patent
illustration sits a lighting device
which will direct a beam of infrared
light onto the iris for image capture in
terms of how the whole system works to
scan and identify users iris and other
features here's what the patent says
word for word quote the first lens may
include to narrow angle lenses having
narrow angles of view to expand and
capture images of regions of the eyes of
the user the second lens may include a
wider angle lens having a wide angle of
view to capture an image of the face of
the user the first lens may be a zoom
lens and the second lens may be a
shorter focal lens length you see one of
the major barriers to iris technology
being used in consumer tech has always
been both latency and expense in secure
facility applications time and money are
not much of an object so taking the
extra second an iris scanner requires to
verify a person's identity is acceptable
not so when used to unlock a smartphone
especially with the incredibly fast
finger scanners we are now accustomed to
having said that it's unlikely Samsung
will do away with its fingerprint
scanner in favor of its iris scanner
alone iris scanning technique several
years to catch up and become refined and
fast enough to outpace fingerprint
sensors so you can still expect to see
both options in the immediate future one
final thing worth mentioning is that
this triple camera system complete with
a light source needs to be front mounted
above the display that means a larger
bezel at least somewhat while the patent
diagram isn't necessarily indicative of
the amount of bezel
the iris scanner will actually need it
will surely mean a larger bezel than
usual we'll see let me know what you
think in the comments below today nearly
anything is possible if you can dream it
your team can build it
makers of collaboration software that
helps your team work better together
create and share content organize
results with the flexibility of
confluence they even have instant
messaging and video chat with HipChat
you can also manage code in real time
with the power of bitbucket visit
Atlassian comm and see how JIRA
complements HipChat and bitbucket
can give your team everything they need
to succeed hey guys JC r just wanted to
give you a heads up that we are working
hard to flesh out better content across
all our platforms including Facebook
snapchat Instagram Twitter you name it
so make sure you follow us in the links
