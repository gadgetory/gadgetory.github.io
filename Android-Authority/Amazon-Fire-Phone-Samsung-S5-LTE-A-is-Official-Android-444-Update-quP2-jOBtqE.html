is Jace and if the past few weeks were
somewhat slow in the world of Android
news the past few days have surely made
up for it with two new phones
one being the Samsung Galaxy s5 lte-a or
the prime that's official and amazon
finally after years has launched their
first phone called fire but that's not
it because google has officially given
us art no not that type art I'm talking
about Android runtime and according to
Google it will cut down our app launch
times by half yes that's right now we've
talked about art in the past but it
seems now art is ready for primetime one
of the biggest differences between art
and dalvik is that art precompiled
bytecode when the app is installed
unlike dalvik which requires
just-in-time compilation which happens
when an app is launched so this is not
only an effort by Google to make Android
devices faster but make older Android
devices faster so time will tell whether
or not it actually makes a difference so
for all of you who were peeved at the
rumors that Samsung could be coming out
with a Samsung Galaxy S 5 prime version
only a few months after the original s5
it gets worse or better from depending
how you look at it Samsung just made the
long rumored Galaxy s5 LTE a official in
South Korea the Galaxy s5 LTE which
appears to be the long rumored s5 prime
is the first device on the market to
pack a Snapdragon 805 processor rockin
crate 450 cores 3 gigabytes of RAM and
an impressive 225 megabits lte-advanced
network speeds there's 32 gigabytes of
internal storage and support for 128
gigabytes via the microSD card slot
it features a 5.1 inch 2560 by 1440
Super AMOLED display for a
record-breaking 577 PPI edging out even
the LG g3 which features the same
resolution in a slightly larger format
but unfortunately I have to be the
bearer of bad news because it appears
that this phone will be exclusive to
South Korea
right now after years of rumors and
speculation amazon has launched its
first smartphone and it's aptly called
fire
now from a specs standpoint the Amazon
fire seems pretty solid with a 2.2
gigahertz Snapdragon CPU two gigabytes
of RAM and Adreno 330 GPU and an
impressive sounding 13 megapixel rear
shooter there's even a cool instant
access button that allows you to take
photos when the screen is off other
specs include a 4.7 inch display likely
720p with Gorilla Glass and dual
speakers turning to the design the
handset is rather attractive at least at
first glance and offers aluminum buttons
with a glass back now by far the most
rumored feature of this new Amazon fire
phone was its 3d capabilities that don't
require glasses so how does that work
Amazon's phone does in fact utilize 3d
technology with four front-facing
cameras the feature is powered by
dynamic perspective according to Amazon
which makes it possible for the phone to
redraw 3d images at 60 frames per second
Wow the 3d effects go beyond apps as
well allowing you to move around the
phone's UI by moving your head and eyes
there's also 3d lock screens and the
ability to tilt controls in the web
browser and the list goes on now
although this 3d technology is super
sexy and interesting beyond applications
within the real estate market what are
the real practical applications for this
3d technology could it be just a dimming
just like 3d movie technology is some of
you might be 3d movie geeks but for me
it's a little more than a headache will
it be any more than a gimmick what do
you think are the practical applications
for 3d technology on a phone let me know
in the comments below
so another surprise this week is Google
being the ever incremental engineering
company that they are released 4.4.4
android update no that's not a type on
the script I didn't mean 4.4.3 4.4.4
yeah that's come out for those of you
who are willing to sideload among the
android 4.4.4 update for the Nexus 5 is
largely security fixes including one
major one for the open SSL protocol
however these are just the changes
visible in the AOSP code now for those
of you who don't want to wait for the
over-the-air update for the 4.4.4 you
can look in the descriptions below where
there is a how-to on how to sideload
4.4.4 to your Nexus 5 right now thanks
for watching Android army my name is
Jase I'm right here on Google+ or
Twitter love to connect with you I read
all my out replies and comments you
don't want to forget about my brothers
and Android
the boys we're working real hard to
deliver the best Android car that we can
you also don't want to forget about
Android QA I promise I'm working hard to
get some q and a's out very soon but you
want to go to Android Authority forums
check out the questions on Q&amp;amp;A section
and post a question if you have it or
post an answer if you have a good one
and I'm much more likely to use that in
the show and therefore you're much more
likely to win a t-shirt or up to a $50
gift card for Google Play talk to you
next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
