probably liked it the question is how
does it compare to the competition in
short decent spec bump
no big game-changing innovation but it
does look good well right off the bat
one of the major distinguishing features
of the s8 and si plus is the fact that
it's using snapdragons 8:35
system-on-a-chip
the Galaxy s8 will be the first product
to market a new system on a chip
followed by Sony's Xperia XD premium
which has also been announced to use the
new chip other recently announced 10
sets from LG and HTC are using last
year's Snapdragon 820 1 which is a fine
ship we should add while fall way is
making the most of its latest high
silicon kuren 960 now we should note
that Samsung will also be launching some
of its s8 models with its own in-house
Exynos 88-90 5 processor which is
expected to closely match the
performance of the Snapdragon the point
of note here is that with these new
chips they will move down to a 10
nanometer manufacturing process which
means it will improve your energy
efficiency and performance along with
some notable boosts and graphic
performance Samsung states that the
Galaxy s8 offers up to a typical 10%
improvement to CPU performance and a
more impressive 21 percent gain in GPU
performance since its last inset now
what about the displays and what Samsung
is calling the qhd+ well the new
handsets 2960 by 1440 display resolution
is what Samsung is calling qhd+ q HD
2560 by 1440 resolution is already more
than sufficient for display sizes
between a 5.5 and 6.5 inch display so we
aren't anticipating a noticeable boost
in image clarity with the new display
resolution after all Sony's 4k display
is rather wasted in its limited form
factor samsung has moved over to an 18-5
9 aspect ratio similar to LG g6 which
now features an 89 aspect ratio this
changes here to support future media
content that will move over to its 2
one aspect ratio in the future they
slightly longer display also lends
itself a little more nicely to stacking
multi windows on top of one another now
let's talk about RAM because for most
geeks they love RAM like a goat loves
revenge Wow but it looks like that uncle
Sammy is cooling their ramjets quickly
looking at the memory options inside
today's slide ships four gigabytes of
RAM and 64 gigabytes of internal flash
memory is the norm Samsung hasn't seen
the need to increase the RAM capacity
from last year's Galaxy s7 which is
probably the right call when it comes to
weighing up the cost versus performance
benefits but don't worry too much about
a spec bomb ceiling because Samsung did
put some extra work in their camera and
it didn't come down to just megapixels
when it comes to the camera we see a
similar reserved improvement by Samsung
over last year's model there's the same
12 megapixel dual diode autofocus spec
sheet from the rear sensor of last year
instead it's the front-facing camera
that has been upgraded to an 8 megapixel
sensor with the same F 1.7 aperture
instead of a major Hardware overhaul
Samsung says that it has implemented a
Newell multi frame image processing
technique which takes three images and
combine data from two of them to improve
the look of the final result we'll have
to wait until we can go properly
hands-on with the phone's camera now
let's talk extras we see most of the
commonly used features appearing across
the board NFC fingerprint scanners a USB
type-c port and fast charging technology
are now common across the entire
flagship tear support for 24-bit and
even 32-bit audio files are now also
Universal although listening experiences
will vary depending on the phone circuit
layout and other components only the HTC
u ultra has been brazen enough to ditch
the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and
unfortunately US customers won't have
access to xperia x ease premium
fingerprint scanner either so you want
to take that into account that said
HTC's boomsound speaker technology
remains one of the best and we'll have
to have a listen before drawing any
conclusions meanwhile LG treated in the
quad
da see for wireless charging on the
american g6 so like i said at the top
decent spec bump but nothing super
innovative but the thing looks being
good and i want to note that when we've
actually got our hands on it we notice
that although it's longer and bigger by
dimensions it doesn't feel as big and i
thought that would be a big deal for
those of you who are worried about the
devices being too large when you get
your hands on it tweet me right there i
want to know what you think about it
either in the comments or on twitter let
me know i want to hear your voice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
