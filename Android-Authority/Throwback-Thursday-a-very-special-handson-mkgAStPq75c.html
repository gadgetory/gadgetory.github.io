metal and a bunch of fiddly parts we
thought we'd take a trip down memory
lane and revisit the granddaddy of the
smartphone introducing the nokia 34 10
hey what's up everybody is nerve and the
other day I opened my safe and I found
this phone in pristine condition having
only been used for a few days before I
put it in the safe
13 years ago how does the flagship phone
of 2002 stand up in today's world let's
take a look in this special hands on
let's kick things off with the display
and it's a sign that this phone was made
in 2002 that there's no official
classification for just how big it
measures that being said the monochrome
display supports six lines of text and
has a resolution of 96 by 65 pixels
which might seem low competitor day but
was impressive for a phone from this era
beneath the display we have this iconic
t9 keyboard that lights up in yellow
just like the display itself the keys
themselves are quite easy to press but
they do take a lot of getting used to
compared to the touch screens that have
become so common today think back to
mobile phones of this era and there's a
common misconception that they were
heavy and also quite thick but what is
quite surprising is that while the nokia
3410 is certainly quite thick it's
definitely like competitive a's
flagships at a weight of 114 grams it's
lighter than almost all smartphones of
today's era except for something like
the vivo air LTE which weighs under a
hundred grams the word brick though is
definitely apt as that 22 and a half
millimeters thick it's almost the same
thickness as the galaxy note5 Xperia z5
and the Nexus 6p combined moving to the
back and phones of this era had no
cameras or speakers on the back instead
we had removable Express on covers that
allowed you to customize the design of
your phone taking this back off we
removeable 825 milliamp hour battery
that lasts for a lot less time than
current handsets do now look at the SIM
cards from the era compared to the SIM
cards used in current handsets and you
can see just how much technology has
changed the nokia 3410 was definitely a
firm favorite of mine in the past but
looking back on it now compared to
modern smartphones there's probably only
one feature that I'd like to have in all
its glory I am of course talking about
what made Nokia famous snake too so
there you have it guys a quick throwback
to an icon of the past the Nokia 34 10
and 13 years later it's working in all
its glory thanks for watching and let us
know what you think of this throwback
