really were expecting this we're out of
the main 20 in made 20 pro event the
announced this new phone that is 7.2
hitches and it's kind of a hybrid
between the mate 20 and May 20 Pro it's
got some of the features that the main
20 Pro has like the quad cameras with
the 40 megapixel camera but it isn't
that the integrated fingerprint reader
so you're kind of getting that on the
back but the main part of this phone is
that it's it's 7.2 inches so it's
basically like the return of the phablet
this is basically what the note series
was originally meant to be you can even
get this small way pin with it that you
can draw on it with and like they're not
bundling it you have to buy that
separately and they also don't have one
in this demo area here but essentially
the whole point of this is that if you
want just a huge bone because like big
phones are now pretty much general and
2018 you can get this one 7.2 it just
looks like beer than the original Nexus
7 is absolutely huge other parts of his
phone it's got a five thousand milliamp
hour battery which is enormous because
like a lot of phones like the me 20 pro
is a fourteen thousand two hundred
million power battery which is also
pretty big the five thousand milliamp
hours means you're probably going to
last a really long time assuming this
7.2 inch display doesn't completely wear
it out
and it's got most of the same specs as
the male meet 20 and make 20 pro it has
got the pyridine 80 processor as 6
gigabytes of RAM and as 128 gigabytes of
storage there's also an OLED panel it is
1080p so it's not gonna be like opposite
the absolute sharpest this way but just
messing around with a hearing it still
looks really good you've got the do job
not just to display like you have on the
irregular main 20s you're not getting
the IR face blasting sensors either but
it has started $8.99 which is a pretty
manageable price especially since the
May 2000 is starting at 1040 9 euros
which you know that's a lot of money for
a lot of people and if you just want a
bigger screen and with kind of half the
features and this is gonna be a good
phone to go after so well more
information on this sooner rather than
later this is just a quick look at the
launch event here so will talk to you
guys later and stay tuned for hands-on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
