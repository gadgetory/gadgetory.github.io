and the one plus five is a really great
phone that comes with a lot of really
great features and it would be nice to
have some of those features on other
Android phones so here are five features
of the oneplus 5 that should be on every
Android phone so this is a no particular
order but kicking off the list at number
one is the all-new reading mode so you
guys may have heard of night mode or a
blue light filter which will filter out
the blue light on your screen and give
it more of a yellowish appearance to
make it easier on your eyes when you're
looking at in the dark or at nighttime
where reading mode is sort of a similar
concept but it's also very different
this will turn your entire screen to
grayscale similar to what you get on an
e-reader or in Amazon Kindle and this is
great if you love reading web articles
for long periods of time or reading
books directly from your phone so it has
a lot of practical uses and it wouldn't
be that difficult for other
manufacturers to implement coming in at
number two is gaming do not disturb mode
and the name is pretty self-explanatory
it's a do not disturb mode made
specifically for gaming and if you game
a lot on your phone like I do you know
how annoying it can be when you get that
text message or phone call in the middle
of a game and this prevents all that
from happening and you can select
whichever apps you want this to
automatically enable for or you can
manually turn it on from the
notification shade next up on the list
is customization and there's a ton of
phones out there with their own
customization options and features but
none of them handle them quite like
oneplus because oxygen OS is basically
stock Android the features that are
built in feel like a natural part of
Android and not just a skin or extra
bloatware and there's a ton of really
cool things you can do on oxygen OS you
can customize the accent colors switch
between a light or dark theme and
there's a bunch of different motion
gestures that let you launch the camera
turn on a flashlight and a lot of other
really cool things that you can do on
oxygen OS and it would be really nice if
other manufacturers handle their
customizations in this fashion number
four is the alert slider and this
feature lets you easily switch between
all of androids different ring profiles
like silent mode
do not disturb and of course all
notifications and not only is it really
easy and convenient it's also very
greed this is great for situations like
a business meeting or inside of a movie
theater where you don't want to become a
distraction so instead of taking your
phone out of your pocket unlocking it
and then changing the ring profile you
can easily do it without ever taking
your phone out of your pocket or waking
the phone up and this feature has been
available simply one plus two you would
think by now other manufacturers would
have picked up on this idea but that
hasn't exactly happened so let's hope
that changes very soon last but not
least is dash charging and there are a
ton of fast charging options out there
but none of them quite compared to -
charging it's just insanely quick you
can literally get a 60% charge in only
30 minutes and it's also very efficient
the majority of the heat is trapped
inside of the brick instead of going to
your phone and because your phone stays
a lot cooler it's not going to throttle
the CPU if you decide to use it while
it's charging and it will also continue
to fast charge even when you're using it
which is one of the biggest benefits to
- charging but what do you guys think
about this list do you agree or disagree
or are there other features of the
oneplus 5 that you would like to see on
other Android phones let us know down in
the comment section below and give this
video a thumbs up if you did enjoy it

already hit that notification bell so
