Authority and if you recently just
picked up an lg g5 and you want to learn
a little bit more about it than this
video is for you
this is tips and tricks for the LG g5 so
our first tip is a pretty simple one and
that is the volume key shortcuts this
feature is designed to work when the
phone is locked and should already be
enabled by default but if it is not just
jump into settings and scroll down until
you see shortcut key the shortcuts
aren't user definable which is
unfortunate but you do have a couple of
options from here you'll see that if you
double press volume up this will open up
LG's capture plus application which lets
you do two random things or take a quick
note pressing falling down twice on the
other hand will launch you directly into
the camera and you can also set it to
take photos instantly if you want tip
number two is how to theme the LG
interface so if you're not a fan of the
wavy stock icons look you can change
that by downloading additional beams
from LG smart world application you can
do this by either long pressing on a
home screen and jumping into the home
screen settings or opening up the smart
world application directly and selecting
home theme from the customization
drop-down I was actually pretty
surprised by how many themes there were
but something to keep in mind is it's
nowhere near as robust as something like
Samsung's theme store the themes are
also pretty basic it'll change your app
icons and wallpaper but stuff like the
system UI and the apps themselves remain
the same but it's still a great option
to have if you want to switch things up
a bit
next up is how to enable smart bulletin
and qslide apps the latest version of
LG's UI is a lot cleaner and less
in-your-face and many of their most
well-known features are either off by
default or a little bit more hidden than
usual but they are there if you really
want to bring them back to enable smart
bulletin simply go into settings select
home screen and scroll to the bottom
where you'll find the smart bulletin
toggle from here you can also select
which apps appear in the smart bulletin
home screen and once you're done with
all of that just head back home and you
should find smart bulletin as your
leftmost home screen to bring back
qslide apps you'll actually find this
one under the display settings oddly
enough
just tap on the home touch buttons and
then select button combination from here
simply add the Q slide shortcut into
your navigation bar and you'll instantly
have access to all compatible cues like
apps anytime you want coming in at
number four is the smart settings so
smart settings is nothing groundbreaking
but it's still a pretty convenient
feature this allows you to set a
specific sound profile Bluetooth or
Wi-Fi setting to automatically adjust
based on whether you're at home or away
from home and you can also set which
apps automatically open up when you plug
in headphones or connect a Bluetooth
device
so for example if I wanted to set which
app opens up when I plug in headphones I
just select it
get enable it and then you can pick
whichever app you want but obviously a
music app like Spotify or Google Play
Music makes the most sense here tip
number five is how to hide apps and
change the screen grid size with LG's
new launcher not having an app drawer
being able to hide apps to reduce
clutter and increase the grid size to
fit more apps per screen is more
important than ever to do so just long
press on the home screen go to home
screen settings and from here you'll
have the option to switch between four
by four four by five and a five by five
grid size to hide apps just select hide
apps and pick whichever apps you do not
want to be seen on your home screens
like the pre-installed bloatware for
example and once you're done just hit
apply and that's all there is to it
those apps are out of sight and out of
mind our next tip is how to customize
the always-on display you'll find the
settings for this one under the display
section of the settings menu there's
actually not a whole lot you can do with
the always-on display but you can choose
a show either the time or a signature or
random message by default it should
automatically be set to your name
already but you can change it to
whatever you want and also pick from a
short list of different fonts once
you've made all of the appropriate
changes just hit save and now your
signature or message should be displayed
when the phone is asleep most Android
phones no longer have a contextual menu
button because most menu buttons are now
built into the applications themselves
but if you miss that old menu button
LG's come up with a pretty elegant
solution for that and it's really simple
all you have to do is long press on the
recent apps key and a menu will pop up
and this works whether you're in an
application or on the home screens or
anywhere else that has a menu now if
you're not a fan of the new app drawer
list experience and you prefer to stick
to lg software LG has provided a
solution for those who want to bring
back the app drawer all you have to do
is go into the smart web application
look up LG home
oh no and download it once you have it
installed set as your default launcher
and voila you now have an app tour again
if you don't want lg's launcher you can
obviously always download any
third-party one of your choice like the
Google now launcher nova or apex I know
that most tips and tricks typically have
to do with software but this final tip
actually has to do with the g5s hardware
and I'm going to show you how to
properly swap a module because it's not
exactly as straightforward as you may
think
so before you swap a module the first
step is to power the phone down
you technically don't have to do this
but it's better that you do next step is
to press the release button so that the
bottom chin pops out once it's free just
slide it out and detach the battery now
in order to properly detach the battery
you'll want to grab the chin with one
hand and the battery and the other and
act like you're bending or trying to
snap it in half do not yank the battery
out if you do it that way you're making
it much harder on yourself and you're
also running the risk of breaking it now
all you have to do is grab your module
of choice and essentially reverse the
process attach the battery to the module
and insert it back into the phone and
power it on and you are good to go but
that's going to wrap it up for this tips
