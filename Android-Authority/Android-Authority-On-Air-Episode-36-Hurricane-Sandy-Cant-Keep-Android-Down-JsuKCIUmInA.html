original hangout show for android on
google+ I'm Derek Ross and I'm Scott
Anderson this week we're joined by
returning guest dan Charlton of teammate
dan thanks for coming again as usual we
appreciate it nice to be here Isis Scott
we had a hurricane this week but you
know what we still have a whole lot of
Android to talk about dylan so what's on
the show yeah we got a google actually
just released October Android ecosystem
numbers we're gonna go over that to
begin with then we're gonna be going
over some app updates some major app
updates and then we're going to do some
more information about nexus devices
we're gonna have some little rants about
nexus for not having LTE things like
that then we're going to be going over
jelly bean 4.2 features and kind of what
has leaked and what has been said about
all the different type of features and
then we're going to wrap up with patent
wars which is Dan's favorite section all
right so let's just get started talking
about some Android ecosystem numbers
before we get into the ultimate Android
all the things segment of the show here
so just just very very recently you know
it's beginning of a new month another
month has passed so we get numbers from
google on exactly how widespread android
is in terms of their distribution
version numbers and jelly bean is still
climbing growing very very slowly but it
is growing we're at 2.7% right now um
Ice Cream Sandwich you know ice cream
sandwich is now a year old and it's
sitting there at about just under just
under thirty percent so that's nice but
unfortunately gingerbread still rocks
fifty-four percent of the Android
ecosystem so that's that's a shame in my
opinion since it's so old and so many
things have been improved upon but a
three percent for jelly bean and year
old ice cream sandwiches about said
twenty-eight twenty-nine percent um so
let's talk about what's that Scott
we getting there yes oh yeah yeah it's
slowly getting there I so let's talk
about the Android Android ecosystem here
a little bit play music continues to
grow you know google keeps continue to
grow the the play content to play store
and now they have every major record
label on board the this past week they
added Warner Brothers content so anybody
that was under contract with Warner
Brothers those music groups are now
available through the play store will be
added shortly and that's great and
speaking of music just today a little
bit ago music Explorer launched and
that's just a music discovery tool it's
actually pretty cool if you have an
Android tablet you should check it out
it's not available for your phone i'm
guessing us because there's a lot going
on and maybe it's hard to view on your
phone i don't i don't know but uh it's
pretty cool so what you do is you open
up no to put the Play Store and you
search for an artist once you find that
artist maybe it's one yard have you find
them and you select the artist and you
see a little couple little spheres a
couple little circles you tap on those
and you start exploring similar artists
from there you can explore similar
artists and similar band similar singers
and so forth and it's like a spiderweb
keeps keeps going and going going from
one artist to the next the next the next
the next and eventually you know you I'm
sure you'll find something is pretty
pretty interesting i also whenever you
first view a new artist the music starts
playing right away so for example um I
chose uh on a dead mouse deadmau5
however you want to say it everybody
says it differently I chose them a
little bit ago as a for example I opened
up explore similar artists and it showed
me rose a similar artist so I tapped on
Nero and boom one of their songs started
playing and then the next similar
artists I tapped on and that song
started playing then you can select that
that song then it takes you back to the
Play Store and you have the option to
buy then so it's just a neat neat way to
find new music and they like it um
and getting a getting file matching is
actually coming to to Europe here in the
in the very near future and then soon in
the u.s. I'm actually not very sure what
that actually means Danner Scott a
little bit more about that yes so it's a
a sort of a process by which right now
they just store your music your music
all of it is stored in some separate
individual storage just for you then
everybody else's music isn't some other
individual piece of storage this will
allow them to basically have one copy
one master copy of every song that
everybody just gets their own strange to
them when they want so when you're
uploading your content to Google Music
the first time everything that's also in
its databases it's just going to file
match and give you a copy of its verge
which is good probably be a higher
quality than whatever you happen to have
um and it also means that like you don't
actually have to do all of that
uploading transfer so then you don't
have to do all of that downloading
transfer when you try and match them
back up on the other end so it's way for
them to cut down on the amount of
storage it takes for them to do it it's
also worth noting that they are giving
this away for free and both Apple and
Amazon charge I think its monthly or
annual fees to get access to their file
matching features well very good to know
so Scott what do we go for app updates
this week we got just today chrome of
for Android got updated personally I see
that there's a little bit of a speed
improvement and the release said that
there was speed improvement and some bug
fixes things like that basic update
nothing to schnazzy then we got an
update to field trip Derek you want to
go into detail about that well I
actually stopped using field trip
because I felt that it was killing my
battery now I know Dan had better
experiences with field trip so he
actually kept it around longer than I
did I I used it for about a week when it
came out a few weeks back um
and it's definitely neat concept you
know field trip allows you to find
things to do locally where you're at now
so if maybe if you're I don't know
you're visiting an area and you walk by
a museum and it says hey here's this
exhibit at this museum you know check it
out you know it allows you to plan
events or helps you plan events and it
helps you see different things when
you're visiting a new area I mean
obviously locally it wouldn't be that
interesting because chances are you know
everything that's going on locally but
unless they're in a big city and I
should have no no we're like me where
nothing ever happens so I know exactly
what's going on here so it's not too
useful for me but if I go on vacation
somewhere I'm sure it's pretty cool but
said danda did you actually update field
trip this week I got the update but to
be honest I don't really use the
application it's just sort of thing it's
there matters that me at random times
when I don't really care about them I
mean there were some minor updates who
would just improved application settings
which some of the settings were lacking
before it fixed some crashes on the
motorola xoom and just also had some
other bug fixes so I mean was really
that big of an update so you know what
I'm curious you know since it's still a
fairly new app and I'm trying to find
actually uses for so if you're watching
right now on either youtube or google+
let us know if you use field trip if you
actually use it to what it was intended
for besides just installing it to see
what it was about was pretty much what i
did let us know well revisit that
healing a little bit next we got Google
Earth Google Earth today got an update
um basically just bug fixes you guys
notice anything really big um with the
update yeah I just saw bug fixes opened
it up yeah run around looked a few
things you know just trying to see if
there's anything new I was wanting if
there's gonna be any type of integration
you know cuz Maps was was updated this
past week for android 4.2 and more
specifically a Google now actually it
was updated for for better integration
with with that but um those are some app
updates we can talk about as well yeah
and then another app update a long time
coming it's been a while since this app
and got update
but adw.launcher got updated with a
massive overhaul and yeah that
adw.launcher used to be extremely
popular and then i would i'm gonna say
what ice cream sandwich came out and
they just stops yeah yeah I mean it was
one of the most popular launchers a year
ago and they just didn't do anything
with it but thankfully others stepped
off you know like nova launcher which is
that's what i use um but it's nice to
see you know them come out of nowhere
zombie you know being revived yeah yeah
we got a question about the rumors of
the Google Wallet physical card Scott
you were talking a lot about that before
the show and how useful that be for you
do you think the rumors are realistic
and how exactly do you think that it
work yeah well let's uh add that into
our conversation because I think it is a
very big thing that google is releasing
or rumored to be released personally I
believe that Google needs your
information in order to serve you better
ads if Google is the middleman for all
of your purchases they get all of your
purchases all of your histories of what
you've purchased and also the location
and if you choose to show where you
purchased it that in return is extremely
valuable to google and they will use it
to serve you better ads as well as
serving better google offers now this is
just the beginning of google actually
stepping up to the plate and being a
amazon like store people are not going
to go to google now in the future to
just search it'll be more so thought it
will be interesting because they will
turn more into amazon and actually be
the searching center of the internet as
well as searching searching and
purchasing and Google will know
everything and I think that hopefully
they can serve us better ads and better
offers related to where we're at and I
personally I use public transit so the
rumor of having public transit cards in
there as well as credit cards as well as
rewards cards that is awesome
in one card well I definitely like the
the rumor speculation or actually I mean
it was another Android blog site out
there ripped apart the apk and saw some
interesting information a few weeks back
that basically says that you'll be able
to send people money from your phone so
55 bet Dan 20 bucks that his colonel
won't run on my phone and he and he
loses and you know he can my phone that
your phone is broke Deacon's you know
allah paypal but you know google wallet
just send me 20 bucks um yeah so that's
neat um I don't use that um yeah and
another thing that the google was saying
is you know people don't really find or
don't really purchase things on mobile
on mobile websites and with their recent
rollout of click to purchase but with
Google Wallet makes it very simple and
it streamlines it I think better than
paypal and it is just a middleman it's
not like it doesn't hold any of your
money um but it's very interesting and I
I'm very curious to see what actually
gets released and when it gets released
yeah you know and I think this is a
common answer for any time Google
releases an admin similar to another app
we're already all embedded in Google's
ecosystem androids ecosystem whatever
you wanna call it so adding another
service to their portfolio that i don't
have to go outside them i mean that's
that's good for me in my opinion because
it's easier and it's good for them
because they get more of my data they
can give me more ads and make more money
because that's how they make their money
with you know advertising so it I don't
know some people don't like to put all
their eggs in one basket some people are
Google fanboys and don't care you know
yeah yeah I okay with that so uh let's
uh let's talk about a couple more apps
that God updated here um this kind of
goes into what we'll talk about later
but since we're talking about apps here
let's talk about Google now and he
received a major major update I'll get
into the details later but Google now
like I said that that's a
that's android 4.2 comin at you without
even having to update your your device
right now so if you have an update to
the latest version of Google search
which includes Google now you should do
that we'll get into that later when we
talk about Android 4.2 but there's if
you thought it was cool before but you
thought it was lacking a getting it
needed a few more cards well it got man
it got so many more cards so much more
you know tighter integration to the
knowledge graph and I love it it keeps
getting better it's google nails it's a
platform you know it's it's more than
just an act it's really turning into its
own platform and whatever whenever
google glasses come out which is
basically going to be a front end for
google now but um it's gonna be pretty
darn cool i I'm excited for that but
anyways us let's talk about let's talk
about nexus devices so so Scott standee
didn't let us sit down completely like
sandy cancelled the actual physical
event but Google decided in the middle
of nowhere huh we're just gonna release
everything and hope people start to take
notice yeah I I don't personally at all
it was the best decision but I do like
the slow trickle out but I would really
like to see a live demo to see if the
demo gods are good or not that's always
fun and it's always awesome to see like
an hour-long event yeah and you know
touting all the features and all that
stuff so I kind of Miss that hopefully
they do do it event that'd be cool but
yeah the nexus 4 8 gigabyte version for
299 unlocked and 16 gigabyte version for
349 unlocked I actually crazy cheap yeah
I actually talked to two people that I
work with and they asked me what fun to
get I said wait and they're gonna be
getting those phones so I mean it's
definitely a phone i'm going to
recommend ones on t-mobile and the
others on 18t so she will know it's the
same device it will work on either
t-mobile or AT&amp;amp;T I mean
the people that were gone sorry I'm
sorry and then they gave my version 4
199 on a two-year contract with tmobile
yeah but not even with Wi-Fi calling so
really all you're doing is wasting extra
money to have a contract I agree okay so
I know last show we went over a lot of
the features and rumored features and
all of that stuff and since then we've
had releases of actual specs of these
devices nexus 4nexus 10 all these
devices so wonder than the solid
features that we know of that we weren't
released before there were just rumors
uh well they confirm that it's got
corning gorilla glass 2 on both the
front and the back so that's a that's a
big improvement over say other glass
backed phones that were just ordinary
glass on the back um I remember her mom
Martius Duarte was asked is it gonna
break his glass breaks and he goes well
we designed it differently so I mean
it'll be interesting to see we'll do
some drop tests maybe oh yeah and figure
out if it actually lives up to what they
say mmm other than that I think the only
thing that we didn't know was the the
cellular support that it was going to
have with it so the hspa+ gsm-only no
LTE no cdma Penta ban 3g quad band gsm
so that's hspa+ 42 for t-mobile and
HSPA+ 21 on the rest world that doesn't
actually have a 42 network anyway so um
but this way they can build just the one
device and sell it all over the world
and i'm gonna talk about that in a few
minutes because i have a lot of things
to say about that and you know it's
mainly personal but I'm sure I'm not the
only damn person that cares about it so
anyway we'll continue continue
back there last week oh go ahead dan I
know last week we talked about
processors um and this one you know
confirmed 1.5 gigahertz quad-core krait
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 pro how does it
stack up to currently what's out there
uh well i think was Matthew Stewart a
who said it is the fastest mobile
processor on the market in a phone today
he said in a phone today I don't know
how it stacks up against the Exynos 5
that's in the nexus 10 ah but
realistically that's the only other chip
of the market to compete with it ok and
then wireless charging support that's
yep good from that and they have a
little sphere to go with it that's all a
palm tree touchdown you know what and
and that's pretty cool yeah i would buy
one if how much would you buy for
because you know you gotta buy more than
one what buy one for work by one from
home yep that's what i would do buy one
for taking vacations if there are twenty
thirty dollars or less which i don't
think they're gonna be but yeah they had
to be thirty bucks or less for me yeah i
mean i would definitely swap up to a be
is there 50 i might buy just one yeah i
don't care how much it was i would buy
one just cuz you know you know Oh
although when Matthias was doing the
demo of putting it on there um he said
that they were not released a hardware
devices yet the wireless charging
because it looked like it was a little
cumbersome but hopefully the final build
they you know figure out some stuff with
that yeah um I think the only other
thing that we didn't know is that it's
gonna have a barometer it's like the
Galaxy Nexus did just an unusual feature
for our cell phone but actually not if
they're not have an unusual feature at
all it's very useful to know what like
they are useful yeah hey there aren't a
lot of devices that have them very true
so we use it we use didn't want to check
the weather right
no it helps determine the altitude which
gives you one of the three coordinates
that you need to get a GPS lock and so
it's not a sensitive nut barometer to
actually do any kind of like weathered
aging so go buy an any crazy spam apps
on the market that say otherwise um but
Allah beautiful potential of your Nexus
4 and Galaxy Nexus be able to tell the
weather it will give very accurate
readings of altitude and that's what
it's there for cuz it helps with GPS
lock actually a third of the GPS lock
games Samsung Galaxy Nexus needs time so
I'm wondering that that's going to be an
issue with the LG Nexus they just they
threw it in there to help it out you
know where assume that's are there to
help it out the GPS has built onto the
the die with the Wi-Fi and the rest of
the modems in this case uh but moving on
we also had some Nexus 7 News sambo with
actually they uh they saw this all the
hell hell of a lot of these devices no
it wasn't google that really sees
statistics it was actually yeah yes oh
hey sue said that they've sold
approximately 3 million so far and that
number keeps growing month per month per
month and right now they're they're very
fastly approaching 1 million units per
month now compared the competition we
were talking about that earlier what's
apples numbers look like Dan um I mean
they sold what 19 million iPads last
quarter so I mean that's a lot compared
to only three million in just under a
quarter but there's no more than one
tablet maker in the Android world and
you're selecting about and you also have
to think about the fact that Apple has
more than one tablet so you know they
have 45 now five um tablets and you know
all those count for the numbers so you
know they're still selling and but what
Android is definitely catching up with
them in a specific tablet that
is you know hitting the floor running
which is nice we haven't seen many
tablets do that from the Android
ecosystem but that's good news all right
so we got some price drops is on the
Nexus 7 the new flavors of the Nexus 7
don't you dare call it the new Nexus 7
you know you like that huh okay so uh
the 16 gig version dropped 50 bucks it's
it's now 199 the eight gigabyte version
is it's gone um this is going to come
back who knows but as of right now it's
gone it's not there the new 32 gig
version is selling for what the old 16
gig was at $249 and the unlocked hspa+
version only comes in 32 gig and its
cost Nia 299 so 300 bucks and you can
get a hspa+ variant of the Nexus 7
that's but that's that's it I mean
nothing else was announced new about it
just new new storage new HSPA Claudia no
this is new we we had this leaked all
over the place but now it's just you
know we had price and that's one thing
you weren't a hundred percent sure I
wonder if they had a 16 gigabyte version
with an hspa+ radio how much that would
cost well we know the radio doesn't cost
fifty bucks we know I don't wanna be
interesting what they would prices at
president I mean I that's just to make
money you know they they're selling the
cheap the 16 gig version for next enough
and there doesn't cost fifty bucks to
add another eight gig of flash memory
you know that's all it was seven dollars
i think that i fix it said costs yeah so
they're just doing it to me there don't
take money i mean they're they're in
business to make money so you know
that's okay somebody I'd asked earlier
for just casual use would you recommend
the 16 year the 32 well I'll tell you
what um I have the eight gigabyte
version and I swore by because I have
everything that I do in the cloud you
know all my music I stream from google
play videos I'll stream from google play
four plex I don't store anything locally
i really don't now when the game horn
came out I decided you know it was hyped
up
enough I don't play that many games but
sure I'll download it doesn't like a
couple bucks I'll play it it's a two
gigabyte game um I'm a few other apps on
there not a whole lot and then an update
for horn came out and I had 1.5 gig free
I couldn't update horn and that kind of
annoyed me I had to uninstall dead
trigger 2 update horn and then reinstall
dead trigger which was pretty much yes
and I in my opinion but I had to do it
and I I don't really play games you know
it wasn't a big deal to me because I
don't play don't use my nexus 7 to play
game so I guess my point is is that the
16 gig is probably plenty unless you
want to store things locally the eight
gig you know I ran into some issues 16
is probably the sweet spot for the
majority of people if you're storing a
lot of stuff locally 32 gig you know um
and let's go back to the 32 gig Galaxy
Nexus that I have I have like twenty six
gig free on that thing you know and so I
it all depends what your use case is
average you so I'd say 16 gig is good to
get you're good to go yeah I'm timey I
don't even use all of the eight but I
have online yeah so let's talk about the
big guy The Big Brother the nexus 10
that you know that that screen that we
knew it was going to be amazing you know
we just didn't we just didn't hear a
whole lot about it so anyways uh Nexus
10 Scott you want to talk about that a
little bit yeah well we got a 16 or 32
gigabyte version 16 gigabyte version for
399 32 gigabyte four hundred dollars
more at 499 oh that's van this is
extremely competitive competitively
priced oh it's extremely competitively
priced I would still say unless you
desperately need the extra storage space
don't waste your money on the 32 right
on the nexus 7 you go from 16 to 32 for
50 extra dollars for a hundred dollars
you get the devil storage space and gsm
why pay an extra hundred dollars just
for 16 gigabytes of storage x is 10
very true um I just can't believe that
they hit this price point at this with
this type of tablet I mean the screen
resolution is ridiculous and it's uh I
mean better than the new new iPad the
new iPad yeah it's definitely now you
know some iOS fans out there you know
we're looking at the chris Rizzo I'm
talking to you if you're listening and
watching us some on some iOS fans out
there are looking at the Play Store and
seeing only like five hundred plus ones
on the Nexus 10 and take it home android
fans must not care about it well you
know I've we might not plus 1 all the
things but we're damn excited for this
thing that screen is amazing it blows
your your new new iPad out of the water
like the this is this is an amazing
device you know and and coupled with
android 4.2 features which we'll get
into you know for multiple user accounts
this button this is this is a great
device for for people that have multiple
people in their household and need to
use a tablet ya can't do that on my ped
all that and you get an Exynos 5 which i
would say is probably as good or better
than the DA 6x in the new new ipad
better screen plus gorilla glass 2 plus
a better front-facing camera i'll say
better operating system alright so if
you're getting the nexus 10 let us know
let us know in the comments of
interesting to see how many of you are
interested in getting one not and and
then let me know if you already have a
nexus 7 if you're looking to get rid of
the nexus 7 or you don't have a tear you
don't have one yet you know what are you
looking to buy wanna to replace
something else and what are you
replacing it with let it let us know i
i'd be curious just ask you know what
are your thoughts i mean we all have
nexus evans and okay yeah what are your
thoughts on the edges and if you have a
nexus 7 tablet yeah so so I rock the
nexus 7 I use this thing every day and
why do I use it every day because it's
it's ultra portable I mean it does the
7-inch form factor is my favorite thing
about it it's light it's you know it's
been coined it you know the only tablets
you know that
has throwability which she notes I don't
throw my nexus 7 but but uh you could
you know you could chuck it on the bed
check on the couch is I'm going to break
uh you can I dropped mine accidentally
about a week after I had it right on its
face arm I wasn't happy until I picked
it up and saw was okay and then and then
I rejoiced but uh yeah I was but anyways
uh it's it's light it's easy to hold and
with a 10 inch tablet it which I had
before you know you're laying there and
bad you're sitting on the couch or sit
in a chair you know you're holding it
you know like you hold it like this for
a while right and you're like okay now
this hand hurts then you hold it in his
hand for a little bit then you changed
now maybe you're laying on your side
this and if you're just listening I'm
basically moving around so just you
don't know what I'm doing right now so
but uh okay sorry baby you understand
i'm saying though you know with a 10
inch tablet yeah after 10-15 minutes 20
minutes half hour or whatever you're
gonna change positions it gets heavy
it's awkward I never have to do that I
have to sit there and roll over or you
know sit a different way with my nexus 7
it it's light it's easy it fits my hand
I love it I'm not getting the nexus 10
even though it's absolutely amazing oh I
don't get it if I didn't have another
tablet but I know I don't need it so I'm
not gonna get it yeah I I I mean my
nexus 7 did not replace my transformer
prime they had different use cases and i
still use the transformer prime but I
don't need to replace it and I like
that's what's holding me back from the
nexus 10 is 2 prime still a great tablet
I don't need to get rid of it from your
instant unless he wants to buy one for
four hundred dollars in which case ok
now let's say a person that does not
have a tablet and is looking at the
tablet market would you recommend the
nexus 10 definitely I'm gonna say it all
depends on what your I mean coughs tanya
is that there's money differences tutor
at all or difference hundred dollar
difference in depending on what version
you're going for so yeah I mean money
plays a factor in that if you can afford
to in a box and that's all you can get
and that's all you can afford obviously
get you can afford if your budgets a
little bit more you know get the big guy
get dick if there's I'm going to blow
everything away if you're in the market
for a premium tablet a premium full-size
tablet I would definitely give the nexus
10 yet very long block
fercho so uh earlier we said the nexus 4
was gsm only being only sold through the
Play Store well that's not entirely true
02 is going to have exclusive in the UK
and what t-mobile's selling it for 12
hundred bucks on to your contract so
it's not entirely true but I'm sure it's
good its majority is is l is only sold
by google so google we know wants to
have it to be used anywhere in the world
have it be unlocked have anybody be able
to use it so it's tits gsm because gsm
is pretty much available anywhere unless
you live in certain places of the world
such as huntington pennsylvania so celeb
minute so this is a personal rant but i
but i know i'm not alone in this i know
a lot of people were upset that the the
nexus 4 doesn't have LTE and I'm really
not concerned about LTE I mean I I don't
really care about that it's more along
the lines of CDMA but you know verizon's
not going to put out a cdma only device
so that's a moot point so I I want this
film because the build quality is
absolutely amazing it's setting the bar
for other manufacturers it it's has
amazing hardware and i'm a android
fanboy of course i'm gonna want it even
if it was even if it didn't have amazing
specs and hardware and I mean it's it is
the build quality is so much better than
the Galaxy Nexus it's rock solid I mean
is a nice device so I want it and and I
can't have it simply for the fact that
verizon is my best choice of my best
service provider my best carrier and
people's you know don't don't really
understand that and I think it's that
way from what I've been you know I
wouldn't say researching I'll say more
along the lines of bitching the past
couple days and and people people
comment everyone smile saying oh me too
but but most people just don't
understand saying how can you not have
good gsm services like well you know I
live no nowhere and verizon has amazing
3g coverage here i got to drive 20
minutes in three different directions to
get LTE but let's do
I can drive 20 minutes one way and get
LTE 25 minutes another way and get LTE
and I have 3g coverage everywhere I want
to go here um I do not have that with
AT&amp;amp;T or don't even have tmobile here but
t-mobile will piggyback off of a tease
towers here so what does AT&amp;amp;T have AT&amp;amp;T
has the awesome edge network running at
2g um I barely have that at my house I i
I'm actually trying to test that now but
that's another and that's another topic
so how can google alienate 112 million
subscribers that and you know people
argue saying that it's going to cost
money you gotta test able to put on
another device and I understand and I
really do but my whole argument all
along was Google can't let their largest
competitor the iphone run unchecked on
the largest amount barely largest the
largest neo network in in the United
States and it that for for business
that's how I'm confused and plus the
fact that i don't have gsm service here
pisses me off because i want this phone
and I've been trying to figure out for
two days now how I can talk myself into
living with horrible surface just to get
it and through some help earlier today I
decided that I I can't do it but I would
love to do it but I I guess III think
that there are a couple main points the
first one I think is Google needs to
take power away from the carriers for
example verizon because verizon decides
like we all learned with the Galaxy
Nexus on verizon they decide when to
update the device okay so hoo that's not
for you go on to the next point my Mairi
but we do this like a debate my rebuttal
on that is the average user people that
basically aren't watching this show
don't care about updates don't care when
they get them just the fact that they
actually get them and most people don't
even know that there's an update
available in my opinion that's the part
that you're missing though with this
device Google doesn't care if those
people don't get to buy the device so so
Dan the GALEX not our target
market the Galaxy Nexus received updates
faster than any other phone to jelly
bean on veut the verizon variant did no
other phone had jelly bean before it did
pretty sure no other phone has elegant
at all on verizon I i bet you google was
uh really no jelly bean faster than any
other device and still three months
after it got jelly bean on every other
carrier okay so that was my first point
the fact they need to take power away
from dick carriers and i think that's a
rightfully so it's i agree not just I do
it's not just in the purse the consumers
see like these things with the Galaxy
Nexus there's a lot of stuff behind the
scenes that we don't see the
manufacturers have to pay the carrier's
to carry the devices that makes the
device is more expensive that's how you
can sell an unlocked phone for three
hundred dollars yeah and you know what
it is a side thought on that how can you
sell that an unlocked phone for 300
bucks well as i said earlier when i was
ranting that i've been trying to trying
to figure out if i can get this phone so
I went into my local AT&amp;amp;T rapper very
nice guy I have known him for many many
many years I told him the phone I wanted
he'd never heard of it and and uh I I
told him that it was going to cost 300
bucks and his very next response was oh
well that's probably not going to go to
the phone if it only costs 300 bucks
without a contract I mean are our best
phone the s3 cost 600 bucks without a
contract so that phone is probably junk
why do you want a junk phone as I can
see they that's where the problem lies
obviously carriers are doing something
if if they can cell phone for double the
cost well the big asterisk on that is 18
he's not going to sell you an unlocked
anything yeah they're gonna sell you an
off-contract but still definitely lock
to AT&amp;amp;T yeah device and it's not an
unlocked device that you can just pop in
whatever sim card you want it'll work on
AT&amp;amp;T and that's it I understand that but
I just thought was funny that that how
you know a gay carrier said well the
device costs 300 bucks so it's obviously
junk and that's not that's not the case
so I understand what
Google's doing a wide Google needs to do
it uh life is about my second point yeah
so say your second player sorry Scott
gun okay so second point when the Nexus
line started and has continued the
ultimate goal was to make it open and to
make it very open and pure Google and
with verizon and again it's taking power
away from carriers but it can't be truly
open if some carrier decides when to
push an update so they're trying to hold
true to the actual pure Google
experience i believe ya know i
completely agree i think that google is
going to tell you well if you really
want AT&amp;amp;T LTE or sprint's LTE or sprint
cdma you should get the LG optimus G
just like when they have the next one
mission and the HTC incredible oh wait
Verizon's not going to have the next the
nexus one that's a complaint on agent
surprise you know and i did i did buy
the HTC incredible yep but this is a
complaint you should have verizon why is
it verizon picking up the optimus G I'll
tell you what I'm gonna do it I'm not
gonna get the Galaxy Nexus you know i'll
tell you the day AOSP 4.2 is released
not maybe two days you know i'll give
you know i'm not going to put any
pressure on anybody some amazing
developers out there going to have a rom
up for the Galaxy Nexus on verizon and
I'm gonna be running for point to the
next day so then I personally don't care
I just wanted a better quality phone but
the Galaxy Nexus is still a great phone
I will continue to rock it until eight
EMT says hey we ran fiber lines in your
area two years ago before they rot we're
actually going to do something with them
and they put up hspa+ you know um until
then um i'm just gonna you know you that
I'm moving you know we're so where was a
good place in the country to move you
know well that's a city apparently
Kansas City they have hspa+ they have
google fiber fiber they probably have
some LTE to that Mike's rills out there
I mean
there's also you and I one more point
that I think that they did for when
verizon got a bad rap for slow updates
and you saw that all over the news
you're saying well okay would you
recommend this device what carrier you
on you're on Verizon well I don't know
you know I wouldn't recommend it that
much just because of the slow updates
but the thing is that plays a big part
into public view of the phone and the
carrier if the phone is on verizon it is
going to get slower updates and that
deters people um you know they don't
really care that much about the updates
because they just don't know about him
but the thing is when they hear that and
they hear that they're going to be
getting less updates and less features
then it really does affect that they're
you know mental state and I really does
develop that's true all right so it also
does another personal example here my
dad has the Galaxy Nexus he got it
whenever best buy had it for free for
the two-year contract I told him he
should get it cuz he needed a new phone
so he got it and the jelly bean update
came out and do too in my opinion it
running IMM 76 q he couldn't install a
jelly bean update because apparently the
the mms APK was corrupt on the on the
stock rom and every time it tried to
install the updated failed i actually
had to unlock the bootloader flash the
jellybean factory images and then give
it but anyway that's not my point my
point is is that he read for almost a
month without the jelly bean update and
he didn't care his phone worked he used
his phone he didn't care that you know
every once in a while he did say to me
hey what am I gonna get that thing that
the thing that's better than Cirie and I
said I'll come up and do it one of these
days no but the only reason he knew
about that because as soon as the day I
got it as a dad you gotta check us out
you know I showed him so he didn't care
he know but the thing is he but the
thing is he wanted it because I tell him
about it no but the thing is we always
talk about it so people around us are
always gonna want it you know what I
mean yeah I guarantee you i just did 20
on a week ago if I won't have done it
six months from now he'd be like
yep still using my phone still browsing
the internet still use an app still
making phone calls it yeah well it
doesn't mean that he's getting the best
possible experience out of that device
and it doesn't mean that he doesn't know
that it could be better yeah my my whole
thought process is is that unfortunately
end users the average end user doesn't
care they just want it to work and it
did if it's not if it's not broken then
why not then they don't want it fixed
agreed let's move on because we have a
lot of for dad to stuff to talk about
and I'm excited about a lot of it so
let's start off with the released
features um let's start off with multi
user accounts excited about that for
talent only for tablets only yeah and
that's great you know tablets are more
of a multi-user a family computer let's
say you know you have you have mom dad
kids whatever have a have a tablet you
you really gonna buy a tablet for all
your everybody in your family well some
people do but not everybody can do that
that's expensive so now you have a think
of it as a a couch a coffee table tablet
you know it just hits in the coffee
table who ever sits down to couch can
pick it up and do whatever it have
accessed their own personal stuff I mean
I think it's gonna be great for tablets
oh yeah I think it's been good for
wrecking homes people with kids right
like I know Derek you gave your extra
tablet to your kids but before that you
were sharing it and i'll tell you what
for the longest time I still say I still
stayed signed into my google account on
that tablet until he started G talking
like friends and my accident you know
and and doing all sorts of stuff mean I
disabled that he couldn't buy apps but
it was a pain to do all this stuff and
then and then I was like well you know I
don't I don't want to stay signed in to
this tablet you know I under my account
I want him to have his own account you
know so okay so we got a lot of talk
about what would be great for families
okay so uh gesture keyboard I've been
using this for the past couple days I
really like it because I don't have to
change my keyboard in order
use it nice very nice so you can type
like a regular keyboard and then you can
use you know the gesture typing whenever
you please and I really like that yeah
it's it's not bad I'm not a big fan of
swype I'm not either but the thing is we
got a really long word it's actually
kind of handy and the biggest thing for
me is you don't have to switch keyboards
in India you know it's generally the
predictive text one isn't that bad ah
I've been using it off and on and I like
the fact that I can you know use or not
use it without having to switch
different keyboard now I know swipe you
can type without actually swiping but I
don't like I swipe much more for typing
though okay so next we got lock screen
widgets um I'm excited about some of it
I mean I don't know the form
implementation of it I mean I did we
don't you know we didn't get a full demo
event because of Hurricane sandy so
right now you know various places around
the web or starting to get these devices
and play with them and start to release
information but really on and we know so
far as you can put lock screens on our
sorry with widgets on your lock screen
or do you want to put some lock screens
on your lock screen so you seeking put a
calendar on your lock screen right so
you swipe to the left or swipe to the
right and there's your calendar but
think it'll be cool and I kind of want
to see how it's gonna be implemented to
judge it for what it is both excited
about like I don't want someone to see
my someone to see my personal calendar
yeah but other people may like me I
really got the implementation on then
definitely something I want to use but I
want to know how its implemented you
know for privacy for four people that
you know what if I as it you know say I
don't get in there alright next we got a
daydream it's basically kind of like a
screensaver for your phone um things
like photo slideshows and you would have
news headlines and really anything that
just aggregates into a screensaver so if
you doc your phone or you doc your
tablet when it's not in use which some
people do is like a desk clock or you
know or if or if you're sitting there
because it's
right on the wireless charger you know
if it's on the little the little half
orb charger its kind of hang it up and
sit in there so while it's charging
maybe the screens on and you want to be
a screen saver it's going to flow news
headlines your photos i think that's
cool I'm use it um and then it also has
wireless display support for miracast um
basically with miracast you can a lot of
the tvs and all of the tvs that LG is
releasing in 2013 are all going to have
support for them which is really big and
i think that you know them making the
device really gets them ready for their
ecosystem um but basically what near
guest is as you can stream audio video
directly from your device to any TV that
supports it and also once connected the
TV will mirror everything happening on
your phone or tablet so I think that's a
great standard that is being implemented
and it has something to compete with
airplane right um so then so we had the
uh I'm sorry Scott dead um next we got
quick settings um they're basically
tiles um the quick settings from what
I've seen I am a fan of the quick
settings and you from any screen you can
swipe down two fingers and get your
quick settings that are right away we're
just nice but the fact that the tiles
for the settings are so big and it
frustrates me you guys know the big
tiles yeah I don't like that it takes up
the like the entire yummy I don't either
um okay so let's let's talk about some
4.2 features you can get right now
there's an updated camera just pretty
fun to use yeah it's fun um I yeah it's
fun so there's a new camera UI a new
function of the camera called
photosphere
there's a better filters and editing has
changed a little bit and there's there's
a new gallery and the biggest thing
there is the camera UI change like you
can control all of the different
settings like your flash your uh yeah
all sorts of camera setting all the
camera settings yeah Gator project is
the touch of a button you say you push
in on the button you hold are you
pushing on the screen you hold it in a
little ring pops up and you swipe left
right up down a bee select start you
know whichever direction and you can do
it all from there you don't have to deal
with two fingers I'm to do with two
hands it is all mine three videos yeah
yeah I like it I definitely like
instances but so the big feature yeah
new you I knew a new gallery the big new
feature is photosphere which basically
mimics what we've seen in Street View
for google maps where you hold your hold
your camera up you take a picture and
you keep moving all around in a 360
degree uh you know pattern taking all
your pictures and it then meshes
everything together an awesome skier now
or we can do how you can do 180 degrees
if you want to not do a full circle but
but anyways it meshes everything
together and this awesome 3d orb of a
picture of a picture that you can then
viewing your phone you can post it on
google plus you can post it on two maps
actually so if you're on vacation
somewhere you know it and you took an
awesome scene you know there's a
beautiful scenery you took an awesome
photo you can post it there so other
people can then can view it because the
photos are a geotag so it's very cool
it's fine I'm hearing it from mobile to
google plus and it wouldn't allow me to
then you are mad sir because I've shared
a couple really yeah sure well we'll
talk about that there's been a couple
iterations of this you know it was first
released oh hey look new camera new new
UI oh my god everybody installed it Oh a
second photosphere doesn't work so then
the guys went back to work again and
released uh you know a couple lids I had
to put in his system lib directory and
then Hey look photosphere works oh my
god first four works you know and then
you couldn't edit photos and
and view them and that was fixed in the
last class thing added view so you can
actually view the photosphere pictures
mobile you don't actually have to post
them to Google+ or maps and to view them
to that so yeah so if you were though
you know you jumped on it yesterday
morning maybe the first thing there's a
couple updates throughout the day and
then late last night I believe it like
ten o'clock or so a final version came
out which fixes everything so you can
find them various places around the
internet androidcentral actually
released the majority of those on their
forums so uh thanks Dylan for up for all
of your work we appreciate it oh not
another features 4.2 available now you
know we've been using it for a while now
gmail 4.2 it was a leaked a while ago
which you know has zoom and swipe to
delete um just your keyboard actually
which we were just talking about a early
earlier that the keyboard worked it was
leaked you can go and install if you're
rooted installed on your device and go
ahead and rock gestures and if you don't
like swipe you can try gesture keyboard
it's not bad I like it as I said and
lastly uh the the new google now /
google search you know that is available
from the Play Store you don't have to
worry about leaks to get that you just
downloaded and slap it on your phone it
it's awesome so I said earlier to added
a whole bunch of new car drink so it
adds a pedometer on which we didn't know
about until last night till midnight you
know you look at your phone hey November
first new month Oh what's this tell me
how many miles I've walked or biked over
the last two months you know it is
interesting so Google now can tell you
you need to exercise which um as well as
stock your portfolio so if you use
google finance and you have stock
tickers in there they're automatically
pulled over now anytime there's a you
know one percent change its going to
show you news update so earlier in the
week whenever you know we were i live in
the area where hurricane sandy was
coming through so i started i saw news
headlines about hurricane sandy in their
photos nearby so if you're out and about
somewhere and somebody who has a posted
photos online maybe on maps or so forth
you'll be able to see those
concerts and Google will tell you when
your birthday is if you didn't know
which that's another mini rant and run
on time so I won't go too far into that
basically Google already tells us when
we our friends birthdays are by going to
google com and through google plus it
says hey these are your friends
birthdays tell him happy birthday google
already knows when our friends birth is
our why can't we have that feature as a
card then you can configure which
circles should show up that's my opinion
and last gmail is now part of you know
the knowledge graph and you know it's
been rolling out for a while so if you
label no I'm excited about the Google
now features yeah ah the pedometer is
pretty cool hey how many how many miles
heavy did you guys walk class 111 went
say 1610 I don't remember right so you
got so trusted just what you sow so
gmail gmail knowledge graph so it will
tell you when packages it'll read your
email anytime you get like from amazon
you ship a package somewhere and it'll
say hey here's the tracking number one
out google now reads that it scans that
and then tells you when you wear your
package is at when it's been delivered
and picked up and so forth flights
hotels is is now pulled from gmail
concerts um you know event bookings you
know things like that restaurant
bookings and so anything that comes into
your any type of event that comes into
an email now Google's up scanning it and
going to show it a realm
check check various places online you
can get a little bit of 4.2 right now
without having to wait for it to come
out here in about about two weeks so Dan
thought about patent so yeah there's
been some interesting developments this
week in in the patent wars um Abalos we
know was ordered to apologize to Samsung
for lying about Kat accusing them of
copying on the copying the ipad with the
net what was it tab 10.1 um they put up
a pretty snarky response on some very
tiny little link in their footnote on
their homepage which the judges and he
can't work very displeased with they
basically said the things in the
statement are not true in the first
place and even if they were the way in
which they presented doesn't comply with
the order and they ordered Apple to
change it to a chapel responded
insisting that they were going to need
14 days to do so the judges pretty much
left in their faces and gave them 48
hours so by Saturday morning they will
need to have changed that notice and
more prominently displayed on their
homepage um in more bad news for Apple
they lost their request for preliminary
injunction against amazon for the use of
the term App Store so they've been suing
amazon for infringement on the App Store
trademark Amazon's more or less
responded by saying app stores a general
term like grocery store which is pretty
obvious and that's pretty much what the
judge agreed with and really really just
did not take seriously any of that those
arguments at all and then in more really
bad news brachle they sued Mexican
telecommunication company iphone that's
I fon he um for trademark infringement
on their iPhone product problem with
that is they developed and Trademark the
iphone in 2009 and iphone the company
has existed in Mexico as a trademarked
entity since 2003 won't want one yeah so
Apple I quickly got countersued and
predictably is losing all of this
everywhere including they're now going
to lose the I
phone trademark in Mexico and
potentially have to pay restitution so
like forty percent of the profit of
every iphone sold in Mexico ever so bad
news for Apple all around on the patent
front and that's and that's just great
yes yes it really really is I mean
they're their argument in the Amazon
case it's actually two different claims
one is an infringement then the other is
a false advertisement claimed we're
basically their claim boils down to
apple's app store is such an
unbelievably amazing product that
anybody else even using the term app
store to describe something that isn't
our App Store tarnishes the awesomeness
that is apple's app store I agree yeah
