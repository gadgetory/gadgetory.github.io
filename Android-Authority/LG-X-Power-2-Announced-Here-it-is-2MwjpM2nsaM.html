entry-level device can earn the respect
of geeks but the lgx power to may do
just that
ahead of the Mobile World Congress which
kicks off on February 27th LG has taken
the wraps off a new entry-level to
mid-range smartphone the X power to its
biggest feature is definitely the
battery which has a whopping forty five
hundred million power capacity the
company says that it will allow you to
watch videos for around 15 hours use GPS
for 14 hours or surf the web for 18
hours on a full charge the device also
supports high speed charging tech
meaning you can fully charge the battery
in about two hours or get up to 50% in
60 minutes dude
I can see you drooling from here but
let's talk about some more specs the LG
X power 2 sports a large 5.5 inch screen
with HD resolution it comes equipped
with a feature called comfort view which
reduces the amount of blue light emitted
by the display this makes reading ebooks
and other content a lot more enjoyable
as blue light is known for causing eye
fatigue and keeping you awake at night
under the hood you'll find a 1.5
gigahertz octa-core chipset along with
either 2 gigabytes a 1.5 gigabytes of
RAM and 16 gigabytes of expandable
storage there's a 13 megapixel primary
camera on the back and a wide-angle
selfie snapper with a 5 megapixel sensor
on the front which has a few nifty
features this includes auto shot which
will automatically snap a photo when a
face is detected and gesture shot which
allows you to take a picture with a hand
signal so you don't have to press the
shutter button the LG X power 2 runs
Android nougat and comes with a few
different color options black tightened
shiny tighten shiny gold and shiny blue
I can't even say that with a straight
face God dangit were men call it black
silver and gold or go polish your shiny
