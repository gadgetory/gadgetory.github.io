Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 139 and we have a
special guest this week so let's get
started humble mobile bundle is back
this week with perhaps it's best
offering ever some of the hit games
available in this one are this war of
mine adventures of poco eco Broken Sword
five episodes one and two and goat
simulator goat Z you'll have to pay
seven dollars or more to get every game
but the total value of these games is
well over fifty dollars check this one
out for sure the paid apps for free
pirates have pled guilty to conspiracy
to commit criminal copyright
infringement their contributions to the
piracy market cost developers an
estimated 17 million dollars this is the
first time mobile piracy has ever been
prosecuted in a court of law but we
don't know how bad the sentence will be
until August first researchers have
found over 272 million email accounts
that have been compromised with the
usernames and passwords available to
practically anyone for about a dollar
the numbers are quite staggering and
affect people using mail drew gmail
yahoo and microsoft predominantly just
as a security measure it's probably a
good idea to update your password
sometime soon Rockstar Games is having a
sale on all of their max payne and grand
theft auto titles this is an excellent
time to pick up some of the better
mobile games available today and you can
get a view of them for up to fifty
percent off we don't know how long the
sale will last so grab them while you
can the rumor mill is circulating a
story that YouTube may be creating a
paid cable television service that's
slated for release sometime in 2017
according to the rumors the service will
be called unplugged and it's been in
progress since 2012 apparently all
that's holding up the works is Google
getting all of the stations they want on
the service on board for even more
Android apps and games releases updates
and headlines don't forget to check out
this week's newsletter which is linked
in the video description below there
you'll find all of the stories we didn't
have time for here if you're so inclined
you can sign up for the newsletter by
filling out the form in the written
companion which is also in the video
description below and we'll send it to
your inbox every single week or you can
check out the official android authority
app ok folks we'll take a look at the
apps and games that made a big splash
this week as usual if you want to check
out any of these apps or
games will have those links for you in
the video description below 5217 is a
new productivity application that tries
to help you be more productive by giving
you scheduled breaks between periods of
productivity the breakdown is
essentially a 17 minute break for every
52 minutes of work which according to
the study done by the muse is supposed
to give you the optimal mental agility
to be as productive as possible the
application is simply done with copious
amounts of material design it's only 99
cents and it has no in-app purchases the
Uncharted fortune hunter is a puzzle
game based off of the popular uncharted
video game franchise it features nathan
drake and you'll be solving a variety of
puzzles to help uncover long lost
treasures it's a fairly typical puzzler
with elements similar to puzzle
adventure games like Laura Croft go it
features two hundred puzzles that span 6
adventures so it'll be a little while
before you finish this one it's free to
download and play but it is suffering
from some release day bugs and now we're
gonna throw it over to Josh regard for
the next application this week finally
the Rock has come back to Android anyone
who knows me knows that I'm a huge fan
of the rock and that's why when he made
his own alarm clock app I had to jump
right on it the rock is currently on a
quest called Project Rock to improve
everybody's lives and to help people
chase greatness and this is one way to
do it it helps you wake up in the
morning basically you just create your
own alarm that says wake my ass up at a
certain time and you have a number of
different tones some of which actually
include the rock in them in order for
you to wake up now you just turn on your
alarm hit sleep mode and you get a nice
clock for the middle of the night and at
times you will be able to go into the
application and get a personalized
message from the rock now this is just a
canned message but on most days you will
actually get what looks like a snapchat
video of him actually greeting you good
morning and showing you what he is up to
but there's also another feature on here
and it's called rock time this app will
actually sync up with the rocks own time
to wake up in the morning and you can
wake up at the same time that he does
but usually wakes up well before five
and if you really want to do that you
just got to hit the button and it goes
but what might be more important is what
it lacks and that is of course a snooze
button so that are pretty much do it for
the rod clock I already used it an have
gotten up very early in the morning not
at rock time though because that's way
too early for me so with that I'll go
ahead and send it back to you Joe you
candy astro brownie thanks Josh
battleborn tap is the next app on our
list and it's a premium mobile game
based on the battleborn series while it
isn't quite like it's PC and console
counterparts it does feature a lot of
the characters and elements from the
original games the mechanics are simple
as you'll spend most of your time
tapping the screen to take down wave
after wave of bad guys there are things
to collect achievements to earn an a
storyline to play through there is also
exclusive content for people that own
the game and have a shift accounts with
google i/o 2016 just a couple of weeks
