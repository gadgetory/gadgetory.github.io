handy the Android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly
let's jump right into some headlines
first up this week Google will now be
showing us sponsored apps search results
when we search for apps in the Google
Play Store it's too bad of all the
things that could have given us from the
actual Google search they gave us
freaking advertisements AVG recently
released a report that shows the
applications that take up the most
storage have the worst battery giant and
use the most data yes Facebook is on all
of those lists google has launched
android for work which is a set of
curated apps that help increased
productivity for businesses and their
employees to check it out to head to
android comm slash work earlier this
week developer of falcon pro released a
video slideshow showing how he developed
his Falcon pro application in just three
weeks and what methods he used it's a
great watch especially for developers
last up this week Google Play Music now
allows you to upload fifty thousand
songs to their service for free this is
ostensibly to better compete with Apple
and Amazon but really it's great no
matter how you spin it
if you want to see more headlines
updates and app releases don't forget to
subscribe to our newsletter I curate it
myself and I promise I will never send
you any spam the link is in the video
description below if you're interested
okay focus take a quick look at the
applications that made a big splash this
week if you want to check any of them
out the links are in the video
description below links is a special
kind of browser that opens up in
floating bubbles instead of full screen
like a normal browser and it was updated
to version 1.0 which means it has
finally left beta the update also
brought a number of new features bug
fixes and performance improvements it's
totally free so why not check it out
all my tree is a brand new 3d puzzle
platformer where you play as an
adventurer who must bring a balance to a
crumbling world it brings with a decent
graphics and fun story and surprisingly
good game music it's a dollar
ninety-nine but there are no in-app
purchases there is the occasional bug
here and there but they'll get that
ironed out soon enough
sound hut is a new app that helps you
control your volume and does so without
root using this you can put your
lollipop device into actual silent mode
if you want to and there are a range of
other features such as the ability to
adjust only media volume on tablets it's
free to use with in-app purchases heaven
strike rivals is a new tactical RPG out
of Square Enix it has some pretty decent
graphics and similar battle mechanics to
old-school classics like Final Fantasy
Tactics not exactly the same but similar
it also has a bunch of other content for
you to enjoy it's free with in-app
and it's worth a shot if you're a
strategy RPG fan YouTube kids was
released this last week by Google to
generally positive reviews it is a
YouTube application that is geared
specifically at kids and contains
playlists with entertaining and
educational content again it's
specifically for kids it's an app that
all parents should at least try out and
it is totally free the only issue is
that if your kid is too old for this
stuff they have to go back to using
normal YouTube once again I'm Joe hindi
the Android authority app guy while
you're here why not subscribe to the
Android Authority YouTube channel if
you're hanging out for a minute we have
a couple of awesome videos for you to
