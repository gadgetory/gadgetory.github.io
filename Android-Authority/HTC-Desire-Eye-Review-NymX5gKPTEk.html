continues to gain steam phone
manufacturers are finding new ways of
making yourself portraits better in
HTC's case the solution was to simply
take the rear camera copy it and paste
it on the front is it the camera
combination that we've been waiting for
well let's find out because it's Josh of
Garthim Android Authority what's going
on everybody and this is the HTC Desire
eye HTC continues to push their design
language in the desire series and I'm
definitely a fan of how it makes the eye
look given that it is considered a
mid-range device the Desire eye gets a
plastic construction that still feels
pretty sturdy nonetheless due to a
little bit of weight but the real story
deals with the color yes I do have an
AT&amp;amp;T version of this phone and thus it
comes with an expected red orange motif
but this dual color palette is the
desire eyes calling card something I
should mention is that the version I'm
currently reviewing is the red and
orange version from AT&amp;amp;T but there was a
gray in blue edition that was available
when I first got a look at the desire I
currently I'm not too sure what that
version has gone elements around the
phone include the boom sound speakers
almost ingeniously tucked between the
screen and the bezels at the top and
bottom the button layout is all found on
the right side and includes the
dedicated camera button near the bottom
these buttons are made of the same
plastic and can be quite squishy
especially the camera button which was
the most significant bummer
and of course the dual 13 megapixel
camera is adorned the typical spots at
the top of both sides it's a little odd
to see such a large optical package
above the screen but that is the eye
looking right at you the shape of the
phone is best described as simplistic
but very effective subtle curves around
the sides and in the corners further add
to the attractive aesthetic and with an
accessible 5.2 inch display the handling
experience is up there with the best
HTC likes to keep their devices rather
narrow so the side to side grip is easy
and the smooth plastic keeps things from
getting smudgy which provides a pretty
safe tactile feel the best part being
that this entire phone is actually
waterproof it almost makes you wonder
why other manufacturers don't try to
let's say experiment a little bit more
with their phones looks like the Desire
eye does with color and perhaps they
should return to a more classical shape
like the Desire eye does quite
symmetrically HTC thus does it again in
the design department creating a phone
that looks and feels pretty great
as mentioned before a 5.2 inch display
keeps the desire from being too big
perhaps a better choice compared to the
earlier brethren the larger desire 8 to
6 specs come in with the standard 1080p
display rocking 424 pixels per inch
which is a pretty great density for
sharpness across the board
this is an IPS panel which then brings
the expected brightness levels you'd
want making this a good performer in
even direct sunlight and HTC's penchant
for darker interface elements works well
on the screen that solidly handles
contrast watching movies and playing
games brought me an enjoyable experience
though I will admit that the boomsound
front-facing speakers deserve quite a
bit of the credit here as well now
despite being in the mid-range segment
of HTC's lineup the desire I manages to
pack in a snapdragon 801 the Krait 400
quad-core variation that brings 2.3
gigahertz and speed this is along with
the audrina 330 and two gigabytes of RAM
I didn't play super intensive games with
the Desire eye but I don't doubt that it
will get the job done with minimal lag
the games I did play on it performed
with little to no incidents getting
around the interfaces nice and smooth
but that's due in part to HTC senses
simpler architecture which is certainly
a different take on the classic Android
experience but it's still a highly
accessible iteration HTC is grid design
and the recent apps screen allows for
jumping among nine applications and that
was more than enough for my multitasking
needs as HTC has always managed to get
right to their interface more than
anything else keeps things simple and
thus the Snapdragon 801 is able to keep
things fast Hardware aspects for an HTC
phone almost always start off on the
same positive note quite literally the
boom sound speakers found on the front
and given the placements almost out of
plain sight really HTC continues to be a
pioneer for a feature that many other
manufacturers seem to stray away from in
their own design languages so the sound
from these speakers is already vastly
better than any rear or even side
mounted speakers though I will say that
it lacks the oomph of its flagship
brethren the HTC One
speaking of sound call qualities word
should be with no drops on either end a
little issue hearing the other party
clearly speaker phoning is still pretty
nice with the boom sound speakers though
and the same sensor suite that helped
the HTC One m8 in the usability
Department comes here in the desire I
allowing for easy access to the
interface via swipes or taps after
raising the phone from a table or pocket
it's not hard to trigger these gestures
by accident though but at least they
just get into the actual interface and
don't really trigger anything that could
be troublesome otherwise you get many of
the same bits and pieces inside the
desire eye and this AT&amp;amp;T catered version
did well to provide fast and reliable
internet battery life relies on the 24
hundred million power unit inside which
is a little smaller than may be expected
for phone this size thankfully however
the general experience has yielded the
full day's worth of usage at bare
minimum a lot of different power saving
features are available in order to make
it push closer to the two day mark but
that will probably be only possible with
the super power saver that strips the
phone usage down to its bare essentials
as is the growing trend with phones
these days these Snapdragon processor
underneath coupled with a capable quick
charge adapter allows you to get half of
the battery life back in about half an
hour that was mostly right it took a
little bit longer than half an hour for
me to get 50% back on here but
nonetheless it is a trend that is good
for a lot of users out there and looks
to be the growing norm but of course you
want to know about the camera experience
which is the crux of the desire I
experienced not only does it sport a 13
megapixel camera up front but the
software and sharing experiences are
also in HTC's bag of tricks holding down
the camera button can activate the
camera app which is a nice shortcut to
have but ultimately was the only time
that I use the button this is because
the dedicated camera button is simply
too squishy for what it's supposed to do
the soft press halfway down to gain
focus isn't too bad but pressing down
even harder to trigger the shutter
almost always makes my hand shake and
thus yield a pretty blurry photo more
often than not simply put this was more
of a frustration when it didn't need to
be and speaking of frustration using
both cameras in unison using the
relevant modes seem to be sometimes too
much trouble for the phone to handle
I found it hard to get a uniform
exposure on both and sometimes even
focus on just one side was alright
thankfully there is a mode here in the
split capture that allows you to take a
picture on one side first and then take
a picture on the other side but it's a
little bit more work than I feel should
be needed for something like this
overall the app itself is pretty easy to
get around which shouldn't be a surprise
to any HTC veterans simply swiping from
the very sides of the viewfinder changes
the modes and when you hit the button
you can still see the various ways of
using the camera split capture is a
really nice way of using both cameras in
unison especially in video because when
using photos and split capture some of
those frustrations like I just mentioned
can come up photo booth splits a number
of sequential shots making it easy to
make a collage on the fly this is a mode
that I feel could be used often by
social media users and there are many
modes and manual controls available
though having to go through the little
menu just to activate a mode like HDR is
it really an ideal way to access a
feature that has become essential for
many picture quality is hit and miss at
best unfortunately for a camera setup
that is supposed to champion self
portraits it just isn't practical to use
in most situations where you would want
to take a picture of yourself the main
issues come up when indoors and in low
lights for the most part this should be
expected but let's just say our hopes
were a little bit higher with the Desire
eye a very distinct fuzz and grain
showed up on any pictures away from the
comfort of broad daylight this was also
true for the rear facing camera and
while both cameras benefit from dual LED
flashes their harshness on the subject
just made for pretty much equally
unattractive photos out in the wild the
cameras fare much better and it is
really in these situations that I had a
better time having fun with the extra
modes and taking advantage of the HDR
and right in the right environments it's
a shame that the camera experience is a
letdown in the desire I as it is what
this phone is marketed for and it's also
ashamed given all the other things that
HTC got rights with this device and
finally we have HTC Sense which is once
again at the helm here bringing its
version of Android complete with
blinkfeed the second screen news
aggregation experience for anyone that
is used to sense in the past this will
feel exactly like it has a more recent
iterations the app drawer is a vertical
list the recent apps screen is a three
by three grid of your apps the home
screens are secondary
- the blinkfeed and vice versa and the
overall operating system takes on HTC's
typical dark motif it's really not that
hard to get around sense making it one
of the more easily accessible versions
of Android that I would recommend to new
users colors take on a very important
role in this newer version providing
cues for where you are in the system
like blinkfeed or the gallery many of
these elements are customisable in a
theme section though the changes don't
do too much to detract from senses
general aesthetic HTC's applications
help make the experience more unique as
well blinkfeed is still one of the best
second-screen experiences available on
android showing a grid of news stories
or social media feeds that are easy on
the eyes and full of customization
options and like in the case for the
gallery pictures and videos are bundled
together in a number of ways the most
useful of which being probably by date
so you can trigger the readily available
photo editing tools and even a nice
highlight zoe reel for your daily
memories and speaking of Zoe's the Zoe
app is now fully available and is a
place for you to share your custom made
memories with the masses though my only
gripe with it is the lack of users
currently on that ecosystem sense has
matured much since its original versions
and in the most recent iterations it
still is one of the best Android
iterations out there at least in my
estimation because it is very accessible
for even the novice user so also HTC has
proven that their operating system is
not only at home under flagships but can
bring a lot if not all of the features
available to the user to their mid range
as well and in this case the desire I
Rock sense very well currently the HTC
Desire eye is available on ATT in the
States and can be had on either of their
contracts or monthly payment plans
though it's full unlocked price on the
website comes up at five hundred and
forty nine dollars though there are
plenty of mid-range offerings that
provide many of the same experiences
none have the dual powerful camera setup
of the Desire eye which makes it a bit
of a bummer that this phone's
differentiating feature just doesn't go
above and beyond and so there you have
it the HTC Desire eye is HTC's first
take on a common problem front-facing
cameras are just not as powerful as
their rear facing iterations and HTC
believes they need to be for our
self-portrait obsessed generation does
it do the selfie revolution justice well
yes and no while HTC provided fun and
useful modes take advantage
of its front-facing optics their picture
quality just isn't a step forward where
we did hope it would be a bounding leap
perhaps HTC needs to perfect their rear
facing cameras before thinking of
putting two of them on the same phone
but when you look at the rest of the
phone the Desire eye is a very
compelling package of attractive design
great internals waterproofing and boom
sound speakers that could make many
flagships flinch and this disparity in
quality especially considering what this
phone was supposed to be able to do or
let's say capture is ultimately it's
unfortunate Achilles heel as always
