handy the Android authority app guy and
welcome back to another episode of
Google Play weekly this week we're gonna
talk about even more Google apps that
got updated the Xbox one smart glass app
coming to Android some Google Play Store
updates and a whole lot more so let's
get started in our first bit of news
this week the Google Play Store is
rolling out some previously announced
changes that are directed mostly at
tablets there is now a design for
tablets section so tablet users can get
the apps they want not only are apps now
categorized by being designed for
tablets but apps that don't meet the
criteria are designated as being
designed for phones only even though
it's a small change it's going to affect
the Play Store in a big way especially
for tablet owners as it'll now be
possible to get the best tablet
experiences on Android with less
searching the Xbox one was just released
and with it came the Xbox one smart
glass app much like the smart glass app
for the Xbox 360
Android owners can use this app to
control the interface on their Xbox one
it has most of the same features as a
360 version of smart glass you can move
around the interface control your media
message friends and even get game help
it's a free app and you guys know how
much we love those if you're picking up
the Xbox one we highly recommend you
pick up the smart glass app to Google
Wallet got a pretty big update over the
last week included are a number of new
features including the one we've all
been waiting for which is tap to pay
using host card emulation the bad news
is the tap and pay feature is only
available for devices running KitKat
along with tap and pay support comes bug
fixes performance improvements Google
Wallet cards support and the ability to
take a picture of your card and have it
added to your account while we're on the
topic of Google Apps Google has combined
Google Play Magazine and Google Currents
into a single application called Google
newsstand the resulting mash-up should
take some of the sting out of Google
Reader not being around anymore and it's
actually a pretty decent application we
won't talk about it too much here
because we did a review of the
application you can find the review on
our YouTube channel so far people have
had mostly good things to say about it
it provides an excellent gap between the
hardcore minimal RSS apps and the
beautiful if somewhat cluttered RSS apps
like Flipboard pocket recently updated
its app to version 5.0 it was a pretty
big update that brought a number of new
features and a fully revamped UI
the result is a cleaner easier to use
application the app was already pretty
awesome and it brings a lot of nifty new
features like highlights which breaks
down your stuff into categories so you
can read what you want we also did a
review of this
location which you can find on our
YouTube channel so who wants to see some
trending applications as usual if you
want to check any of these out you can
find them in the written companion in
the video description the first on our
list this week is to do it it's already
touted as one of the best to-do list
apps available for Android today and
your recent update has only made things
better
new features include Google now support
- clock widget support and Android
KitKat support if you haven't yet now is
the time to check it out
Google Drive was recently updated
included in the new update is a new
light theme a quick action bar swipe to
refresh better upload reliability and
more spreadsheet functionality if you
have been bulking on trying Google Drive
and this update has some features you've
been waiting for go ahead and give it a
shot the Twitter continues to inspire
and impress this year as they improve
their app yet again this time around
they added new filters to search improve
trending and discover modes and a new
verification backup method the app has
been improving to battle its third-party
competition and if you haven't checked
it out in a while now's the time to do
so it's not very often that we hear
about Google Translate updates because
the app is already awesome however an
update was recently released it does
more than just fix bugs or improve
performance there is now a new interface
that makes it easier to communicate
people while you're out there actually
with them along with some edit
handwriting and camera functionality
usually TV provider apps really aren't
that good but they are trying to improve
in a recent update direct tv now allows
customers to view 30 channels from their
mobile devices when they're not at home
these includes Showtime stars the Food
Network and a lot more if you have
DirecTV and you don't have this app you
really should once again I'm Joe handy
