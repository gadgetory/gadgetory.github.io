s4 well we've got five reasons you might
want to buy it readings I am Chris look
now a little while ago we played the
devil's advocate and gave you five
reasons not to buy the s4 now we're
going to be kinder and gentler and give
you five reasons why you might want to
pick it up after all number one looking
at the benchmarks on android authority
calm the galaxy s4 is one of the fastest
devices currently available no matter
which version of the processor you're
running the hardware is some of the best
around now in the last video I said that
it wasn't that much of an upgrade at
least not as much as I would have liked
to see I still believe that to be true
but that really doesn't matter because
it is an upgrade as I've said before
we're starting to reach a point where we
aren't going to see performance growing
leaps and bounds like it has in the past
that said it isn't too likely you'll be
thinking man I wish this was faster
number two as much as a lot of people
myself included love big honking
powerful phones like the note 2 they're
always going to be a little unwieldy
compared to smaller phones and this is
an area where the s4 really nails it
it's just big enough to have a screen
that's great for watching videos and
browsing the web but small enough that
you don't feel like you're making a
phone call on a tablet I've seen for
myself that this is a really tough
balance to achieve and I've got to give
it to Samsung they definitely did that
here on to number three we recently
compared the cameras in the galaxy s4
and the HTC One and long story short
they're both great but we did give a
slight nod to the s4 now here's the
thing let's ignore all the more gimmicky
features and just get down to the nuts
and bolts just looking at picture
quality a lot of people are calling the
galaxy s4 s camera the best smartphone
camera currently available now pay
attention I didn't say best Samsung
camera or best Android camera people are
saying it's the best smartphone camera
enough set next now this is a point that
a lot of you raised on the other video
and it's worth addressing the
as you were right there are always going
to be new and better phones coming out
and eventually you've just got to make
your choice and hopefully be happy with
the phone you picked with the kind of
specs and design you're looking at in
the galaxy s4 chances are pretty good
that a year from now you're not going to
be kicking yourself and wishing you'd
waited yeah something better will come
out but the s4 should hold you for a
while and now the final best reason one
of the coolest announcements at this
year's Google i/o is that Google is
going to be selling an unlocked galaxy
s4 that runs stock Android now that's a
chance to get some of the fastest
hardware currently available with a
blank slate of an OS that you can
customize to your heart's content now
some people prefer fancy features
included right out of the box and that's
why this is great the normal galaxy s4
is still available this kind of choice
isn't something we usually see and it's
very very neat all right between this
and other videos we've done by now you
should have a pretty good idea on
whether or not the s4 is the right phone
