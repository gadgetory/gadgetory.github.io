my name is Jason and this is where we
try and answer your most pressing
Android questions like how do I fix this
charger that doesn't charge don't touch
it don't breathe on it so let's talk
about a real popular question the most
recent comes from eight the eight nine
and Abdul where they ask hey what is a
64-bit processor what does it mean and
what does it mean for me and any future
phone I might buy alright let's say that
this device is like a great library and
this library is commanded by a librarian
but this librarian has 32 assistants now
for example if someone comes in to this
great library and says hey give me all
your books on dinosaurs for example
those 32 assistants are not tasked with
retrieving each of those books
now each assistant can only take one
book therefore to retrieve all 64 books
the assistants have to make two trips
each but what if that librarian had 64
assistants those assistants could make
that trip in in one cycle so and that
would significantly increase the speed
of your device or the library in this
metaphor but it's not exactly that
simple so I know that some of you
computer science engineers out there are
groaning because I've simplified this
metaphor quite a bit but for the
purposes of explaining in a couple
minutes the librarian is the CPU those
as thirty-two assistants are the bits a
32-bit processor but it has 64 bits it
can almost double the amount of data
that can retrieve and doubling the time
kind of because there's other factors
that play here there's two one is RAM
now most of you who know a little bit
about city four but processors aren't
going to know that that needs more than
3.2 gigs of RAM to really utilize that
64 bit processor it's going to need at
least four ideally six now the rumored
Samsung Galaxy s5 against rumored is
rumored to have at least four gigs with
its
a 4-bit processor so it could help yes
but it's still a lot more processing
power than the gigs and then the RAM can
sustain right so there's a bit of a
bottleneck there but I will tell you
that the other major factor is the fact
that there's almost no programs out
there that support 64-bit processor now
take some comfort in the fact that when
this happened in Windows PCs I remember
the last time I built my my latest pc
rig there was just this push to change
from 32-bit to 64-bit and there was only
two games that I could play that were
64-bit supported but that changed within
you know 18 months so bottom line is
what does it mean for you well it
doesn't mean much now it's overkill now
but in 18 to - 18 months to shears that
could mean you could could utilize some
wicked programs that would support that
64-bit power for those of you who love
this stuff there's two links below that
goes into a deeper one from reddit and
one from stack overflow enjoy now moving
on to Mahna Mahna asks hey I want to
convince my mother to change from iOS to
Android which phone should she get well
if you think she's really ready for the
move ask yourself the question what do i
OS users really like about iOS it's a
simple quick user experience even though
it may be a restricted user experience
and what phone is doing that really well
right now the Moto X with the voice
commands the it's 4.7 big but not too
big it's really doing fantastic and at
350 off-contract
you really can't go wrong now if price
is a concern you consider the Moto G
although it's a little underpowered at
179 off contract you can't go wrong go
mom all right guys how many of us had
this problem where we've had to prop or
tape up our charger just so we get the
right charger properly I mean this is
overkill for a fact but uh we've most of
us have had this problem so I did find a
fix for this right here on YouTube
there's a gentleman who has a channel
that has a couple videos where he gives
you a step-by-step instruction guide on
how to clean the charge port in there
because it turns out that for the most
part that's the source of the problem
it's not an electronic malfunction per
se but it's just a bunch of soot and
grime in the charge part that
be clean with common household tools
that you can you know employ yourself so
be warned though you can damage your
device and even hurt yourself so follow
the guide step by step be careful if
there's any of you who use it and it
works or doesn't work let me know in the
comments below I'd love to hear about it
so after reading all your comments I
noticed that there is a number of
Samsung Galaxy s3 and asked for users
who are lusting after KitKat 4.4 and
have yet to receive the update so if
you're impatient you can't wait there is
a video in the links below that gives
you a step-by-step guide on how to route
your Samsung Galaxy s3 s4 to get 4.4
KitKat now but I also saw someone who
said don't believe anything jason says
because I've routed multiple devices and
never had a problem it's not dangerous
okay don't be stupid
use common sense there's two things that
are undisputable fact one you do void
your warranty two you can brick your
phone it can happen most of the people
it doesn't but it can happen so you know
be forewarned know what you're getting
into before you do it let me know how it
works so guys before we go I just want
to ask you a question about what you
want to see here on Android authority we
do you know a number of different things
news reviews drop tests lots of geeky
stuff what else do you want to see like
someone suggested about doing a myths on
Android series and reduce iOS you know
moving migrating from iOS to Android
guide are those kind of things that
you'd like to see tell us what you'd
like to see and like them when you guys
put questions for the QA or in the
Android weekly and a lot of people you
know thumb them up I'm much more likely
to take those on and address them in the
next show what do you do the drunken
sailor what do you do the drunken sailor
what do you do a drunken sailor lion
