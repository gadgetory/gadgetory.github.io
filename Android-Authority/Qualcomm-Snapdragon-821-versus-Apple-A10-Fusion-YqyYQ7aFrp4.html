Android Authority now two of the most
popular mobile processor design
companies at the moment are called Combe
and Apple now Qualcomm's current leading
processor is the snapdragon 8 to 1 and
apple's of course is the a10 fusion but
how do they compare with each other or
they like when you put them side-by-side
well if you're brave enough follow me
and let's find out now before we get
started with this comparison I just want
to say two things first of all we are
just talking about chips inside of a
mobile phone there's enough problems in
this world there's Wars that there's
diseases there's terrorism ok let's not
just blow this out of proportion and the
second thing I'd like to say is that
actually apple and Qualcomm aren't too
forthcoming about the technology that's
in their mobile processors so we have
the snapdragon 801 and we have the apple
a10 fusion well what are they like when
you put them side-by-side what are their
feature lists well let's have a look
well first off it's worth mention that
both chips are quad-core arm v8
compatible processors now Qualcomm and
Apple both have architectural licenses
from arm and that basically means they
have the right to design their own arm
compatible chips using their own
designers using their own technology as
long as it is compatible with arms
instruction set and architecture now
they've both got quad cores and they
both use what's called heterogeneous
multi-processing that's why I'm a polite
Alling fusion what it basically means
the two cores are kind of high
performance they run at higher clock
speed and they use more power and there
are two cores which use less power on a
lower clock speed and are more power
efficient and the idea is that they
juggle between the two depending on the
different workload however there is one
big difference Qualcomm can use all four
calls simultaneously home from what we
understand the Apple chip can actually
only use two cores at one time and it
switches between the two powerful calls
and the two less powerful core now in
terms of the GPU we have the Adreno 530
in
qualcomm 8 to 1 and that's Qualcomm's
greatest and latest GPU and kokum will
be designing GPUs for several years now
and we find them in their different
series of chips as we've been going over
the years now up until now Apple has
used the power VR GPU from imagination
technologies however this is the first
time that Apple are actually shipping
their own GPU now talking of GPU is also
interesting to note that Apple supports
OpenGL ES 3.0 and its own metal API
whereas the Qualcomm Snapdragon supports
OpenGL ES 3.0 and the Vulcan API and
there is other api's so Apple have got
less API support but then again they
control the whole phone these chips are
only made to go inside of iPhones and
maybe inside of iPads
whereas Qualcomm sell their chips so
just about everybody that will buy them
including Samsung including other
smartphone makers including set-top box
makers including tablet makers including
media player makers they have produced a
general specific will cater for lots
lots of different use cases whereas
Apple are producing one that only
supports their use case and of course
that's a difference in the business
model between these two companies and
one last thing worth mentioning the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 actually has
quick charge 3.0 support built into the
processor so every phone that built that
has the 8 to 1 in it has capable of
having quick charge
technology built into the phone every
tablet the same whereas Apple moment
doesn't have any quick tile charge
technology and it's certainly not found
inside of the SOC and in fact talking of
things not included in the SOC another
thing that's interesting is that the
Qualcomm chip includes the LT modem as
the modem used by your 4G and 3G in 2d
networks built into the SOC where's
Apple don't build the modem into their
SOC the a-10 doesn't have a modem built
into it but it does use modems on
external chips and internally enough
three out of four Apple phones use
Qualcomm modem so Qualcomm actually are
being used inside of Apple chips for
their modem technology now my testing
for performance comes in two categories
first of all I'm using several of the
off-the-shelf
benchmark apps you
find that work on both iOS and on
Android so everyone will go and to -
we've got bit Geekbench and we've got
Basemark OS - now my second set of
benchmarks are ones that I've written
myself now writing benchmarks work
across two platforms is quite of a
challenge so the first set of benchmarks
I use use the Lua programming language
because there are SDK is available for
both Android and iOS and I've actually
got some C programs that I wrote and
I've used those in a previous video that
I've done when I was comparing the
difference between C speed and Java
speed on Android and I've taken the same
code and I've compiled it on Android
I've compiled it on iOS to see what the
difference performance is so that's kind
of a look now to do these performance
tests I've got a Google pixel smartphone
and I've got an iPhone 7 now as a caveat
of course there may be faster Snapdragon
8 to 1 devices out there I chosen the
picture because it's probably one of the
most important phones of this year and
of course I know that there is a
difference maybe between the iPhone 7
and the iPhone 7 plus for example the
iPhone 7 plus has got a bigger screen
got a greater resolution screen to the
GPU will have to work harder so you know
I know these are just two phones and
maybe we could use different phones to
get different results however those are
the two that I've got and they do give
us a good indication of the underlying
performance of the SOC s so our first
test is with antutu and as we can see
the iPhone 7 beats the pixel not by a
huge amount but by a significant amount
now if you go over to the androids comm
website and find the article goes wrong
with this video you'll see how I've
analyzed the individual figures that
come from the antutu results to see how
it got these particular numbers and in
particular it's worth noting according
to an - to the pixel has a better GPU
than the iPhone 7 however the rest of
the test the iPhone 7 is actually faster
and our next test of course is Geekbench
and Geekbench has two types of tests one
is a single core test which basically
runs on one core in the phone - doesn't
matter if there are two calls or four
calls or eight calls it will give you
the same result class of per core test
and weak
see that the Apple a 10 fusion is
significantly faster than the snapdragon
8 to 1 when it comes to the single core
test and in the multi core test
basically all four cores are used
simultaneously and again we can see that
even in that multi core test the iPhone
7 came out tops and then really to
verify the antutu and Geekbench are
telling us the truth we use a Basemark
OS 2 here which again shows a fairly
significant win for the Apple a 10
fusion hats off to Apple that's an
excellent result and definitely the
numbers speak for themselves
that was a results that we've got from
these popular benchmark apps but now I'd
like to use my own benchmarks to see
what numbers we get out now my first
test basically does a whole bunch of
math processing it does some prime
number finding it does some hashes it
does some table sorting and basically it
runs through the tests and it tells you
how long it takes for each test to run
now the time is in milliseconds and we
can see that actually the Apple produced
its result making it through all that
tests in about half the time of the
Snapdragon 8 to 1 so according to my
first benchmark the other benchmark by
an to 2 and geek bates seemed to be
coming true
the a-10 certainly did very well during
this test now for my second test I move
things over slightly into the graphics
world I have a simulation which kind of
puts two drops of water every frame into
a container uses a physics engine to run
that all that calculations and some
floating crates that float around the
water there's more water being added in
and it basically accounts to see how
many droplets of water can go in in a 90
second period now so the theoretical
maximum score is ten thousand eight
hundred so let's have see how these two
phones did well the scores are almost
identical the Apple a10 fusion in the
iPhone 7 is ten thousand two hundred and
two droplets of water in a 90 second
time frame and the Samsung sorry the
Snapdragon 801 with the Google picks or
managed ten thousand won
178 so they're almost even so it seems
as I bumped up the complexity here to a
the whole 2d physical simulation with
all those particles of water going
around that actually both phones
performed very very well and for my
third set of tests we're now using these
C programs I wrote both on iOS and on
Android there are three different tests
the first one produces some sha-1 hashes
for a block of data does that lots and
lots of times and then sees how long it
takes the second one tries to calculate
the first million prime numbers using
trial by division and the third one is
race it's a complicated maths function
that does multiplies and divides as
floating-point operations to see which
function how long it takes to run that
function so let have a look at the
results now in this particular case
lower is better and the Snapdragon 8 to
1 makes you complete my tests in nought
point 6 5 4 seconds compared to naught
point eight six four seconds for the
iPhone 7 we see the same thing again
with the prime numbers half the speed a
half a time taken on the Snapdragon
twice as long taken on the iPhone 7 and
again for the math function again the
same theme naught point 1 5 seconds
compared to null point three oh three
seconds now this is a bit of a mystery
because up until now all the benchmarks
we've seen have told us that the Apple
a10 is significantly faster than the
Snapdragon 8 to 1 in the Google pixel
and yet when I run these C tests we find
that actually it is the Snapdragon 8 to
1 which is twice as fast as the Apple
a10 now I don't know why that is I just
know that I compile these two C programs
on the respective development tools that
you have for each platform now there
could be some problems for example maybe
the optimization inside of the iOS app
is less than the optimization on Android
that's a possibility maybe there are the
tests were too short for example maybe
the tests ran on the lower cause in the
iPhone and the schedule didn't have a
chance to Swit them over to the high
power cores because they only last as
you've seen half a second
or something like that so maybe the
scheduler didn't get around to moving
over to the high power calls or maybe
there's some other kind of optimization
that goes on in the software level that
tells the hardware do things differently
and that didn't kick in when I was
running my tests so I don't know why but
according to these tests of mine the
snapdragon 8 to 1 is significantly
faster than the a-10 now without further
research I really can't say any more
than that so it's all very well having
the performance but what about the power
how is the power usage of these two
different mobile process as well as I've
said I'm using the pixel and I'm using
the iPhone now they've basically got
different battery sizes in them there's
different screen sizes in fact the pixel
has twice the resolution in terms of
pixels than the iPhone 7 so there's more
power being used by the display so this
is quite difficult to actually do so
what I did and I this is really the best
I could do right now is I turn both
phones on turn them down to their
minimum brightness level and left them
for an hour sitting on the home screen
of the respective operating systems and
just saw how much battery was used and
then when I ran the tests I actually -
took away subtracted that power usage
when it was idle hoping that will take
away what the screen used so we can get
maybe a closer look at what the system
on chip is using so then what I did was
I ran two tests one is I use the 3d game
Epic Citadel to test the 3d capabilities
of these two processes and on the second
test I played a video to see what the
usage was like so according to my
calculations for doing the 3d gaming the
pixel use 415 milliamp hours worth of
battery whereas the iPhone 7 used 319
million pounds of battery so it might
seem at first glance that the iPhone 7
is more power efficient than the Google
pixel how we have to remember the Google
picks is pushing around twice as many
pixels per frame when it's running Epic
Citadel and it's actually doing that
without using twice as much power
so although the pixel is using more
power
is actually doing more work and for the
second test running the video we find
actually both devices used are basically
the same amount of power so even though
the pixel is powering a higher
resolution display the video processors
in both phones work very very well and
so now this year there's been millions
of phones that will use the snapdragon 8
to 1 and the Apple a10 fusion I won't
declare which is best because clearly in
terms of performance the a-10 seems to
have the lead but there are other
factors involved like cost for example
like API support like modem support like
fast charging that you find inside of
the snapdragon 8 to 1 what's the GPU
like in the 8 to one compared to the GPU
like in the a-10 i'll let the numbers
speak for themselves you decide which
one you prefer now I really will look
forward to reading your comment but can
I just again ask for a level of maturity
we're talking about chips and a mobile
phone we're not talking about anything
else
the world's got enough problems that it
is without people getting angry with
each other about which mobile phone they
use if you want to get the technology if
you want to admire what Qualcomm and
Apple have both made then let's just
talk about it in the comments below well
