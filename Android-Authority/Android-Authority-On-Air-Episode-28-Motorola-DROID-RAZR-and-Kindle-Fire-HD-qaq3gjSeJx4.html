original android hangouts show on
google+ I'm Derek Ross and I'm Scott
Emerson and this week we are returning
guest Johnathan Franklin fellow android
enthusiast and our resident ranter Dan
Charlton you love him you hate him he
hates various CPUs he codes he does all
sorts of crazy stuff dan welcome to show
John welcome to the show what's up guys
it's a crazier introduction every single
week it does continue to have to build
off of previous experience eventually we
have an entire show just introducing Dan
so was the skull are we talking about
besides that I'd and this week we're
going to talking about the number of
Android device activations that was
released at a motorola event um we're
going to be going over some ICS and
jelly bean updates for phones and
carriers also some app updates /
releases also some new devices and
rumored upcoming devices and we are
going to be giving away an Android
thority odd t-shirt so yeah alright so
if you're watching this right now it may
be a little bit of deja vu yesterday we
tried to do it it had some technical
difficulties but we're back we're back
in action here so let's get started
Scylla is is scotts away a little bit of
Android activation news so if you want
to go back in June Andy Rubin announced
that there was nine hundred thousand
Android devices being activated per day
just under a million about a month later
at google io 2012 google announced that
over a million devices were being
activated daily fast forward til this
past week and motorola's on display
event in New York City Eric Schmidt
announced that the total number of
device activations had now surpassed 1.3
million per day and out of those 1.3
million 70,000 of them were tablets to
date there is almost half a billion 480
million
Zach Android devices that have been
activated around the world that's pretty
crazy that's a lot of devices Android is
is a is a freight train that cannot be
stopped so following activations we say
well all these activations yes what are
they running all these devices running
well jelly bean is starting to slowly
creep up there jelly bean has
one-point-two percent you know what
though that's not bad and it's been out
what six weeks yeah and and those are
mainly Nexus devices you know only Nexus
devices yeah yeah so that you know that
that's not that um faster than I see us
was yeah yeah Ice Cream Sandwich was
John said ice cream sandwich is still
slowly gaining traction it's sitting at
about twenty one percent right now um
it's been out for what was announced
last October first devices came out in
November so it's going it's going on
close to a year right now it's only
about twenty one percent honeycomb is
still in there about two percent for
someone known reason manufacturers
update your tablets please and
gingerbread is still rocking 57% I don't
expect the the progression of Ice Cream
Sandwich to be somewhat similar to I
think was Claire we're sort of it took a
while for it to start catching on and
then sort of picked up a little ground
and then was just eaten alive by froze
domination very quickly right like I
think this might be the high water mark
for ice cream sandwich and ice cream
sandwich is gonna start disappearing to
jelly jelly beans more of a latter one
never let lateral move it's a minor step
up with the framework yes not nearly as
major as gender Brett gingerbread ice
cream sandwiches by far the most you
know even Erin Android yeah even from
Android zone beginning it's more
significant than anything we've ever
seen for PGL drivers and stuff yep so
Scott speaking of device activations in
Ice Cream Sandwich and jelly bean
updates a few devices that updated this
week not as much as we'd like but if you
did right
yeah for Springs we got the Galaxy Nexus
on the nexus s 4g they're getting jelly
bean this was announced yesterday as a
phased rollout and this is kind of a you
it's an over-the-air update which is
great don't have to use Kai's but 480
ICS update for the Samsung Captivate
Glide not started yesterday as well but
that is an update through kies or keys
however you want to put onto it whatever
floats your boat I think he's jesus i
can set the carry us we're some player
update because they don't want to have
to put the data transfer bill let's talk
about keys are quick and android updates
all these devices that are getting ice
cream sandwich from samsung via keys or
causes God says you know they're they're
only being updated in my opinion by the
tech savvy the average person isn't
going to know to download software put
another computer plug your device in to
see if there's an update unless they're
being told by their carrier you know
getting a message and email a text
message or whatever you know i mean it
most people aren't going to know that
and then plus most people don't want to
have to go through that hassle all just
to give up big most people don't care
about updates so i think the problem
with your your argument about it being
just for the tech savvy is the tech
savvy right first of all don't have
samsung passive glides and second of all
already have rooted vices yeah oh really
this is for the consumer that happens to
want to look and is complaining about
not getting an update yeah a buddy of
mine i working today oh well no you need
to plug it in and do all this crap to
get your update like oh it's out there
Joe playing loss yeah well that's like a
buddy of mine I work with he uh he has a
samsung tablet and he had to get it
through keys and he was talking with me
about it he basically said you know if
you wouldn't have told me about it and
told me I had to go do this I would have
never done yeah you know and said so
that
your job as a tech savvy person though
if you know somebody has a samsung
tablet and the updates coming through
keys or phones going through keys you
know let them know no get their ice
cream sandwich on form I think it's just
Samsung's cheaping out on that one cuz
Epton deming baby your bed bet to pay
the carriers to push the OTA update i
think is just a way for them to try to
circumvent having to pay that I don't
know that they have to pay our carriers
for it I like I don't know that that's
the hold up i think the carriers are are
sort of the problem in this not so much
samsung i finished still have to go
through the approval process but i don't
know if there's a separate fee to
actually you know bandwidth wise push
the OTA or not I don't know how that
factors in because you're going to tie
up their own people to test the software
you might as well go ahead and push it
through and just get it over with but
they're also pushing Keys based updates
for Wi-Fi only devices yeah we cannot
new is that does take the whole carrier
aspect out of the equation because for
the tablets that are Wi-Fi only it's not
a carrier issue it's just Samsung being
lazy so is it them not wanting to you
know download a massive update over
Wi-Fi thinking that somebody might be
downloading an update and then walk away
from their hot spot and then have the
download be corrupt or something now
it's not that hard to have the download
self check for complete oh I know they
could definitely do an integrity check
all right so let's uh let's talk about
some app updates here this week we had
one big one for some people ah Scott uh
utorrent utorrent beta hit the Play
Store basically it's a torrent a
searcher and downloader and it's popular
on desktops and laptops and it's kind of
nice having it come to the phone so you
said we've done is it actually a torrent
client percent to our client yeah it's a
hundred percent of our client which is
really awesome but the search
functionality just searches google which
is kind of funny yeah so but you can
recharge this has been taken down for
dmca reasons yeah and this you can
subscribe to RSS feeds if you got
things that you want to download
something to release every week or
something like that they also you can
set upload and download limits which is
nice as well so I it's in beta it's
strongly in bed right now um but it's
getting there that's pretty cool for a
tablet that you have mentally definitely
previous BitTorrent based apps i've seen
have just been sort of controllers for a
desktop app yep always seemed pretty
stupid to me yep yeah that the utorrent
uh remote or whatever you know that I've
used before to log into my desktop and
control it you know control the torrent
actions from there it was helpful from
time to time but no I wish the whole
thing on earth yeah but there will I
mean will I want to download torrents to
my phone then you know what I mean like
I need to do this but hey you can if you
want to remember a few episodes back
about Hayes a server in your pocket or
you decided to baby well enter utorrent
it's all we're saying yeah that's true I
mean if your alts units point your
distribution of linux to put on it yeah
yeah so uh devices this week amazon
scott came out with a whole bunch of new
players of the game huh yeah kindle fire
one $149 kindle fire HD 7-inch for 199
which ships September 14th that's a in
all about a week little less than a
week's is yeah and then kindle fire HD
8.9 inch two hundred ninety nine dollars
and ships sometime in november and
there's an LTE version for 499 dollars
yeah they thing comes with a fifty
dollar a year subscription to 250
megabytes of data a month on AT&amp;amp;T LTE
only that's just weird yeah Yello whole
thing of this is weird these are also
all three of them ad-supported so it
basically turns your lock screen into an
amazon advertisement screensaver page
and the 250 megabyte allowance goes good
to download all those ass nice high
resolution image and everything here you
are okay Don extremely small LTE
footprint you get all of the ads that
Amazon can throw your way yeah okay so
to be to be you know a realist on this
here we're making fun of it cuz they're
only giving you 250 mega month but it
only costs 50 bucks and for the most
part everywhere you're using it for the
majority of time most people use a
tablet you're at home your work your
hotel at airport coffee shop restaurant
you're somewhere that has Wi-Fi so for
the few times that you just need to
check something yep 250 250 mega for a
couple times a month really isn't that
bad it only cost you fifty bucks you
also have to be in one of the 12 AT&amp;amp;T
LTE places Wow well that was it was
Chromebooks Chromebooks were giving you
a hundred megabytes of verizon 3g for
free yeah and not only that the female
readers give you 250 megs a month for
free dan you don't have to use LTE it'll
romana clearly network my understanding
was that it was LTE only no no it'll
know there's 10 radios than that thing
if it's 10 billion 10 bands it'll it'll
work on three teams AT&amp;amp;T only I'm not
busy I don't know but if it fits because
that's who they got to make their deal
with but it will work on 3g it's not
just not just Forgione so you can you
can use it in areas without you get
other data plans or you just stuck with
this fifty dollar a year or Twitter 50
megabytes and that's it I'm not a
hundred percent sure how that works but
that you do any amazon isn't exactly
forthcoming with details about all the
little hidden caches in these much like
they didn't bother mentioning they had
supported nature of all threads yes how
you can't opt out of that yet yeah yet
long and when you can you have to
basically tack an extra unknown maybe 20
maybe 30 maybe fifty dollars on to the
sale price of all of these more we're
assuming it's going to be somehow
unsubsidized but it mean that's just our
assumption yeah I mean it's the
assumption based on what their previous
prod
Tibetan right like I had supported you
readers that you pay 30 bucks to get rid
of the ads on them and then move on so
yes we had thirty dollars i'm gonna cost
of all these all three of these tablets
Oh Dustin brand 250 megs it isn't 50
bucks a month it's fifty dollars a year
yeah for 250 a month Turner 50 megabytes
month I don't know I think it's nothing
I if I had that on my Nexus 7 I would
lie pay 50 bucks right now to use to 50
meg of of mobile data in a jam if i can
tell you downloaded your three songs
then what are you gonna do next what
kind of funds you don't go in my car and
I need to do something real quick people
write a lot to look and it was done with
the long symphonies so you know the rim
is known for daddy right 310 it's not
meant for content consumption over 3g
it's meant for quick no that's exactly
what it's meant for Jeff Bezos made it
very clear these aren't gadgets their
entire purpose is to provide you with a
service that is correct with it with a
4g 3g the motivator HD movie a month
well think about it though what you're
praying for your carrier you're getting
literally 3 gigabytes of data a year for
50 bucks which is a year yeah I mean
you're paying 50 bucks a year but still
you can pay fifty dollars say a month on
the carrier and get five gigabytes worth
of data so yeah they know and for me
Birdman it's not is it a deal I mean I
was a different use case for me
personally I don't need five gig on my
Nexus 7 of mobile data I need good I
need the few times i'm out somewhere
maybe and I don't you know I've never
tested it because I haven't needed it
yet so what does i just i just made
comparatively about the value of it 3
gigabytes worth of data 450 bucks is not
exactly that much of a deal no for 35 a
month you can get unlimited from
t-mobile yeah okay oh who adds would it
be given the hardware and we'll go over
that would it be worthwhile to flash and
just
your own rom on it and get rid of those
ads would it be worth while at the
prices that they're offered right now to
just buy the hard work so no no no on
all three editions dan you you're not a
fan go now I know that the the little
guy that the revamped the new kindle
fire minutes it's rocking the roughly
the same hardware you know the Galaxy
Nexus hello not even the same hardware
as the Galaxy Nexus not even good it's
using a lesser 000 during that process
or correct yeah yeah so and and that
technology is a year old right now so it
put its hundred fifty nine bucks it was
it worth 150 nine bucks I'm pretty sure
you can get a Galaxy Nexus 4 about that
price in remember well remember the
Nexus 7 it is uh oh that's right what
he'd get something that's mother Joyce
is good I did well we're just dollars or
hardware and come with you know a $25
credit so that brings it to price down
plus it depend on google wallet which
brings the price down and it's a free
yeah its head free which brings the
price down further and the software
implementation is 50 gazillion times
better oh yeah and the list goes on but
the thing is one thing I do like is do
micro HDMI out on the the new kindle or
the house the new fire on the new fire
HD right yeah I'm high quality nice
things it has more storage space I don't
know if it has expandable storage but I
know it does have more space only other
than that it's got absolutely nothing
that even compares to the quality of the
Nexus 7 it's got the same resolution
screen but it's LCD which is not as
high-quality as the IPS that's in the
Nexus 7 hi it's got the same processor
that's in the galaxy nexus we keep
referring to the little guy the the
right the kindle fire about it let's
talk about now let's talk about the HD
then the 7 inch HD for 199 yeah LCD
screen so not as good as the one in the
nexus 7 the same ship that's in the
galaxy nexus s so not i mean
a good processor when it came out a year
ago yeah but it's not exactly impressive
anymore now what about the whole
marketing ploy about how it has the
Wi-Fi antennas demanded my mobile
support my mode means multiple in
multiple out so basically it can connect
multiple times to the same access points
you get faster connections so it was
what that means like right now if you
have a say a wireless-n network your
Galaxy Nexus or your nexus 7 will only
connected like 65 megabit I believe even
if you you're sitting right beside
you're not gonna connect any faster than
that but what they're saying is you'll
be able to connect a lot faster up to
what's what's wireless-n 250 Meg to
something like that long enough so you
will well I said I know it worked i
connect to 250 megabit on the end on my
laptop so you'll be able to connect it
at least that now you so so that they're
selling that is their marketing plan
with this that you can connect so much
faster well remember what the neat thing
about internet access is is you're only
as fast as your weakest link so most of
the country is sitting there it thought
an average okay pils 8 megabit per
second project action in the country is
the average let's even talk about me for
I comcast I have 30 mega bit so the 65
megabit that my nexus 7 connects that is
still twice as fast as what something
can be thrown at me so then you could
argue all the weight maybe they're
talking about local networks but these
are devices meant to download stuff from
Amazon's Cloud yeah that that's just a
bunch of fluff for people that don't
really know what this needs it's really
not that big of a deal okay it is this
is pretty much the same thing as Samsung
advertising for their as yet
non-existent a 15 processor that it's
going to have a camera what it is Wi-Fi
display which is basically Samsung
inventing some new title to put on
something that absolutely everything
else can already do yeah nothing special
just something for Hammett on Amazon
try and brag about to try and make
people think that they're putting out
good products when in fact they're
really not it's nice to see them
continue to use Android as their base
though I do like that and they've
improved it to ICS up from wasn't built
on froyo before yep so the next one will
be built on jellybean probably or you
live among the key line will be I think
key lime will probably be a more major a
software update than jellybean know if
they'll have really have time to do what
they I don't know what key lon is gonna
bring either okay well let's not get
into that yes yea though i just made
based on their slowness to react to what
they have so let's recap here for
everybody watching so even it no matter
what what version the LTE version for
500 bucks g 8.9 inch for 299 the 7 inch
HD for 199 of the 159 in dope regular
kindle fire dan any of these uh you
would recommend troops any people i'm in
any case i'll circumstance know how
about you John can't say that I'm
necessarily would over a nexus 7 though
what about if somebody is already on the
the Amazon ecosystem you're already
using Amazon's Cloud for music they're
ready using amazon mp3 either their
prime member you know they're already
maybe they have amazon movies on their
blu-ray player or TV or something I you
there already part of the Amazon Cloud
it don't work if your Prime member i
think is the main advantages i don't
think that it really has an advantage in
that I think the question is not so much
are you an Amazon user as are you only
ever going to use Amazon if you only
ever use Amazon the same way that iphone
users only ever use itunes for any of
their content that they want to consume
ever then sure go ahead and get a kindle
but if you want to have the option to
use amazon and potentially any number of
other content providers no i don't i
wouldn't recommend getting the kindle
reader app on any other android device
you can get your kindle movies a pond
that's the point Android allows you to
access other content systems I'm sorry
but Android that we know it allows you
to access other content systems where as
you know the kindle fires version of
android again you can't do that without
you know a little bit know how so you
say yeah I I wouldn't be read and
putting another version of Android on us
oh yeah yeah exactly exactly I think
anytime you've got the option of a
equivalent operating system where you
have one that treats a third party as a
first class citizen versus one that
tries to close you and lock you in you'd
be dumb to recommend the one that just
locks them down to one particular when
they have an open ecosystem that gives
them options yeah doesn't make sense why
lock yourself into a company that might
fall apart three years later right no
right for somebody that is tied into the
Amazon content community there's no
reason why they can't use a nexus 7 to
access that yeah but for somebody that's
maybe a little bit in Amazon but also a
little bit in Google's content system or
a little bit into other smaller
retailers they can't so much do that on
the kindle fires so so the next question
is because these things the previous
edition version of these sold twenty two
percent of the u.s. tablet market and
they sold a ton of these so is it
going to sell more than the nexus 7 you
don't like a fix them because just
because they I wouldn't be surprised
when way or the other well I think it
will because it's well known I mean it's
a well known product everyone knows what
a kindle fires not everybody knows what
a nexus 7 is or a nexus or a nexus nexus
endure what Google has done a better job
advertising the Nexus 7 and they have
nexus devices in the past and I have not
done what I would think is good enough
they need to give it in a retail store
like a best buyer one of the most
popular ones and stuff just was it
staples and you know a couple of others
I mean they need to get an outlet for
them yeah I mean it's just they need to
really do better making deals with
retail partners well I mean the other
thing is Google's still release him
just getting into the con yep ethereal
hardware producing sort of mode they're
getting there you will the Nexus Q can
be released again yeah I wonder if
they're going to do another event for
two I mean I think that will depend on
when they do it it might just end up
going sort of sitting on a shelf until
next I out it might okay so let's move
on to more to roll up Derek you want to
take that I'll talk for a little bit i
like to talk to my motorola yeah exactly
so motorola did some neat stuff this
week they in my opinion their
announcement was hey look this is what
google was doing with the company we are
Google now this is the new motorola be
excited for the new motorola you know
Motorola's going to do things in my in
my opinion the first few minutes of the
speech or the first 10 minutes of the
speech mean when Eric Schmidt was
talking was basically throwing around
Google's cloud in my opinion stating you
know this is what this is what we're
doing and I'm excited I am I would
recommend these phones to people
actually I have recently to two
co-workers um to Motorola announced the
finally the upgrade to the razor the
razr HD and they announced the upgrade
to the razr maxx which the razr maxx HD
and they announced a new little guy
which i'll actually very excited for the
razr m I think out of all three of those
devices I mean in my opinion don't even
go for the the razr HD we'll get to that
minute don't even talk about that guy
you know if you're going to get a razr
HD go for the one that has to bed
battery life yeah and and then the raise
our rent but they're all very very
similar specs basically except for the
battery and the screen um said we owe
money to get into the majority of Oh
mean they have 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
s4
cesara get your ram 32 gig of internal
storage till everybody you know there
once storage with me at times on the
device I think the regular razor and the
hem are smaller but the max is bigger
the men yeah exactly um you have an 8
megapixel camera 1.3 megapixel
front-facing camera you know the the
razr HD has a 2500 mAh battery and the
milliamp hours on the on the amaz ittle
bit smaller than that coming in at two
thousand and the maxx HD is a little bit
bigger coming in at 3,300 which gives
you a hours of web browsing 32 hours of
mixed usage so I hate those numbers
those hours of usage if you're a heavy
user you can suck that battery down as
fast as you please so I take that with a
grain of salt just like driving a car
but miles per gallon is how fast you go
so yeah it's the battery on those
fingers are meant for the presentation
is what 27 hours of talk time 21 and I
don't know it's a fun it is I will give
it credit as a friend of mine has the
original RAZR MAXX and yet last forever
yeah i mean the original RAZR MAXX is
one of the longest lasting LTE devices
on the market it's not hardware is it
all it's all battery capacity because
that's like things a home at just like
the Galaxy Nexus hands and we know how
bad it is all better now but these
phones they kept touting about you know
how fat how long the battery is going to
last on all of them the main one of the
main points of the the announcement was
that they want a phone that lasts all
day long they don't have to struggle at
the end of the day hoping oh god I hope
I make it home from work so I need to
charge my phone these phones will you're
gonna go to bed at night and you don't
need to charge your phone until you know
to the next day you know these though
maybe on minimal usage will last for two
or three days but it's triggered and we
have to be able to browse the web using
chrome for 48 hours straight I mean
that's that's what
the Nexus the next Nexus 7 does that it
does 10 hours so it's almost as good as
your nexus 7 owners it almost last as
long as that for web browsing and that's
LTE too I mean that's not using Wi-Fi
it's using the big battery Corbin LTE is
saying of self that that's not bad
that's exciting um said they have the
the you know Kevlar casing on it just
like the previous uh razor devices
corning gorilla glass yes you I'm sure
we'll see some fun drop tests here in
the near future but one of the most
exciting things for me was the razr m
which has a larger display even though
it's only a 4.3 inch screen smaller
display yeah they're so a smaller
display or point 7 verse 4.3 4.3 being
me out yes and it's lots of qhd rather
than 720 and keep you in mind 4.3
doesn't include hardware keys either
like if you think about a film 3 like a
thunderbolt glad you got 4.3 plus
hardware keys you got 4.3 including the
software keys on the M so it's
effectively closer to a 4-inch display
as far as what you're yes don't forget
that the lack of a bezel the screen its
edge to edge it is not edge to edge but
it is very close to that it is a smalls
buzzle that's out but it is its first of
all you know the average person is not
going to no damn if there's a millimeter
of the bezel there it's virtually the
average person can tell ya it the
average person isn't something good on
that when they see space between getting
along really entered the device they
think gee I don't see an edge there now
remember the bezel isn't the plastic on
the side we're talking about the glass
vessel you're never gonna have a display
without some level of bezel on it yeah
even as flexible displays for samsung
have about three millimeters but there's
definitely plastic on the side after say
no but man maybe someone these days I
guess yeah I can never say never yeah
when we may have a project dryer sooner
or later yeah technology surprises us
all the time so similar series rarely
it's barely wider than an iphone which
is impressive enough weren't they saying
it has what forty percent more screen
than an iphone it's amazing song is
longer than iphone obviously but it's
like within was like within a millimeter
of the width of an iphone with a 4.3
instruments are very when probably did
they were telling you how they had
seventy eight percent more pixels this
is not the end but the the max and they
know our percent more color saturation
yeah yeah so it's been the iphone 4s oh
yeah the iphone 4s is going to be
replaced and but they use that is a
comparison set the bar that it's
seventeen eighty percent you know better
characteristics for the screen yeah i
think is also way for them highlighting
the fact that these devices are in fact
not look alikes yeah so bring it Apple
try it to us this doesn't look like
anything like your products okay so
let's move on to their on Motorola's
announced new exchange program basically
this this is a program by motorola
saying that if devices were made in 2011
and washing 2011 and they don't get
updated to jellybean that customers will
be offered a hundred dollar credit to
buy a new motorola phone hannah cool
yeah that's considering yeah i think i
like it i mean if my demise listen get
it i go on a par top that's that's nice
yeah i mean it i suppose it's better
than other carriers just say oh no we're
gonna get to it we promise three years
later yeah motorola gets slammed a lot
for lack of updates but samsung is the
jump substantially worse i mean i don't
know wise Motorola's pinned out as being
one of the worst one for the updates but
up takes their outs of the loader
locking mm-hmm and was even the galaxy
s3 on verizon had a encrypted butta
butta of course it got cracked but
that's beside the point they're starting
to lock them down now on verizon so
that's a carry everything the not a yeah
yeah just you're comparing with the
razor would you know which is on verizon
too so it's it's kind of a lateral thing
but you know motorola has been better
not not quite as good as HTC has been
passed about updates but they're better
than samsung and LG yeah and I wonder
how hard verizon is going to push these
razors cuz i know they push the razors
before pretty hard like all the razor
before was the number one marketing
thing of all time by Verizon Wireless it
also the iphone 4s during a corner so
they they didn't know when the Galaxy
Nexus came out you know they they didn't
try to what we all know they didn't try
and sell them yeah that when I was
talking to the various verizon wraps
multiple of them told me that that the
razor was the number one marketed phone
of all time they never in terms of money
spent on advertising in the push for it
so I'm trying to talk me out of buying
our galaxy right now than ever before
what's that Dan car that's just that the
cost of advertising continues to go up
so it costs more to get the same amount
of advertising now than it did yesterday
well yes but they also may be spent more
money but they also spend more
percentage of the money to on
advertising for it well I'm not gonna
push a Galaxy Nexus because it doesn't
have v cast on it it doesn't have the
carrier after they're making money off
of it and like they try to talk me out
of getting Galaxy Nexus you'd think that
they're just actively sort of selling
against it at least like it greatly
Google support that yeah well yeah I
mean I mean I they tried to talk me out
of it and I got an own launch day it
wasn't they know it wasn't like oh and
we got this historical daddy that says
you know it may be crappy as possible
Nexus ever that's crazy I I just seen a
couple customers getting talked out of
the iphone 4s strictly because of the
LTE but that's been a main decider as
well as the battery life they've been
pushing them towards the razor which I
understand that I mean you're a customer
more satisfied if they're in charge at
last and it has all te spoor they're
gonna be happier motorola hit the nail
on the head with a
RAZR MAXX for the average consumer
because yeah but then they came out with
eight different versions and then they
kind of pasting from each other just
smoking off all of the previous
customers yeah so they need to come up
with I would argue that they should not
have the razr HD I agree with now I know
people that chose to get the HD as
opposed to the max because they didn't
care about the extra battery life I
don't think that it's a problem for them
to have the two different offerings I
think it's a problem for them to offer
them at two different times okay Oh
goners there's like a millimeter worth a
difference between the two devices form
factor wise now I don't think because of
that I think most people wouldn't even
notice but maybe gotta mean obviously
you save a little bit of money i guess i
mean it's 20 but 2500 milliamp hours is
pretty generous even for a base offering
that's much more than I mean that's more
than the galaxy s3 has that's more than
any other phone i can think of on the
market has as a base option but 3300 you
got a 3300 million power battery
combined with a Snapdragon s4 it's gonna
last a long time so it seemed so John
Dan Scott I have a question for you a
lot of people were yelling complaining
that you know motorola which is now
owned by google is putting out phones
that don't have stock Android horns it
all comes with blur down with motor oil
comes the blur so my question to you is
what do you think of what I'll call the
new blur the the blur that was demoed on
the phones have you watched any of the
demo videos that are on YouTube other
than it used to be which is nice I think
that's I mean they sort of go on the
same direction as HTC with lightening it
up but also I mean as much as people
keep going out about these are the first
phones coming out for motorola after
it's a google take over first of all
that's demonstrable false because the
motorola Photon Q with the first device
to come out from Motorola after the
takeover and second of all these devices
are coming out too soon after the
takeover to have had any significant
Google influence in their developers I
I'd say the next group of big phones
yeah maybe might be considered the first
homes but i'm thinking maybe after that
even will be true hey this is what
Google is doing with Motorola this is
what our vision is for the operating
system on motorola yeah calvin cycle on
these devices is easily a year yeah so
we've got some time to figure out what
they're actually they're true visions
going to be but right now I think that
they've gone in the right direction for
the for the time being yeah no I think
they've made a big step in the right
direction I'm not sort of staggeringly
impressed with any of their devices I
think they're roughly the same as the 1
series and coming out six months later
but I don't think they're bad devices I
think they're just as good as the other
top end devices on the market i just
think they're six months late to the
party when these things don't have
removable batteries correct no no okay
there are the reasons why they can make
them as thin as they do yeah we're clear
the software is a marked improvement
over what it honestly like the software
on those better than I do touch with and
sense right now they did add some cool
stuff even with the current edition with
the razr HD like you can swipe to the
left and get your quick settings real
quick that was about my favorites might
be there left or swiping to the right to
add a new screens it's out as obvious
that they're paying attention I mean uh
there's a stockist it's not stock but
it's not offensive yeah now the clock
widget how each of them don't you know
does something different you know each
of the three little circles like sets up
your notifications and brings up
settings and so forth and you know just
wipe up on the phone icons and the other
to peak until your phone calls and time
in have added some stuff that's useful
you know you got for our lock screen
shortcuts I'll tell you what it's not a
bloated skin in my opinion you know and
I hate corners you know I just did that
it's not a bloated the custom framework
yeah yet because custom framework it
isn't it's it's not bloated it's not bad
I I run it I would have not disgusted
looking at it or anything there have
been like TouchWiz makes me the nature
of us it was the most no yeah now I want
earn it and you know stabbing the net
with a knife but I mean uh and I
actually I kind of like the fact that
you're starting with home won home
screen because i really don't populate
all five home screens on the neck i
usually use three yeah i have a widget
or two but yeah i never use more than
two or three I've got one that has all
my settings and stuff and I've got one
that has all my bein used apps and I've
got my widgets it's I just don't see a
need to have I mean I see need that some
people might have that many by like the
fact that you're not forced to use a set
amount of home screen yes that is that
underlying great thing about it and I do
like the fact that the like Derek was
talking about the multi-use widgets
mm-hmm I do like that yeah I don't think
of every time you look at a custom piece
of software they kind of have to have a
signature motorola used to have the
swipe down contact widget but it's kind
of sense you look at a flip call you
know even if it's beautiful widgets and
you look at a flip clock you think since
you don't think that's just a cool
android widget you just automatically
think HTC sense yeah that's very true so
I guess the question is is how many home
screens do you have OD can you have now
how many do you have well you can have
seven on blood of the noogler servants
and um so let's go around I mean OMG i
so how many homeless on which device on
my phone oh yeah you know what I I've
gone for a stringent over a minimal know
we're gonna talk I want a minimalistic
effect in the past in the past year I'll
say I i used to have all sorts of seen
the widgets or the place you know app
icons folders everywhere you know in
multiple multiple home screens I only
use three now and they're very barren
they have each of them you know only the
clock widget on the home screen a couple
folders very clean you swipe left I have
you know some folder shortcuts in one
widget you swipe right I have
widgets and some more folder shortcuts
like I kind of have like you know work
stuff on one side and Derek fun geek out
stuff on the other side you know like
and I like it clean and simple and my
galaxy and that's my galaxy nexus my
phone on my Nexus 7 for a while I
actually ran stock UI with you know the
play recommendations everywhere just
just you know because I gave it to me
why not and I got tired of it I had to
go clean and and that's how it is now
it's the same thing as my phone I have
three screens have a widgets one way
couple folders the other way you know to
find them work and play you know one
side the other net I like it clean and
I'm like it I don't like it cluttered
and dirty Scott how about you all right
there I also have three my phone of my
tablet source and I pretty much the same
where I've got to calendar and google
voice widgets on the main page and then
full-page your email or Google+ on the
to your sides but you got I'm the same
way i use amount use a pretty stock
compiled version of jelly bean but i
only use three of the screens on the
actual stock launcher i mean i just i
have all my main applications and
folders on the main screen and then i
have the bookmarks widget and i've got a
gmail widget on the other and that's
pretty much it yeah i don't use a ton of
applications though yeah i use three
screens as well my last three is maylee
settings and root apps then middle is
just mainly used apps things I access
more than 5 m's of 8 and then on the
right I got my five wickets but I
started out with android though I used
seven plus i used a lot and I mean were
you guys the same way that night I used
to use all seven home screens on SBS
it's kind of weird let you host all the
screens because you know it's new and
it's available to you but then you
realize wait I can be way more efficient
with my space here I mean I realized
after a certain point I was just looking
to find stuff to put on the home screens
just to fill them up it was the same way
bet was sense but the only thing was
since
back then was uh well it was an
incredible 2 so 2 so it only had so much
ram but you know you put seven widgets
worth a home screens on there and
they're gonna get kicked out of memory
yeah I mean you're just like waiting on
the widget of refresh every time you
scroll to it so it's kind of useless
yeah the famous three drop all right so
let's uh let's get you a t-shirt
giveaway here and then we're going to
talk about two more things and we'll
wrap up a Derek Moore requested us to
talk about the intel based razor and
it's going to be released in the UK here
so we'll hit that here in a minute and
then though it's a patent war stuff but
let's do a t-shirt um if you were here
for the technical difficulties addition
is what we call last night chill Oh Ian
so we're going to give away two t-shirts
and they're both going to be the Andy
Android nah man biting down chewing
eating an apple and said nom on and Jody
Barnes answered the correct question he
won the Andy t-shirt it's already been
sent to him he's going to be getting it
but unfortunately the supplier has sold
out of those t-shirts since then but so

we're watching so when you answer this
question foot make sure you're putting
your answer in the comments on the main
post if you're on YouTube on your buddy

dan whoever we're not watching now we're
only watching the main one so make sure
you're commenting on the Maine coast
where I just put that URL for the
t-shirts okay so yesterday I had said
this was going this question was going

android statues so these statues that
are in front of google building 44 at
the Googleplex in Mountain View
California there's a bunch of Android
statues there for the various versions
of Android and a few other things in
android so the question is an Android
dog model was once accompanied by the
original android robot model until it
was stolen in 2009 so the original
android bugdroid robot used to have a

sorry to tustin just a moment too slow
yeah man I really wish to type stirrups
for seconds gotta see how close family
where oh ok so let's let's talk about
the rumored and now somewhat confirmed
droid em are sorry razr m no it's just
droid out yeah yes raisins razor are
staying proprietary to verizon it will
be the droid hem we have that backwards
thing ya know the bruins rise of the
rumors like frame all right so everybody
mark mark this down this is first time
Dan Charlton's ever been incorrect
before and he's at your about anything
Google to find it out verizon just as
George Lucas in their back pocket it's
drop yet the razr m is dropping the
droid branding when it goes to the UK
just going to be the razr m and is rude
and now confirmed to have an Intel
processor and this phone was somewhat
announced demo talked about last year
while the back at CES so actually around
the beginning of the year at CES
motorola announced a partnership with
Intel that they're going to be producing
Intel phones and a phone we'll see
and so forth so this is the result of
that partnership so what do you think
about it you know I mean we've had a few
very few I can think of two off top my
head phones that have been dropped with
intel processors running Android in
China and in India if they're late to
the game but they're very familiar with
you know with processors with CPUs yeah
they've been doing it for 40 years think
it's the wrong time to get an
intel-powered smartphone because they're
coming out with silver mine as a
architecture like next year did he drop
out I think that I was physically well
if that's the obligatory drop out of
Derek every single hang out I don't I
don't drop your regular hangouts and
hangouts on air it's really nice to meet
you I have a bug report for you um so
another one yeah so my corner reporting
issue intel chips yeah okay it's not
under the exact same as the razr m it'll
be the same shell but the insides will
be different yeah so that we really
don't know much did you wish should you
get this phone being near the first
major phone to the sport an Intel
processor or should you wait to the
second gen of Intel processors the color
remember when the Thunderbolt was
released that was a great fun jump on
right no I mean I've been on were sex
for the record this is not the first
intel mobile chip no they did do in
Google TV and they have deal with
logitech for a while not only that one
they tried putting other one out that I
mean it was designed to be a mobile ship
just all the mobile handset makers kind
of laughed it out of existence because
it was that bad it was it was pretty bad
there I mean they're they're not half
the performance production for quadruple
the power consumption it was I mean
they're they're working off a five year
old architecture right now they don't
have the compiler completely optimized
if you know x86 is I mean they're
they're working hard they're
contributing a lot but now is not the
time to get one yeah I mean they're
they're moving very quickly and I think
Intel in the the sort of in the arm
space will be interesting but I don't
think they're there yet silvermont maybe
it's gonna be on a smaller lithography
and it'll be the first actual atom that
has out of water processing so it's I
mean there there's a lot to like about
what they have coming up but this one
this one can't even run with current
crates processor to process a 19
county-based man integration so yeah I
mean when they put it out they were
trying to show it off as competing
against the previous generation of chips
the problem with that was it was coming
out at the same time actually behind the
new generation of arm chips so it's it's
just not nearly as good as the s4 or as
the quad-core exynos or is the Tegra 3 I
would like to think that they're going
to be completely successful with it I
mean they just for the fact that they
know their architecture and they've been
doing it for 40 years but they haven't
been doing in the mobile space though
for 40 years they've been doing in the
mobile space for any years no no but the
thing they're not a new company is my
art oh they're not but they are a
company getting into a new market so
that's why i would say Ken wanna hear
the bed field medfield processors my
stuff not be the one
gen 1 this is generation 2 well what was
what was gin again one min the cedar
trail I think the cedar trail I can't
keep track of their reference names but
whatever one didn't actually make itself
into any handsets because it was so bad
that nobody would actually buy it the
men move it medfield Medfield's gen 2
i'm wrong yeah this one's just so bad
that not a lot of people will buy it
mommy Motorola is being the one to adopt
it to assign to a multi-year agreement
it gets kind of telling because motorola
prior to google snatching up is pretty
desperate and intel inside is a
marketing / that I mean it counts I mean
that's a good marketing to the person
that doesn't know any better yeah
because nobody if you tell somebody what
an ARM processor is they wouldn't know
what you're talking about you tell Intel
it's already slapped on top of their
laptop is a sticker so they know what
you yeah so let's let's move on to our
final topic of the night here long story
short dan John say these things are
gonna be jumping find out we'll find out
in here this thing it's not as included
at the american version with s4 it would
have been awesome last year yes yes a
year ago that coming out would have been
a very good funnel we don't we don't
also know what it's coming out the
midfield processor here we don't know
what architecture they're going to use
uh will intel's only made just the one
so yeah we pretty much dunno hasn't been
confirmed so do be in what do you think
of the latest round of patent wars news
this past week with HTC you know countin
some other patents surrounding ltd if
what Apple comes out their iphone 5 here
and then in a yawn yawn yawn things his
way to go after HTTPS like what three
patents on LTE they're actually making
any of it I don't even know how they
managed to get patents on it Boeing
that's right because you don't actually
have to make things in order to patent
them you just
to think of something no they bought
them they bought them so even better
they purchased hands too just for the
simple fact to go after to use them
against Apple you know that i did buy
them before they release the vulnerable
yeah exactly that's why they bought them
they were releasing the Thunderbolt yeah
I mean apples gonna have problems moving
into the LTE space but all of the
problems that they're gonna have our of
their own making if they hadn't run
around the world pissing off every
single person that they rely on to do
everything that they do they wouldn't
have all of those people going wait a
second we actually build everything that
makes your phones cell phones and give
it to you and now you're coming back
suing us saying we're ripping you off
please so you don't think do you think
that that if Apple in HTC go to court
over this do you think it's gonna hold
up I don't think it'll matter you know
bagel no I really don't think I'll
matter yeah whatever Ltd technologies
out there I'm from somebody presumably
it's gonna be Qualcomm because that's
who everybody's buying their LTS
hardware firm right now and its patented
by a Qualcomm and by buying it from
Qualcomm Apple gets the protection of
Qualcomm patents that's true and you buy
more concrete very much easy buddy a
wife Alex yeah hold on what after subway
Hong Kong could shut down the entire
cell phone market if they went out I
mean there's a reason why they hold
something like sixty eight percent of
the mobile radio market and that's all
radios when it comes down to LTE it's
much more like ninety-eight percent and
you better believe they have the IP to
back up those products so when they sell
it to apple it's not like Samsung can go
and sue them for using a Qualcomm chip
that somehow invalidate or somehow
infringes on a samsung patent because
it's a Qualcomm miss you it's not an
apple issue yeah and you better believe
that Qualcomm can back up their products
against Samsung's relatively meager ten
percent of the LTE patents
or against HTC's handful of purchased
ones so let's talk about a little bit
about android authority on air we've now
been doing this for a little over six
months so if you guys just found out
about it recently hey how you doing uh
is if not you'll know that we've been
growing over the past six months we're
very happy to be where we're at have all
