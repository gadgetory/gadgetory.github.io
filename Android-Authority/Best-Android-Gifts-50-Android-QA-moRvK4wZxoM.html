and we're all looking for that perfect
gift unfortunately for many of us that
perfect gift is a brand new
six-hundred-dollar phone so I'm here to
help you with more stocking stuffer
friendly like sub $50 android happiness
here we go alright so i'm going to cover
the number one option in various
categories and first off we're going to
start with streamers and right at the
top of the list has got to be the google
chromecast hdmi streaming media player
it lets you stream your online video and
music to your TV from your smartphone
tablet or laptop with support for both
Android and iOS devices and chrome for
mac and windows setup is very easy and
all you need to do is plug the device
into your hdmi port of the TV connected
to your Wi-Fi network and follow some
very basic setup instructions there's
also a number of great services that are
offered through chromecast Netflix Hulu
Plus and many more with tons of new apps
coming all the time now maybe you want
to help someone take their mobile gaming
to a whole other level consider the Moga
hero power the Mogo series of Bluetooth
controllers are must have accessories
for any serious Android gamers out there
with the Mogo hero power being the
slimmer more portable and slightly
cheaper option while compact the hero
has all the controls you'll need
including two clickable analog sticks a
d-pad for action buttons two triggers
and two shoulder buttons so even with
the smaller form factor you get all the
functionality of a full-size controller
the holding arm extends up to 3.7 inches
enough to accommodate even larger
devices like the Galaxy Note series the
Mogu hero also comes with an added
feature called power boost that allows
you to charge your device while docked
as long as the battery of the controller
is above twenty-five percent now as
media consumption explodes on our mobile
devices you don't want to forget the
very practical option of better memory
cards while there are many Android
devices that no longer support micro SD
slots what if you still do and whether
it's for a phone tablet or digital
camera there are plenty of reason to own
a sparrow micro SD card even better they
make great gifts and excellent stocking
stuffers now there was a time not to
getting a high quality memory card was
really expensive but there's some
options there we can get class 10 that's
running at a really high speed great for
pretty much anything even
high-definition video for less than 20
bucks fantastic stuff you also want to
think about getting headphones for those
really loud people who like to play
their music loud because being loud can
be really annoying I hate that now when
it comes to headphones for your Android
devices you want to consider the tone +
bluetooth headset by LG it's one of the
best products in this price range and
features audio and bass response
technology to reproduce CD light quality
over a Bluetooth connection now while
it's not an audio files dream it is
vastly improved over its predecessor
with additional noise reduction and echo
cancellation technology the headset also
features LG's BTW reader app which is
available in the Google Play Store to
read your incoming messages and also
includes an audible battery status alert
and vibrating call alert now speaking of
batteries we know there's lots of
battery geeks out there who are
constantly asking questions about
battery issues on their devices well we
got you covered too unfortunately these
days removable batteries are becoming
less and less common so we do have an
option for you lemon blast is one of the
best considering that it provides a
whopping 15,600 milliamp hour capacity
the lemon battery pack can be used to
charge two devices simultaneously and
holds more than enough juice to charge
the battery of your smartphone multiple
times also includes a built-in safety
flashlight and four LED indicators to
show the level of charge now for all you
commuters out there who are braving the
winter roads we do have some bluetooth
car kit options for you and our top
choice is the kinivo bluetooth
hands-free car kit it's a simple
solution for hands-free answering and
receiving calls while in the car along
with the ability to stream music from
your smartphone at CD quality the car
kit features an understated design that
can be mounted just about anywhere and
includes easy to use music controls and
a built-in microphone to answer calls
keep in mind that it does require a 3.5
millimeter auxiliary input in your
our stereo now for those of you who'd
love to listen to music and audio books
on your mobile phone but you don't want
to sacrifice on sound quality you could
consider a Bluetooth speaker and our top
choices the rover beats t3 Bluetooth
wireless speaker and it promises great
quality sound with csr bluetooth chipset
that offers class-leading performance
for a crystal clear audio reception and
an enhanced bass resonator the device is
compatible with any smartphone or tablet
with Bluetooth capability or a 3.5
millimeter audio jack not only does this
device support music playback it also
has a built-in mic for hands-free
calling from any phone with bluetooth
capability and it also works with skype
the speaker is compact and very portable
and also features an anti-skid mat at
the bottom to add stability now I know
what you're thinking you're thinking
Jace I forgot wireless charging but I
didn't this isn't for everybody but if
you know someone who uses a smartphone
or tablet with Qi standard wireless
charging support you can help make their
lives much easier by gifting them a
wireless charger the power bot chien
abled wireless charger is a compact and
easy to use charger and is compatible
with all chi enabled smartphones the
device can be placed on the pad at any
angle with a beep indicating that the
device is charging an anti-slip grip
holds the device in place and leds
display charging status available for
less than half the price of the nexus
wireless charger the power bought
wireless charger is definitely a choice
to consider know if you're not sure what
to get and you don't mind losing the
element of surprise you could always
consider it google play gift card that
will make any Android lover very happy
but last up I wanted to talk about
something that I've found really really
curious it's sort of an honorable
mention check this thing out it's the
easy macro lens band the easy macro lens
band is simple flexible magnification
accessory for smartphones and tablets
that lets you take close-up photos with
incredible detail the band is
stretchable ensuring that the lens will
fit any smartphone currently available
on the market when not in use the band
is compact and portable and can even fit
in your wallet with the original card
using the band will give you four times
optical magnification
for great close-ups now you guys should
know that this is just a small snippet
of the actual article at Android 30.com
it's linked up boom right there you can
go and there's a whole bunch of
different alternative options to the
number one options that I provided
there's like thirty two different gift
ideas or something like that everything
from you know there's still a few bucks
up to fifty bucks great stocking
stuffers great stuff you can get last
minute not too last minute Merry
Christmas guys happy shopping</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
