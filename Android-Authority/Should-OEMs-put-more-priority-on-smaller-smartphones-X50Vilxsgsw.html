thought the whole phablet craze was just
a phase but now it is more common than
not the wire phones getting bigger and
bigger exactly if you think back to
Zoolander days phones weren't big at all
but that's when our primary consumption
behavior was phone calling now it's
video and when it comes to video bigger
is better
the center has to be at least three
times bigger than this if you remember
way back at the time of the release both
the original Galaxy Note and the Dell
Streak were inconceivably large Samsung
in particular made the case for what
would quickly be labeled a phablet by
offering a smartphone that had a Wacom
powered stylus over time devices
gradually grew larger to the point where
we are today where the de-facto size for
an Android phone is 5 inches plus of
course not all smartphone manufacturers
have gone along the same route like it
or not Apple's success in the smartphone
market stands as a testament to this
especially amid reports that the 4.7
inch iPhone 6 outsold the 5.5 inch
iPhone 6 plus seven to one even so there
are countless Apple fans still
disappointed by Cupertino decision to go
big longing for the minuscule four
inches of pixel power put in previous
products meanwhile in Android territory
OMS have by and large chosen to regulate
the small screen form factor to a back
burner experience at Best Buy using
names like Mini in particular they not
only seek to describe the device itself
but also offer a telltale all on the
specs that will be featured inside the
device this is exactly why Sony's use of
the name compact is so profound as it
doesn't imply anything other than
superior portability case in point I had
this phone for a long time
fantastic battery life in fact the best
out of any Android flagship at least up
until the time that I had it and it has
micro SD card support no removable
battery but generally the phone is sick
by far the best Android phone I've ever
had now is it the small form factor
isn't underappreciated enough these days
even the name Minnie is becoming
somewhat convoluted ZTE announced its
plans to launch the axon phone mini but
it's almost tongue-in-cheek with a 5.2
inch screen the device isn't actually
small at all yet for the sole fact that
the standard model is a phablet and the
axon max is rumored to be a whopping 6
inches so I will confess I failed to
this prediction for those be watching
for a long time you'll know that 18
months ago I predicted that smartphones
flagship smartphones would kind of
revert back to four point seven four
point eight inches max because that was
the largest sized screen you could have
and still ensure one-handed usability
but I was wrong completely wrong the
importance of a larger screen for media
consumption was much more important
because smartphones are becoming
people's primary device in some cases
their sole device that's certainly true
with my three teenagers at home here
they consume media and use their
smartphone for everything homework
movies video games you name it so having
a slightly bigger phone is much more
important than just one-handed usability
I get it I was completely wrong however
will it change will there be enough
demand for one-handed devices that
smartphone manufacturers will provide
more options I doubt it you see this
brings up a new prediction and that is
that I think there will be new category
devices that change people's behavior
before people revert back to a smaller
screen so virtual reality devices for
example or different wearable devices
that allow us to consume media in easier
more accessible ways is more likely than
people reverting back to a smaller
screen what do you guys think let me
know in the comments below thanks for
watching Edward army yes I know I do
have a bit of a cold today and I got the
raspy breath thing going on I apologize
but I love to connect with you here on
Google+ or Twitter you don't want to
forget about my brothers and sister and
Android we're working super hard to be
