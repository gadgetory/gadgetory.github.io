young bird coming at you from your
number one source for all things android
android authority calm today we're going
to be reviewing the brand new amazing
alex app from Rovio no this is a game
and it's going to be fun for all ages
it's got some nice cartoon graphics for
kids and then not for adults it might
get you thinking it's a physics puzzle
game and it's brand new on the market
today so anyways let's check it out
we've got our screen right here our
startup screen so it's actually get into
some gameplay here as you can see we
have a few worlds we've got a classroom
our backyard Alex's bedroom the
treehouse you can download levels and
then we can create our own so let's go
back to the very first world the only
one we have unlocked which is the
classroom go ahead and go to the first
one plata so the objective is to get the
soccer ball into that basket our options
are to restart it looks like we have our
ads for all of our other Rovio games
here other options are to go back
okay so so that's our first level we
didn't have to do anything you have to
collect the stars for best result so
here's will go to our next level it's
like we can move our table here and we
will set our table there then we can
play the Powerball once again we got the
best results as we collected all the
stars see mind the gap here's our item
tray and bring this up set that there
and actually twist this a little so it
goes down perfectly so there we go oh it
looks like I didn't get it to move the
table position correctly so today's we
can move this now we have to move it
down like that looks like it could work
there
so there we go we've got the best result
once again because we got the stars it's
a real go sir now we get to place two
items two of the tables so place that
there it's like that's pretty even and
will place another here wait to add a
little tilt to it and let's see if we
got it so we did well on that level and
so we got it there so you can see we're
needing to implement a few more items
now we'll go next flying with scissors
let's see so we're going to need the
scissors to bounce down here pop the
balloon
or something it looks like these are
actually going to have to guide the
balloon
you need to pop it on the scissors OOP
whoops well I didn't get the other star
so I didn't get the best result but we
did pass this one pop don't fly so many
ways you guys get the basic idea of this
game it's a physics puzzle game you just
got to arrange the items you're given in
a set order in order to get these stars
then once you get the stars all three is
a best result then you can move on to
other worlds and it's a pretty fun game
you know it'll challenge your brain as
you get into the farther levels and then
it'll keep your kids entertained if
you've got me so I'll check it out you
guys it's rovio's brand new game the
amazing Alex it's on the Play Store go
ahead and get it today it just came out
July twelfth and keep tuned with android
authority calm guys because you've got
plenty more reviews where this came from</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
