you're probably just as surprised to see
my face here on android authority as I
am as is customary here at Android
Authority i'm going to give you a little
behind-the-scenes look at who i am how I
got started and what I like outside of
technology I'm also going to answer some
common questions that I get asked all
over the internet all the time so
without any further delay let's get to
it first I want to say thank you thank
you so much because the first video I
uploaded on the channel got almost 400
comments as of like 10 minutes ago and
they were all or mostly all very very
kind there are some trolls out there I
know who you are but it was a very warm
welcome and it felt great to be joining
such an awesome team so I want to say
I'm happy to be here and thank you for
anyone and everyone who said the nice
words in the comments section because
that's my favorite place and I
girlfriend's favorite place control so I
guess I'll begin with where I actually
got my start here in the industry about
six years ago I got a job working at
best buy mobile I was selling phones and
I ran into a man who came in often his
name is Aaron Baker and some of you may
know him he was working at phoneDog at
the time and he was starting a new
website for blackberry fans and he asked
me for my help because of my expertise
and blackberries seriously I was
obsessed with blackberries like really
really bad swore off Apple and Android
Android wasn't really a thing then but
swore off pretty much everything but
blackberries and swore I would never
carry anything but a blackberry yeah
pretty short-sighted I guess but anyway
Aaron offered me a free volunteer job as
the forum's moderator think through the
span of like three months I might have
posted like three things and moderated a
bunch of spam and that's pretty much it
but fast forward a little bit he offered
me a news position with the website and
fast forward like six months later I was
the managing editor of the website fast
forward just a little bit more because
this is kind of boring stuff I decided
to leave bberry dog and they were gonna
shut up the site so they offered me a
position at phoneDog as I guess just a
news writer and that kind of led me into
writing editorials because I preferred
giving my opinion because I talk a lot
and I like to share my opinion even if
not everyone wants to read it all the
time to date i've probably written over
3600 editorials which is a crazy number
that is almost i think i calculated a
while back
maybe a million words or so that's a lot
of writing it's it's not darren murph
like Guinness World Records writing but
it's a lot of writing and i also got
into videos i started doing some videos
for phoneDog and they were horrible I'm
so embarrassed of them do not go look at
him I know that's what you're going to
do now but don't go look at them but
then at CES 2013 I ran into some guys
you might know them Michael Fisher
Brandon minimun Jaime Rivera I became
pretty close friends with these guys and
I actually joined pocket now in February
of 2013 and I sort of being I guess one
of the main YouTube guys they're doing
cell phone reviews and tablet reviews
and all kinds of other different videos
I was also doing a lot of written work
there as well but fast forward to
November 2014 I decided that I was tired
and I needed a break but I'm not going
to get into all of that here if you want
to listen to the whole story you can go
listen to my podcast it's untethered
it'll be episode 49 it's not live yet
I'm actually about to record that with
Josh here in a little bit but it will be
live later this week i believe on
thursday but it was actually CES 2014
where i met Darcy and josh and we didn't
really talk that much we met at Pep calm
and kind of met and did a little meet
and greet and went on about our business
it was really busy but at Eva 2014 in
Berlin Josh and I got to hang out a lot
and we got really close after that he's
been a regular on my podcast we talk
about pretty much anything and
everything it's kind of an anything-goes
podcast we come each week without a
topic to talk about and ramble on for
about an hour to an hour and a half
sometimes two hours and it's really
interesting because sometimes the
conversation is just amazing and then
other times we really don't know how we
got to where we are or what we're
talking about and it's led down some
very dark paths some very interesting
things and secrets have been dropped on
the podcast so it's a it's a lot of fun
and I look forward to it every single
week but after I left pocket now I
picked up where I left off with my own
channel it's called mod and I do a bunch
of DIY videos and cover technology and
pretty much anything that I find
interesting I also posed some vlogs with
my girlfriend I do some videos for two
doest and I write for them and I do a
lot of work on the side I'm a pretty
busy guy but now here I am in February
2015 and I'm with android authority
making videos about phones again because
I always knew that I was going to miss
mobile technology that
never a secret i knew i was going to
miss it and i wanted to be back
eventually but I didn't know how soon
that would be so what am I going to do
here at Android Authority the video i
posted on sunday the nexus 9 tips and
tricks is a very great representation of
what i'm going to be doing here are some
tips and tricks how to's and other odds
and ends like that but i'm also going to
be filling the gap and covering the
review devices that the other guys can't
get to just kind of be here when they
need me to do different things so now to
some questions Kevin here at Android
Authority gave me a little crap over not
answering his question which he then
later said i did answer his question
about what audio setup i use for these
videos currently just out of frame is a
samsung meteor mic on mic stand it's
nothing fancy it's a little USB mic and
it works really really well as you can
see but last week i actually had a much
nicer mike i was using a blue spark with
a focus right scarlett 2i2 interface and
for some reason decided to stop working
the very minute I decided to start
making videos for android authority so
there's that I'm now using my old Mike
to do these videos devices i carry i
know this is going to come up so i'm
going to go ahead and get it out of the
way right now i am carrying my primary
device is the Moto X 2014 pure edition
this is on tmobile it is I love it I
just want to say that the only two
things to say about it are the battery
life is f and the camera sucks also i'm
using an iphone 6 plus on verizon at 64
gigabytes space grey and i have this
really cool fit bag for it I yeah that's
what it's called fit bag it's just a
little pouch I like it a lot people make
fun of me for my fit bag but i like it
also ipad mini yeah I'm a little bit of
an apple guy not really a fan boy I use
Apple devices I use Android devices so
what and of course the Nexus 9 you saw
that in the video the other day oh and
before I forget I use a moto 360 it's
just my wrist and most the time I forget
about it because i don't know maybe I
forget and leave it in theater mode I
don't know it's on my wrist and never
buzzes but that's pretty much the gist
of my mobile devices i also have a
macbook pro retina 2013 mid-2013 early
2013 I don't know and some other
knickknacks you can see my everyday
carry videos on the mod channel also
what is probably my most prized
possession is my car i drive a scion
fr-s it is hot lava
not orange and I have done a tablet
install on the dash and took it out and
I want to finish that but other than
that I haven't done any mods but i do
want to swap out the exhaust and do a
force injection though I haven't decided
between a supercharger or turbocharger I
will probably go supercharger once the
warranty runs out of course other random
interests I have recently picked up
skateboarding in high school I was the
crazy guy who was jumping stairs heads
and grinding rails and doing crazy stuff
and then I hit my head I almost died I
went blind for 24 hours and decided to
call it quits and recently because my
girlfriend loves me so much she bought
me another skateboard maybe she's trying
to tell me something I also ride a
motorcycle it barely qualifies as a
motorcycle is 250 CCS it's a ninja and
it looks like a straight out of the 80s
and I Plasti Dip tit and that's pretty
much all there is to know and from time
to time mostly every night after my
girlfriend goes to bed I play video
games most recently I've been playing
NHL 2015 I have both Black Flag and
unity for Assassin's Creed and then
modern warfare which I play online not
really as often as I would like I want
to do twitch streaming but the internet
here so bad and I'm so busy that I just
don't have time and it's not worth the
struggle because time warner man
seriously time warner and then finally
coffee yes coffee I love coffee it's
probably a very very bad addiction and
maybe borderline obsession but I love it
and it tastes great and I like to make
different types and try all the
different flavors and different roasts
and everything I use an aeropress i use
the inverted method for three to three
and a half minutes and that's pretty
much it may be a coarse grind oh and
then of course DIY I like to make things
lots of things I make things every
monday so i guess that's pretty much it
that's about all there is to know about
me I live a pretty boring life here in
my sister's basement it's really dark
and drab and we have to use a lot of
lights to make you see me on the camera
but I look forward to making videos for
you guys to watch and I look forward to
your comments and getting to know some
of you in the comments section I'm
pretty active on google+ well not really
that's a lie that's a total lie I always
tell myself I'm gonna be more active on
google+ and I never am but I will try I
will make an effort to be more active on
google+ for you but you can definitely
find me on twitter at casper tech I'm
always there it's like my second home
I'm tweeting all the time sharing links
and you
clickbait stuff that you don't want to
click but I do it just to troll you I
also use Facebook but for some reason
buffer and all the other services I used
to share to Facebook decided not to let
me post publicly so you probably will
never see anything if you follow me
there but do it anyway and i'm also on
instagram also a Casper tech you can
