weekly show is brought to you by beta
fish-- 3d Logan ladies and gentlemen I'm
Joe Hindy the android 30 appt guy and
welcome back to android apps weekly this
is episode number 130 so let's get
started google has released new AP is
for day and night modes that will allow
applications to go dark when the
environment is dim this means you can
expect far more applications to have a
night mode in the future because it
should be easier to implement for
android apps compatible with version 4.0
and higher it was announced this week
that ubisoft is bringing Assassin's
Creed identity to Android for those who
don't know what's a sins creed identity
is an action RPG where you create your
own assassin and then go gallivanting
around it should be released later this
coming spring and should cost around
five dollars in an effort to do battle
with Twitter's increasingly popular
periscope facebook is doing its own live
video streaming it's out for iOS right
now but word is that it should be
heading to Android in a couple of weeks
at the earliest it'll be integrated
directly into Facebook's regular
application something Facebook did get
right now however is a new system that
has replaced the antiquated like system
you can now like love Wow and more on
any given Facebook updates new icons
will appear when you use them and it
gives users slightly more options to
engage with posts it's rolling out right
now to just about everyone this week it
was announced that Microsoft will be
putting a halt to project astoria for
those who don't remember project astoria
was an initiative to port android
applications to windows 10 unfortunately
that won't be happening but Microsoft is
continuing the project that ports iOS
apps so there's still something going on
for even more Android apps and games
news don't forget to check out this
week's newsletter which is linked in the
video description below there we have a
lot of information including big app
updates that we didn't have time for
here if you would like you can sign up
for the newsletter using the form in the
written companion which is also linked
in the video description below and get
all of this information sent straight to
your inbox every Sunday alright folks
let's take a look at the apps and games
that made a big splash this week as
usual if you want to check any of these
apps or games out you can find those
links in the video description below
don't of God's is a free-to-play stri
that could be described as very similar
to clash of clans you'll be tasked with
building a village upgrading its
defenses and then defending it against
other players the feature that sets it
apart is the ability to summon any one
of a hundred and fifty Norris Greek and
Egyptian gods to aid you while you
destroy stuff there are also six battle
modes a campaign mode and a lot more
it's not bad but it is an early release
so watch out for the bugs the peach is a
messaging service that connects you with
your friends it includes a lot of the
same features as other chat services
such as gifs supports emoji and various
sharing features what makes this one
unique is the variety of words that you
can type that the application calls
magic words these words give you
additional stuff that you can share to
express yourself it's actually pretty
fun but of course you'll have to
convince your friends to join you on the
service it seems as though Futurama has
joined the slew of television shows and
celebrity personalities with their own
mobile game futurama Game of Thrones is
a match for puzzle game that's themed
around the once popular television
series it has plenty of the show's
trademark work and fans of the show
should feel right at home it is a puzzle
game similar to other match games so
there isn't a lot of originality but it
is kind of goofy and fun if you're
interested hub keyboard is the latest
application out of Microsoft's garage
project and this one is pretty nifty
it's a keyboard that allows you to
quickly link things from other
applications without actually leaving
the application that you're in for
instance you can access documents a
translation tool contact information and
even multiple clips from your clipboard
it's a preview so there are still plenty
of bugs but this keyboard has a lot of
potential and is worth keeping an eye on
the walking dead michonne is the latest
point-and-click adventure game from
Telltale Games this one focuses around
the Michonne character and explores what
she was doing during her disappearance
in the comics for a little bit it looks
in plays like prior telltale games so
fans of the previous Walking Dead games
will know what they're getting
themselves into it's four dollars and
ninety-nine cents to start and each
episode will run you a few more bucks it
is suffering from some early bugs though
so do keep that in mind this week's
Android apps weekly show is brought to
you by beta fish-- 3d this is a
gorgeously done live wallpaper
application that's based on the emotion
wallpaper originally available on the
iPhone 6s unlike the 6s version this one
features a full range of
motion as though the fish is swimming in
the aquarium with the full version you
can customize the fish and even the
background during our testing the
wallpaper didn't use much battery life
which is good news the animations are
smooth and everything just looks really
pretty there's a free version that you
can try and the full version is just 99
cents give it a shot and show your
support for the Android apps weekly show
