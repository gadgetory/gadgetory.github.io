authority and today we're taking a look
at the 1 plus 3t but this isn't just
your ordinary 1 plus 3t this is a 1 plus
3t nd new midnight black color and I
have to admit this thing looks awesome
it's super clean super sleek and very
stealthy looking and I think it's a
color that oneplus should have released
from the get-go but you know what they
say better late than never and it's here
now and that's all that really matters
and if you guys remember oneplus
actually released this as a Collette
Edition which was extremely hard to get
and you pretty much had to be in Paris
to get one this one's a little bit
easier to get your hands on even though
it still is a limited edition you can
actually order this directly through
oneplus website so if you guys want to
do that we'll leave a link to that down
in description below or up here in a
card but otherwise you know besides the
color and the red and black box versus
the white and red box it's the same 1 +
3 T as that you know and love it has the
same specs with the snap during a 21
1080p 5.5 inch AMOLED screen same camera
same build same everything just a new
coat of paint the midnight black version
does come with 6 gigabytes of RAM and it
also has a hundred and twenty eight
gigabytes of internal storage so plenty
of storage inside of his phone now did
we just make a video about the 1 + 3 T
just to talk about new color of course
