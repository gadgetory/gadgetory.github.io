everybody and I'm here to bring you some
first impressions on the sony xperia XZ
premium now we've known about this
device for a little while but now we
know that in the u.s. pre-orders are
going to start on June 12 with the
shipments going out on June 19 the thing
is I'm not in the US right now I mean
Taipei 4 combi tix 2017 but I was lucky
enough while here to play with the
Xperia XD premium for a little bit now
our full review unit is coming to
Android authority very very soon
so our review is going to come after
that taking into consideration all the
specs and the features initial thoughts
on the design the phone feels just a bit
too big a 5.5 inch display is not too
large
however there's so much going on above
and below it that it feels like Sony
just doesn't know how to compact their
phones as well anymore that said this
phone is incredibly symmetrical with
this blue hue that is incredibly glossy
and as such pretty fingerprint prone
handling takes a bit of a hit because of
how large the overall device is but all
in all it's a great looking phone and
part of the reason why it's a great
looking phone is because of that 5.5
inch display it has 4k resolution and
HDR capabilities now I can't speak to
either of those extra features just yet
and I plan to in the full review
however 4k resolution just makes
everything look incredibly sharp already
one thing I noticed however was in the
display settings there are a lot of
options for changing the coloration of
the display you can have a super vivid
mode that really bumps up the saturation
or you can stick to an sRGB mode for
more accurate colors that said that 19
megapixel camera is probably one of the
marquee features of this phone not only
is it capable of 960 frames per second
slow motion video which were really
excited to test out pictures and video
should be pretty awesome on this phone
and I've been using it a lot for a
little bit of vlogging and also for a
lot of pictures around Taipei video in
particular I've been pretty happy with
because colors come out pretty good
detail is still pretty high and at the
SteadyShot set two intelligent active
mode does a good job of making sure that
my jitters aren't showing up on the
screen and if there's one thing I'm
always going to love about Sony Xperia
devices it's that
strict camera button if there's one
negative I can give at least for now on
the camera it's just that the interface
is a little bit cumbersome everything
seems to be a mode and you have to swipe
over to get to the video mode or you
have to open up the mode selection
screen just to get to 4k video it's a
few too many steps to get to something
that should probably be a button on the
original camera interface but for now
you can enjoy these clips and pictures
from Taipei and you can see what the
quality is like for yourself as we are
going to continue testing it for our
full review so that takes care of the
main features we'll just go ahead and
give you the rest of the specs including
the snapdragon 835 4 gigabytes of RAM 64
gigabytes of on-board storage with
expandability and Android nougat 7.1.1
now the software on the Xperia XD
premium actually feels really snappy and
that might be because the animations are
turned up in sony's version of android
that certainly makes everything feel
faster but I also did not notice any lag
when going through all of the different
applications and in particular when I
was using the camera interface pretty
incessantly throughout the day and
finally there's a 30 to 30 milli amp
hour battery in the Xperia XD premium
backed by a quick charge 3.0 and an
adaptive charging layer that is on top
of that so you can really juice up the
phone in no time at all so those are
just some initial thoughts and just a
quick spec rundown of the Xperia XE
premium overall I think that the design
just kind of shows that Sony is sticking
to its guns when it comes to how they
build their phones but when the
specifications are this high you might
really have a contender on your hands a
4k display could mean one of the best
display experiences especially with
everything that sony puts into their
triluminos display and then of course
the 19 megapixel camera that is really
easy to use with that extra button but
also with its super slo-mo and also its
intelligent auto modes that we've seen
in Sony phones before you might have a
great shutterbug companion on your hands
so we hope you enjoyed our initial
thoughts at least on the XV premium like
I said we're going to give you a full
review very soon so make sure you stay
tuned to Android 30 for that and even
more head over to our other properties
for more coverage of Computex 2017 as
well and remember to come on back to
Android Authority calm and our YouTube
channel subscribe to it if you haven't
