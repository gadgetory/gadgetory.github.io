Hindi the Android authority app guy here
and in this video we're going to take a
quick look at ghostery browser the
purpose of this browser is to make web
browsing more transparent and allow you
to see and block when websites try to
track you of course this is a web
browser and thus it does web browser
kinds of things such as surf the
internet search and all of that stuff
ghostery relies on the standard tab
system that is accessible with the
square icon at the top next to the
ghost' icon which we'll get to in a
moment
beside that there is the three dot icon
that gets you into the settings and the
navigation keys like back forward
refresh chair and bookmarks the tab
system is pretty standard you can open
various tabs and switch between them
pretty easily it's a very clean
interface so you shouldn't be getting
lost at all as per the norm you can
swipe away any tabs are no longer using
and a nifty little reminder will show up
at the bottom in case you want to undo
the closing of the tab and that lasts
even if you close the app and open it
back up in terms of performance goes
through browser is based on Android
webview and does about as well as all
other browsers that are based on Android
webview is scored relatively well in
Peacekeeper by future mark and should
score right around with Google Chrome
scores in most other benchmarks in real
world performance it works about as well
as you can reasonably expect the browser
to work we didn't see any dips in
performance that worried us but it's
also not going to win any speed records
the biggest features are the ones that
deal with privacy ghostery aims to make
web browsing more transparent the ghost
icon at the top keeps a count of how
many trackers each website you visit
attempts to employ if you click the icon
you'll see a list of all the trackers
present on that website from there you
can block them or allow them as you so
choose
you can also whitelist a website which
will allow it through the tracked
locking if it's a site you trust you can
also pause the tracker blocking if a
website is acting weird and it allows
you to see if the site works without the
blocking in place in the settings you
can change a number of different things
the default search is DuckDuckGo but you
can change it to Yahoo Google or Bing if
you so choose and there are others you
can also manage your ghostery settings
and decide whether or not to allow track
blocking or whether or not to enable
ghost rank which sends anonymous data
back to go street to help them improve
their product about the only issues we
- are some websites seem to hiccup a
little bit when tracker blocking is 100%
enabled every now and then you may have
to whitelist a website or turn the
tracker blocking off or pause it but
otherwise everything seems to work as
intended
there is no flash player support but
there hasn't been on an Android browser
in ages unless they do some weird hacker
II so I wouldn't take the lack of flash
support too seriously overall this is a
very solid and stable web browser the
clean interface makes it easy for casual
users and the app is generally well laid
out and has good performance the privacy
additions that ghostery have added are
icing on the cake and this is a
must-have browser if you're worried or
even curious about what websites are
tracking you and what they're tracking
you with and that about does it for this
video folks in the video description
below we'll have a link to the written
