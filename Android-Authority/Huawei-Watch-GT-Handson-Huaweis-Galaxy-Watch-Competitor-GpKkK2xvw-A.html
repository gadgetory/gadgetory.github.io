20 pro while we announced a brand new
SmartWatch called the watch GT it's not
a wear OS SmartWatch though instead it's
actually running huawei's own platform
called Lite OS we don't really know a
whole lot about it just yet
but it'll be interesting to see what
advantages it might have and how it
stacks up to other wearable platforms
like wear OS Huawei had a couple of
goals in mind when making this watch
they wanted it to look like a normal
watch and they wanted it to have long
lasting battery life so that people
didn't have to charge it all the time
the watch GT certainly does look like a
normal watch and it's got a pretty
classy and elegant design it's got a 1.3
9 inch circular AMOLED display and the
case is made of stainless steel with a
ceramic bezel and two crowns on the side
and it's a decently Bend SmartWatch at
ten point six millimeters while we
didn't mention the size of the battery
but they're promising 22 hours of
battery life with continuous exercise
tracking GPS heart rate monitoring and
the screen always on if you're just
using the heart rate monitoring and
exercise for ninety minutes per week it
can last up to two weeks which is pretty
insane but it doesn't stop there
if you're only using the watch for
messages and calls the watch GT is
supposed to last up to 30 days which
sounds pretty crazy for a SmartWatch but
we'll have to wait and see if it
actually lasts that long other specs
include an altimeter which is great for
hiking purposes and it can track a bunch
of other typical exercises like running
swimming walking and cycling there's
also a heart rate sensor on the back
with six LEDs and it uses what Huawei
calls true scene 3.0 heart rate
monitoring which is supposedly a more
efficient and accurate way of measuring
your heart rate and the watch will
actually learn where it sits on your
wrist in order to give you a more
accurate reading if you want to learn
