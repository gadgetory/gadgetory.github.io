and/or authority now you're probably
used to me wearing these glasses but
today I'm going to be telling you about
these glasses one of the most famous or
sure sa infamous augmented reality
products of recent times was of course
Google glass however Google aren't the
only company investing in AR Epson a
company who you may know better for its
printers and scanners also make AR
products including the BT 200 smart
glasses and today we're going to look at
these smart glasses and see what they
capable of the BT 200 are a full set of
smart glasses with tiny projectors for
both the left and the right eyes however
unlike a VR headset the rest of the
viewing area is transparent this means
you can walk around and perform tasks
aided by the glasses coming out of the
side is a cable which connects to a
control unit this box was about the size
of a smartphone provides all the
computing power as well as a touchpad
for controlling the glasses and
connectivity like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
halfway down the cable is a small clip
and a headphone socket the control unit
is like a small tablet but the display
has been removed and replaced with
projectors in the glasses inside the box
is a Texas Instruments OMAP 4460 so
dual-core cortex a9 based processor
running at 1.2 gigahertz there's also
one gigabytes of RAM and eight gigabytes
of internal storage if you need more
space and you can use a micro SD card to
add up to an extra 32 gigabytes the
guard is way around 88 grams which is
much heavier than normal pair of glasses
however the weight isn't prohibitive you
can wear them comfortably for about two
hours only then do they start to feel
like a burden the optics are first class
the little projectors display an image
which appears to be about 80 inches at
five meters distance the way the optics
have been designed gives the impression
that you are looking at a large screen
or monitor a few meters in front of you
because of this perceived distance and
the quality of the Epson projectors my
eye has never got tired from looking at
displays no headaches no neck aches
no nothing it was a pleasure the unit
runs Android 4.0 4 which means you can
run any API 15 Android app including
games
proactivity apps and multimedia apps
it's a fairly stock version of Android
that means it will be able to run
unmodified Android apps directly just as
you would on a smartphone or tablet the
trackpad on the surface of the control
unit is used to control a cursor much
like a mouse you move it around with
your finger on the pad and then tap for
a click the screen that is projected by
the glasses in landscape mode but the
trackpad is used in portrait mode this
is OK and doesn't really cause any
problems except that the width the
trackpad is narrow as you have to use
the left/right distance of the upright
pad area rather than using its longest
side the BT 200 uncomely --gel play
support so any normal apps you want to
download either need to be side loaded
or installed via a third-party app store
for my testing I installed amazon's app
store and i was able to find and install
many popular apps without any trouble
for app developers there is also the
Merv area SDK which provides a library
that allows Android apps to control the
bt 202 splay audio and sensors form
ovarian specific apps Epson has its own
ecosystem and an app store called
Moe Vario app market it would be nice if
the Android version was higher not
because there is any functionality
missing but because it might give some
access to some more interesting content
like Google cardboard or other VR
projects are being built on later
versions of the OS the old adage goes
that hardware is useless without
software and that also applies to the BT
200 smart glasses thankfully there's
quite a bit of interesting app
development going on for these glasses
having used the glasses for quite a
while now I can safely say that they
work very well just about any Android
app and game I download the dolphin web
browser and Angry Birds and both work
without any problems
the only minor exception was of the
intro for the Dolphin Browser is in
portrait mode however once you have
dealt with it it switches back to land
the only apps that don't work are those
that must be used in portrait mode for
example I downloaded Temple Run and as a
portrait game it just isn't possible to
play it browsing the web is an
interesting experience if you are
loading pages with lots of text and
smart classes really aren't the best
medium however if you are looking at
media rich pages like photo galleries
then smart glasses work very well
typing in URLs and search terms can be
tedious as you have to use the on-screen
keyboard which means you have to move
the cursor to the desired letter then
tap then move to the next letter tap
again and so on
since there are no Google services there
is no YouTube app however YouTube's work
as expected from within the Dolphin
Browser watching a movie or browsing
your photo collection can be quite fun
on the BT 200 s and the device support
apps like Netflix however you can do all
that on other VR headsets the real power
can be found in a our Epson kindly
preloaded my review unit with some
example AR apps which demonstrate what
is possible the glasses include a
built-in VGA camera you can take photos
and record video using the standard
Android open source camera app as well
as being able to take low resolution
photos and record video the camera is
also used by app to see what the wearer
is seeing with pattern recognition and
other fancy technologies apps are able
to add layers of new information on top
of what the user is actually seeing the
classic use case is with trackers
printed material usually a printed
pattern or code is recognized by the app
and used to display a 3d model or some
other image one of the more ambitious
demo AR art is probably visualizing the
future by seeing technology it is meant
to be used with the WellStar atrium
model 4000 single collection chess
drainage system it displays a our
instructions directly above the physical
device the idea is that it provides help
and training for users of these medical
devices and shows the necessary steps
for successful operation you can
download the front-facing target which
is stuck on the front of these devices
and experience the AR part without
actually owning one of the drainage
systems since I don't know much about
chest drainage systems I was a little
lost while I was using the app but it
certainly did show me where to connect
the hoses all in glorious ar1 fun game I
have for the BT 200 is a I'm an it's
basically a pacman game in 3d when you
play the role of the pac-man you are in
a maze which you navigate by actually
walking about and using your head to see
what's around you there are even ghosts
this is clever because the game uses the
sensors in the glasses to detect forward
movement as a result you don't need to
control your position in the game via
the touchpad you just walk forward
obviously you need to be in open area to
play this but because you can see
through the glasses you aren't walking
around blind like you would be with
other VR headsets the same author also
wrote Maelstrom every hour walking app
that allows you to look around the
virtual world while also enabling you to
move around in virtual space by actually
working around in real space if there is
an app which is close to being a killer
app for the mo burial glasses is the DJI
vision app for use with the DJI phantom
drones some of the DJI drones have a
camera on them which allows you to see a
live view from the drone DJI call this
first person view flying the app allows
full remote camera control and
incorporates things like live telemetry
readings since you can see through the
mo varial glasses then you can watch
your drone while flying it but at the
same time receive telemetry and a
first-person view from the drone in
terms of non consumer apps Epson is
seeing lots of interest from businesses
for example Lockheed is using the BT 200
smart glasses to instruct engineers on
how exactly to build and repair f-35
fighter jets according to an interesting
article by Popular Mechanics when a
glass is wearing engineer is installing
a break component on the landing gear
they look at the wheel and the glasses
show renderings of every bolt and cable
with the part numbers and ordered
instructions showing where the parts fit
another area which is interesting is the
whole area of remote support
see what I see imagine a situation where
someone needs some remote technical
support normal telephone support only
goes so far if you have used a service
like TeamViewer to help someone do
something on their PC you can now
imagine a system where you see what the
other person is seeing through their bTW
200 small glasses but more than that you
can interact with their display by
adding arrows circles and text so you
can guide them in their repair it's
quite an interesting concept and two of
the leading companies are scope AR and
apex labs the list of potential uses for
these glasses is in fact very long
another favorite of mine is the use of
augmented reality by pilots flying
planes a company called Aero glass has
an app for the BT 2 hundreds which help
pilots to properly visualize terrain
navigation traffic instruments weather
and airspace information overall I'm
very impressed with the potential of
these smart glasses this is very much a
product in the developer edition phase
it isn't ready for consumer mainstream
however if you will your company are
looking for a are solutions then the
move area might just be the platform
we're looking for as with so many areas
of innovation the key to success will be
finding a killer application at the
moment the BT 200 are interesting even
inspiring but not yet essential unless
you own a drone that is however as this
tech develops we will certainly see lots
of new ideas and interesting ways of
using AR Epsons original bt100 smart
glasses were released in early 2012 and
weighed 220 grams two and a bit years
later X and release the BT 200 smart
glasses now weighing just 88 grams if
Ector maintains the same release cycle
then we can expect to see the BT 300
smart glasses sometime in late 2016 or
maybe early 2017 if the company manages
to cut down the weight even further add
a 2 or 5 megapixel camera and use a
newer version of Android then what is
company a device for businesses
developers and drone enthusiasts could
become a must-have consumer product in
the mean time if you own a DJI drone
then go out and get yourself
of BTW $200 similarly if you want to
develop VR and AR apps and you should
seriously look at this platform and
there you have it the Epson move area BT
200 artists they're currently available
from Amazon for $699 please to check out
the Android or thority comm website and
find the written companion to this
article we also find some links to some
other technology I was talking about
today well my name is garrison from
Andrew authority I hope you enjoyed this
video if you did do please give it a
thumbs up also don't forget to subscribe
to and royalties YouTube channel and
please use the comments below to tell me
what you think about these smart glasses
and what you think about a AR and VR in
general and as for me I'm going to see
you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
