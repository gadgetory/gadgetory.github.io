you think a major Android device ranks
in the top ten of Google's search trends
for consumer tech you might be surprised
fourth that's right
fourth androids biggest most hyped
largely successful Android device the
galaxy s 8 ranked fourth in Google's
consumer tech search trends for 2017
sort of is a jolt of reality and reminds
us that we live in a little bit of a
counterculture that even something as
massive as the s8 isn't as mainstream as
we might have thought and what's ranked
1 and 2 yeah
first up is the iPhone 8 then the iPhone
X followed by Nintendo switch and then
Samsung Galaxy s8 followed by Xbox 1x
Nokia 3310 the razor phone Oppo f51 +5
and Nokia 6 nylon 2 some good news
surrounding a newer phone that could be
a promising entry-level smartphone
according to the antennae listing the
honor 9 light sports and 18 9 aspect
ratio a 5.6 5-inch 2160 by 1080
resolution that has two cameras on the
front and two cameras on the back
both Arrangements feature a 13 megapixel
primary sensor coupled with a 2
megapixel sensor with the secondary
sensor presumably aiding the primary
sensor to create portrait images
elsewhere even though the tenant listing
only mentions an octa-core chipset at
the heart of the honor 9 light odds are
the chipset is Huawei's in-house kuren
6:59 the processor is paired with either
3 gigabytes of RAM or 32 gigabytes of
on-board storage or 4 gigabytes of RAM
with 64 gigabytes of on-board storage
though a microSD card slot is present
finally keeping the lights on as a
twenty nine hundred million power
battery that is recharged through the
phone's microUSB port the honor nine
light could be priced around $200
putting it in honor 7x territory
we'll find out more on December 21st
when honor is slated to hold a press
event in China and finally the tech
sector has not escaped the wave of
sexual allegations specifically when it
comes to the father of Android itself
Andy Rubin after taking a leave of
absence less than two weeks ago
reportedly due to quote personal reasons
essential founder and Android co-creator
and Rubin has returned to the company if
you recall it was reported that rumen
had an inappropriate relationship with a
female colleague while he still worked
at Google the search giant reportedly
looked into the situation in 2014
since it has a policy that forbids
relationships between supervisors and
subordinates Google concluded that
Reubens conduct was quote improper and
showed bad judgment unquote an essential
spokesperson said that Rubin was quote
never told by Google that he engaged in
any misconduct while he worked at the
company now it was reported by recode
that Andy Rubin although officially took
a two-week leave of absence from
essential essentials shares the same
workspace as playground another project
run by Andy Rubin so he really didn't
take off anytime at all even if he did
take off two weeks I don't really know
what that does what do you guys think
about this let me know in the comments
below or on Twitter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
