December 5th but it's coming a lot
sooner this month previous rumors pegged
December 5th in London as the first time
we laid eyes on the phone but what we
took to Weibo to announce that we'd
actually get our first official look a
week earlier on November 28th in Beijing
China the posting indicates that the
phone will have a dual camera setup and
have enhanced AI capabilities these
features were rumored in early reports
but now hallway has confirmed it
according to gizmo China honor CEO Xiao
Ming recently went on record to state
that the v10 would be powered by the
same cure in 97 chipset found in the may
10 and may 10 pro as for software the
owner v10 would run the latest version
of emu i version 8 on top of android 8
oreo unlike some of the higher-end
contemporaries which feature tall
displays and differing aspect ratios the
honor v10 will reportedly stick with the
five point nine nine inch 18 nine
display with minimal bezels according to
leaked documents spotted by Giz China
the honor v10 sports Huawei's in-house
cure and 97 chipset the same found in
the may 10 and may 10 pro as such we can
assume that the honor v10 will include
some AI focus features on the hardware
and software fronts though will
ultimately be up to wall way as to what
will be included and left out
and next up Xiaomi seems to be getting
into the holiday spirit with new
products just in time for the holidays
the me sphere camera is the most
expensive of the bunch at $299 it
records 360-degree panoramas at twenty
three point eight eight megapixels which
means that you can record up to 3.5 K or
just shy of what your 4k TV can display
the camera supports two shooting modes
with a resolution of 23:04 by 1152 at 60
frames per second or resolution of 3456
by 1728 at 30 frames per second it's
ip67 rated for dust and water resistance
and has six axis stabilization now what
about this a Xiaomi me robot the robot
builder kit lets you build one of three
different robots from
and 978 part kit the fun part doesn't
stop there you can download an app on
your phone and program the robot it's
self balancing includes high-capacity
batteries so the fun won't stop anytime
soon xiaomi is also selling two new
different types of headphones over the
ear and in ear buds the xiaomi me head
phones are the over the ear headphones
and will run you a hundred and thirty
dollars Xiaomi says they are crafted
with the new graphene material to
provide high performance audio and a
passive radiator provides fully
immersive hi-fi experience and powerful
bass and Xiaomi hasn't forgot all you
battery hogs out there and there are a
lot of you because they've provided us
with the power bank pro now I haven't
used it but it must be doing pretty well
because it's sold out currently out of
stock but if you look in the link I
provided below it'll take you to the
article and you can follow that link in
the article and get the updates when
needed now I know from reading comments
in past shows that there are still a
sizable number of Nokia fans out there
and you'll be happy to know that not
only is the Nokia 2 coming very soon but
it's coming to the US as of right now
you can head over to the Amazon listing
for the nokia 2 and check out all the
details although it is not on sale just
yet but will be very soon the phone
comes unlocked for use on gsm networks
like AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile but will not work
on Sprint or Verizon and has a low
powered qualcomm snapdragon 212
processor a 5 inch 720p display but a
massive 4100 million power battery it
comes with android 7.1.2 out of the box
and much like other Nokia devices
there's promised upgrades for Android
reo and Android P the rest of the specs
include an 8 megapixel main camera a 5
megapixel front-facing camera 1 gigabyte
of RAM 8 gigabytes of on-board storage
but luckily you can expand the storage
with a micro SD card but you're stuck
with a paltry 1 gigabyte of RAM their
support for dual SIM cards LTE and the
phone comes in three colors black copper
and white now don't let those specs
chase you away just yet you should know
that the phone is being priced for
$9.00 hey guys I got a question for you
you know that I have the new pixel to
the the smaller version and I have a
bunch of cases for them and I want to
know from you what do you look for in a
case do you use a case if you do what
are you looking for in the case for me
I'm usually looking for something that's
really thin and just provides minimal
protection I don't want to add bulk
because I don't like big phones what are
your priorities let me know in the
comments below
preferably on Twitter cuz it's easier to
track right there let me know what you
think thanks now my audience is smart so
smart that sometimes you're inspired by
a business idea and then you try and get
the name of that business in a domain
name and your next perspective customer
is searching your business name and they
assume you have the dot-com and if you
don't you're giving your business away
to the one who does that's the power of
a.com now why is that exactly
well no domain name extension tells your
story with the same degree of trust as a
dot-com or dotnet domain name.com and
dotnet domain name extensions inject
credibility and your online presence and
who doesn't want to be credible and
