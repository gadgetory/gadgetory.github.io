what's going on everybody and I just
went on an expedition okay so just a
second ago I got done with what's called
an expedition which is the program that
Google is creating via cardboard that
will allow kids students let's say to be
able to actually experience what would
otherwise would just be in their
textbook in their curriculum now the
reason why I really wanted to experience
this and share it with you guys is
because well it's it's already well
known that there's a difference between
seeing what you're actually reading in a
book the video or something but this
might be the next step this might be the
next level rather because we've all had
those moments where we're sitting in a
classroom and we just watch a
documentary on something and the
monotone voice the David Attenborough
boy's voice just allows us to sleep and
that clashes into being like a bit of a
nap time for us but really in the in the
sense of actually trying to learn about
places or even things this is what I
think might be the next level because
you're actually able to engage and what
you're being shown and what you're being
taught and even just the act of having
the cardboard on your face with whatever
phone is going to be used in there will
allow you to kind of stay awake so on a
very simple level I feel like cardboard
and expeditions is a great way of sort
of alleviating what might otherwise be a
very boring experience in the classroom
but really the experience itself was
actually really awesome the expedition
that I did was on the spirit rover that
went on to Mars and looks for rocks and
various forms of or rather signs that
there was life on Mars at one point and
it actually had panoramic views of
exactly what spirit was seeing on Mars
and when going through all of the
panoramas you'll see in this particular
clip right here that the teacher has a
tablet with an app on it that will Wi-Fi
direct to all of the Nexus 5's in my
case and be able to project what is
being shown on its screen and then send
it out and then the teacher will be able
to pinpoint little parts inside of that
image in order to tell them exactly what
they need to be looking at
then give them information on it with
little scripts on the side for so that
the teacher knows exactly what to talk
about but the thing about the
expedition's experience is that it's not
limited to just experiences like that
like looking at Mars through the eyes of
the Spirit rover you can also go to
places like Versailles or you can go to
places like the natural history museum
out in new york which our actual
examples that they will have here at the
expedition as well and those are ones
that i'll check out as well but really
anywhere that they can send little GoPro
arrays like you can see right behind me
or any other array that will be able to
take those panoramic photos and be able
to make them interactive anyone can take
those and go to any place in the world
and be able to create in this case we'll
call it curriculum for students and also
it will be able to create a pretty much
any experience for anyone that wants to
enjoy them i know for me i think will be
really great to be able to go to like
say the vatican and be able to see what
the inside of the vatican is like
because i can't feasibly just fly out to
rome and be able to go in there you know
on any given day but with something like
expeditions you can get an experience
like that and be able to actually see in
depth what it is and for students I
think that's a huge deal so I just want
to give you this quick look at
expeditions here at Google i/o 2015
cardboard of course is the platform on
which Google is hoping to create this
experience for students and be able to
upgrade and let's say level up the
education experience and really it seems
like it's going to be a pretty
affordable way of doing so a lot of kids
these days have smartphones whether or
not we're cool with that but if they
have the smartphone and they're able to
get the cardboard AB these pieces of
cardboard really don't cost much at all
and they'll be able to send a bunch of
them along with the tablet that has the
curriculum on it and then there you go
you have your syllabus or your
curriculum for the day but nonetheless
this is josh of regard for android
authority reporting to you live just
giving you a quick look at google
expeditions here at i/o 2015 in san
francisco california</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
