by Toyota and now at CES 2014 we've
moved over to Huawei and looked at an
updated version of a phone that we
really loved one year ago at CES 2013
hey it's Josh Berg our firm
anti-authority what's going on everybody
and this is the huawei ascend mate -
alright so what we're looking at here is
a brand new 4G LTE compatible phone that
is coming to the States we don't really
have a release date yet for the huawei
ascend mate - just yet but we are
excited to see it on US carriers what we
have on the front is a 6.1 inch screen
covered in Corning Gorilla Glass that
provides really own very nice experience
you can even see in the camera right now
just how nice the screen looks dead on
and even in the viewing angles this is
one of the Bennis creams that I've seen
so far at CES 2014 that 6.1 inch screen
is right below a 5 megapixel shooter at
the top that provides really nice
panoramic photos because of its wide
angle lens and speaking of cameras the
rear camera at 13 megapixels comes in at
an aperture of f28 for some nice
low-light photography we already took a
coma pictures on it and yes the screen
does have a little bit to do with it but
the pictures came out very crisp and
very sharp underneath the surface this
phone is powered by the Snapdragon 400
that clocks in at 1.6 gigahertz that
will then give it a lot of good speed
and definitely enough reliability for
all of the users out there especially
the general users out there and of
course with this screen you'll be able
to watch all the media that you want
play some games and have a lot of fun
with the 6.1 inch screen and then
further underneath the surface of 4050
milliamp our unit allows the battery
life for this to go for quite a long
time and of course the final part about
the ascend made to is the interface now
the emotion UI is what you see here and
it's a very attractive looking operating
system but it does come with a couple of
extra enhancements which we can show you
right now the first thing that we'll
show you is
the one-handed operation one-handed UI
is right over here and you will see it
right now I allows you to have the
keyboard on one side in order to get an
easy access to it using just one hand
that's one of the enhancements on there
and the next one that I'll show you
right now is the floating window which
is a part of what's called the suspend
button right here the suspend button is
a tiny little dot that appears on the
interface as you can see right over
there
that when you press on there from
anywhere in the user interface it will
give you access to all of the big
functions and that could be the home
button the back button the Menu button
but here the floating window allows you
to have a few different apps right on
top of what you're already working with
for example the calculator just flips
right up and you're able to do some
calculations right on the fly a couple
other ones that are available include
messaging so you can get your texting
done on the fly and it's really just a
nice way to get extra multitasking done
without having to do too much effort all
right and so there you have it for the
ascent mate - we're always really
excited to see wha we at CES at CES
shows and this year we are very happy to
see that while we is really stepping up
their game with 4G LTE on what was
already a very nice device but has been
given a lot of great enhancements that
makes it even more attractive than we
already thought it was so for all of the
best coverage here at CES 2014 committed
to Android Authority coming to you live
from the Consumer Electronics Show and
we're here with huawei stay tuned for
more coverage
and once again thank you to Toyota for
sponsoring our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
