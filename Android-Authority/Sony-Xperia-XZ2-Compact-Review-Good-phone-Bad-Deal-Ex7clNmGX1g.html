it's basically an expiry to but in a
smaller form factor so there are a lot
of similarities but there are some
notable differences as well and because
of that I figured the easiest way to
approach this review is to break it down
by similarities and differences so let's
go ahead and do that let's start with
these similarities first because I
figured it'd be easiest to get those out
of the way so for the most part these
specs are exactly identical to the
regular xperia x ii ii it has a
snapdragon 845 processor inside and four
gigabytes of ram so you're not losing
anything on the performance side it's a
very fast phone its quick to launch
applications quit to multitask and it
also plays all the graphically demanding
games extremely well so there's no
issues with performance on this phone at
all other specifications are exactly the
same as well it's IP 68 certified
against water and dust it has a micro SD
card slot for extra storage and it also
has the fingerprint sensor which is now
on the back and I personally like
rear-facing
fingerprint sensors but I actually kind
of find this one to be a little bit too
low I kind of bend my finger down a
little bit lower than what is
comfortable so I kind of wish it was a
little bit higher but as far as the rear
facing I don't mind it at all and it
actually works extremely well it's very
fast to unlock very accurate as well and
yes of course it does work in the u.s.
this time unfortunately there's no
headphone jack but the regular xperia x
ii ii didn't have a headphone jack
either so it's not really all that
surprising with the xperia x ii ii
compact you also have the same software
and the same camera setup but let's
start with the software first it's
running android 8.0 oreo out of the box
and it's a pretty close to stock Android
experience sony has always done a really
nice job of just letting Android be
Android but you do have the usual Sony
customizations like PlayStation
integration and the exterior lounge and
there are some pre-installed bloatware
apps like Amazon and AVG protection but
that's pretty much it as far as
bloatware is concerned otherwise it's a
really clean and simple Android
experience and that's something I really
appreciate about Sony software
now as far as the cameras are concerned
you have a 5 megapixel camera on the
front which is okay for selfies but it's
definitely not the best on the rear you
have a 19 megapixel of motion eye sensor
with f 2.0 aperture and electronic image
stabilization no optical image
stabilization unfortunately but it
actually does decently well in low light
without it photos are still very well
detailed with nice colors and very
little noise it also performs very well
in daylight or well lit conditions
there's plenty of detail really vibrant
colors but not overly saturated where it
looks unnatural and dynamic range is
actually pretty good it's one of the
better smartphone cameras that Sony has
had in a long time I know Sony
historically doesn't really have great
smartphone cameras but I would say the
Xperia XE 2 compact is the exception
here the only thing I think Sony could
really improve on is their camera
software it just feels a little bit
outdated it's the same exact camera app
that Sonia has been using for the past
several generations and little things
like HDR mode is still really difficult
to get to you have to dig through manual
mode in order to get to it and that just
feels really cumbersome and silly in an
era where HDR auto is a thing on
smartphones ok so I think we've gotten
all these similarities out of the way
let's talk about what's different first
off is the design so overall it has the
same exact shape the same rounded
corners and the same curved back as the
regular Xperia XE 2 but the main
difference here is that it uses a
plastic back instead of a glass back and
I personally don't mind the plastic back
it has this really nice unique frosted
look to it and the benefit here is that
it doesn't attract finger prints like
the glass back of the Xperia XE 2 but
the build quality is still pretty good
even though it uses plastic it still has
a metal frame that wraps around the
sides that feels very solid so I don't
really mind this look at all I think
it's really nice even if it isn't quite
as elegant feeling as the Xperia XE to
the second big difference is the display
because this is a smaller phone you're
getting a smaller screen so it's a
5-inch screen instead of the 5.7 inch
display that's on the Xperia XE 2 but
otherwise it's exactly the same it's an
IPS LCD
with Sony's triluminos technology and it
even keeps the same 1080p resolution
this time around which wasn't always the
case with previous compact phones so
it's pretty nice that you're getting the
same exact resolution if you decide to
go with the smaller version a smaller
phone also means a smaller battery the
Xperia XE to compact doesn't have the
largest battery in the world it's only
two thousand eight hundred and seventy
milliamp hours which by today's
standards is considered to be pretty
tiny
but battery life on the Xperia S II do
compact is actually pretty good I get a
consistent five plus hours of screen on
time which is pretty impressive for a
battery of this size and I usually end
the day with around 20 percent battery
life left and I've never had a charges
phone midway through the day so I've
actually been pleasantly surprised by
how well this phone lasts in terms of
battery life the only other notable
difference is that the XE to compact
doesn't have the same dynamic vibration
motor as the regular XE too and this is
supposed to be like dual shock except
for your smart phone where it'll vibrate
when you're listening to music watching
a movie or playing a game and it's a
neat feature but it's definitely a
little bit gimmicky so I don't think
very many people are gonna mind that
this version of phone doesn't have it I
think the biggest problem that a lot of
people gonna have with this phone is
that it's not exactly cheap it's $600
here in the US and unless you really
value that small and compact form factor
it's not the best option out there the
one plus six for example has a larger
screen a much more modern design dual
cameras and slightly better specs at a
lower price tag the Sony Xperia execute
compact is a really good smart phone for
Sony but it's definitely not the best
deal so that pretty much wraps up this
review of the Sony Xperia XE to compact
