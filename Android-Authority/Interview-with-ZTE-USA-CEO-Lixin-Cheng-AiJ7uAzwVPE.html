2017 and I have the pleasure of talking
again with mr. Lee Hsien Chang was the
CEO of ziti devices USA thank you for
spending time with you today sir you
again so let's talk about 2016 it was
big year for ZTE a lot of things
happened axon phone x17 I'm some mini
big global rollout project CSX and a lot
of new initiatives you guys have with
the two year warranty and all that good
stuff so what was the 2016 like for ZTE
yeah 2016 is a great year so we our
shipment of smartphone grows quarter by
quarter as you know actually the overall
smartphone market was shrinking in the
United States we getting our market
share and the solidified our position in
the android market as number three with
thirteen percent market share okay so
which is so good and our total shipments
to you as reaching almost 18 million
units so it's a great so I also launched
a tablet android tablet with LTE
connectivity both 8 and 10 inch
we also launched the connected car
devices oh really please 18t Mobley and
also sync up dry with tmobile cool
second reply has a very extensive deck
elastics safety and the security
features in condition to be a mobile
hotspot so you have a app on your phone
so you will be able to see everything
going on with your car and also of
course the geofence and other features
stop the teenagers from taking it out oh
yeah yeah so I was a tmobile party made
the maxi burr so he pulled out his phone
very happy with that's looking at the
sex HCG for that yeah why I'm a party
here I still can't see my sign even my
family where they are what's at stake to
the heart so all we're moving towards an
even more connected world yeah so as you
know that they keep wishing to be the
enabler mi CT so I see T's internet the
communication technology with a me in
front of this makes many things right
mobile mainly mobile many connections
and also mentioned the Machine society
is really that end-to-end solution
providers we're also very excited to
about 5 g coming so we're investing a
lot you know in 5g more than 300 million
US dollar already so we continue
building momentum setting the standard
for the global mean why we also be able
to deploy 5g technology on today's 4g
network so so that is a lot of things
going on
the lady 2016 yeah we believe also
continue this momentum into 2070
absolutely I was something you have a
lot of momentum going on right now and I
don't think I mean our audience is very
knowledgeable but I don't think a lot of
people really recognize how large and
diverse of a company's et is and how
much legacy engineering experience
company possesses and in terms of 5g
like it's been around the buzz word has
been around for a long time but how far
realistically do you think it is before
consumers can anticipate to have those
types of bandwidth yeah so 5g it's going
to provide an incredible data speed
super to the consumers and also you know
the platform for the industry which can
do a lot of more streaming video a
critical mission you know services like
auto driving cars to sell products
cancers the latency has to be early low
yeah because you know that speed it's a
mini secondly into the life of death I
second critical so leaky is a leader in
this area setting the standards for the
global meanwhile we are also doing a lot
of creative things that to try to
partnership with a lot of different
carriers around words so we can launch
that product spy g-technology to the
market as soon as possible but probably
say that we believe the massive
deployment of 5g to complete 5g will be
probably around 20 20 yes so that's the
case so then for that 5g you will see
probably 15 kickback kickback per second
don't think a gigabyte yeah so we
already see that you can see it in your
testing yes yeah so so that's a great
but on another side and there is certain
technology like massive vimal
he is a concern that there will be 5g
technologies amid he also have
innovation so we will be able to deploy
those technology today's 4G network so
all the consumers you don't need to
change your phone so then you will be
able to get 5g kind of speed 4.5 t
almost yeah no I think it's 35 to 35 see
because the four if you call it 4.5
meters you know years evolution you're
on 4g to 5g I still fortunately not
exactly but pre 5g means you know we're
going to deploy the 5g technology our 4G
network so so you see that difference I
do and so in terms of the investment
that telecoms and carriers have to make
I mean in order for us to get to 4G
speeds like they did carries had to
invest billions globally it's a huge
market yeah what do you think in terms
of you know what it's going to take for
us to get to those 15 gigabytes a second
super low latency smart cities what how
many billions of dollars are they going
to have to spend essentially so I I
don't know the excitement number but
some industry analyst talking about
probably 38 to 40 billion u.s. dollars
for us only a video smarter to
university not to a straight to the
complete 5g network
which is good thank you know that's the
thing I mean consumers we need more
speed right everyone needs more data and
as we transition to 4k in AK and 360
video yeah we're going to need
incredible bandwidth yeah I know but
this is exciting yeah and speaking of
exciting throw our audience out there
there are a lot of people who really
look up to people like you mr. Chang
because you know your CEO of a
multi-billion dollar company that's very
successful and produces world-class
products and I guess my question to you
is what motivates you like what drives
you to pursue excellence like what do
you feel it was in your heart and soul
that got you from where you were before
to where you are today it's about the
consumer you know so we always want to
do something you know and deliberate the
product which is consumer was yeah so if
you look into their eyes they say hey
mr. chan it really delivered something
which we want so you know we announce
that we're going to build a Z community
completely lost CES yes so we take out
five months to build a platform to
launch that you know in May last year so
then and your end of last year we have
12,000 active users which is strong as a
community is great so they are talking
with that day by day about you know what
they want the needs and wasn't the dream
of their phones so we invest resource to
support us so I think that's a very
rewarding so now we have 33 million
customers active users in the United
States using DD phone every day so I
always want to see you know how I can
make them even more happier so and this
year
we had about 30 different you know
members of the community so they come
here by themselves okay so of course we
facility no meaning ops let them to be
accepted here to talk with our head of
R&amp;amp;D or marketing and also our product
management and also which means I spend
one day and the breakfast with them so
we're talking with them and listen to
them you know the appreciation and also
the suggestions to us this is really
rewarding I just heard from GF actually
they just left so but everybody signed a
car and write a good work to me I saw
also very good real people yeah real
people and nearly one of the cameras so
that's that's that's that's really
motivation so that is also really the
center of everything we do at dt another
thing you know you've probably heard we
we also announced the CSX not c est le
community sauced devices so we let the
community to come out with ideas we
received almost 400 ideas from 170
countries different people also so then
we let the community to vote so finally
we get this item or tracking devices and
so they all stick yeah so then we also
get the name also come from the
community they have five hundred forty
different names come up so of course we
have to do the visibility study to see
right it's a technical Facebook
affordable and also named you know
trademark and all those legal reviews so
