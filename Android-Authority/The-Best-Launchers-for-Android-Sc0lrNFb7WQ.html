handy the Android authority app guy do
you like launchers I know I do and after
the intro we'll check out some of the
best third-party launchers for Android
first on our list is 91 launcher this
fun and simple launcher offers a smooth
experience even if it's a little more
simple than most
while many can get deep into
customizations 91 launcher sticks with
the basics
good widgets good wallpapers and good
themes don't let the simplicity fool you
91 launcher has many of the theming and
customization options that people liked
such as transition animations it just
doesn't get ridiculous with it so if
you're looking for a superior launcher
without all the bells and whistles this
one is worth looking at apex launcher
has been around for a while and it's
because it's a really good in popular
launcher unlike 91 launch or apex comes
packed to the gills with features and
customizations for everything from the
app drawer to the home screens and even
themes icon packs and transition
animations it's optimized for both
phones and tablets as are most of these
launchers so it doesn't really matter
where you use it it's optimized for both
phones and tablets as are most of these
launchers so it doesn't really matter
what you use it on it's an overall
positive experience with smooth
performance and a lot of customization
sadly some of the more fun features are
in the paid version but that really
shouldn't surprise anyone go launcher is
the most downloaded launcher on this
list this is likely because it's free
but it could also have something to do
with how awesome it is it's jam-packed
full of features and can be added to
with a seemingly endless supply of
add-ons it has solid performance but you
really can't appreciate go launcher
until it's entirely set up the bad part
is that setting it up can take forever
as there are themes customization
features and add-ons of plenty if you
like more options than most sane people
then give Go Launcher a shot one of the
most dependable and generally well-liked
launchers is nova launcher like most on
this list it supports a lot of features
themes and customization so if you like
eye candy and really who doesn't like
eye candy nova launcher has plenty of it
perhaps its funnest features are for the
widgets you can put any 1x1 widget in
the dock and even overlap your widgets
to conserve space for create widget
collages for even more eye candy
goodness aside from that it runs really
smooth and people generally like it
smart launcher pro is different from the
other launchers on this list instead of
keeping to the Android
it instead goes with its own thing
unlike most launchers that try to go
with their own things people have
responded to smart launcher Pro with
praise you start on a single homescreen
with shortcuts arranged in a circle you
can make these shortcuts open whatever
app you want so you can get to your
frequently used apps rather quickly from
there you can access a modified app
drawer and a three home screen layout
for all of your widget needs if you take
a look at our leaderboard you can see
how all these apps ranked up against one
another keep in mind that this is how
you rated them not us and there is no
bias on our part if you want to try to
them out for yourself the app links are
in the video description launchers are
interesting because everyone has a
different definition of what a good one
should do with that in mind we have a
few honorary mentions to this list and
they include ADW launcher launcher seven
launcher 8 next launcher easy launcher
chameleon launcher and big launcher if
there's a particularly good launcher
that we haven't mentioned yet but we
really should have feel free to comment
below and tell us about it once again
