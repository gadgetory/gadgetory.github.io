Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 178 so let's get
started it's being reported that Google
could be removing millions of
applications from the google play store
soon google reportedly sent an email to
developers of applications that don't
have a privacy policy those without a
privacy policy will eventually be
removed if they don't start including
one developers will have until mid-march
2017 to fix the issue it should remove a
ton of amateur apps filler apps and a
whole bunch of abandoned ass it would
help freshen things up quite a bit the
latest humble bundle is now live this
time around it will feature tons and
tons of RPGs some of the games include
evil land Duma destiny shadowrun returns
star wars kotor and many more you can
pay whatever you want and get three
games you can beat the average and get
four additional games or pay the flat
six dollar fee to get every game in the
bundle some of them are some pretty
awesome RPGs and there are enough games
here to last you a whole year Mozilla
announced this week that half of their
staff are being laid off they have also
decided to redirect their focus to
Internet of Things technology and some
are reporting that Mozilla will also
begin looking into AR and VR technology
as well we also hope that their browser
gets a little more love it's been a
rough day for about 50 people what we do
hope that it leads to better things
going forward hatch had some big
announcements this week their mobile
game streaming service will offer over
90 games on its service for free when it
launches some of the games include altos
adventure evil land and a few others for
those who don't know hatch is a spin-off
from Rovio their premises to create a
game streaming service for mobile gamers
and it'll have no in-app purchases or
anything like that they'll also have a
paid version of the service but we don't
know much about it just yet the Google
now launcher will be removed from the
google play store by the end of march
additionally GMS partners won't be able
to prepackage the launcher on their
devices anymore a recent update allows
third-party launchers to integrate the
google now panel directly onto their
launchers thus Google now launcher
apparently is no longer necessary at
least according to google because we
thought it was fantastic we do have a
list of alternatives if anyone is
interested lego life is a community
application for lego
fans the idea is that boys and girls can
join up check out Lego stuff and
communicate with one another the app
comes with Lego videos information about
various sets and games and all kinds of
other stuff you can also share videos
and updates about what you're doing in
the world of Lego the target audience is
kids ages 5 to teenage years it's also
completely free to download and use
although there are some bugs that need
to be fixed there are no in-app
purchases with this app a boy and his
blob is a remake of the original NES
game of the same name aside from the
graphical remaster the game is the same
as it always was the world is threatened
by an evil emperor and your job is to
stop that from happening it's a classic
platformer and the controls are smooth
the graphics are colorful and there are
plenty of puzzles and challenges to
overcome of course you'll have your blob
friend to help you out it's four dollars
and ninety-nine cents with no in-app
purchases camerata be our camera is
something a little bit different you can
use this application to link smartphones
together to create your own VR camera
rig it also uses a single user mode that
lets you record a video and then the
application tries to render it into a VR
video for your enjoyment it then has a
dual phone mode that lets you capture
stereoscopic 3d videos it's a bit
challenging to use and it's also quite
new between the bugs and a new landscape
you may run into a few issues here and
there thankfully the application is
completely free and it won't cost you
anything to check it out good dogs is a
new infinite runner about dogs it was
made by 4th wall along with the popular
Twitter account we rate dogs the game
has a simple premise as you run through
a dog park and try to avoid obstacles
when you lose you'll be rated based on
your performance it includes seven dogs
to unlock some customizations and the
developers promised a different part to
run through every month it's a fun
little time waster for dog fans and it's
free to download and play the in-app
purchases are just little customizations
that you can unlock with real money
email by easily view is a new and simple
email app it boasts a simple no frills
interface that puts nothing between you
and your mail it also has an assistant
built-in it tries to help you organize
and find your important emails aside
from that it supports a variety of
account types real-time notifications
for things like package tracking and
flight info if you have those emails and
you can unsubscribe from junk mail
fairly quickly the only downside is that
the application is in beta so there will
be some bugs here and there otherwise
it's completely free
for even more Android apps and games
