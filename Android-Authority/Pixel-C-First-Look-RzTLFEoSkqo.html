authority what's going on everybody and
here we are with the brand-new tablet
from Google here we're looking at the
pixel see now the reason why I have it
in this orientation right now is because
I'm gonna show you one of the main
features of it you already have the
light bar right here which is
reminiscent of the pixel line but if I
just slide this out like that you're
going to see that it already comes apart
like that so slide this out I'm going to
go ahead and just snap it right it's a
place oh they told me was gonna take a
couple of tries but there you go check
out the magnet back here is actually
really strong it goes for a number of
degrees and there's also so strong that
I have to snap it off like that and I
can actually put it in this orientation
now going around I'm just gonna go ahead
and hit the power button right there and
here is the tablet itself now we have of
course the updated version of Android
here marshmallow on this 10.2 inch
screen and the resolution is 2560 by
1800 so you can all a lot of a lot of
space on here to do a lot of work and
play and of course we're gonna take a
look at marshmallow right here and
there's your Easter Egg for marshmallow
now the tablet itself is powered by the
NVIDIA Tegra x1 which should bring not
only high performance but also
performance for gaming and that's
obviously going to be a focus of the
tablet as media consumption is going to
be really important bringing it up here
to the keyboard we're just gonna go
ahead and get a little bit of typing
done on here so we're gonna pop over to
the dog's application let's go ahead and
just make a quick document
now the keyboard actually feels pretty
nice it's very reminiscent of a laptop
keyboard in the sense that you had that
chicken type style and it has that
really really small feel small ish feel
in terms of the feel of you know keys
going down when you're pressing over so
really it's quite nice and the tablet is
also able to detect when it is docked
with this Bluetooth keyboard and it will
give you the ability to either have it
for typing on the keyboard or and
there's the keyboard right there but if
I were to snap it back onto here then
the keyboard disappears so that's a
really nice feature there in the
integration of the keyboard with the
tablet itself is quite nice now the
thing that we really enjoy about this
particular tablet is that has the pixel
design language on here if we're gonna
go and close it up right here we have a
non metal construction all around which
gives it a very sturdy feel this light
bar on the bottom right here you can see
is already showing me just how much
battery is on there use just a double
tab on the area in order to get it and
then of course the keyboard has the nubs
on the bottom in order for it to sit
quite nicely the battery is 34 watt
hours and they're hoping that this
tablet will be able to last for 10
constant hours plus so hopefully that
will definitely be the case when we get
our editor unit this package however
will set you back a couple of different
price points the tablet itself is going
to come in at $499 starting and then the
keyboard is $149 on its own it won't be
available until a little bit later but
just in time for the holidays but you
can order it on the Google store and
from there you should have a pretty nice
tablet ready for the holidays so we're
pretty excited to see a new tablet from
your Google not only manufactured you
buy them because that is how the pixel
line usually is but has this great
design language would do it dual
speakers on the sides right here of
course the USB type-c port right over
here which is going to be their new
standard across all mobile and also the
Chromebooks that already introduced the
USB type-c but really that's just a
quick look and we're going to do this
one last time
at the pixel see the new tablet by
Google another one of the exciting
announces that they had here at their
event here in San Francisco keep it
tuned to Android authority for even more
about the pixel see and we'll have our
full review once we get our hands on a
review you
it's it's a nice it's a nice compact way
of changing your tablet into a full
workstation and we're pretty excited to
get our hands on it as you can see here
it's pretty nice to use so keep it tuned
to Android 34 even more because we are
your source for all things and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
