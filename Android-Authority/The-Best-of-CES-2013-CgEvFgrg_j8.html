Osterberg are from android
authority what's going on everybody so I
have my tea right here because like many
people who came back from CES I got
really really sick and it took me just
about a week to get over it so I hope
I'm hoping the tea will get me over the
top I've definitely gone through my fair
share of dayquil and nyquil but I think
I'm just weather the storm I should be
getting better now
being behind the camera at CES was a
very interesting experience because I
got to see everything through a lens but
not only that I got to relive all of
that by being able to put the videos
together every single day and each day
since the show so we're one week removed
now from the Consumer Electronics Show
of 2013 so I thought it would be a good
idea at this point to bring you our best
of CES 2013 it'll include all of our
favorite gadgets our favorite devices it
will also include some of our favorite
clips and stay tuned until the end
because there's a pretty funny gag reel
along with a lot of the b-roll footage
that we didn't get to show you the first
round but we get to show you today so
from the bottom of our hearts that
Android Authority thank you so much for
watching we hope you enjoyed all of our
CES coverage and next year we're gonna
do it bigger and better so stay tuned
alright let's go alright so but first
things first left right so this is my
first time in this is a dare across from
Android Authority calm this is my very
first time out in the Fabulous Las Vegas
and as far as CES goes he wasn't the
only one aside from Darcy this was
pretty much all of our first time to the
Consumer Electronics Show now the one
thing you notice right away when you get
to convention like this is the people a
hundred and fifty thousand people made
it out to CES 2013 and it showed not
only was it hard to get into the venue
but once you got inside it was hard to
get around
now here's the Samsung booth one of the
busiest ones during the convention you
can see just how many people were there
to take a look at the latest and
greatest that Samsung had to offer but
look how awesome it looks and it was the
same for everywhere else the scenery at
CES is one of the first things that
you'll remember when you leave all of
the companies make their boots look so
awesome
and it's kind of like a sensory overload
kind of the one thing about it is though
there's so much going on around you that
sometimes it's easy to get lost you can
see here Darcy and I trying to find our
way over to the video booth which was on
the very other site of this one
convention floor there were three shell
floors each with hundreds and hundreds
of exhibitions but you see some really
awesome things kind of like this aston
martin and this rolls-royce there
weren't a lot of cars on the show floor
and the cool thing about them is if the
door was open you know someone's gonna
sit inside and I was no different
I had to get inside of here and see just
what a Rolls Royce was all about now I
may never have this car in my life so
that's why it was kind of nice to check
it out one of the reasons why the
Preview Day videos even existed was
because even though you come to us here
at Android authority to look at the
newest and the greatest phones when
we're at an event like CES we want you
to be there with us we want to make it
as if you are right beside us
experiencing everything that we get to
experience because we're looking at
technology through wide eyes and we're
also fans of everything that's going on
around us here at the convention floor
kind of like this display here I mean
look how cool it is that they're
displaying their Smart TVs speaking of
televisions they were one of the biggest
draws at CES 2013 now 4k televisions are
pretty much going to be the future and
it's debatable whether or not they're
going to be here sooner rather than
later if people are going to adopt them
because let's face it 3d last year
wasn't quite where it would need it to
be but our own Derek Ross was set to
find not just a better looking TVs but
ones with even better functionality
underneath and the Google TV's were
definitely his forte now just take a
look at these TVs I mean they look
pretty awesome already but the
functionality underneath is pretty
obvious when you
the remote I mean look at all of the
buttons that you have on that now
simplistic remotes are a thing of the
past now but nonetheless Android seems
to be making it on to other devices
rather than just phones and TVs or
perfect example I mean just look at how
the voice search on this TV is working
so well it's nice to see Android making
it on to a bunch of different other
platforms and with televisions being on
the forefront you're going to see a lot
of things you used to be able to do just
on your computer happen on the big
screen but now I'm not even going to
waste any time I'm gonna get into what
was at least for me the biggest
announcement of the entire CES 2013
yeah you guessed it I'm talking about
the shield now I had the distinct
privilege of being at the press
conference where Nvidia announced not
just the shield but shortly before that
Tegra 4 now Tegra 4 is a beast of a
processor package that's gonna make it
into a lot of new Android devices and
it's six times more powerful than Tegra
3 with 72 graphics cores and a quad core
CPU it's made to go the distance and
it's made for absolute power we're
really excited for the Tegra 4 and we
can't wait to see it in new tablets even
ones that surpass the fastest one out
there right now as you can see the Nexus
10 and there are some other advancements
in there as well where both clusters of
the GPU and CPU cores are going to be
able to take simultaneous pictures which
makes HDR photography so much more
possible on smaller devices like
smartphones and tablets it's a pretty
awesome feature that is available in
Tegra 4 and the demonstration for it was
pretty amazing as well it looks like HDR
is going to be the future of Android
photography and I'm really excited to
see what that pans out stay tuned for a
video on just what that means once this
comes out but then again let's get right
into the shield now the Tegra 4 is going
to be the heart and soul of the shield
and what the shield basically is is a
large controller just like that that
allows you to control your games in ways
that you haven't been able to before
especially on Android but as you can see
on the TV they're not the actual display
he was playing Assassin's Creed 3 the
capabilities of the new Nvidia graphics
cards are going to be able to stream
your PC games over to this little
portable device that's just nothing
short of amazing at the Nvidia booth we
were able to get not really a hands-on
but we got really close to the devices
themselves everyone wanted a hands-on
but that was just not gonna happen this
is about as close as we could get to the
shield and you can see it running all
the Android games is what now but we're
really but at least me I'm really
excited to see the PC capabilities of it
when it streams your PC games from the
computer
we had a lovely interview with this
gentleman right here and you can see me
over there on the left side I'm just
over there doing my thing and I have to
say even though it might just be from a
gamer standpoint I really do think that
the shield is a perfect example of just
how Android is maturing into not from
not only a phone interface or a phone
operating system but into something
that's so much more than that and here
we go we're finally getting into the
best of phones we're gonna start off
with the huawei the ascend mate and the
ascend d2 were almost like brothers on
the show floored
every time we saw one phone its
companion was definitely the other that
came together no matter where we went
here's the ascend mate but we're also
jumping into the ascent d2 which is seen
right here now the ascend d2 may not
have the best specifications on the
market right now but it's sporting a
five-inch screen with a 1080p display
like a lot of smart phones are doing
these days it's a smaller of the two
which is pretty funny to say because the
ascend mate
is what beckons on the side our own
Darcy lack of a sports a Galaxy Note 2
and he loves big displays and big phones
when it comes to the ascend mate he was
positively falling in love with that new
device he was all over it the entire
time we were there and he cannot wait to
get his hands on it in the future
we also go on to a different phone the
ZTE grant is coming from another Chinese
manufacturer it seems as though the
grand s by ZTE is going to be one of
those phones that puts a style maybe
over functionality just a little bit as
you can see has a very colourful
interface again with a 5-inch display at
1080p again that's going to be our trend
but while it may have what looks like
basic functionality with a very nice
skin on top what we were able to find
out during this interesting interview
with the representative at ZTE is that
the entire phone is really in one way or
another very customizable you can have
the interface customized but also the
body of the phone itself comes in a
bunch of different colors so if style is
what you're looking for I think this
phone has it in spades and you can
customize it all you want but this is
when we get to the best and I think
arguably we're looking at the best phone
here in the Xperia Z by Sony it already
got a lot of awards by the time we got
to the Sony floor but we had to take a
look at it for ourselves and we found
that the Xperia Z really captured our
hearts especially mine it's just a
gorgeous phone that takes top-tier specs
expandable memory 5-inch screen 1080p
display and puts it into a body that is
not only really sleek but also
water-resistant as you can see here we
found that the Xperia Z was able to go
into depths of 3 feet for up to 30
minutes now that's nothing short of
amazing and in the first demonstration
we saw on the first night in Las Vegas
we saw that even after you take the
phone out of the water it's able to work
right off the bat and if for whatever
reason you don't really like the all
glass look of the Xperia Z there's a
variant called the Z L you might be
giving a body resistance but what you
get instead on the back is a very nice
matted plastic and also a slightly
smaller body even though all the specs
and even the size of the screen are
exactly the same it's just an amazing
product and it deserves all the
accolades I has gotten and it certainly
gets the same appraised four months
and so there you have it
CES 2013 was nothing short of amazing
from the sheer amount of people that you
saw to the kind of people you saw on the
show floor to even the people that you
got to work with it was just a blast all
around and one thing that you get
reminded of every single day at CES is
that technology is moving at a pace that
sometimes we can't keep up with it in a
way that's what's awesome about it thank
you so much we hope you enjoyed all the
footage that we had at CES we can't wait
to do it bigger and better for you next
year and we want to leave you with this
a small little blooper reel a lot of
b-roll and even if these things aren't
necessarily Android related per se they
still are part of our best of CES 2013
we're going to see you next year
we hope you're along for the ride
that's in the outtakes
a little bit of the epicMealTime there
for you guys we're coming to you live
from CES 2013 it's Android authority
everybody
Spanish music get those all out oh yeah
can you hold it and I move my finger
ramp think about owning a smartphone or
tablet what is the number one thing that
is always on your mind battery life it's
like a mortgage it's like a virus
haunting your mind the key is the power
cartridge or nectar pod is what we call
it and each of these pods has enough
energy in it to power your phone for two
weeks to a month and it's really simple
to use you just take the pod insert it
in when it's done you can recycle it and
pop another one in I disagree with your
choice of phone by the way plug that in
yeah sorry about the phone yeah now you
were telling me before that this has how
many many 5000 milliwatt ours just blows
my mind
well thanks everybody thanks for taking
the time to listen today I'm Dave
Anderson I'm an automotive Solutions
Architect with NVIDIA and I kind of help
look after the North American automotive
side of things for NVIDIA this is a
total gauge replacement so this is
actually basically replacing all the
analog needles all the dials that you
normally have in your vehicle today so
with this we can change the subpart of
this composition and this can allow us
to bring in other kinds of mobile apps
could bring in navigation could bring in
a content database you know for like
your contacts or something like that
anything that you might imagine you know
that you have wireless access food today
invidious technologies have been a
little over two and a half million
vehicles on the road today yeah yeah
it's it's it's a it's a massive the
presence if you will for us I mean so
it's definitely a growing growing
business and we're very very excited
about it yeah yeah likewise really great
to talk with you yes a problem so here's
what I will say about that so here's
what I will say about that I'm ready and
this is where I skirt the question and
redirect please young ones introduce you
to the project for now Susan
yeah that's a big deal that's great all
right now let's get some some UI
elements here anything else we did today
we got over vocally today we got a lot
of really good information from Sony and
from Huawei and from our a lot of
vendors for the Google TVs
k3b - is there expandable memory he's a
handsome man you can just you can just
go into talking about it LTE 4G @xt
for the samsung galaxy note 10.1 4G LTE
beezly VZW
