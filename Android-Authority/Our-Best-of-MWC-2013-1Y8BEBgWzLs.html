let's do this ready to go hey guys it
starts to lack of a here with Android
authority what's up we are here at
Mobile World Congress this is the final
day we weren't really able to get any
videos out every day for you guys
telling us what our experiences are like
so we want to have a nice recap and of
course this Joshua Burke are from
Android Authority unlike from CES I got
to get in front of the camera just like
right now so Darcy and I are kind of
cutting up the duty a little bit but in
that respect we've been able to really
see a lot of great devices I got to film
some I got to hold some I got to present
some so it's been really really great
you know they actually changed the venue
this time for those of you who have been
regular visitors you'll see that Mobile
World Congress used to be in a previous
venue but they changed up for logistical
reasons and I have to say that this has
been a real pleasure to represent you
guys to check out all the cool hardware
general thoughts on the conference
honestly it was I was I was really not
sure what to expect CES was the first
convention that I had ever gone to the
Consumer Electronics Show and it was in
a place that I'm very familiar with so
it's Las Vegas but coming out to
Barcelona Spain insane in and of itself
the fact that I get to come to this
beautiful country is we don't was
sitting with this awesome food
black-footed hand by the way all my
goodness anyway it's really really
awesome to see it just how easy was to
navigate the floors and everything like
that aside from that it's the same kind
of deal you have the sensory overload
with the colors and all the noises and
all the people and all that so kind of
it's one of those things have you ever
been to like a comic-con or something
like that most conventions are pretty
much the same but this one's really
awesome because it's focused on mobile
and that's really what we're here for so
we got to see some really awesome stuff
and I think I think it was great
honestly the city really adds a lot to
it but also the convention show floor
was just a lot of fun
it's owned already and being able to see
everything through a lens but also
firsthand hands-on and first-hand man
it's it really is an amazing experience
there's two things okay actually three
things first one would be Spanish women
because they're very beautiful even
though we didn't see them outside they
were all inside here I kind of have a
bit of a bench or a on this one because
if you know me at all already and I hope
some of you do by now I'm to come the
videographer slash reviewer slash photo
guy for Android authorities so the two
cameras that you're seeing one right
there and then the one that you're
seeing right here
it's my equipment it's all stuff that I
have so I take really good care of my
stuff
even a camera from like four or five
years ago still does really well I had
events like this
unfortunately the night before the show
even started the entire MWC even started
we went to a couple more exclusive
events and I leaned this this monopod
that you see here that that we're using
here that Darcy's all linked and leaned
it with my newest camera on the table
and normally nothing ever happens it's
perfectly fine but as I went to put on
my bag I just saw it just get smaller
and smaller and just fell on the ground
I was freaking it out luckily I picked
up the camera it's a resilient camera
and everything worked fine this camera
seriously Lumix G H 3 by Panasonic you
guys should totally check it out this is
this is a great camera and it could
withstand a fall like that so honestly
even though it's a bad story that's my
favorite experience because it made me
realize just how much I love my
equipment so ii would probably be the
tablet from Sony the Sony Xperia tablet
Z or Z depending where you're from
beautifully thin nice powerful Hardware
1080p Beyond TV display and then finally
my new love something I'm thinking about
changing up the Galaxy Note 2 4 which is
the Optimus G pro with this ultra thin
bezel and call chrome 600 processing and
13 megapixel camera and I'll just go on
and on I don't want this to become a
trend but it seems like Sony's gonna
take my heart every time I go to a
convention floor because CES was the
Xperia Z in the CL I really loved both
of those phones they were incredible and
then they just came out of okay maybe
they didn't come out of nowhere but I
certainly wasn't expecting the Xperia
tablet Z to be as amazing as it was I
was so excited to present it and I
and I was able to and that was like the
best part for me that thin that thin
thin device and it's so easy to to hold
and someone made a really wonderful
point earlier that I totally agree with
having that angular edge that real
rectangular display and form factor
that's what a tablet should look like
all the other tablets are great but the
Xperia tablet Z I'm so looking forward
to seeing what that is like in real life
