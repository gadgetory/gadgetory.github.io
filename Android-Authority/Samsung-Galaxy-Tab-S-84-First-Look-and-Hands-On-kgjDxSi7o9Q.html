from Samsung a trucks regard from
Android Authority what's going on
everybody and here is your first look at
the Samsung Galaxy Tab s 8.4 if the Tab
pro 8.4 was somewhat like a blown-up
Galaxy Note 3 than the Tab s 8.4 is
trying to be like a blown-up Galaxy s5
quite literally every design element
from the galaxy s5 finds its way onto
the tab S including the fingerprint
scanner integrated into the physical
home button that is flanked by a
capacitive back key in a recent apps key
also making a return is that textured
plastic back with a perforated dimpled
design after six point six millimeters
thick and around two hundred ninety
eight grams you're almost so much
surprised at the handling when you pick
up this device the Tab s 8.4 is actually
quite easy to handle not only because of
its flat sides and thin profile but also
because of how light it is
and at this size the Tab s 8.4 offers
the perfect balance between Portability
and display size without going too far
and of course the marquee feature of
this tablet is the fact that it comes
with a great 8.4 inch AMOLED display
coming in at a resolution of 2560 by
1600 it is the standout feature and it
is really what Samsung is going for here
in terms of creating a color profile
that is very pleasing for all those who
use their tablets for media consumption
which their research pretty much finds
is basically the case when it comes to
tablets pretty much anything you will do
on this display will come out absolutely
fantastic if you do like the
oversaturated colors of the Super AMOLED
screens on your Galaxy S smartphones
then you get them blown up here in these
tablets and if you wanted a comparison
using the 10-inch tablets that were
available in a display at this event you
were able to see that the Super AMOLED
screen was able to have higher contrast
and much deeper blacks when compared to
a regular TFT LCD display and you can
see that difference here and it is
pretty obvious all in all you do get a
great display here and if it is really
something that you wanted out of your
tablet a more vibrant display then you
got it here in the tab S Series
performance should be no issue when it
comes to either of these tablets as you
will be getting the exceed O's 5 octa
processor found inside but there are
going to be LTE variants of these
particular tablets
we want to be surprised if those
particular ones came with the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 801 since that is the most
updated version of the Snapdragon
processing package available as far as
the hardware go Samsung again packs as
much as possible with all of the full
ranges of connectivity available on
either device including like I said
already the LTE variants after that you
get 16 or 32 gigabytes of built-in
storage and which can be further
expanded by microSD cards of up to 128
gigabytes of capacity so storage should
be a no issue and I wasn't able to test
the speakers on these but we wouldn't be
surprised if they were at least decent
performers given that these are media
consumption tablets first and foremost
the Tab s 8.4 packs a forty nine hundred
million power battery which is slightly
larger than the one found in the Tab pro
8.4 but it should still offer a
comparable and at least equally
impressive battery life it seems that
all the high-end tablets nowadays are
going to come with rear cameras but
again in this case it's not particularly
a standout feature and I wasn't able to
really test it out anyway but we're
looking people who use their tablet so
the camera won't really be a marquee
feature it's not going to be a primary
shooter you probably have a better
shooter in your pocket already with your
smartphone and finally in software the
experience is very similar to what you
already saw in the Tab pro and no Pro
line of tablets again the primary focus
in this particular operating system this
version of TouchWiz is the magazine UX
it's the tiled interface that in a lot
of ways is basically just a front end
for Flipboard and as such it may add a
couple extra steps to get you from the
start to finish when it comes to your
source but in the end it is a pretty
nice looking interface but if it's not
ultimately useful for you then that will
dictate whether or not you support the
magazine UX as part of the TouchWiz
operating system aside from that however
despite some aesthetic changes TouchWiz
remains very much TouchWiz even with the
circle centric motif that is found in
the notification drop-down in the
settings and then after that you still
have the uber colorful elements all sort
of flattened out in this updated version
of the look but there are a couple of
enhancements that were put into the
software this time around as these
tablets are supposed to be integrating
with the galaxy s5 smartphone there is a
new application called side sync
basically which
give you a full view of your phone and
be able to control it via your tablet
you can do everything from controlling
the phone to transferring pictures for
example from the phone to the tablet to
even taking calls when a call comes to
your phone it will route all of the
audio back and forth using your tablet
so you really don't have to touch your
phone at all it really makes these
tablets a more robust system especially
if you like to integrate that the two of
them you know obviously you have to have
both in order to have this functionality
and so there you have it this is the
first look at the Samsung Galaxy Tab s
8.4 we do have the Tab s 10.5 available
in the video as well so you can go and
check that out

tablets the flagship tablets as Samsung
