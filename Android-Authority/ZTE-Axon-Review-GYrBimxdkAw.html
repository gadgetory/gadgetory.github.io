Android authority and ZTE s latest
smartphone is supposedly made entirely
with consumer in mind and delivers only
the things that you would want or value
in a smartphone without all the
unnecessary fluff but how well does it
live up to that claim let's find out
with the axon phone by ZTE here in 2015
the design of a smart phone couldn't be
more important and with phones becoming
somewhat of fashion items with all the
different color options and material
choices that we have now from the likes
of Samsung LG and Motorola it was up to
the fourth largest smartphone
manufacturer to get it right especially
if they really want to make a dent in
the US market the body of the axon phone
is made entirely of a smooth metal to
give it that high-quality premium feel
and the back is tapered with rounded
corners similar to a phone like the one
m9 to make it sit more comfortably in
the hand it definitely does feel
extremely nice but the smooth metal
finish can make the phone feel slippery
the phone is also quite tall due to the
large bezels and front speaker grills so
reaching up top for the notification
shade can be a little bit of a chore and
makes the phone feel even less secure
when you can't maintain your grip the
axon phone also isn't going to be
winning any awards anytime soon for
being thin and light as it weighs in at
a hefty 175 grams and is a little over 9
millimeters thick
but it certainly isn't a bad thing as
the added thickness and weight only
makes the phone feel even more
substantial than it already is to give
the axon phone a unique appeal ZTE added
a distinctive grille pattern that can be
found in multiple locations like the
earpiece front speaker and camera this
is supposed to make the phone stand out
and grab attention to certain parts of
the phone without being overly shouty
aesthetically it flows well with the
overall design of the phone and it
definitely is eye catching when you see
it for the first time going around the
device the buttons are in very ergonomic
locations which really helps with the
handling of the phone considering it has
such a large footprint the power button
is on the right with the volume rockers
on the opposing side below the SIM tray
but also on the right is a dedicated
camera shutter button
something we don't see enough of on
Android phones on top is the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack next to a
microphone and the microUSB port is on
the bottom next to another microphone
finally on the front the axon phone
features a capacitive circle home button
with two dots flanking the left and
right sides for menu and recent apps a
nice touch with the circle home button
is that it also doubles as a
notification light and will pulsate
anytime you get a notification or your
battery is low for ZTE to truly compete
with the heavy hitters the axon phone
had to be packed to the gills with the
latest and greatest and smart phone tech
and it all starts with the display the
screen is a large 5.5 inch LCD panel
with the resolution of 2560 by 1440 or
quad HD all wrapped up in Gorilla Glass
3 and it's a fantastic looking screen
it's big bright beautiful with great
color reproduction viewing angles and
contrast and it's just an absolute
pleasure to use the large size and high
resolution makes it great for all sorts
of content and there's a nice amount of
saturation to make the screen pop it
gets bright enough that outdoor
visibility isn't an issue and the black
levels are pretty good too for an LCD
but obviously still pales in comparison
to the inky dark of an AMOLED panel
inside you'll find the latest chipset
from Qualcomm with the Snapdragon 810
and three gigs of RAM to keep things
running along smoothly the axon phone is
snappy and responsive it flies in and
out of applications without hesitation
and is able to multitask and play
graphically intensive games with very
little trouble not only is the axon
phone being powered by a very powerful
processor but the performance is also
helped by the fact that it's not being
bogged down with a bunch of
pre-installed apps or unnecessary
software which helps to maintain a fluid
experience all around
these Snapdragon 810 is notorious for
running hot which we all know by now and
there have been a couple of times where
the phone did get warm during long
gaming sessions and feeling the heat
permeate through the metal body is a
little bit jarring but it's yet to get
to the point where I felt like I
couldn't handle the phone or rendered it
inoperable ZTE made a pretty big deal
about the audio experience on the axon
phone and rightfully so it's the first
smartphone to be released
in the US with a hi-fi audio chipset
built-in for both listening and
recording you can use any pair of
headphones or earbuds that you want to
take advantage of it but ZTE does
include a very nice pair of JBL earbuds
in the box
a $50 value which we're essentially free
if you took advantage of the pre-order
the hi-fi audio definitely works well
and I was able to easily notice a
difference in audio in comparison to a
couple of other flagships that I tried
like the s6 and m9 while using the JBL
earbuds among all of them on the ax on
phone the sound is not only louder but
it's also a lot fuller with depth
especially along the mids and lows now
one part of the audio experience that
isn't quite what you might expect is the
speaker grilles on the front the dual
speaker grilles would lead you to
believe that there's dual front-facing
speakers but sadly there's only one
speaker firing on the bottom and the
other is just the earpiece the speaker
does sound good and is quite loud but
without a second speaker up top for a
true stereo sound the audio can be very
lopsided when consuming media and
landscape and overall it is anything
overly impressive other hardware
includes the usual slew of connectivity
options like Wi-Fi Bluetooth NFC and of
course all of the necessary LTE bands
for to work on carriers here in the
states like t-mobile and 18t now for
storage there's only one configuration
available which is 32 gigabytes and
there's no room for microSD card
expansion which was a very odd omission
considering this is the only storage
option that you get now 32 gigabytes may
still be enough for most people but if
you're really heavy on the media it may
just barely be cutting it as far as the
battery is concerned a large 3000
milliamp hour battery is packed inside
and battery life on the axon phone is
good but it isn't spectacular it's good
enough to last a full day with at least
four hours of screen on time but that
number seemed to be where it would
usually cap out even on a heavy usage
day where I played quite a few games and
took a lot of photos the phone still
managed to eke out four hours of screen
on time despite only lasting about eight
hours off the charger with more casual
use that number increases dramatically
to around 13 to 16 hours but screen on
time only showed a slight increase
four and a half hours for those heavier
days where you may need to charge midway
through the day the axon phone takes
advantage of Qualcomm quick charge 2.0
to get you back up and running in a
short amount of time
another big highlight of the axon phone
that ZTE made a big deal about is the
camera the main camera on the rear is a
13 megapixel F 1.8 sensor with oh is but
there's an additional 2 megapixel lens
for capturing depth information similar
to what we saw on the One m8 for selfies
the front camera is a respectable 8
megapixels and not only is it capable of
taking some great looking shots but it's
also a wide-angle lens to help you
easily fit additional subjects into the
frame the camera UI is simple and
navigation is done with swipes across
the viewfinder to switch between modes
typical modes like manual panorama sport
HDR slow-motion video etc are all
available but the one that stands out
the most is the bokeh mode which takes
advantage of the cameras refocusing
capabilities the interesting thing about
this bokeh mode is that allows for
manual f-stop control at least that's
what it leads you to believe it does
alter the depth of field or background
blur but unlike a real aperture change
on something like a DSLR it doesn't
affect how much light actually enters
the lens regardless of whether you're
shooting wide open @f 1.0 or @f 8.0
shooting in this mode will allow for
images to be refocused after the fact
along with the level of blur to be
adjusted and the camera does a really
great job of separating objects in the
foreground from the background but it
can look very artificial if you get too
carried away with the blur effect and
can only fully refocus on a different
part of an image if it hasn't already
been blurred out by the cameras natural
bokeh
it's cool and can be rather convincing
if you follow the appropriate guidelines
but right now it still feels more like a
novelty than a must-have feature in
terms of general everyday picture taking
the camera experience is mostly more
good than bad the shutter speed and
autofocus is very quick which made it
very easy to snap photos and the
dedicated camera button is a nice touch
but an auto mission is the lack of a
half press to focus and the camera
button is currently not able to launch
the camera from a sleep State but
hopefully this is something that can be
address
any future software update now infer to
good lighting conditions the camera is
able to produce some pretty excellent
images with adequate natural-looking
colors and maintains a high level of
sharpness and clarity even when zoomed
in dynamic range is just okay it tends
to crush the darks a little too much and
you lose a lot of detail because of it
HDR works well to alleviate that in most
situations but in some cases it does
tend to bias towards a more overexposed
look with less natural-looking colors
macro shots can also be very hit-or-miss
sometimes the camera can find the focus
point right away and you can get an
image with tack sharp focus and other
times it almost becomes an exercise in
frustration to get the image that you
want
even with OAS and an aperture of f-18
low-light and nighttime photography is
decent at best and the image processing
may be to blame there's a lot of noise
reduction going on which leads to softer
details and colors are much more muted
in these situations that it makes it
tough to capture an appealing image as
they hold the camera is good but as it
stands right now it seems to fall a bit
short of the hype for software the axon
phone offers a very clean Android
experience in comparison to the more
heavily skinned devices by ZTE the axon
phone ships with Android 5.1.1 and it's
honestly a mostly stock Android
experience with all Google's material
design aesthetics kept intact there are
a few changes such as the custom
launcher that offers the typical
features like widgets and wallpapers but
you can also change the home screen
scroll effect to something a little more
dynamic and even theme it but it's not a
full-fledged theme engine so there's
only a few to pick from for the time
being the quick settings toggles have
also been slightly tweaked allowing to
rearrange these shortcuts in any order
as you see fit which is a really nice
touch and there's quite a few more
toggles than the traditional ones found
on stock lollipop another functional
change from stock Android is the
addition of a quick info panel that's
accessible with a swipe up from the
bottom with a music player starred
contacts a step counter and sports news
from Yahoo it can be useful but I found
it to get in the way more than anything
especially when trying to swipe away the
notification panel and the info panel
comes up instead ZTE also kept the app
experience
extremely clean by not bogging things
down with a ton of pre-installed bloat
there's only a couple of pre-loaded
applications with Argos and Rock my run
both of which are geared towards health
and fitness Argos is a simple pedometer
to help keep track of your steps and it
can constantly keep you updated on your
lockscreen and notification panel you
can even connect with your friends to
see how well they're doing and help keep
you motivated towards your health goals
The Rock my run app on the other hand is
essentially just a music app but I can
tailor the temple to beat to the pace of
your run to help keep you going
listening to the music is free but if
you want manual control over the tempo
or have it changed based on your pace
it'll cost you $4.99 per month for the
service which also eliminates the in-app
ads the acts on phone is available now
for pre-order directly through ZTE and
other outlets like Amazon eBay and
Newegg
for 449 98 it's available in three
colors phthalo blue ion gold and
chromium silver to top off a purchase
and make users feel more at ease about
buying an unlocked phone the axe on
phone comes with passport 1.0 a
protection plan that offers free premium
protection two years of product warranty
advanced exchanges and free two-way
shipping should anything ever happen to
your device for $450 the axe on phone is
a no brainer it offers many of the same
features as today's mainstream flagships
with a premium metal build quad HD
display a decent camera and the latest
processor at a much lower price point
ZTE may be the fourth largest smartphone
manufacturer in the US but their
presence here in the u.s. among the
general consumer is largely unknown in
comparison to the likes of Samsung LG
and even HTC the axon phone is their
gateway phone to changing that and
they're certainly on the right track now
they just have to convince people to buy
it as always guys thanks so much for
