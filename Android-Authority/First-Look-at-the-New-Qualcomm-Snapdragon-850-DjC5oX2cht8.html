taipei and we're with Qualcomm today to
discuss the future of these always
connected pcs now back in December we
showed you the 835 pcs which are pretty
much these computers that can run all
day they have like 20 plus hours of
battery life they're crazy and they were
running on the snapdragon 835 platform
well today they've announced the
Snapdragon 800 and this platform is
specifically for these always connected
pcs sometimes Wi-Fi is really spotty and
so you're gonna want to be able to use
LTE and so these have a sim embedded so
that means that you're just gonna be
able to use LTE wherever you are and
you're not even gonna have to look for a
Wi-Fi hotspot now you're not gonna have
to go to like a coffee shop and use
their Wi-Fi you can just sit on a bench
outside and do whatever you need to do
for the day
now the 835 was made for smartphones as
well and while that's fine the 850 is
made specifically for these laptops so
that chip is gonna be tuned specifically
for carrying around a laptop where
you're gonna be wanting to pull data
from the internet all day this is kind
of a horizontal shift so it's still on
that same 10 nanometer process but it
actually has a lot of improvements over
the 8:35 and a demo they showed us today
this chip got about 10 degrees Celsius
better thermal performance while running
some games in the background now that's
really really major especially if you're
sitting on your couch or sitting on that
bench like I mentioned earlier and
you're just kind of like writing things
or doing work or even doing a little bit
of light video editing you don't want
your PC to start burning your legs and
third performance is very important here
now again that is that same 10 nanometer
process but you're actually getting
about 30% better battery life now like I
said the 835 was really made for phones
and this is made specifically for
laptops so it's actually pretty
surprising that you're getting such
better battery life on something with
that much bigger of a screen now these
things runs Windows and you're probably
wondering how do these apps actually
work on a Snapdragon chip well they
actually have their own arms 64 platform
and that emulates Windows processes so
you would think that there would be a
major performance like issue here but
there really isn't welcomed told me that
there's really not that big of a
performance hit here when you start
emulating Windows stuff on arm 64 but it
is incredibly easy to compile for arm 60
or DLC was actually the first app that
is now natively running on arm 64 but
they made it as easy as recompiling to
be able to make your app compatible with
it
so now app developers can just have
these Windows apps and just recompile
for arm 64 and it instantly works and
you're not gonna see a huge performance
improvement here but it's still nice to
have your app running natively on a
system now kokum is still selling 835
laptops and in fact this Asus Nova go is
still an 835 laptop they do actually
have any 850 devices here at Qualcomm
they did have some reference devices but
they didn't have any laptops they're
actually gonna ship you're probably not
going to see those shipping and until
about 2019 but until then you can still
buy these 835 devices so we've got a
full article on everything that the 850
is enabling you can head over there to
check it out and make sure you stay
tuned to our socials because we're going
to be keeping you up to date with
everything happening at Computex because
of course we are your source for all
things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
