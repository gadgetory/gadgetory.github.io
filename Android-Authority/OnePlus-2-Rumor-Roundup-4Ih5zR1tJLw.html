brought to you by domain.com when the
oneplus one came out last year it really
made some waves and it was near the top
of our best bang for your box smartphone
lists so naturally there's a lot of
anticipation for the oneplus 2 so the 1
plus 2 s official unveiling is only a
few weeks away so let's talk about what
we know and what we don't know and we'll
start first with design 1 plus has yet
to release anything official regarding
the oneplus tues materials the rumors
have been circulating for some time that
the phone might come with an all metal
chassis for starters CEO Pete loud
teased in his weibo account that this
rumor may be true soon after that we got
our first early look at what is
purported to be the new handset
featuring none other than an all-metal
design the leak smartphone render didn't
really show us anything to it of the
ordinary a rear facing camera a volume
rocker on the right hand side as well as
a standard 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
on top it should be noted that we can't
vouch for the validity of the image in
any way so this rumor should be taken
with a grain of salt now when it comes
to the display rumors have been floating
around that the device could employ a
screen that measures approximately five
point five to five point seven inches
diagonally the oneplus one carried a 5.5
inch display which seems to be the
perfect size for many users who want a
phablet but don't want to go as big as a
6-inch display increasing the size by a
factor of 0 point 2 inches could put it
up against the Galaxy Note line though
this slight increase could also turn
some users away who value one-handed
usability now we do know for certain
that the oneplus two will have a
fingerprint scanner 1 plus explains that
I quote on the oneplus two one quick tap
will take you right to the home screen
with the ability to store up to five
fingerprint profiles it's fast it's safe
and it's secure your smartphone is your
most personal device and its security
should be personal to the company has
also confirmed that the oneplus 2 will
come with a new Qualcomm Snapdragon 810
version 2.1 processor despite many
reports
mean that the original Snapdragon 810
runs too hot one plus assures us that
the new CPU will run cooler than ever
this also means that the device will
come with the perfectly capable adreno
430 GPU which is good news for the
gamers out there aside from the
snapdragon 810 version 2.1 the company
also says that the device will feature
four count them four gigabytes of LP
ddr4 ram which will bring faster loading
times smoother gameplay and a slew of
energy-saving features to the device 1
plus also recently held an ama on reddit
revealing a few notable specifications
for the device for starters the oneplus
2 will feature a big 3300 milliamp hour
battery which is nearly a ten percent
increase over the oneplus one unit now
thus far not a whole lot has been leaked
about the oneplus 2 s camera there are
some rumors floating around to hint at a
16 megapixel rear facing camera and a 5
or 8 megapixel front facing camera but
these rumors are backed up by little to
no viable evidence seeing as how the one
came with a 13 megapixel rear camera and
a 5-megapixel front shooter bumping each
Canberra up by a few megapixels would be
a natural progression for the upcoming
flagship now you shutter bugs can take
some comfort knowing that at that same
am a reddit they did state that the
oneplus camera would be a major focus
with no other details so sit tight the
oneplus one originally shipped with
cyanogenmod which is based off Android
4.4 KitKat although many consumers were
huge fans of the software there's
unfortunately no chance that the oneplus
2 will be shipped with signage motto s
back in April cyanogen + 1 + experience
an entirely overly dramatic breakup
which basically meant that the two
companies wouldn't be working together
in the future but not all is lost for
one plus on the software side 1 plus has
developed its own software dubbed oxygen
OS which brings a few nifty gestures
quick setting improvements and more of a
familiar vanilla Android look and feel
oxygen OS is available for download for
the oneplus one and will be the
operating system that powers the oneplus
2 now I know what you're thinking when
can i buy this puppy 1 plus has not been
shy when it comes to revealing price and
release date information
in late June the company announced that
the oneplus 2 will officially be
unveiled to the public Monday july
twenty seventh at seven pm on the
pricing front according to the oneplus
CEO Pete Lau the oneplus 2 will cost
less than four hundred and fifty dollars
us there was no mention of a specific
price point when the company announced
this information the other day so we're
unsure if their prices will be closer to
450 or 300 like the one plus one so what
do you guys think by or no by in my
experience with the oneplus one it was a
geeks dream phone it really was a
powerhouse for relatively cheap price
but there were some detractors out there
people who had real problems with the
hardware I want to hear from people who
had it loved it or hated love to read
your thoughts about that in the comments
