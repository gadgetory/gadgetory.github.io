tricks for the Samsung Galaxy s4
greetings s4 owners and owners to be I
am Chris look I know you're hungry for
some tips and tricks so let's get
started with number one the galaxy s4 is
already fast but if you're looking for
more speed we've got a few options first
if you don't like the slight pause
between hitting the HOME key and
actually seeing the home screen there is
a fix C tapping the home button twice as
a shortcut to s voice by default so it
waits a little bit for the second tap
now go to S voice settings and turn off
the open via the home key option now
you'll instantly get to the home screen
whenever you tap the button the second
is a bit more tricky first you want to
enable the developer options menu to do
this go to settings then more than about
device now find the build number and tap
this seven times yes seven now that the
developer options menu is open you can
go in and turn off window animation
scale transition animation scale an
animator duration scale now TouchWiz
should feel a bit faster
battery life is already nice on the
galaxy s4 but there are still a few
things you can do to stretch it out
which could be crucial for a long day
the first and easiest option is to turn
on power saving mode go to settings my
device and then power saving mode you
have three options you have CPU and
screen power saving and then the option
to turn off haptic feedback using all
three options will provide the best
results now if you want to save even
more battery life you can start turning
things off turning off mobile data will
help quite a bit and then it's kind of
up to you air gestures bluetooth sbeam
and NFC are a few options to start with
in the s4's notification drop-down
you've probably noticed the icons at the
top that allow you to do things from
changing the sound mode to turning Wi-Fi
on and off
chances are fairly good that you use
some of these more than others
so why not get them in an order that
works for you simply pull down the
notification pane then tap the upper
right most icon now tap the icon that
looks like a pencil you'll be able to
drag and drop the quick settings buttons
and put them in an order that puts your
most-used settings first the galaxy s4's
camera comes with more options than ever
although some are arguably more useful
than others still there are some steps
you can take to make sure you're taking
the best photos you can first you might
want to adjust the photo size and
settings by default the s4 is set to 9.6
megapixels with the 16 by 9 aspect ratio
for the best quality you can switch to
13 megapixels which uses the more
traditional 4:3 aspect ratio the other
settings like ISO and anti-shake are
worth exploring as well then you'll want
to pay more attention to the modes
you're using eraser and drama sha aren't
something you'll probably use too often
Auto might be your best bet but Beauty
face panorama sports night and rich tone
or HDR are all useful for the most part
you'll probably want to turn the flash
off as well while the s4 has a nice
display there are certain times where
you just want to see a photo video or
game on a larger screen and there are a
few ways to do it the first and easiest
if you have a Samsung TV or an All Share
cast dongle is to use the built-in
screen mirroring feature just turn it on
and wait for it to find your device the
second option is to use MHL now this is
the fastest option but you'll need an 11
pin NHL adaptor make sure you get the
right adapter because a standard 5 pin
MHL adapter won't work the final option
doesn't quite work the same way but it
does work as a last resort DLNA sharing
allows you to share from your s4 to
other DL
na capable clients like blu-ray players
tvs and other home electronics this
won't mirror your screen but it will let
you access your photos videos and music
with the s4 there are a few ways to
control who can get in touch with you
and when the first is blocking mode you
can find this option under settings than
my device it allows you to disable
notifications calls the LED indicator
and even alarms either all the time or
between set hours this is great if you
have friends or family who love to send
you late-night emails or even worse make
late night calls the second option is
better for dealing with specific numbers
to set up automatic call rejection head
to settings my device and then call the
easiest and probably most common way to
do this is to auto reject certain
numbers only just add numbers to your
list and they'll automatically be
rejected optionally you can also send
them an automated message telling them
why their call was rejected by default
the Galaxy s4's lockscreen is a little
on the boring side luckily it's easy to
spice it up by customizing it and adding
a few widgets head to Settings my device
then lock screen there are a lot of
options here you can put application
shortcuts or multiple widgets on the
lock screen and change whether you want
a clock or personal message once you've
enabled multiple widgets you can go to
the lock screen itself and either swipe
to the left to get to the camera on the
screen to the right side or head in the
opposite direction to add your own
widgets now you can check your email or
other messages right on the lock screen
yeah the s4 shoots some pretty nice
video out of the box but what if you
want to get a little more creative with
it two of the coolest options are fast
motion and slow motion video
you can enable these by opening the
camera app tapping the Settings icon and
then the icon that looks like a video
camera now you can switch between normal
limit for MMS slow and fast motion with
slow motion you can go from half speed
all the way down to one-eighth of normal
speed with fast motion you can go from
double speed to eight times normal speed
neither of these options will produce
video as clear as the normal mode but
they are still fun to play around with
to be honest I wasn't too sure about the
adapt sound feature until they tried it
out myself but after trying I had to
include it in this video go to my device
then sound and scroll all the way to the
bottom make sure to have your headphones
hand what adopt sound does is play a
series of tones to test your hearing and
to a certain extent your headphones just
start the test listen closely and answer
whether or not you heard the sound after
this process is over you'll have the
option to preview the newly adapted sad
for me the difference was noticeable
compared to the original sound the
adapted sound sounded clearer and more
detail
if you're like me and I know I am one of
the first things you do on any phone is
turn off auto brightness in this case
though there is actually a good reason
for using it at least occasionally users
have found that the s4 screen brightness
can go higher with auto brightness
turned on then you can manually set it
yourself it's probably done this way to
prevent damaging the screen still if
you're in bright sunlight and having
trouble seeing the screen try turning on
auto brightness to see if the screen
gets any brighter and that's it
hopefully at least a few of these tips
will help you get more usefulness and/or
enjoyment out of your s4 if you want a
little more detail we have an in-depth
