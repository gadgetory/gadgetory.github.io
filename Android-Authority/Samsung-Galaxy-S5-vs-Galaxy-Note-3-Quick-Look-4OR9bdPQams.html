by bitdefender mobile security you could
say that this is the Battle of two
different flag ships for the same exact
company eight stretch of a guard from
Android thority what's going on
everybody and this is the Samsung Galaxy
s5 versus the Galaxy Note 3 though we
are looking at two different sizes in
these phones we do see that the design
aesthetics are actually quite similar
between these two phones the note 3 does
feature the more angular design and the
very flat sides that the galaxy s5 has
adopted the bigger 5.1 inch display on
the galaxy s5 does increase its size
overall but it is still smaller than the
galaxy note 3 with its much larger 5.7
inch screen the galaxy note 3 introduced
a new material choice for Samsung as the
back was made of a faux leather a
textured plastic that did feel really
nice in the hand we have yet another
change in the Galaxy s5 with a soft
touch back that has a perforated design
now in the end which one is better for
you is going to be your opinion but I
think we can all agree that both of
these are a welcomed shift away from
glossy plastic one thing that the
Samsung Galaxy s5 can definitely boast
is its ip67 rating it is waterproof and
dustproof which means that it can take
the elements better than most
smartphones out there including the
Galaxy Note 3 when it comes to the
screens while we do have the same 1080p
resolution on both of these Super AMOLED
displays the difference in the size does
mean that the pixel density is different
on both but for the most part of the
text and reading experience on either
one should still be very great and
immediate consumption will be as well as
is expected from Super AMOLED display as
we do have vibrant colors perhaps
somewhat oversaturated great viewing
angles and in the end it's just a joy to
watch anything on either one of these
screens depending on which size you
prefer in terms of performance the
galaxy s5 does have the upgraded
processing package being the phone that
came out later the Galaxy Note 3 is
still incredibly smooth and fast and the
s5 is just about as good if not better
one thing that might be just a little
bit of a disappointment is that the
galaxy s5 only comes with 2 gigabytes of
RAM it despite the note 3 beginning the
trend of 3 gigabytes it doesn't look
like that was going to continue for the
s-line
in the hardware department we do have
two somewhat different philosophies as
the Galaxy Note 3
definitely comes with that s-pen the
stylus experience that is pretty much
one-of-a-kind in the smartphone space
when you compare it and all of its
additions that do make it onto the
galaxy s5 aside from the s-pen we find
that the galaxy s5 has a very feature
heavyset it does come with all of the
bits and pieces that originally made it
onto the s4 and the note 3 but now there
are new features like the fingerprint
scanner that is found underneath the
home button for a swipe down of any of
your fingers to unlock the phone and
also a heart rate monitor on the back
found just beneath the camera optics the
camera found in the samsung galaxy note
3 was a very good 13 megapixel shooter
that provided some pretty good shots and
some pretty good videos and was the
first to bring 4k recording to the
Samsung space however Samsung moved to a
16 megapixel ISO cell sensor in the
galaxy s5 that should be able to take
even better pictures with less noise
especially in low-light conditions
it does also bring 4k recording to the
fray as well but it is limited to only
five minutes of video due to the large
files it would create overall however
the app in the s5 has been overhauled a
little bit to provide a lot more
settings for your smartphone photography
hit that Settings button and you'll see
a lot of different toggles and settings
in order to really tweak what kind of
picture you want out of the camera
however the s5 camera should still be a
pretty big step up from the one found in
the note 3 not only in quality but also
in terms of options and finally when it
comes to software we were looking for a
bit of an update when it comes to the
TouchWiz UI found in the Samsung Galaxy
s5 unfortunately didn't quite get it
here but it may not be that big a deal
as touch with still performs very well
despite some of its enhancements and
maybe the need for an update that we are
still going to end up waiting for
however on the galaxy note 3 it does get
the enhancements provided to it by the
s-pen which allow it to have a very
great stylus experience that is somewhat
one-of-a-kind when you move to the
galaxy s5 however there's a bit of a
different philosophy as certain elements
like the my magazine UI have been moved
to the very left as a second screen and
some of the elements have been changed
to a flatter look and more circle
centric as you might see in a
notification drop-down so while there
are some changes in the TouchWiz UI from
the note 3 to the s5 they aren't really
all that overarching at all and so there
you have it
for the look at two flagship devices out
of Samsung's camp the Galaxy Note 3
definitely one of the more popular
devices out there right now as plenty
people love that large display and the S
Pen functionality is definitely
one-of-a-kind but the Galaxy s5 is
looking to really jump back in and make
the Galaxy S line the king again in
order to do that Samsung really put
everything into the phone except the
kitchen sink and we'll see if all those
features really put it over the top so
until we have our full comparison
including the comparison with the camera
stay tuned to Android authority for all
of the best coverage especially our
event coverage here at the Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona Spain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
