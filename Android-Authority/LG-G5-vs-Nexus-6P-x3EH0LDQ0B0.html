today we're taking a look at the LG g5
versus the Nexus 6p these days we're
seeing lots of smart phone companies
ditching plastic and moving to an
all-metal design and this year LG has
done exactly that with their all-metal
LG g5 but the g5 and Nexus 6 piece for
an all-metal design but even with the g5
being made from metal thanks to that
extra layer of primer coating the phone
feels a little plasticky and less
premium than the build of the 6p there's
also some questionable design features
with the g5 like the curving of the top
and bottom making the phone appear at
spent and also the sudden breaks along
the chamfered edges to make it look like
the paint is chipping when putting these
phones side by side the Nexus 6p
certainly stands out in terms of design
one of the biggest differences when it
comes to design is the size of these two
phones the Nexus 6p force of 5.7 inch
display while the g5 is much smaller at
5.3 which makes a 6p a full 10
millimeters taller and about three
millimeters wider so yeah the g5 is much
easier to handle slip into a pocket and
use one handed and another reason why
the 6p is much taller than the g5 is the
large bezels but there's a reason for
these large bezels and that is the
front-facing speakers there on the top
and bottom of the display making for a
great experience when watching videos
the speakers are aimed right at you and
you have this nice stereo effect on the
g5 your speakers on the bottom of the
phone where it can easily be covered up
and you don't get this nice stereo
effect but that being said the g5 gets
just as loud as a 6p although the
quality is not the greatest the back of
these stones are quite similar
now that LG has relocated the volume
buttons while leaving the power button
we have large black visors near the top
with a fingerprint scanner below now
unlike the 6p scanner the g5 fingerprint
scanner doubles as a power button
however the scanner works similarly to
the six PS where even if the screen is
off your fingerprint will still be red
the g5 fingerprint scanner is actually
than the six PS letting you reach the
home screen around half a second faster
every single time but due to this
superfast scanner that's also a power
button it can get frustrating because
sometimes you want to check your lock
screen to see your notifications and the
scanner will read your fingerprints
super fast taking you straight to the
home screen a good workaround for this
though is with the tap to wake and tap
to turn off feature that cannot be found
on the 6p some may think that the LG g5
isn't the prettiest of phones and even
though the Nexus 6p is a little
odd-looking itself with that large black
visor it's still the better looking of
the phones in my opinion however the
strange design choices of the g5 become
more forgivable once you remember that
this is a modular phone even with the g5
having an all-metal design you can still
take it apart in seconds to access
things like the battery which is a first
for a smartphone simply push the button
on the bottom left and pull the battery
out this allows for the swapping of
batteries so when your g5 dies you can
be back up and running within seconds on
the Nexus 6p
you'll have to be glued to a charger for
a while this creative feature isn't just
for battery swapping though it opens up
a whole new line of accessories which LG
calls friends including a camera module
that has physical controls and dials for
zoom and other features making it
similar to a DSLR the modular
capabilities of the LG g5 make it stand
out from not only the Nexus 6p but
really any phone on the market as of now
although you'll have to ask yourself how
often will you actually be using these
accessories like I said the Nexus 6p is
a much bigger phone mostly due to that
large 5.7 inch display it's one of the
best-looking displays on the market
right now with this AMOLED technology
and beautiful vibrant colors dark areas
of images look very nice with the pixels
turning off underneath creating true
blacks which leads to apps that take
advantage of this like night clocks or
battery saving dark themes it's also a
quad HD display which makes images in
text very sharp and with a punch up in
colors this definitely has the LG g5
display beat but that's not saying that
the g5 display isn't great though it's
also quad HD however it is smaller and
it's not AMOLED instead is an LCD IPS
panel due to the smaller screen size
this quad HD resolution does give
more pixels per inch but between the two
phones you probably won't even notice
the color temperature is much cooler on
the g5 but when comparing photos the 6p
definitely is the most preferable of
course with the g5 being about six
months younger than the 6p is going to
have a much better spec sheet this is
one of the fastest phones out right now
on paper and even in real world
performance we got the Snapdragon 820
versus your a10 Adreno 530 / Adreno 430
and four gigs of ram versus three gigs
the g5 always opens apps faster than the
Nexus 6p sometimes it's a split second
difference or sometimes even a full
second Geekbench give the g5 a nice
rating of 5132 while the 6p only
received four thousand two hundred and
fourteen and two twos benchmark had an
even bigger difference between the two
with 125 thousand on the g5 and only $69
6p when loading graphic intensive games
like asphalt 8 the g5 usually ends up
loading the game a good 5 seconds before
the 6p battery life on these phones is a
much different story however with the
Nexus 6 piece battery being much bigger
at three thousand four hundred and fifty
milliamp hours over the g5 s pretty tiny
2800 in the time I had with these phones
using both pretty moderately the g5
would usually die before the end of the
day with a few hours to go
while the Nexus 6p usually had just
enough juice to get me through the
entire day I was looking at about three
and a half hours of screen on time with
the LG g5 and four to four hours and 15
minutes with the Nexus 6p but like I
said before the g5 s battery is capable
of being removed and swapped with
another fully charged one which in some
ways is better than the 6p we do have
USB type-c charging ports on both phones
which is great because that means you'll
have fast charging on both fast data
transfer speeds and also the nice
reversible USB type-c cable
unfortunately though this will be the
only way to charge both of these phones
as wireless charging is unavailable in
both like all LG G phones you're going
to have access to a micro SD card slot
something that you don't have with the
6p so you'll be good with getting a
cheaper model of the g5 with low storage
space and buy cheap microSD cards for
storing pictures songs and movie
whereas with the 6p you'll have to spend
some extra money for that larger size
model although both phones are running
Android marshmallow 6.0.1 their
experiences are totally different the 6p
is running 100% stock Android which is
created and designed by Google this is a
experienced Google intended Android to
be following material design guidelines
and with the features they believe are
worth having and because of this
whenever Google releases a new version
of Android or even a small update the 6p
will be able to install that update
immediately the day it comes out LG g5
owners will have to wait a while until
their phones receive this update because
this version of Android marshmallow has
been heavily skinned with lots of
features added it behaves totally
different so it will take some more time
for LG to update their skin but that's
not saying that LG's version of Android
is worse than Google's stock version it
really all comes down to preference and
this year LG skin is actually much more
toned down and less cluttered overall
the softer experience definitely feels
much more complete with the 6p which is
going back to what I was saying with
Google's attention to detail the g5
icons may look a little old-fashioned to
some and the folder opening animation
comes from the middle of the screen
instead of where the actual folder is
located the settings menu makes it
harder to find things with this four
sections and yeah you don't have an app
drawer by default but you can get it
back with an updated version of the home
launcher sure these are just little
things and aren't going to be a
deal-breaker for most but the Nexus 6p
is main selling point is a stock Android
experience and it definitely is superior
here last year in our best of Android
camera comparison all of us voted and
named the Nexus 6p the best phone when
it comes to picture quality but this
year there may be a new winner LG is
always experimenting with their cameras
and this year is no different with the
g5 sporting three cameras one selfie
camera and two front-facing cameras with
one of them being a wide-angle lens
okay so first you'll notice that the LG
g5 s main camera is not as wide angled
as the six PS if you take a look at the
right side of the photos you'll notice
the stop sign and tree next to it where
both are gone on the g5 but of course
that's why we have the other camera with
a wide-angle lens which creates an
amazing photo but let's go back and
examine these shots now
with HDR off the LG g5 is always going
to take the better photo it's a much
more natural shot with better dynamic
range the 6p has a lot more contrast and
its colors are not as nice but once you
crank on HDR or HDR plus as it's called
in the 6p both photos become beautiful
HDR is a lot more subtle on the g5 where
the difference on the 6p is night and
day those colors just come to life and
the blue of the sky really comes through
more so than the g5 but still we have a
much more contrast the image with a
six-speed with the g5 you can actually
make out the details within the shadows
where the 6p just crushes them colors
are a lot deeper on the 6p while the g5
s are more bright and realistic exposure
seems to be better with the g5 as well
lots of time when HDR is on both cameras
there's also much more detail when
zooming in with the g5 thanks to this
extra megapixels but it's certainly up
to preference the wide-angle camera
although with this noticeable
downgrading quality creates stunning
images the LG g5 also has a full manual
mode something that the 6p does not have
but even without its manual controls the
g5 can get a lot closer to subjects in
the 6p overall the g5 is just a much
more fun camera to use however once we
get into lordly areas it loses some of
its fun with HDR off the g5 is a clear
winner with the spider image with much
better colors and less noise but when we
turn HDR on both phones the g5 creates
the same image while the 6p boosts up
his brightness really saturates colors
and gets rid of all that noise sure the
g5 can still create a sharper image and
you could probably end up editing it to
make it better than the 6p but right out
of the camera the Nexus 6p has a g5 beat
in this area the selfie camera is
another area where the 6p beats the g5
especially when HDR is on each the g5
struggles with dynamic range with the
front-facing camera while the 6p is
perfect but once we get to video the LG
g5 comes back as the winner the g5 has
optical image stabilization
unlike the 6p to create crazy smooth
playback colors are also a lot better
and the overall image is brighter the 6p
seems to crush the blacks way too much
the g5 does hunt around a lot for focus
though and just prone to this weird
glitch if you look closely you'll see
the
I hunt for focus every second or so but
not all g5s have this problem and it
only shows up sometimes you can also
record with the wide-angle lens which is
pretty cool so what's the better
smartphone this has really been a
back-and-forth type of comparison the LG
g5 will slaughter the Nexus 6p in one
area will help being destroyed by it in
another but a lot of the downsides to
the g5 are forgivable sure it's not the
best looking phone but that's because
it's modular and the battery is below
average but it's removable in some areas
the LG g5 is amazing and a leader among
other phones in the market but in other
areas it underperforms whereas the 6p in
almost every area is just pretty good
anything you throw out the 6p it'll
handle really well it's a very well
thought out phone with no huge downsides
but no huge upsides either there's
really no clear winner because it comes
down to preference
what is a user going to use a phone for
it all comes down to picking and
choosing what features will actually be
used although a big selling point of the
Nexus 6p is this low price of only
around 400 to 450 dollars whereas the LG
g5 starts at around 650 to 700 dollars
so what do you guys think we're very
interested to hear from you so please in

these two phones you prefer also if you
