what's going on everybody and we're
taking a look at the Samsung gear s 3
and comparing it to the one that came
before it the gear s2 now you're going
to notice in this video that I'm
focusing on the gear s3 classic and the
gear s2 the original one that doesn't
have the classical look now I keep using
the word classic because that's
basically where the gear s3 derived its
main look from the gear s2 original is
the only one in the gear s line that
actually looks the way that it does with
the somewhat more sporty ER look but of
course that means that we're taking a
look at a smooth rotating clicky bezel
when compared to the one that has the
ridges on it on the gear s3 classic up
front here now the look of these two
devices is quite different if you're
looking for something a little bit like
I said sporty-er also maybe a little bit
sleeker the gear s2 just might be the
device that you're looking for and it's
also a little bit more let's say
inconspicuous with its slightly smaller
design a 1.3 inch display on the gear s3
makes it just that little bit larger
than the gear s2 so that might be
something you need to consider and in
the gear s2 you have to use the
proprietary watch straps it's something
that might keep customization kind of at
a minimum when compared to the gear s2
classic and the two gear as three
devices because with those lugs on the
top and bottom you can use any 22
millimeter watch strap it really comes
down to how these two devices look in
which one you're really looking for
obviously there is the gear s2 classic
which is slightly smaller than the two
gear s3 is while retaining a very
similar look but as far as capabilities
go there's a lot that's still the same
between these two especially considering
the displays which are still Super
AMOLED displays only the always-on
display of the gear s3 will allow for
even more colors and more customization
from there however you also get LTE
connectivity on the gear s3 frontier
line which will allow for the watch to
be even more standalone because you can
then receive notifications and even take
calls which you can do on both of the
gear s threes using the speaker and
microphone combo we're actually not
expecting too much more battery life out
of the gear s3 mainly because it has a
larger cell yes but also more
capabilities including GPS and the
slightly larger screen the gear s2
has the NFC and MST support so you'll be
able to go to pretty much any pay
station at major retailers and be able
to pay using the built-in Samsung pay
the app ecosystems for both will remain
the same so even if you get new
applications in the gear s3 you will
still be able to use them on the gear s2
as well so there are some main changes
between these two devices but not so
much that you would have to put away or
replace your gear s2 if it's already
performing well and you don't need the
new features if you are in the market
for a new SmartWatch or even your first
one mainly it'll come down to the looks
of these two devices and the very few
features that actually put the gear s3
that much farther forward than the gear
s2 we have yet to hear really what the
main release date and price will be for
the gear s3 but right now the gear s2 is
still available and it will not be
replaced by the gear s3 when it is
released so you can take a look at both
of these devices not necessarily as one
over the other but as two in the same
line from the Samsung gear line keep it
tuned to Android authority for even more
about the gear s3 including more
comparisons and when we get our unit
we'll bring you our thoughts in a full
review stay tuned to Android authorities
