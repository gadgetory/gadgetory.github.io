thority and I'm hanging out at Lenovo
taking a look at the Lenovo tab 3 lineup
these are all extremely affordable
tablets that are going to be available
this year and they come in three
different sizes to suit your needs
there's a 10 inch version in 8 inch
version and a 7 inch version they don't
have the most amazing specs in the world
which is part of the reason why they're
so affordable but if you don't need
crazy top-of-the-line specs these might
be tablets worth considering they're all
made of plastic and are being powered by
MediaTek quad-core processors but the
most powerful one out of the bunch is
the 10 inch version which lenovo is
marketing as a good business tablet so
you're going to find apps like Microsoft
Excel PowerPoint Word and OneNote
pre-installed the 10 inch model also
comes with a large 7,000 milliamp hour
battery an IP 52 rating for dust and
splash protection and dual Dolby Atmos
speakers the Tab 7 is the cheapest one
out of the bunch and this one will get
you a 600 by 1024 resolution display one
gig of ram 8 gigs of internal storage
and a 34 50 milliamp hour battery the
tap 8 on the other hand has a 800 by
1280 display one gig of ram 16 gigs of
internal storage and a 40 to 90 milliamp
hour battery and it also come with Dolby
Atmos we're only getting one speaker
here versus the dual setup of the 10
inch version the software is Android
marshmallow with a few customizations
from Lenovo like a kid's mode and
customizable gesture features but
otherwise it's a mostly stock Android
experience availability starts in June
of this year with one $29.99 for the tap
three seven $99 for the Wi-Fi only eight
inch version or 149 with LTE and one
$99.99 for the Wi-Fi only 10 inch model
or 249 with LTE this has been a quick
first look of the Tab 3 lineup by Lenovo
