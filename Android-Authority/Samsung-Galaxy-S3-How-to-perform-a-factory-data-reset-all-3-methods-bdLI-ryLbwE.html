Youngberg coming at you from Android
Authority calm your number one source
for all things Android today I'm gonna
be showing you how to factory data reset
your Samsung Galaxy s3 now may need to
do this if you're possibly selling your
phone and you don't want your
information passed on to others or you
might want to send the phone back to the
factory for some warranty work and you
don't want them having your info
um just any reason you'd want to factory
data reset your phone there's many so
we'll take our t-mobile galaxy s3 here
in the first method we're going to use
is probably the most simple method we're
just gonna go ahead and unlock our phone
you can see we have all of our data on
there I have my music here and then our
media hub the widgets usual stuff the
apps I've downloaded and we're just want
to go into our settings and then we'll
scroll down do we see backup and reset
now on the backup and reset menu we're
gonna want to click factory data reset
and it gives us the prompt we will you
know be erasing all of our accounts off
of the phone and we're just going to be
resetting the device so we'll click
reset the device and delete all that's
all the personal information now mind
you the SD card is not going to be
formatted all of your pictures and music
or anything stored on the SD card will
still be there and you'll need to take
the SD card out for that info and data
to not be stored on the galaxy s3 so
this one's factory data reset and we're
gonna take our sprint version of the
galaxy s3 and show you another method
now now this method is a little bit more
technical but it is very useful we can
go into our dialer here and then from
our dialer we just type in the code star
two seven six seven star and then three
eight five five pound and it does the
factory format as you can see here after
a few seconds it will reboot please do
not touch any button so that's going to
reboot and perform a factory data reset
so both of our phones have booted into
the initial setup menu that's indicating
that we have performed a full factory
data reset on each of the phones I'll
take this opportunity to show you the
final step or the final process you can
use to factory data reset your phone
will move our t-mobile version out of
the way when you
sprint version now all this requires you
can do this from any menu in the phone
or any screen you just simply hold the
power button you're gonna want to turn
the device off and we'll wait for it to
fully shut down you're gonna want to
wait so the lights go all the way off
and you receive a final vibration
indicating the phone has shut down and
then we're gonna want to press a
combination of buttons to actually boot
the phone into its stock recovery mode
we're gonna be Wanna we're going to want
to press the power button the volume up
button and then the physical home button
and hold all three until we see a small
blue line of text up here then we'll let
go of the buttons and it will be in our
stock recovery mode so we're holding our
buttons now see we got our text there
and we let go we get our Samsung Galaxy
s3 logo there and now we will boot into
the stock recovery you see we get our
Andie there now we have our list of
options right here such as reboot system
now apply the update and we can also
wipe data/factory reset' so we're going
to want to use the power button to
select the actual text and we can use
our volume buttons to navigate
throughout so we'll select wipe
data/factory reset' we're going to want
to scroll down to yes and click delete
all user data you can see we're wiping
the data and formatting the data so
there's our methods you guys um this is
going to help you return your phone sell
it to someone else or just possibly work
some bugs out of your operating system
by outperforming the flash so I hope
this helped guys go ahead and try this
out if you need to and stay tuned with
