andrew authority and they're big they're
bulky but they protect your phone
today we're we taking a look at the best
of what OtterBox has to offer to protect
your Samsung Galaxy S 5 the differences
between them all and their pros and cons
to help you decide which one is right
for you the Samsung Galaxy s5 might be
dust and water resistant but the phone
isn't necessarily built like a tank but
what is built like a tank is the
OtterBox Defender arguably one of the
most well known cases from OtterBox and
if you want maximum protection from
pretty much anything the OtterBox
Defender is the case to get in order to
protect your s5 the OtterBox Defender is
comprised of two parts
there's the rubber outer casing to help
absorb any sort of shock from when you
might drop it in a plastic inner shell
comprised of two halves with a built-in
screen protector on the front
installation takes a little bit of time
but that's to be expected with the case
like this you first start off by
inserting your Galaxy s5 into the back
piece and don't worry about scratching
up your phone as there is a soft foam
lining on the inside to prevent any
damage place on the front piece and go
around making sure the two pieces are
securely snapped together once that is
done all that's left is to slip the
phone into the rubber casing and you'll
want to go around the lip of the case
and press down any parts that are loose
until it's all firmly connected if
you've ever owned an otterbox defender
before you'll know that this is quite a
hefty case and on the s5 it's no
exception but the defender has always
been about function over for more than
anything else the case fits extremely
well and all the cutouts for the sensors
ports speakers and camera are nice and
large so there's no issues with anything
being obstructed the camera is also now
recessed protecting it from getting
scratched up the power and volume keys
are covered but they're still very nice
and easy to press and the built-in
screen protector on the front sits very
flush with the screen of the phone and I
haven't noticed any issues with touch
screen sensitivity if you're wondering
about the home button it does make it
completely flush but it's still very
easy to press and there's no problems
with using the fingerprint scanner
either there's also an additional third
piece that serves as a belt clip and
doubles as a kickstand for propping up
your phone for viewing media all in all
the otterbox defender is one of the best
OtterBox is out there in terms of
protection and it's the only one that
comes with a belt clip slash kickstand
it does cost a pretty penny at $60
directly through OtterBox but you can
find it for a little bit cheaper through
third-party retailers like Amazon and if
you're a clumsy person you happen to
drop your phone a lot this might be
worth the investment to protect your
$650 phone next up is the OtterBox
Commuter in this case is not quite as
big and bulky as the defender but it
will still offer great drop protection
and is also a heck of a lot easier to
install it's comprised of two parts with
a soft silicone shell on the inside and
a hard plastic shell on the outside
installation is very simple just slip
the s5 into the silicone piece and then
line up the plastic shell with the ports
and grooves and press it on firmly to
complete the installation once it's on
the phone the case fits very nice and
snug and again there's no issues with
any of the cutouts on the buttons and
ports they're all very large and lined
up well and the volume power keys are
still very easy to press there's also a
pretty nicely sized lip on the front to
help protect your screen again this case
is not as bulky as the defender but it's
still going to protect your phone from
virtually any drop there's no built-in
screen protector but OtterBox does
include a screen protector in the box
that you can apply separately if you
really want to this case cost between
forty to forty five dollars depending on
which color you pick and is a great
option if you want that OtterBox
protection without adding a crazy amount
of bulk to your phone case number three
is the commuter wallet which is
essentially the commuter but with an
extra trick up its sleeve
just like the regular commuter it's a
two-piece case a silicon piece on the
inside with a hard shell on the outside
installation is just as simple and easy
as the regular commuter just slip the
silicon piece on first followed by the
outer plastic shell again there's no
problems with fitment on this case
either it fits just as well as the
regular commuter all the buttons and
ports line up well and the power and
volume keys are still easy to press now
you'll notice right away that it's not
quite as slim as the regular commuter
and
is because the back piece slides out
giving you a place to store your license
and credit cards hence the name wallet
this case retails for $45 and is a great
concept if you're the type of person
that doesn't like carrying a lot of
stuff around and you want to consolidate
your phone and wallet into one taking
away an additional item that you'd
normally have to carry and at the same
time you're not sacrificing any
protection if anything you're probably
getting a little bit more protection due
to the added thickness just be careful
with this case because if you lose your
phone you lose your wallet too
our fourth case is the OtterBox symmetry
and out of all the other boxes this is
probably the slimmest and easiest case
to install that you can find from
OtterBox
the case is made of silicone around the
buttons and front lip and the back is
made of hard plastic but unlike other
OtterBox cases this one is comprised of
a single piece it's basically the
Commuter case but with two materials
being fused into one if you want to
think of it that way the phone slides
right into the case with not much effort
at all and while it is thin for an
otterbox it's still pretty meaty with a
thick lip on the front and the camera is
still nicely recessed on the back the
bottom portion of the phone is partially
exposed so the drop protection might not
be quite as good so that's just
something to take note of with this case
especially if protection is your number
one priority but it should still hold up
pretty well against the average drop the
OtterBox symmetry retails between forty
to forty five dollars and if you want an
Otterbox case that's very easy to
install and offers a decent amount of
protection that won't turn your phone
into a complete brick this case might be
the one for you the fifth and final case
is the otterbox preserver the galaxy s5
is already dust and water resistant but
on top of giving your phone protection
the preserver makes your s5 even more
water and dust resistant if that's
actually possible it's very similar to
the defender in terms of its bulk the
foam cushioning on the inside and a
built-in screen protector giving you 360
degrees of protection from even the most
brutal drops installation is fairly easy
and quick you first start by slipping
your Galaxy s5 into the front piece and
then carefully place on the back piece
making sure these sides and corners are
firmly snapped into place the removal
process
however is a little bit cumbersome
requiring you to use the included tool
to help you pry out the corners you can
use your hands to pry it off if you want
but trust me you're better off just
using the tool in order for this case to
be waterproof there are flaps on both
the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and
the microUSB port
but I do notice the flap on the s5
itself is pretty much impossible to
reach with this case on meaning either
have to use something to pry the flap
open or take off the case at night just
to charge your phone just like the
defender the preserver turns the s5 into
a tank of a phone but this is for people
who want maximum protection and don't
mind the added bulk overall this case
fits extremely well the only other
problem I've had with the preserver is
the buttons are a little bit stiffer and
harder to press in comparison to some of
the other outer boxes that could change
over time as the case gets broken in but
it's something to keep in mind if you do
decide to get this case OtterBox claims
that this case is waterproof up to six
and a half feet for up to thirty minutes
so this is a perfect choice if you want
to take a deeper swim with your Galaxy
s5 but for a price of forty to forty
five dollars I would like to see
OtterBox fix the problem with these
stiff buttons and be very hard to reach
microUSB port and so there you have it
for this OtterBox roundup for the
Samsung Galaxy s5 hopefully this video
gave you a better idea as to the
differences between all these cases and
their pros and cons obviously some of
these cases are a little bit thicker and
bulkier but offer a lot more protection
and some of these cases are slimmer at
the expense of offering less protection
but hopefully this video helped you
decide which one might be the best for
you but that is it for this video
