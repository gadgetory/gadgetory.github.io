versus jellybean hey it's Josh a regard
for manager at 30 what's going on
everybody and this is the Samsung Galaxy
s4 versus the Samsung Galaxy s4 Google
Play edition all right so we're
basically going to coast through many of
the different aspects of this review as
the GPE
is more quite literally the same phone
from top to bottom from design to
battery as the original Galaxy s4 if
somehow you still don't know much about
the s4 after all the coverage we have on
Android authority feel free to check out
my full reviews links are in the
description below as far as design goes
you have the very same device that makes
handling a 5-inch screen about as easy
as it can get the same button layout and
the same plastic body throughout I will
admit that for the s4 in general I
personally like it in white both phones
bring Samsung's signature Super AMOLED
display capable of 1080p resolution and
441 PPI they're highly saturated on the
original s4 you can customize the
general motif Android 4.2 though looks
absolutely gorgeous on this screen the
performance aspect is handled in both by
the Snapdragon 600 clocked in at 1.9
gigahertz and backed by the audrina 320
and two gigabytes of RAM while the
overall more stripped-down GPE should
yield somewhat smoother and faster speed
over the jam-packed TouchWiz the general
experience is fluid and easy either way
you still get the same removable battery
and microSD card slots between these two
allowing for the expansion of power or
the built-in 16 or 32 gigabytes of
storage only 16 gigabytes are available
in the GPE though all of the sensors and
the IR blaster make returns in the
google fight version but as you'll see
in the software section the story is
different for the GPE battery life is
overall the same as these 2600 milliamp
hour battery found in either device
offers a full busy day of work it is
worth mentioning that you lose all the
power saving features from the original
s4 s touch with settings if you relied
on them to eke out that last bit of
power they are not available in the
Google Play edition so we get to the
main areas of difference starting with
the camera the 13 megapixel shooter in
the original s4 was very well received
as it provided good detail in pictures
and brought a level of vibrancy to every
photo the app is what changes the most
as the original TouchWiz app with all of
its modes and settings brought tons of
options into smartphone photography it's
a different story in the GPE as you get
the stock Android camera app that loses
everything from eraser mode to drama
mode to the dual recording instead you
get a different interface that uses
touch and swipe arch menus that do make
sense for touchscreens
it's an unobtrusive interface that also
brings HDR some scene modes and of
course the photosphere but it doesn't
look like the modes or all that you lost
in the transition from the original s4
in taking some reference shots it looks
like the original s4 our software helped
bring sharpness to pictures it was an
uncharacteristically cloudy summer day
in Southern California today but you can
still see the detail in either photo
zoomed out it doesn't look so bad but
once you zoom closer you see that level
of sharpness that was lost low-light
performance remains largely the same
though you can kind of see a little bit
more saturation in the original s4 I
took a flash shot for posterity but it
served as a final example about how the
original s4 software did help with the
sharpness so it looks like you lose a
little more than just the modes in this
transition all things considered the
pictures you get either way look good
it's just when you zoom in that you get
a better idea of what you're getting it
comes down to whether or not you want
all those extras and modes as the stock
camera app in Android is good-looking
and just gives you the bare essentials
and finally the crux of this comparison
the software I'm already seeing in the
comments for the GPE full review that
the software part is a little polarizing
on the one hand we love our stock
Android because it doesn't try too hard
and manages to look great in the process
but when you pit it against the
full-featured TouchWiz of the original
s4 some people think jelly bean is
overly simplistic both are good points
depending on where you stand now Samsung
packed at the s4 with a ton of extras
right down to the way you navigate the
sensors for air and hand gestures are
just a couple examples and then you have
s health and wot on apps while you might
not use everything all the time there
may be those few instances like in my
case when they did come in handy some
people might get overwhelmed seeing all
of the extras which may be where the GPE
comes in yes stock Android jelly bean is
very stripped-down it doesn't take
advantage of all of the various sensors
and hardware editions or Samsung
originally put in you get
homescreens original notification
drop-down with the shade for settings
and google now i understand those out
there who think that it is a waste with
all the potential that the s4 does
provide on the app side it is possible
to replicate what the original brought
to the table
s health can be replaced with other
health apps and I'm sure there are some
watchon equivalents all those gestures
and new ways of navigating are left by
the wayside unfortunately maybe in the
future developers will make apps that do
use those sensors but right now that
just isn't the case in the end jelly
bean on the s4 is given a boost by the
hardware just not all of it
it's elegant simple and easy to use but
it might be too simple for some all that
loss potential makes the price hard to
handle for some the Google Play edition
of the Samsung Galaxy s4 is around the
same price as the original was upon
release $649 which is about the top cap
for the original s4 nowadays and so
there you have it the Samsung Galaxy s4
was given a refreshing new look and feel
with this change to Android 4.2 it's
worth it to mention that even though the
GPS should be getting updates faster
than the originals they still might not
be as fast as the Nexus devices still
you get some benefit from having a stock
Android experience maybe if you thought
the s4 was too much this will be just
the right simplistic fit if you look to
stock Android and wish for more the
original s4 is there for the taking or
if you feel stuck with the original s4
this google play edition gives you an
example of what stock or even custom
Android might be like on it so in the
