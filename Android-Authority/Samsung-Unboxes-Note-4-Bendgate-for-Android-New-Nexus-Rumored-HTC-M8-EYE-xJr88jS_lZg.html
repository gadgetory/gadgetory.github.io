is Jason in this past week we got some
serious goodies for you one Samsung does
its own unboxing of the Nexus 4 we got
some news on a new Nexus device named
Shamu and finally how would Android
phones fare in Bend date now by now many
of you will have heard about bendgate
Ben gate was the scandal that was
started by my fellow Torontonian at
unbox therapy he wanted to see just how
far he could push the iPhone six-plus
before it bent it turned out it didn't
take that much force at all at least
according to him now some of you as
Android enthusiasts are gonna want to
know hey how would my favorite Android
flagship phone fare under a similar test
well it's no real scandal until Consumer
Reports weighs in and weighed in they
have at approximately 80 pounds
Consumer Reports used a standard three
point test to see how much force the
phones could withstand until the show
permanent damage the test started at 60
pounds of force and continued in ten
pound increments until permanent damage
occurred the devices in the test group
were the HTC One m8 the LG g3 and the
galaxy note 3 and three iPhones the
iPhone 5 6 and 6 plus to get an idea of
the kind of force we're talking about
Consumer Reports says it takes 80 pounds
of force to break four pencils at once a
feat that for many people will be very
difficult well as you can see here
although that the iPhones did not do
very well the HTC m8 did the worst with
the Galaxy Note 3 doing the very best so
what is really going on here is this
just an effort by unbox therapy to make
Apple look bad probably not he put up a
second video a couple days later doing
the same test with the same results all
in one shot with witnesses right here in
Toronto at Yonge and Dundas and but it
doesn't explain while Consumer Reports
had a very different result under a
similar test but my uneducated I would
notice that in unbox therapy he used two
thumbs to try and bend the phone where
as Consumer Reports had that one point
test pressing down in the middle of the
phone that may or may not made a
difference in the test results but
clearly there's a discrepancy so what
does that mean for Android phones it
means that Samsung's Galaxy Note series
is a tank of a phone and HTC needs to
work on the m8 Wow well there's a first
time for everything and it turns out
that Samsung has released its own
unboxing of the Galaxy Note 4 and it
looks like this this is the first
unboxing of the Galaxy Note 4 and gives
us a closer look at what to expect keep
in mind that the video shows off the
Korean model which arrived later last
week and ahead of schedule that means
that the boxing materials may not be
exactly the same as you'll find in your
own market and it is also a video that's
in Korean though there are English
subtitles looking for more details on
the Galaxy Note 4 check out our original
IFA announcement as well as our hands-on
look at the latest note 4 now if you're
lusting for the note 4 but you're not in
South Korea for the official release
don't worry because by the end of
October the note 4 will be released to a
hundred and forty countries so we've
received rumors about the HTC m8 I which
to be blunt on surface looks just like
the HTC m8 but with a 13 megapixel
camera like it should have had in the
first place the m8 I upgrades the One m8
to a 13 megapixel dual camera sensor but
it does not appear that the HTC's ultra
pixel technology is coming along for the
ride
immediate response to the HTC One m8
four megapixel shooter was somewhat
negative but many were surprised by the
end result of the images as the ultra
pixel technology meant larger pixels
that captured more light resulting in
greater image quality in low-light
conditions if the final rumors are to be
believed the HTC m8 I will only be
headed to India and China it will run
Android 4.4 KitKat and we'll have HTC
Sense 6 skin on top last week many of
you were asking for information on the
next Nexus device and it looks like we
have it Shamu and it's a
massive phablet first we've learned that
the handset will look very similar to
the Moto X only much larger second the
handset is said to have a massive 5.9
two inch qHD display with 498 pixels per
inch as Snapdragon 805 CPU with three
gigabytes of RAM 32 gigabytes of storage
a 13 megapixel rear-facing camera a 2
megapixel front-facing camera and has
3200 milliamp hour battery as you can
see it shows off the allegedly massive
Motorola handset next to the LG g3 one
thing you'll notice is that the Motorola
M branding is present on this device and
there doesn't appear to be any Nexus
labeling on it unless the logo is super
tiny and then the piece of paper with
the word Shenmue written on it but we
somehow doubt that that means that so
this means that either the Nexus
branding won't appear on the device or
this device is not a Nexus device at all
phablet lovers are gonna cry oh right
thanks for watching android army my name
is Jace love to connect with you right
here on Google+ or Twitter you want to
forget about my brothers in Android jaws
Joan the tech ninja Kevin lawn and Chris
all working really hard to deliver the
best content on the web
