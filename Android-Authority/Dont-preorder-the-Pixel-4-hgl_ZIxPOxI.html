think we're good don't buy a pixel for
it launch
so some history about me I'm a Google
fanboy
I've bought or pre-ordered pretty much
every Google phone way back when the
Nexus phones were coming out except for
the Nexus 4 because I forget what
carrier was on but it wasn't mine even
when I jumped shipped to a Samsung or an
iPhone I always just found my way back
to a Google phone for some reason I
pre-ordered the og pixel I pre-ordered
the pixel - I even pre-ordered the pixel
3 even though I told myself I wasn't
going to but now for sure I know I'm not
pre-ordering the pixel 4 and I don't
think you should either
ok so I'll start with one of the more
unimportant reasons which is that
there's no more incentives to preorder
or I guess I should say there's no more
good incentives so if the og pixel
anyone that pre-ordered got a daydream
headset thrown in which was awesome it
was a great way to show off a new
platform to the core fan base or the
nerds that we're probably gonna be most
excited about it anyway I mean I still
use this thing then if you pre-ordered
the pixel - you got a free Google home
Mini thrown in which is again another
way to show off a new platform to the
early adopters and it just felt like a
nice nod to the fans the people that
were pre-ordering the Google phones so
what did you get when you pre-ordered a
pixel 3 a $50 gift card
yeah now I should say that they don't
have to give you anything I don't want
to sound like a crybaby I still think
it's pretty cool that they gave enough
money to pick up one of their cool cases
their cold cases safe or a screen
protector or any other kind of useful
phone accessory that I wouldn't have
otherwise purchased because it was too
expensive so it was cool that they did
that but it just felt to me like they
kind of gave up like when you're going
to someone's birthday party and you have
no idea what they like or anything about
them what do you give them a gift card
with the first two pixels that wasn't
the case it felt like they knew who
their core audience was and now maybe
because it's a pixel three's ago in
mainstream it doesn't feel that way
anymore so the second reason why you
shouldn't get a pixel for at launch is
probably the most important reason and
that's the deals so right after the
pixel 3 was announced aka right after
the loyalists pre-ordered ours and
started receiving them Google went ham
with the promos and I mean right after
like within the month everywhere you
look there was $50 off $100 off $200 off
and one that really ticked me off was a
buy one get one half deal that was
short-lived but I could have done that
there was sales for people switching to
Google Phi sales for Black Friday early
holiday sales sales if your grandmother
was left-handed there were just a bunch
of sales and not to sound like a whiny
brat but as someone that pre-ordered it
left a bitter taste in my mouth because
here I was walking around with a brand
new phone that I should have been happy
and grateful for and instead I felt like
I got ripped off because everywhere I
looked there were deals that showed if I
had just waited two more weeks I could
have saved 300 bucks in short I just
felt kind of taken advantage of and I
gladly would have waited another month
in order to get that extra 50 or $100
back in my bank account so unless you
have money to burn and you really don't
care you should probably wait a couple
weeks before getting the pixel for so
the last reason you might not want to
order a pic so far at launch might not
apply to everyone which is why I left it
for last but that's because the pixel 3
exists now the a series of pixel phones
is a thing now and it's still unclear if
Google is going to release a pixel for a
but I'm willing to bet they are by how
hard their marketing this pixel 3 a
speaking for myself I probably
wouldn't have rushed out to get the pic
so three had I known that I could get
the pic so 3a if I would have just
waited a couple months so the 4a will
likely skimp out on some of the higher
and more premium features in the same
way that the 3a doesn't have the
waterproofing or the wireless charging
of the three but man for $400 you get
the same amount of RAM the same camera
and and you get a headphone jack worth
it honestly as someone who spends most
of his time here working on our sibling
site sound guys reviewing headphones
this makes it totally worth it so I
don't have to deal with garbage dongles
or the trash pixel bits which yes I also
bought with my own money because I have
no self control basically if I could
count on a sub 500 pixel for a that has
80% of the features of the pixel for I'm
entirely sold and that pretty much does
it for me guys thanks for watching let
me know down in the comments while your
going to be pre-ordering the pixel 4 or
if you think it's a good idea to wait a
bit or if you're just not gonna order it
at all I'm interested to see what you
guys think as always subscribe to the
