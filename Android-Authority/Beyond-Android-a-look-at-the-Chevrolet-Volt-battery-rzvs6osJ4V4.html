which while it is a technology story in
electrification it's also a bit of a
electrification story relative to the
community and the engineering community
when you think of all the different
things that we're really doing here
while we work with our cell partner LG
Chem on cells and cell technology we put
those together in a battery pack that's
been designed here in inside General
Motors and built here in Brownstown
Michigan which is then sent up to our
Detroit Hamtramck vehicle assembly plant
where the Volt is assembled we also get
our drive unit which is an all new
design from our warren transmission
plant so while we're electrifying the
industry for consumers in many ways
we're also electrifying the industry
relative to where we do the work and
where we build the products I mean
Detroit has such a rich legacy history I
mean some of the world's first vehicles
remain here you know and so much of the
industry is based around vehicle
manufacturing in a vehicle like this
what is the total weight of this year
where total weight here we're in the
3800 75 pound and has the class and how
much of that is battery what all way to
the battery the weight of the batteries
in kilograms is 187 miles like
pounds a large amount yes and the range
on this vehicle this vehicle go fifty
miles on a church do you want to chart
and then of course it has a unleaded
gasoline engine as well yes a regular
gasoline our smartphones obviously
lithium ion lithium polymer in some
cases for more curved designs our Mac
books are laptops you know this all live
him but only getting 500 cells before we
see significant degradation in terms of
lifespan so I had overheard the engineer
discuss 6,000 cycles before things
starts to degrade can you talk a little
bit more about that sure well what Bill
wall is our battery director said was
that while cell phones are set up with a
you know a certain set of requirements
what we use for an electric vehicle is
very different cell phone what do you
think about it one of the most important
things is sighs okay sighs today is very
important while size is important also
in the Volt but but we actually have
more room to work with yeah so we work
with our cell supplier LG Chem again to
get more like six thousand cycles before
we see a significant degradation and and
that's just very important because
consumers want something they know is
going to last something I've always
wondered about is why can't we have
electric vehicles with a thousand or
1500 mile range what is it is it just
the sheer size of the batteries and the
weight pretty much the sheer size of the
batteries just like we were talking
about before in your cell phone right
yeah it can be needs to be very small in
your car it can be larger but it can't
be as large as the entire car I mean
we're always looking at things from a
mobile technology standpoint so what
kind of adaptations have been made here
you with the console and everything like
is there Android auto enabled within it
and so our car has both Android auto and
apple carplay in it so whether you're an
Apple user an Android user you should be
able to link your phone in and its
are you guys going to be making any apps
available so that people can see
diagnostic information or kind of stuff
you know still talk a little bit more
about the mobile more to come
more to come future on apps all right
well once a big thanks to you for your
time sir Gnomeo pleasure talking with
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
