the same that's been around for a long
time and whilst oneplus hasn't been
around for nearly as long I still feel
like it reflects the oneplus 7 perfectly
hey guys money's ryan thomas with
android authority and this is the review
of the one plus seven it's no secret
that the US isn't getting the standard
variant of the one plus seven that's a
real shame but at the same time it's not
as exciting or as flashy as the pro
model so it's not that big of a loss
and speaking of less flashy it does
remind me a lot of the 60 in in many
areas as matter of fact is pretty much
identical to the 60 in almost every way
apart from a few color options like this
shiny mirror gray and as a Red Baron
although actually that Red Baron is only
available in China and India it's a
shame we haven't got thunder purple this
time around that was a really cool color
but maybe we'll see some more being
released during the year new things in
the sevens design include a taller
camera bump a shorter meat toggle switch
a larger earpiece grille and a faster
and larger fingerprint scanner we still
don't get the standard ip68 water and
dust resistance or any kind of weather
resistance
which is a bit of a shame although there
have been claims in past years about
these phones having some kind of
unofficial weather proofing so take that
with a pinch of salt but we might still
have that here as I said a lot of the
visual cues are still here from the 16
loading that water droplet notch and the
selfie camera hidden inside it the six
point four one inch optic AMOLED display
is very similar actually almost
identical to that of the sixteen that's
not a bad thing at all it gets nice and
bright outdoors easily as bright as a
seven pro and its colors are a little
bit muted out the box but this is easily
remedied by going into the settings and
selecting other options sure the 60
Hertz refresh rate won't knock your
socks off and the nuts does leave the
device weakness slightly outdated but
it's a great display either way a
terrific improvement that's been made in
the 7 over the 60 is its audio setup now
yeah we still don't have the headphone
port and that is a shame but we do get
that really large audio grille at the
top which is actually there because we
have a hybrid stereo speaker setup now
though they're not going to be as good
as something like from the 2 XL or the 3
XL but what you're going to get is
significantly clearer and better sound
than the previous model this also
softens the blow because we don't have a
headphone port
neither do we have a dongle in the box
let's talk about cameras probably the
biggest letdown from the company a
couple of years ago has become one of
their strong points the 48 megapixel
rear camera on papers pretty good since
it uses the increasingly common Sony
AMX five six three sensor and an F 1.7
optically stabilized lens it's actually
the same main sensor that's found in the
seven pro but instead of extra focal
lengths we get a 5 megapixel depth
sensor but what does this all translate
to well some pretty great images in
pretty much all conditions images have
some character for contrast some solid
dynamic range and somewhat bright colors
and more than adequate sharpness
portrait mode is an improvement over
last year's model although edge
detection still lacks that kind of
convincing realism low-light shots using
both standard and nightscape look great
and not the best in class but even so I
really did like the low-light images
coming from this phone selfies aren't
bad either they certainly get beaten by
many of the competitors due to the lack
of overall sharpness portrait mode on
selfie mode is good as well where the
edge detection is just not quite as good
we get a nice array of video shooting
modes including UHD 4k at 60 frames per
second and high frame rate video at 480
frames per second to the optical image
stabilization keeps footage looking
smooth even if it's not quite as smooth
as say a pixel 3 a go beyond speed is
this phone's mantra and you'll certainly
be doing that with the oneplus 7 the
snapdragon 855 the quip device comes
with either 6k RAM and 128 goo storage
or 8 gig of ram and 256 gigs of storage
combine this pretty awesome spec sheet
with oxygen OS running the latest
version of Android and you're laughing
performance than anything from social
media to split-screen multitasking to
playing any games it's all just an
absolute breeze for this device and we'd
expect that since past oneplus devices
have been so good in the performance
Department a couple of things to note
this thing uses ufs 3.0 storage which is
really really quick in is one of the
reasons why
phone fields as fast as it does but on
the flip side it's not gonna feel as
fast as the pro model since the display
is lot of def 60 Hertz I'll show the
rest has brought some noticeable changes
this on Iran including Zen mode which
can locks you out of your phone for a
set period of time to keep your mind
free of distractions
another inclusion is gaming mode which
will minimize background tasks to free
up resources of the phone for the game
you're playing just so that you can kind
of maintain higher frame rates fnatic
Road within this will block
notifications and calls and also if
you've got a second sim in in that
second slim slot it will disable that so
that kind of more of the processing
power is going towards that first sim if
you're on a fortune connection if
oneplus does track record is anything to
go by then we're gonna have updates for
at least a number two years if not three
years although oneplus has a promise for
two years
in my week that I had the device I found
the battery life to be pretty average
it's not amazing but it's not bad
it has a thirty seven hundred million
power battery and I'll say two right off
the bat that I wish it was four thousand
we did see an increase when going from
the 1 + 6 to the 1 plus 60 and I believe
that we should have seen an improvement
going from the 60 to the 7 as well even
a small difference would have made a big
difference overall for some context I
find the battery life to be a little bit
better than the 60 maybe that's down to
software maybe that stands to the new
system on the chip however it's still
not what I'd consider a definite all-day
battery it's gonna get most of us
through a full day absolutely fine but
some people will manage to get it down
to zero percent by the end of the day
having - charge return here is a little
bit bittersweet because you you were
able to make the battery last a full day
just by topping up for 10 minutes at
lunch time that's brilliant
however it's not walk the charge which
is what we found with the 7 Pro what we
found is walk charge is noticeably
faster than that charge and it would
have been nice to see it on the 7 Series
instead of just a 7 pro for 499 pounds
or 549 euros it's a far cry from the
company's past flagship killers but
since it's half of what the big guys are
doing I won't hate on the pricing too
much alternatives in this price range
include the Xiaomi me 9 with its ex
four cameras extra focal lengths by
extension and the zenfone 6 for its
unique design and massive battery of
course shammies read me Kate when he
pros also another big flagship killer
that's kind of stealing the crown from
oneplus and and that's hopefully going
to become the apocrypha f2 so if you're
interested in something that's going to
be cheaper and is gonna have similar
performance then maybe wait around for
that conclusion time and that really
does bring us back to the tagline of
this video the 7 is a much faster
cleaner and more refined version of the
16 and that's by no means bad 499 pounds
it's definitely not a flagship killer
anymore and is kind of up there with the
flagships I'd happily recommend the
oneplus 7 to someone looking for one of
the fastest phones to be released this
year and one that's hopefully gonna get
software updates for a long time sure
it's not new and exciting and it hasn't
got that kind of wow factor that the 1
plus 7 pro has but like the tagline
suggests if it ain't broke don't fix at
the 60 was a fantastic device and the 7
is just an extension of that
is it worth buying over the zenfone 6 or
the Shamy mean line that's a question
we'd like to ask you and also since we
have the devices here would you like to
see a 3-way comparison between them
