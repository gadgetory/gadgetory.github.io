handy the Android authority app guy and
in this quick video we're going to take
a look at the best Android weather apps
when weather is a weather application
that has it all you can check various
forecast information use widgets and the
application itself is well designed
there's also support for Android wear -
clock daydream mode and a whole lot more
AccuWeather is a simple weather
application that gives you all of the
basic features including extended
forecast hourly forecast widget support
and more it's well designed and easy to
use and it's a trusted source of weather
look Google now is built right into most
Android devices and it does a pretty
decent job as a weather application you
can ask for the weather and it'll show
you periodic updates and alerts if need
be it's not fully featured but it's good
enough for most people though weather is
one of the most popular and solid
options for weather apps it gives you

also plenty of themes to give you a more
customized look insta weather for
Android wear is a great weather
application for your Android wear

watch faces along with weather
functionality a lot of applications have
wear support but this is one of the few
that's made specifically for Android
wear radar now is a unique weather
application that gets its weather data
directly from the National Weather
Service servers and gives you the raw
feed there's a free version and a paid
version and even some cursory weather
forecast features weather bug was one of
the first fully featured weather
applications on Android and it's still
around today it's now totally free with
no paid version anymore and still has
all the features you would want in a
weather app everyone knows about the
Weather Channel and that means you
probably know about their application as
well it does get a little clogged with
useless crap like endpoints but those
can be turned off overall it's a solid
weather application weather pro is a
simple weather application with a lot of
features the design is a bit old but
it's not overly bad there's a part where
you can track vacation destinations and
it even supports global weather
monitoring Yahoo weather is a solid
option thanks to ya who's aggressive
redesign of their applications it has
the basic features a fun beautiful
design and support for tracking the
weather in up to 20 cities at once and
it's totally free to use your window

with a unique sliding hourly weather
forecast along with the basic features
like forecasts and alerts it's a fun
application especially on tablets and
it's definitely good-looking

video the video likely won't be updated
again but the article almost certainly
will so check back there every now and
