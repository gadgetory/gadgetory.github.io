authority and one of the main ways we
interact with our smartphones of course
is by its display and there are
different types of display technology
that exist today that are chosen by
different manufacturers because they
have different advantages and
disadvantage you may have heard of
AMOLED you may have heard of IPS LCD
then of course we've got infinity
display and Super AMOLED and super LCD
and infinity display and retina hate
lead II and there's all these different
things so what are they and which one's
the best well let me explain first of
all let's cut through all the marketing
there are these different types of
displays that people and manufacturers
talk about Super AMOLED and retina and
infinity and there's basically two types
of display there's led based displays
and there's LCD based displays now an
LED display is as you find in AMOLED is
the LED part starts for light emitting
diode just like you get on that little
red light you get a little TV that tells
you whether your TV is on or off that's
basically an LED now in an AMOLED
display they are reduced down to very
very very small sizes and there are red
LEDs and blue LEDs and green LEDs and
they group together a little kind of
pixelated forms little triangles okay
that when you light them up together at
different intensities you can get all
the different color ranges so if they're
all off yet black if the rule on you get
white and if you kind of have more red
on than you have other code you get a
red color and so on and that's how it
works
and basically the RA for the AMOLED part
basically means active active matrix
because basically what happens is is
that there is a way of putting a thin
layer of transistors over the connecting
up to these LEDs and it makes them turn
on and off very very fast which gives
you this active-matrix organic LED
display and basically this is the
advantage of a AMOLED is that you get
this great contrast because when the
LEDs are off they're off and you get
these deep blacks and that means that
when they're on and you get this great
difference in contrast ratio but
you get these deep blacks and these
bright whites that come up you also get
great viewing angles okay and there are
some disadvantages though and one of
them is this problem of screen burning
after having a whole video about screen
burning I'll link that here in the
scription below that tells you about why
they burn him basically the LEDs are
after you use them over time they're
cursed after fade which means that when
they're in when you turn it on to white
for example you can see the outline of
the LEDs at after a fade out then it
looks like the battery symbol the HOME
key single or the clock or something
because they aren't so bright anymore
now when people talk about Super AMOLED
basically Super AMOLED is an AMOLED
display and a touch screen matrix that
have been put together in a single unit
rather than there being two that go on
top of each other or with some glass or
other kind of substrate between them
they're all part of one display and
that's what they call Super AMOLED and
infinity display is basically an AMOLED
display that you find on the SAT si plus
and of course on the note eight the base
leakage of this idea of is edge to edge
bezel as display but it's basically
still an AMOLED or a Super AMOLED
display now the counterpart to a
Milady's LCD an LCD liquid crystal
display now I'm sure I'm gonna say LCD
display which really means liquid
crystal display display okay everybody
does it don't worry about it LCD
basically means that there are crystals
that when you apply current to them they
can let a certain amount a light through
or not let a certain amount of light
through and they all work by having a
backlight which shines a light across
the whole display and then you change
the crystals to let certain light
through and then watch on in some
polarization and some color filters you
can basically get red green and blue
coming up at each little place on the
screen by controlling what light is able
to go through from the backlight now the
problem with LCD is that when you have a
black display the backlight is still
powering at full power and all the
crystals are sets and no light goes
through it so you're still using the
same amount of energy on a dark display
on a bright display the same battery
power is always being used now when you
hear IPS as in-plane switching that's
basically a second generation of LCD
display that's got great viewing angles
and also has some great
color reproduction and basically all
displays today are IPS I haven't seen an
old TN type of LCD display for several
years now they're all basically IPs now
with AMOLED you have this idea or
problem of burning now we're there isn't
a burning problem with LCD but you do
have the possibility of image retention
which is where a crystal has been
twisted into a certain position a
certain amount of currents been applied
to it Senate mounted lights going
through it if it stays there too long
not always that crystal wants to return
back to its natural relaxed state and
therefore you can get kind of different
images artifacts appearing on the screen
now basically that's normally temporary
if the display is driven to drive you
know different colors and those exits
those crystals are exercised again they
generally sort of free up and there any
ghosting or burning you see should be
temporary so LCD also has its problems
but not the same type of problem as you
get with AMOLED now just like you've got
Super AMOLED you've also got super LCD
that basically means a display and a
touch screen that are built together as
one single unit and when it comes to
Apple products they've got this idea or
retina now retina displays are generally
LCD displays we'll just talk about the
one that isn't in a moment but basic LCD
displays and it first came out in Mobile
with the iPhone 4 because it had a
greater screen pixels per each than the
previous iPhone 3GS and then when you
got to Apple device that got a 720p or
greater that gave us retina HD but
retina and retina HD are basically LCD
displays but now with a launch of the
iPhone team you've got super retina HD
which is basically an amethyst but an
AMOLED display and that is using a
higher resolution so Apple have moved to
an AMOLED display with the iPhone 10 now
when it comes to color accuracy in the
past
AMOLED displays have always been better
at showing colors than LCD displays here
is some graphs from white test that I
did for some devices from 2015-2016 and
you can see that the AMOLED display did
a much better job than the LCD display
so ever I've done some more testing now
in 2017 and there is a less difference
between the LCD displays and the AMOLED
displays when
comes to showing kind of that pure white
on the screen so which is better
on the one hand mo displays a got this
advantage of having the off means off
you get less power being news you've got
good color reproduction however you've
got this problem with burning on some
devices they are tend to be found more
in high-end flagship phones because they
are more expensive to manufacture on the
other side LCDs don't have burning but
they do have image retention the color
reproduction of today's IPS LCD displays
are pretty good and certainly comparable
to those of the AMOLED displays however
of course the backlight is always on
even when you're showing a black pixel
the battery power is still being used to
power up that light and then it's just
being blocked so no like get through now
you'll find they'll IPS else you need to
play more on mid-range phones and more
on low-end phones but of course there
are still lots of high-end phones
including quad HD phones that are using
LCD so both technologies are moving side
by side they're kind of going along
together and people have a preference
for one for the other personally as long
as the display is good and when I pick
up a device whether it be an LCD device
or whether it be an AMOLED device along
like a sieve but it's a good display
good vibrant colors good contrast ratio
personally I don't care but I hope this
videos been helped you to understand the
difference between the basic
technologies that we find in our
displays we don't worry about the
marketing terms just as long as you
understand now how each one works what
