focuses on the premium segment of
smartphones that Lenovo has to offer and
here we're looking at the vibe Z so I'll
leave it to you well thanks very much
we've really excited to introduce the
vibe z2 countries outside of China this
is
Lenovo's first 4G or LTE capable device
it's a five and a half inch smartphone
running on Android 4.3 and you know it's
powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800
processor are running at 2.2 gigahertz
so it's pretty fast a very speedy in
fact great for multitasking and also
very efficient in terms of battery life
it's got a 3,000 milliampere battery
inside but it's still pretty light at
147 grams and also very thin at 7.9
millimetres now on the rear side we've
actually included the fabric feel a back
cover that was also introduced in the
vibe X where you know we helped to make
it a bit more anti scratch and anti
fingerprint so that it has a bit more
premium feel covered with a bit of
Chrome on the on the edges camera wise
we've got a 5 megapixel front camera so
it's great for taking selfies and on the
rear we've got a 13 megapixel camera
dual that's right with a with a flash as
well to help take good shots with an F
1.8 aperture lens so that's really good
for a little light photography
we've also sort of included the Nova's
new launcher in here which we also
introduced in the vibe X where we've
actually taken away the app drawer in
that sense a lot of people ask us you
know why we do that and it was really
from an insight that our lot of our
consumers couldn't find their apps
because they needed to go into a
separate location to find their apps in
that way so what we've done is we've
just put all the apps you know on the
home pages and and you can you can just
move around your apps in that way and
just customize your homescreen that way
we've also made it very customizable by
adding a theme center so that you can
you can actually use or you know change
your themes customize the way your phone
looks even to the extent of separately
different sections of the theme as well
as you know like the dialer different
dialers or
also different boot animations aren't on
the phone just to give it a bit of fun
really yeah and does it accept an
expandable storage alright okay in terms
of the other specifications it comes
with two gigabytes of RAM and 16
gigabytes of inbuilt storage no
expandable storage so it's not it's not
removed that the cover is not removable
yet we have other models of course like
the II also announced the S 930 which
you can remove the cover there's
expandable storage it's dual SIM and you
know you can change the battery as well
but this one's all built in because we
wanted to maintain the the size of it
and also the the weight of the device so
this is Luna was true first 4G it is
absolutely our first 4G device we're
really happy to you know bring it to the
market where where 4G is available in
some of the emerging markets right now
in a lot of these emerging markets 4G is
still you know very new and and that's
why we feel that the time is right now
suitable it's actually introduced this
this product to to the markets in these
countries and in terms of the price
point what are we looking at
oh we're looking at the recommended
price of 549 US dollars it is uh you
know one of our more premium smartphones
you know obviously but we feel that the
the pricing wise is very still
provides a lot of value for the kind of
product that we have here I mean in
terms of the display it's a full
high-definition 1080p display with four
hundred you know pixels per inch and you
know we think that that itself deserves
a you know kind of premium values the
fact that also it's really the contrast
and the color is really bright compared
to compared to also some of the other
competitors with the same full HD
display I understand and it's nice that
you concluded if I make a pixel front
facing camera as well absolutely I mean
selfies has really become a big thing I
mean selling the dictionary now I know
it was word of the year in 2013 so you
know we wanted to help people make their
selfies look better so we've also got
you know beautification editing
functionality in the software as well as
to make them looks like it better
absolutely well it seems like a very
well thought-out device nice and thin
decent build quality nice strong battery
so I have to commend you for that and
hope you hopefully you guys enjoy a
favorable reception in the marketplace
absolutely thank you very much welcome
thank you very time thanks so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
