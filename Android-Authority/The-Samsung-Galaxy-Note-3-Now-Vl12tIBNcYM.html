people didn't quite know what to make of
it
after all phones were still quite small
back then and even then the idea of the
smartphone wasn't quite as ubiquitous as
it is today the second iteration though
did definitely show a growing fan base
and it also showed that general
smartphones and also larger phones in
general were starting to get a lot of
fans so with the release of the third
Note smartphone we see that Samsung's
grown power and now very far reach made
it one of the most anticipated phones of
the year and upon its release the
response was pretty unanimous the Galaxy
Note 3 seemed to signify for many people
the current pinnacle of Samsung's mobile
presence but that was then
and it's Josh regard from Android I
thought hey what's going on everybody
and this is the Samsung Galaxy Note 3
now ok quick story now back at Aoife in
Berlin there was a live stream hosted by
mobile geeks that was going on for the
entirety of the show and at one point I
was privileged enough to be a part of a
panel there talking about general mobile
mostly Android obviously since those
were the main developments so the Galaxy
Note 3 obviously came up and we had to
talk about that textured plastic on the
back now echoing a lot of the people out
there a lot of you who lamented over the
glossy plastic that became all too
familiar in 2013 I came up with a bit of
an idea you know Samsung if you really
wanted to make your users happy with
their Galaxy s4's then you would make
replacement backs made of this textured
plastic instead of the glossy plastic
they have already and then here is Sasha
Pallenberg who quite frankly is somebody
that I look up to his eyes just go wide
open and he says that is a fantastic
idea I love that Samsung you should
listen to him fast forward to last week
when we reported that Samsung has
updated the galaxy s4 with you guessed
it a textured plastic backing you're
welcome and now we make it to the
present day now up until the Galaxy Note
3 I had reviewed a couple of larger
phones and since then I reviewed plenty
of them and while I still am not too
sure if I would use a large phone every
single day there is only
one device that actually got close to
taking that title and that is of course
this Galaxy Note 3 now obviously as I've
been pointing out a lot in this video
already my love for the new material
choice still continues but as far as the
size goes what really struck me about
the Galaxy Note 3 is that at this size
at 5.7 inches after sometime especially
with the more sort of rounded but also
flat look on the front and back mostly
you do find that this size begins to
feel incredibly normal sure you might
wrestle with this phone trying to get it
out of a tight jean pocket or when
you're trying to use one hand in order
to do all of your tasks you might notice
it then but until those particular
moments you probably wouldn't even think
about the fact that this is a larger
phone than most and of course that
screen remains one of my favorite parts
it still provides great color quality
high pixel count in that 1080p display
and also the large size I have to admit
does create a much better viewing
experience than many of the other phones
out there if I had a choice between this
and the Moto X as much as I love the
Moto X I would pick this to watch a
movie on any day of the week and of
course if we're going to talk about
imaging the camera still has to be
spoken of because it still provides
great quality shots at that 13 megapixel
count and even if using a phone this
large it doesn't make taking pictures
very easy the pictures you get from it
still look really great and that is a
testament to Samsung's quality in their
optics so you can probably guess where
my main gripes are when it comes to the
Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and yes it does
have to do with the software experience
well probably what is more disappointing
about it rather than just the usage of
the software is the fact that it's
something we just kind of expect from
Samsung now as far as the aesthetics ago
when it comes to TouchWiz it is pretty
safe to say that it's just getting old
even if it is being used on a larger
screen which helps to sort of fit all of
the elements in touch with still remains
very bloated and it's just a little bit
larger than it probably should be and
the general plan that Samsung has of
just packing and feature by feature by
feature into their TouchWiz software is
really not doing it enough justice
anymore when it just looks this
whereas stock Android has opted for a
growing simplicity Samsung is definitely
over saturating their features in the
galaxy which pretty much brings me to my
main point when it comes to the software
it's the fact that it's kind of
something we expect to happen when it
comes to new Galaxy devices now for
example did I get excited for every s4
feature to come to the note 3 of course
I was but if you remember back in my
review and then subsequent feature just
like this on the galaxy s4 I found that
those new features I didn't even really
use after a little while and despite the
consolidation and admittedly the very
elegant grouping of the s-pen functions
in the air command like a lot of you
note users out there I started to not
really use the s-pen a whole lot after
some time either so that's kind of the
experience when it comes to the software
standpoint now it's something I kind of
want to term galaxy syndrome and the
main reason is because it's something I
definitely solve with the galaxy s4 if
you remember but on the Galaxy Note 3
it's also there as well now the s-pen is
something that is wholly unique so maybe
the syndrome is at a smaller degree on
the galaxy note 3 but it's still kind of
there and ultimately what it means is
that all of these features that Samsung
loves to pile into their phones might be
exciting at first but after some time
they do kind of fade into obscurity so
with all of that in mind what really
makes the Galaxy Note 3 super popular
because it really is this is definitely
one of the like highest-rated phones
that I've ever seen at least among my
peers because no matter who I ask who
has a Galaxy Note 3 I find nobody who
really hates the experience on here and
I think I kind of have it down it's
because even with those different
features that you may or may not use the
general main and basic smartphone
experience is actually somewhat
perfected in this phone because pretty
much everything that you might want to
do on a smartphone you can definitely do
on the Galaxy Note 3 if you want a
gaming rig you have a great one right
here that can handle all of the great
games out there if you want to multitask
you definitely can and in a bunch of
different ways especially with that 3
gigabytes of RAM
and if you want a stylist experience on
your smartphone well you can't really
look anywhere else and thankfully in the
Galaxy Note 3 it is brought to its
highest possible level that's far so
this is a very valuable trait for a
smartphone to have adaptability and
that's something that the Galaxy Note 3
has in spades and so there you have it
the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 now especially
with its unique stylus and it's a larger
belt this is one of the better
smartphones at a larger size that you
can have today but even on top of that
it is still a very good smartphone in
its own right so if you can get past a
larger size you're still gonna get an
experience that you're probably gonna
have a lot of fun with and so with that
we do say that the Galaxy Note 3 still
holds up very well especially mine it
may not be a phone I use everyday but I
still have a lot of fun every time I do
and as far as we're talking about
Samsung and the Galaxy line I am really
excited to see what's coming in the
pipeline for the Galaxy line but if the
galaxy s4 and the Galaxy Note 3 gave me
any one big takeaway it's that I have to
come into these new devices buy the
Samsung Galaxy line with open eyes get
excited about the features but at the
same time galaxy syndrome might rear its
ugly head at some point after the
release as always thank you guys very
much for watching and I hope you enjoyed
this look at the Samsung Galaxy Note 3
now if anything what the Galaxy Note 3
tells me along with the galaxy s4 before
it is that for future galaxy releases I
might think the features are really
awesome to begin with but later on that
might change like I said it's called
galaxy syndrome you can stay tuned to
