dropped the one moniker off its latest
flagship it chose instead to shorten and
simplify its name to the HTC ten it's a
smart phone that not only looks
dramatically different from its
predecessor but it's also spec to ensure
that to justify to be superior in every
facet by looking at - it's almost tough
to discern any similarities but trust me
there are a lot like a huge lot hey guys
John Belasco here with Andrew authority
and I'm doing quick look between the HTC
One m9 and HTC 10 metal has always been
the core material that HTC has forged
its flagships out of so it's no surprise
that there's a lot of metal here don't
get us wrong they're premium but we
certainly find the HTC tens design more
riveting sure it's a smidgen taller
wider and heavier than the m9 but the
redesign and attention to detail makes
the m9 s design appear Elementary what's
most apparent are the beveled edge
around the back the capacitive buttons
the change to the ear priests grill and
a single button that makes up the volume
control I wasn't bad with sharper edges
of the m9 now just by looking snapshots
are taking the two handsets side-by-side
to one another I can't help but to fall
in love with how the HTC 10 has an
unmistakable silhouette with the size
increase the HTC 10 packs along a
slightly larger 5.2 inch quad HD Super
LCD 5 display whereas the m9 has a
smaller 5 inch 1080p Super LCD 3-1
there's just no comparison here folks
well because the HTC tens panel is more
detailed when you look at it very
closely now don't get me wrong the M
lines 1080p resolution is plenty
detailed but the HTC's tends to jump to
quad HD resolution has been a long time
coming
the HTC 10 is also packin the newer
hardware a quad-core Snapdragon 820
chipset coupled with three thing bytes
RAM and Adreno 530 GPU in contrast to
the m9 features last year's top-line
chip the Snapdragon 810 it's still
plenty powerful but the upgrade comes in
handy
you're dealing with HTC ten squat HD
resolution turning our attention to the
cameras the m9 didn't live up to the
expectations with its 20 megapixel
sensor falling flat particularly under
low-light settings
well the HTC ten brings back the ultra
pixel camera as it slept with a 12
megapixel sensor on the back with 1.5 5
micron pixels and F 1.8 aperture lens
laser autofocus BSI and a dual tone LED
flash will see if blow light performance
is improve though HTC Sense UI has
always been a favorable custom
experience in the Android community
delivering a good balance to meet the
demands of users this year's sensor wise
an evolutionary one that's running on
top of Android 6.0 marshmallow even
though the general layouts and visuals
are the same HTC is so much streamlined
experience and that's a really good
thing mainly because many of HTC's own
apps complected with those from google
staple last year therefore there's no
more wondering what music or email app
to use history has shown us that HTC is
still in that stage of rebuilding at the
last year's effort it seemed as though
that a rebound was impossible thankfully
though that doesn't appear to be the
case because the HTC 10 seems like a
polished product and far more ambitious
than the m9 let's just hope that all
this hard work pays off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
