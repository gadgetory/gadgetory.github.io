Authority and I wanted to show y'all or
really maybe review if y'all an oldie
but a goodie that's been around since
the very very beginning time of Android
it's called locale I'll open it right up
now what locale does is locale allows
you to automate certain actions on your
phone similar to something like Tasker
or automated and it lets you set
conditions in situations to do things
like that so you'll see that I've got
home and default are both active right
now and then work is different and I'll
just take you through how we actually
create a situation
this right here is support this question
mark this Play Store bag with a puzzle
piece on it takes you to the Play Store
and to all of the locale plugins because
there are many third-party plugins you
can purchase and then tap into the power
of locale with this this button right
here lets you prioritize your situations
which one takes priority over the other
and then this menu button actually only
lets you contact support you'll see up
at the top we have an on/off switch just
like you would see in the settings menu
prefer profiles in Santa's and mater
turning Wi-Fi on and off things like
that so we'll start a new situation and
from the very first time you hit add
situation you are given a couple of
options you can select from a template a
silence your phone at night silence
string meetings on your calendar or
silent your ringer by turning the
display face downs returning your phone
over like that but if you really want to
get into the nitty-gritty then you're
going to want to start from scratch now
I'll leave this untitled just because
it's not going be one that I actually
use but to start you need to add a
condition and the condition can range
from battery calendar caller location
orientation and time now time is fairly
straightforward it's a day of the week
days of the week between a certain hour
span of time orientation is if the phone
the display is facing up like this or
down like so location is one of the more
powerful ones it actually taps into the
phone's GPS and you can set certain
conditions or certain I guess what's the
term they use settings pardon me based
off of where you're at where your
one says you're at you can also do
things like if a certain caller calls
and they can have a certain ringtone or
the phone can do something different
calendar events and battery percentage
so why don't we do battery and see what
happens if it is plugged in now if it's
unplugged and below 20% you hit the
checkmark down here so battery below 20%
my battery jumps below 20% what do I
want to happen let's say logically and
these are all the things that are built
in and then I because I'm a desk SMS
user that's a plug-in down at the bottom
let's say logically if your battery is
below 20% you would want to turn
brightness down to 30% just like that
your battery's below 20% let's just name
this high for time sake and just like
that it's saved now you'll see that home
and default are still active default is
what your phone does when none of the
conditions are activated and because I
have nothing on my defaults right now
because I plan to do everything via
conditions then that's why they're both
active now you'll see that high is not
active because right up here my battery
is at 47% one thing that bugs me just a
hair is that there is constantly a
low-cal notification running and it
tells you what conditions are actually
active right now I have home and default
running but if you try and swipe it away
just because I like to have a really
clean notification tray it doesn't let
you and the explanation for this is that
if it doesn't have something in the
notification menu then Android will kill
it as a process and then it can no
longer continue to monitor your phone so
just something that you'd have to deal
with if you are going to use locale
otherwise that's pretty much it it's
very very powerful the more in-depth you
get but I'm trying to keep this as brief
as I possibly can
locale is by 244 a.m. I believe is what
they're called
and it is $4.99 in the Google Play Store
a long long time ago it was $9.99
and when it came out of being a free
beta and so I never purchased it but now
that I noticed that the price was
slashed I think it's a great great
investment especially if you don't want
to have to worry about constantly
turning on or off GPS Bluetooth Wi-Fi
volumes things like that last time it is
called locale and you can find it in the
Google Play Store</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
