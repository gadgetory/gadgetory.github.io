authority and last year was a radical
design shift for Samsung with the galaxy
s6 and the s6 edge they were easily the
most premium feeling smartphone Samsung
has ever produced and were ultimately
pretty good phones marred only by bad
battery life and some questionable
emissions of key features that made a
Samsung a Samsung does a refined design
and a reintroduction of those features
enough to win back the hearts of Samsung
diehards let's find out with the Samsung
Galaxy s7 edge so before we get started
I just want to quickly let you guys know
that we're handling the review process a
little bit differently so the video
review what you're watching right now is
obviously being done by me but the
written review is actually done by our
writer Andrew grush and you can see his
thoughts on the s7 edge up here linked
in a card or down below in the
description and he's actually been using
the X Notes version of the s7 edge so
he'll be it will show you comparisons in
terms of benchmarks and all that stuff
against the 820 in the written portion
so if you want to see all that make sure
to check out the written review but with
that being said let's go ahead and get
started with the s7 edge the galaxy s7
edge isn't a complete departure from the
design of last year's s6 edge but it
didn't really need to be it's more of a
refinement or an evolution the biggest
difference between this year's s7 edge
and last year's s6 edge is the size it's
a little bit bigger due to the increase
in screen real estate but for a phone
with a 5.5 inch display it's
surprisingly a lot smaller in comparison
to other flagship smartphones with
similar display sizes a lot of this has
to do with how the screen spills over on
the sides and the fact that Samsung has
managed to keep the side bezels
extremely thin I still want to consider
this a compact size smartphone by any
means because a 5.5 inch display is
still a 5.5 inch display no matter how
you slice it but it's definitely one of
the easier 5.5 inch smartphones to use
in one hand the Super AMOLED panel is
everything you would expect from a
Samsung display the colors are vibrant
and saturated blacks are inky dark it's
bright enough to be visible outdoors on
a sunny day and it's quad HD just like
last year's model so still super sharp
despite the bump in screen
sighs if anything the extra screen real
estate makes content like movies and
games even more enjoyable and it may be
a placebo effect at this point but
Samsung screens always seem to get
better and better each and every year
and the s7 edge of screen really looks
phenomenal new to Samsung's flagship
this year is the always-on display
feature this takes advantage of the
AMOLED screen by only lighting up the
necessary pixels to show you useful
information but right now it's pretty
limited in functionality and nowhere
near as robust as similar features from
Motorola or even Google's own stock
Android right now I can show you the
clock a calendar or a few predefined
images which doesn't do much of anything
except just look cool it doesn't drain
much battery but until Samsung adds more
features to it or gives you the ability
to peek at notifications it isn't really
all that useful and honestly feels a
little half-baked the glass and metal
construction returns from last year's
Galaxy S is so as far as design
materials go it still feels largely the
same in your hand and despite being
larger the s7 edge feels way more
comfortable to hold due to not having
those super sharp chamfered edges of the
s6 edge
the metal frame has a much more rounded
feel and the rear glass panel tapers
down on the sides similar to the note 5
the tapered backside allows for a couple
of different things one it's a little
bit easier to pick up off a table which
actually helps out a lot considering the
phone side rails are a lot thinner than
most other phones and to the tapered
edges allows the phones to nestle nicely
in the hand and it may sound weird but
it honestly is one of the most
comfortable feeling phones I've ever
held there are still downsides to this
design however the phone is still a huge
fingerprint magnet if you're like me
you'll probably find yourself wiping the
phone on your shirt quite often or
carrying around a microfiber cloth the
other downside is it's not the grippy
alone in the world which isn't all that
surprising given the build materials
it's not a slippery bar of soap or
anything but you'll probably find
yourself being a little more cautious
than normal especially if you aren't
rocking a skin or a case what this
slightly revamp design Samsung has also
brought back a couple of key features
that were notably missing from last
year's models microSD card expansion is
back which means there's only a 32 or 64
gig variant this year but with micro sd
you can expand up to an additional 200
gigs to store all of your photos and
videos the phone is also water and dust
resistant again which means it can
survive the accidental dunk in the
toilet
a spilt drink or the occasional
rainstorm but this time around there's
no annoying covers or flaps to deal with
because it's completely sealed in from
the inside all of the buttons and ports
are exactly where you would expect them
to be on a samsung phone the power
button is on the right where it's easy
to reach volume rockers on the left
physical home button up front flanked
with capacitive recent apps and back key
and along the bottom is the headphone
jack microUSB port and the bottom firing
speaker the speaker is nothing amazing
but it does sound significantly worse
from previous devices it's super tinny
at high volumes and you can most likely
thank the waterproofing for that one now
you also might be thinking right now why
Samsung why microUSB why not USB type-c
USB type-c is the future so the answer
to that question is twofold one USB
type-c hasn't exactly skyrocketed in
adoption there still aren't that many
devices out there that use USB type-c so
at least for me microUSB is still be
more convenient standard and answer
number two would be gear vr which uses
micro USB and the new gear VR supports
the s7 the s7 edge the note 5 the s6
edge plus the s6 edge and the regular s6
and from a production or a logistical or
raw material standpoint whatever you
want to call it it just wouldn't make a
whole lot of sense for Samsung to make a
whole nother VR headset specifically for
two devices when they can just make the
one that works with all of them the home
button up front still doubles as a
fingerprint scanner just like before and
while the setup process is a little bit
long compared to other phones like the
Nexus 6p or 5x the fingerprint sensor
feels a lot faster and more accurate
over the s6 or even the note 5 and very
rarely did I run into the sensor not
reading my fingerprint on the first
attempt internally the phone has
undergone the usual improvements with a
faster processor and more RAM and the
states the phone is being powered by the
Snapdragon 820 chip whereas in other
regions you're getting Samsung's own
Exynos 88-90 but all versions come with
the same 4 gigs of ram the version that
I've been using for the past week is the
Snapdragon model and overall I've been
very pleased with the performance I will
admit there are still some random
hiccups here and there or quote on
Samsung lag but the majority of really
stems from Samsung's own launcher the
Flipboard scrolling issues that plagued
the s6 and note 5 has been mostly
alleviated it still causes some drop
frames when swiping between home screens
from time to time but aside from these
small hiccups general performance has
been really great it launches apps
quickly multitask and plays graphically
demanding games like a champ and thanks
to the built-in water cooling the phone
gets warm but it never overheats
speaking of gaming Samsung is also one
of the first manufacturers to take
advantage of the new Vulcan api's in
their smartphones and once developers
take advantage of this this is going to
allow for better games much smoother
gameplay better graphics performance and
an experience that is much less
resource-intensive
over the current OpenGL framework where
Samsung has made its biggest
improvements is in battery life the s6
edge was a struggle to get through a
full day but the s7 edge is massive 36
hundred million power battery solves
Samsung's battery life woes getting
through a full day has not been a
problem regardless of whether I'm using
the phone casually or hammering on it
with a lot of gaming and picture-taking
it's not going to go the extra mile and
get you a second day but if you're just
looking for a good solid full day of use
the s7 edge provides exactly that now we
know that screen on time numbers isn't
the only metric that should be used to
gauge a phone's battery life but when a
phone is consistently putting out five
plus hours of screen on time that
obviously speaks volumes to how much the
battery life has improved and never did
I feel that I had to monitor or cut back
my usage in order to get through a day
in those times where you do have to fill
up or top off your phone the Estevan
edge does support wireless charging and
fast charging but one thing to keep in
mind about the fast charging on the s7
edge if you have the Snapdragon version
is its quick charge 2.0 and not the
newer 3.0 this doesn't mean a whole lot
in terms of actual charging speeds and
to the average user they probably won't
care but you are getting a charge that
is less energy efficient with quick
charge 2.0 versus 3.0 Samsung has always
done a really great job with their smart
phone cameras but this year they decided
to take a slightly different approach
aesthetically the camera looks much
better the unsightly camera bulge has
been shrunk it down to just a slight
bump but instead of increasing the
megapixel count or keeping it the same
they actually reduce the megapixels from
16 down to 12 this allows for much
larger
pixels for increased low-light
performance similar what Google did with
the Nexus line and you're also getting a
much brighter F 1.7 aperture lens the
new sensor utilizes dual pixel
technology which isn't new in the camera
world but is the first of its kind in a
smartphone this creates for a much
faster autofocus and coming from
something like the Nexus 6p there's a
very noticeable difference in focusing
speeds especially in low-light the
camera interface is largely the same as
before and you still have many of the
same modes like selective focus YouTube
live broadcast slow motion and of course
the more typical ones like Auto Pro and
panorama what is new is a feature
Samsung calls motion photo which records
a short clip before a photo is taken
it's similar to Apple's live photos for
the iPhone and just like live photos
it's pretty gimmicky but it is there if
you want to use it or can be completely
disabled if you don't over although I've
been very pleased with this camera and
the photos that it produces day light
and well lit indoor shots are very well
detailed with pleasant looking colors
and you can get some really great depth
with the F 1.7 aperture HDR mode is
quite subtle as far as colors are
concerned which is a good thing because
a lot of other smartphone cameras tend
to be very over aggressive in this area
otherwise it works well in bringing back
more detail from shadows and brightly
lit areas of photos especially in high
contrast scenarios and because it
doesn't mess with the colors too much
the images still look very natural in
low-light the images still pack plenty
of detail and the camera does a pretty
solid job of keeping highlights in check
it's only in the most extreme low-light
situations where photos start to fall
apart with a lot of noise reduction
overexposed highlights and the images
start to exhibit an unnatural yellow
cast but this is nothing new and has
been a problem with Samsung cameras for
a while now this can also be said about
the front camera but in most situations
the five megapixel front shooter is more
than adequate for your selfie taking
needs there's a wide variety of video
recording modes including 4k and the
optical image stabilization helps keep
the footage from being overly shaky but
I would avoid using the software video
stabilization at all costs as I notice
it tends to cause a lot of warping in
the footage while all these changes that
Samsung has made to the camera this year
have been really great I personally
don't think it's a huge leap from the s6
but if you had any concerns about the
changes to this year's camera
you really shouldn't because it's just
as good as any recent camera Samsung has
produced if not better the software is
Android marshmallow with Samsung's
custom interface and Samsung's UI still
isn't the prettiest but this is probably
the best version of their interface to
date the nasty green and blue color
scheme is finally gone and has been
replaced with a much cleaner blue and
white if you're still not a fan of the
revamp aesthetics the theme store is
still a great option to change the look
and feel of the interface and there's
many themes available to make it look
however you want or even a little closer
to stock Android the edge UX has been
improved to better take advantage of the
curved glass you still have all the same
features from last year like the edge
lighting apps edge and people edge but
the whole edge interface is wider now
allowing for twice as many app shortcuts
which makes it a lot more useful new to
the edge interface is the task edge and
edge panels with tasks edge you can
create a shortcut to your most commonly
used tasks like taking a selfie or
creating a calendar event edge panels on
the other hand will show you quick
information at a glance such as yahoo
news sports scores weather or stocks and
you can download a few more from
Samsung's Galaxy Apps they're pretty
much accessible from anywhere on the
phone including the lock screen but it
does get a little bit cluttered when you
have a lot of these panels enabled and
depending on how you have things ordered
it may take you several swipes just to
find the panel that you need one feature
that have really enjoyed a lot with the
s7 edge is the new game launcher and
game tools and if you're big on mobile
gaming you may actually find these
features to be quite useful the game
launcher automatically aggregates all of
your games into a single folder for easy
access and the game tools is a
convenient little floating bubble that
lets you mute incoming alerts lock the
capacitive keys to prevent accidental
presses minimize the game take a
screenshot or create a recording all
while you're actually playing the game
even though Samsung's UI has made some
improvements it's still far from perfect
it's a lot less intrusive and if you
don't like many of the features you can
simply turn them off but Samsung still
packs a lot of crap we're and redundant
applications into their phones for
basically every Google application
there's a Samsung equivalent of the same
app so on the s7 edge you have to email
apps to web browsers and to voice
assistance with Google now and s voice
and depending on which carrier on you
may be dealing with even more
apps or bloatware pricing for the Galaxy
s7 edge is pretty typical for a Samsung
flagship off-contract it will cost you
800 bucks but you do have the option of
contracts or monthly installments
depending on your carrier I won't go as
far as saying that the s7 edge is the
best Android smartphone you can
currently buy but it's pretty awesome
along with the usual improvements like
the camera and faster processor the s7
edge takes what was great about last
year's s6 edge makes a few key
refinements like a more comfortable
design and improved battery life and
brings back microSD card expansion and
water and dust resistance there's no
such thing as a perfect smartphone but
if there's a phone out there that hits
the mark pretty damn close it's the
galaxy s7 edge as always thank you guys
