is Jason this is where we try and answer
your most pressing Android questions and
I got to tell you most of your pressing
questions have been asked many times
before and been answered multiple times
over all you have to do is go to our
channel with the little magnifying glass
there and search your key word problem
keywords are in our titles tags and show
descriptions so it's not too hard to
find probably your question has been
answered more than once but I found a
question that hasn't been asked before
and I thought man millions of people
probably have this problem let's try and
solve it here we go our first and only
question this week is all about those
Android lovers who are visually impaired
and we got a great question from Brett
just about that hi Jace I'm legally
blind and I'm looking for a new high-end
cellphone can you help me find out who
is able to compete with Samsung's s5s
huge font capabilities thanks and I'm
sure there are a lot of other people out
there with the same question thanks Bret
and I know that you already probably
know the answer to this but I want to go
through KitKat's basic accessibility
features first go to settings then to
accessibility and then you can see
androids accessibility features like
talkback magnification gestures large
text and of course text-to-speech output
now to the best of my knowledge these
features are on all more recent Kit Kat
updates now Bret you should know that I
don't know the accessibility options of
all Android phones but I did do some
research that I found you and all
visually impaired Android lovers might
find very helpful and number one would
be magnify you do this by turning your
phone into an instant digital magnifying
glass equipped with a flashlight
magnified by apt lab is an innovative
application that helps users see better
by using their smartphone as a
magnifying glass the app is great for
reading tiny print visual impairment or
people who are just too lazy to put
their glasses on this app is handy and
can serve a wide array of functions now
40 years from now when my eyes start to
go I'm going to need an app like this to
help me with navigation
walkie talkie is one of the many apps by
eyes-free project that helps blind
people get along with their daily
the app has an exceptional navigational
aid that will greatly help people with
visual impairment navigate the streets
users will be able to get instant
updates on their current location as the
app has a built-in compass and will
always point in the right direction if
the user gets lost the OP will
automatically vibrate and tell the user
that he or she is going the wrong way
now Breton answer to your specific
question about fonts I found a phone app
that should be available on most any
Android phone
this application will solve the problem
of tiny font sizes font installer is an
app that will enable users to install
over hundreds of fonts on their device
for better reading the catch is that
your phone must have root access for the
app to work properly if you manage to
get past this requirement that all
systems are a go for you you can change
the fonts to what you want on your phone
as well as make them big enough to read
once a font is picked it will be applied
globally and not just to a single
application bonus thanks for watching
