Authority and this is the HTC u ultra
this is HTC's biggest phone so far for
2017 both literally and figuratively
this is a behemoth of a smart phone it's
even bigger than some of the most
current flagship like the LG v20
Google's pixel XL or the iPhone 7 plus
and I don't think we've seen a flagship
phone this large since Google's Nexus 6
it's almost annoyingly big and a lot of
that has to do with the 5.7 inch screen
an additional secondary ticker display
and the extremely chunky bezels on all
sides if you like big phones you
probably won't have a problem with it
but it's definitely not a phone that was
meant to be used with one hand on the
bottom bezel is a solid state home
button that also functions as a
fingerprint sensor which does work
pretty well it's fast and accurate to
unlock without much trouble but the
capacitive keys flanking the home button
are a different story
instead of being centered they sit far
too low on the bezel and they're also
very tiny capacitive keys this makes
them very difficult to tap on with
accuracy and I can't tell you how many
times I would tap away and completely
miss the buttons entirely because of how
low and small they are the build quality
of you ultra is pretty typical HTC and
nothing short of what you would expect
from the company but it's an all new
design that we haven't seen from HTC
before they have jumped on the glass and
metal bandwagon with metal along the
sides and a glass exterior on the front
and back the back has a very unique and
super reflective mirror like finish and
it looks really beautiful and eye
catching on the phone is actually clean
but the cleanest of phones will ever
look is when you first take it out of
the box glass is already naturally hard
to keep clean but the reflective coating
makes fingerprints smudges and dust even
more prominent especially around the
bulging camera lens which seems to be a
huge magnet for dust and there's almost
no point in trying to clean it because
it just collects dust all over again in
just a matter of minutes the u ultra
isn't all that thin of a phone either so
it's very surprising how big the camera
bump is and it's almost confusing as to
why protrudes as much as it does equally
as confusing is the lack of a headphone
jack it's certainly thick enough to
house a headphone jack so hc' could have
included one if they wanted the only
real reasoning
you ultra to not have a headphone jack
it's so that HTC can push people to use
their you sonic USBC earbuds that come
bundled with a u ultra and if you want
to use a pair of standard
three-and-a-half millimeter earbuds or
headphones you'll have to supply your
own adapter because the u ultra does not
come with one we all know that USB C is
the future but if your device is still
big enough to fit a headphone jack it
should have a headphone jack for
external audio that you ultra features
the same speaker setup that we saw on
last year's HTC 10 it's a tweeter and
woofer combo with a front facing speaker
where the earpiece is located and
another speaker down along the bottom it
is pretty loud but the quality that you
get from these speakers will depend on
the equalizer setting that you decide to
use
oddly enough the theater mode actually
sounds way better than the music mode no
matter what it is you're listening to
it's a much fuller and deeper sound
whereas the music mode sounds much more
hollow in comparison
usually with phones this big you would
also expect a massive battery to be
inside and it's still a respectable size
at 3000 milliamp hours but when you look
at the overall footprint of the phone
three thousand milliamp hours just
sounds smaller than what this phone
should have to put things into
perspective
LG's current flagship the LG G six has
the same sized display in a smaller body
but still manages to pack a bigger
battery and several other phones like
the one plus 3t and Samsung's s7 edge
also have smaller bodies with
significantly bigger batteries despite
having a glass back the u ultra does not
have wireless charging so the new
material choice here was clearly for
aesthetics and not for any other added
benefits it does have fast charging for
quick charge ups and top offs which you
might end up using more often you would
like because the 3000 milliamp hour
battery leads to just average battery
life it's good enough to last a full day
of average use but don't expect to have
much left over when you're ready to wind
down for the night there are a handful
of positives about the U ultra and the
screen is definitely one of them
the 5.7 inch quad HD Super LCD 5 display
looks fantastic and HTC has always done
a great job with LCD it's very sharp
very contrasty and vibrant in color and
easily readable and direct sunlight the
only glaring problem with this screen is
that exhibit some very noticeable light
bleed coming from the upper left corner
right below the front-facing camera
which doesn't necessarily detract from
the overall display but once you see for
the first time it can be a little hard
to forget about the HTC u Ultra also
comes with a secondary ticker display
and if we're being perfectly honest here
it's pretty much a carbon copy of LG
secondary display from the v20 it does
exactly all the same things it can show
you any incoming notifications so
whether give you shortcuts to some of
your favorite apps and contacts play
music and give you any upcoming calendar
events that you might have within the
next 24 hours it also works when the
main screen is turned off and from here
it will still show you notifications
along with basic info like the time and
date and you also have toggles to some
system settings such as Wi-Fi Bluetooth
and the camera flash it has auto wake
functionality built in which I like so
when you pick the phone up it'll
automatically wake up so you can see any
notifications you might have missed or
just simply check the time and weather
waking up the entire display inside it's
got a top-tier set of specs will be snap
during a 21 4 gigabytes of RAM 64 gigs
of internal storage and a micro SD card
slot if you want to expand upon that in
real-world use there's really no
surprises here it's very fluid with
general navigation and scrolling has
great touch response is quick to launch
apps and multitask and runs games with
silky smooth frame rates
there's no noticeable issues here at all
with lag or drop frames the phone smooth
performance also has a lot to do with
the software experience it's running HTC
Sense but this time on top of Android
7.0 nougat and although HTC Sense is
starting to feel a little dated at this
point it's still one of the cleanest
software skins out there you get all the
usual features like HTC blinkfeed and
highly customizable theme engine but it
still maintains a lightweight stock look
and feel because this is being sold
completely unlocked you also won't have
to deal with any unnecessary carrier
bloatware the newest addition to HTC
software is there Sense companion which
is their own take on AI assistance it's
supposed to provide suggestions and
reminders based on your personal usage
and location and I've had this service
enabled for the past week that I've been
using the U ultra and I haven't received
a single suggestion HTT also markets the
services having built-in voice
recognition but from what I can tell
there's no voice recognition to be found
honestly you're better off using Google
assistant which the U ultra does come
with because we sense companion doesn't
seem to do anything that Google isn't
already doing for you another really
strong point for the U ultra is the
cameras it's got a 16 megapixel front
facing shooter that takes excellent
selfies and the rear camera is no slouch
either it's a 12 megapixel ultra pixel
camera with a large 1.5 5 micron pixel
size F 1.8 aperture laser and phase
detection autofocus and optical image
stabilization the camera is very quick
to launch fast to focus and snap photos
and the floaters that it takes are quite
good I would say it's on par with
Google's pixel and just like the pixel
issues with HDR enabled by default the
photos are crisp they're clear the color
reproduction is pleasant and it does
quite well with handling exposure even
in high contrast situation HD sees
camera experience is clean and easy to
use and offers a handful of shooting
modes including a pro mode with the
ability to shoot in RAW if you're
willing to venture outside the camera's
already fantastic auto mode moving into
low-light there is a noticeable increase
in noise which is to be
effective any smartphone camera but the
overall level detail and clarity is
still quite good thanks to large pixels
and optical image stabilization and the
camera is still very fast at snapping
photos in low-light where start to get
weird is when there are a lot of
prominent light sources like street
lamps or traffic lights you wind up with
photos I have a bunch of random floating
light particles and this is something
you can see directly in the viewfinder
as you're taking the photo at first I
thought that maybe the camera sensor was
not clean but after cleaning the lens
off the problem was still there and
because you can see it in the viewfinder
before snapping the photo it leads me to
believe that this is a hardware issue
and not a software post-processing
problem it's somewhat reminiscent of the
halo effect that Google's pixel phones
were having and it's hard to say what
the root cause of it is they could
either be from the extremely reflective
backing or there's something physically
wrong with the sensor itself either way
hopefully it's something that HTC can
actually address just to be clear the
HDD u ultra is not a bad phone by any
stretch of the imagination in this day
and age it's hard to find a phone that
is truly bad but we've got to the point
where we're looking for phones that
offer the most value for the money and
are doing something different that would
compel you to buy it and the hcu ultra
just isn't doing that it has a great set
of specs a really eye-catching design
and a solid camera but the small battery
and lack of a headphone jack is
questionable at best and it's also
missing features that are starting to
become more common like wireless
charging and dust and water resistance
that makes the $750 price tag extremely
hard to justify and unfortunately makes
the phone less accessible to consumers
it's a price that I think only HTC
diehards would be willing to bear and if
so then this is the phone for you but
it's certainly not the phone for me as
