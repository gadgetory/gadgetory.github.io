authority and we're here at Pep calm at
CES 2016 and i'm here with jimmy our
junior editor on the site and we just
got to try out the HTC vive for the very
first time here at CES alright so we
both got to try out the HTC vive for the
very first time tonight here at Pep calm
at CES 2016 and I've tried a ton of
other VR headsets before but I've never
got a chance to try the vibe but I don't
know about you what had what other VR
headsets have you tried and how does
that experience compared to what you
experience tonight with the HTC vive so
i've tried google cardboard a couple of
different headsets in the past and they
were good you know especially for how
cheap you know google is bringing the
headsets to people but you know the vibe
is just on a whole different level it's
so amazing i'm talking about the the
updated model a little bit it's you know
issues e says that it's it's a slightly
smaller headset a little bit more
comfortable and of course i don't have
you know I i I've never tried out the
first generation vive you know before
but this one you know it was very
comfortable it was a surreal experience
almost at least for the demo that we had
it's definitely smaller than the first
version because I remember watching like
the videos of it and it looked ginormous
and like the previous video so it
definitely is a little bit smaller and
this is actually more of like a
consumer-grade version of it because it
was actually hooked up to a consumer
desktop the demo that we got to do we
only have to do one demo so they didn't
show off a whole lot of different things
but the one that we got to do was like
an underwater one and there was like a
ton of fish and it was actually like
really cool because at first I didn't
really think too much of it I was like
this is kind of like any other VR that
I've tried before but graphically it
looks way better than anything I've
experienced in terms of like cardboard
or gear VR it looks way better and it
wasn't until that I saw like a giant
whale like basically in
on my face that it was like this is
insane it felt so real the only thing it
took me out of it was when the cord like
would hit my leg because it's still not
a it's still a wired experience so that
kind of brought me out of the experience
but overall like this is probably the
best VR experience that I've had the
pleasure of trying out yeah yeah no I
completely agree yeah the the area that
we had to try out this demo you know is
only like a two-minute yeah two minute
long demo or something and we only had
about you know five square feet of
movement around around us and yeah you
know so when you when you step too far
you would run into like this this
imaginary grid would show up in front of
you and yeah of course that took me out
of the experience because you know I was
underwater and then a grid would just
show up and I couldn't go past it yeah
that that kind of like did the same
thing for me too but at the same time I
kind of like that the grid showed up
because it lets you know that you're
hitting the boundary and you're not like
running into a table and hitting your
knee or something like that yeah yeah
absolutely i mean you know i know why
it's there I know why you know why why
that that imaginary boundary is there
but still you know obviously it's it's
it's going to be a much better
experience you know if you have a full
room to demo if you have you know at
least you know you can walk in a couple
different directions for you know a
couple couple more feet than we were
able to but yeah you know overall
overall it was it was just incredible
i'm i'm incredibly scared of open water
and i was my hands got really sweaty
right whatever right when i tried on the
headset because yeah was it was pretty
pretty realistic did you did you have
the the whale like move across in front
of your face to you on yours yeah yeah
the there was a giant there was a giant
blue whale that just came came right up
and stopped and and kind of
dat you and oh yeah it was pretty
terrifying but it was a good experience
I'm glad I did it yeah it was definitely
lot of fun like I was jealous of like
all the people that got to try it like
from thing was mobile world congress
because i didn't get a chance to try it
when i was there so i was i wanted to
know what it was like so I'm glad I got
a chance to try here at Pep com I know
you're pretty stoked about it too
because it was it was an awesome
experience though definitely a lot of
fun but we just wanted to give you guys
sort of our quick reactions of the HTC
vive here at Pep calm so there's
definitely a lot more to come here at
CES 2016 it hasn't even really started
yet so stay tuned for the rest of our
coverage and as always check at the
