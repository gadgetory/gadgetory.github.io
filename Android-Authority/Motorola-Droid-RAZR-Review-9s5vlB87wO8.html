30 and today we've been homeward
it is the Motorola Droid Razr and it is
available on Verizon where else is 4G
LTE network for to $99.99 on a two-year
contract so getting into the basics of
this phone it is currently they say the
thinnest 4G phone in the world at 7.1
millimeters thick and it's a beautiful
lightweight phone now compared to
something like the Droid X which I have
here it's definitely thinner okay it's
definitely thinner and it's definitely
more lightweight you know this comparing
this the Droid Razr to another phone it
is actually half the size of the HTC
Thunderbolt if you're familiar with that
phone which is a really a big step from
little rule to take and they had to
bring on something on this phone even
though it does not really beat its
competitors in every single little
challenge it does bring up the thinness
and that's why people are probably gonna
buy this phone for that and the comfort
ability of the device itself so getting
them to the basics it runs on Verizon's
4G LTE network runs at Android 2.3.5 and
it's a great phone overall it's got some
moto cast features that we'll get into
in a little bit but besides that let's
get interview in the box you'll find
basic manuals pretty basic stuff it's
gonna tell you you know Verizon's 4G LTE
networks here why it's better than
everybody else you know just the basics
and also a two piece charging kit AC
wall adapter and USB 2 mini micro
drifting one of the main features on
this phone is definitely the design you
can see it has the cut edges here that
really it's basically Marlowe's new way
of design it will be featured also on
the zoom 2 which will do which is a
tablet that will be coming out shortly
so for design-wise motor oil is still
sticking with the 4.3 inch screen now
it's really it's a large screen but
there are screens out there that are
four point six five inches such as the
Galaxy Nexus so the screen basically
resembles a Bionic screen or the Droid X
the screen is 540
pixels by 960 pixels and offers a Super
AMOLED advanced screen along with strong
Gorilla Glass even though we're getting
into Lotus class the Gorilla Glass is a
great way to make this phone durable as
the nano coating and speaking about nano
coating Motorola has added nano coating
how many times gonna say it right it
it's basically a coating of material
that goes over all the external and
internal components of the phone that
makes it basically splash proof notice
how I only say splash proof I would not
throw this in the ocean and wish for
good luck it is you know there's still
some expose ports ok like I wouldn't
want to spill coffee in the top of this
thing or it's probably gonna die but it
is splash proof I will provide a video
of it showing you that it's splash proof
it does act up or the splash proof
because you know no electronics can
really be durable to water
I see the closest you can get to that
would be the like the gz1 commando which
is the Android phone ok
so I'm getting into design also it is
around a hundred and twenty-nine grams
for the weight that we've tested and
it's 7.1 milliliters think thick
weighing in at the lightest 4G LTE 4G
phone on the market right now it's also
have a door for sim in micro USB a
little tough to get open but as you can
see it there closes nicely so it kind of
fits up the phone and you don't really
get bugged by that door well still we
got on this phone we have one of my
favorite features the Kevlar carbon
fiber looking back and this is so sweet
nice rubbery not too rubbery like it's
cheap but more of a durable like if I'm
gonna drop this you know the backs not
gonna get scratched it looks really nice
it's nice soft feel mostly carbon fibers
and it's a factory since this is an
internal battery and now that we have
very small battery on this phone that's
internal this is sealed so if you splash
water on the back of this thing I pretty
much make sure that it was uh I don't
think anything will really get inside
because they didn't seal this thing up
pretty damn nice also you have the lock
but
on the side power button usually it's on
the top like the Droid X but and you've
got a volume rocker right there that's
really about it you also have the ports
on the top that show you micro USB and
mini HDMI as long as these 3.5
millimeter jack also on the top of the
device on the bottom you really see
nothing so that's really just about it
for ports and capability it also has a
front-facing camera you can probably see
it there as well as the rear eight
megapixel camera the front being 3.1.3
megapixels and if we were to compare two
phones here it looks a little larger
than the Droid X screen wise is the same
so we're now we're gonna get into
performance now of course your runs on
Verizon's fast 4G LTE network and of
course if you're not in the area for
that yet it will also run on there
pretty much reliable 3G network as well
inside of the Droid Razr here you'll get
a 16 gigabyte SD card included which is
upgradeable into 32 gigabytes as we saw
on the side there and of course has 8
gigabytes of internal memory now all of
that memory will be taken up by the
bloatware apps which we'll discuss later
but the the memory anaise is pretty
standard for today's phones i think we
did a good job it's got a battery that
can go up to 12 hours talktime or eight
and a half days by standby
I think the eight and a half days by
standby is a little to pushing it I
think would be a little less than that
but the twelve hours talktime probably
around 10 or 11 I wouldn't go 12 exactly
now Motorola's did a good job keeping
their megapixels and their camera
straightened out alright its features an
HD 1080p video recording as well as 8
megapixel camera with flash and of
course it has the HDMI micro USB and 3.5
millimeter jack at the top here so you
know if you want to stream Netflix what
you're pretty sure you can do is the
mirror mode if you once you plug it in
your TV will give you an option for
mirror mode and if you turn it sideways
Netflix works pretty well well get into
Netflix in a little bit and it's very
clear beside
and if you were to go inside this puppy
it's got a 1.2 gigahertz TI OMAP
processor by Texas Instruments and also
offers 1 gigabyte of RAM for those
speedy tasks you also have Wi-Fi 802.11
tooth 4.0 which is pretty much standard
of today's phones compatibility to
motorola slap dock which is kind of like
turns it into a netbook which it's easy
typing and access and along with
Verizon's paid tethering feature now if
I don't get into the software of the
phone of course it's running on Android
2.3.5 and will be upgradeable to Ice
Cream Sandwich 4.0 in 2012 so one of the
main features of Motorola phones these
days for Android is definitely their
widgets
and will give you a wide variety of
widgets here you know calendar email but
what I like is the I am and also the
email widget those are my favorite of
course there's little tabs for switches
here and Universal inbox as well if you
want to combine all your messages and
what else is included here is a the home
button of course will access multiple
screens and watch if I if I cover the
sensor at the top the buttons will light
up and back it will go there you go so
it's definitely saving battery it's not
a lot of battery taking up those lights
but still it's pretty nice feature of
course is the resizable widgets with it
and one of my favorite features is there
your compatibility with the apps so say
if I there's this thing called groups
for you to click the top left here
they'll bring into something groups and
you can add groups I added something
called work so if I was to add something
to work I would like Gmail and I like to
add that to a group and then go to work
so I use it for work I also have the
capability to hide apps so say if I
didn't like let's see here
Google Talk I can hide it okay it'll be
hidden the app is still there but it's
just hidden away
so it's not really annoyance in my
applications how one of the cool
features is the text messaging you have
the ability to resize text if you were
to go into menu and then resize text
insert something and sort of smiley just
a bunch of cool features with the
messaging of course will offer a
universal inbox for everything
however the Universal inbox does not
work with your Gmail so if you were to
have a universe Universal inbox Gmail
should be on your email and app instead
of the Gmail app just so that's clear of
course it's multi-touch assuming an
email grouping applications as we said
social networking for those big social
networkers up there they would add a
social network it's also the IM feature
which you can add at Yahoo Windows my
messenger or a I am so what else do we
have
of course there is moto cast which I'll
get into right now so as you can see the
little icon the bottom word like we're
next in my library
that's the modal cast icon and it's a
lot of videos online that will show you
I get in the modal cast basically just
plug it into your phone and it will
install the software so I have a lot of
music this is all for moto cast this
will stream right off my network lock
screen though we never um some of the
things you can add here is I can turn my
phone you know often silent I can go to
my pictures oops but I can't really
access my music so we'll have to
definitely fix that and finally my
favorite feature would be the smart
actions so safe in the smart actions are
really they're kind of complicated
understand but they're really easy to
understand okay I'll walk you through
these so say if you can program your
phone to say all right so I go to sleep
at 8 o'clock at night or whatever you
could program it so that it would lower
the screen brightness so it wouldn't
waste your battery stuff like that so if
I were to go to view samples you know it
has a bunch of samples here for for
whatever that's really about it
or the software of the phone so all in
all the Droid Razr is an extraordinary
device I find it really groundbreaking
that they can make a phone this in and
lightweight the Kevlar back really makes
it lightweight and the the internal
battery really does as well so one of
the cons I'd say though is the X there's
no battery there's no external battery
so you can't access the battery so see
if they did get past the lock bootloader
in this to route it if you ever look
right into a boot loop boot loop which
is basically a reoccurring reoccurring
startup there would be no way to battery
pull which is the main way you shut it
off so people gonna have a hard time
brooding so we'd have to do an app where
it would you know something that would
shut it off
let's real quick all right so we got to
top your every running now it's really
crisp it might not seem like it on this
end but it's a really crisp device
I've definitely goes check it up for
yourself so all in all this is a great
device if I were to give it a rating out
of five I probably every even a four or
five probably a four because it really
doesn't bring anything new to the table
besides its thinness and thickness this
has been will from anted authority and
we have just done the review of the
Droid Razr by Motorola</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
