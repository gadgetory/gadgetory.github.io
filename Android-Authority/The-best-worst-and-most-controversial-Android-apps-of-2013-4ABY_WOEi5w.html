Hindy the android authority app guy 2013
has been an amazing year for
applications the envelopes were pushed
and the app ecosystem will never be the
same again so which ones were the best
the worst and the most controversial in
this video we're gonna tell you first up
is the best design app of the year which
we gave to Osmos HD the game itself is a
puzzle game where you must absorb modes
that are smaller than you so you can
grow and absorb larger modes it's a
dollar 99 in the google play store right
now so why did we choose it because it's
simply beautiful the moats are colorful
and vibrant the gameplay is challenging
an intense but slow and relaxing at the
same time add in the atmospheric music
and it's like the nerd gamer equivalent
of taking a bubble bath with candles the
runner-up in this category was badland
our best designed apt choice this year
as cal calendar it's a calendar app so
you pretty much know what it can do it's
free in the Google Play Store and we
gave it a pretty favorable review just a
few weeks ago at the end of the video
will provide a link to the review Cal
calendar won this category because it's
design actually affects its
functionality in a positive manner the
calendar itself looks wonderful it's
colorful easy to read and modern when
adding things to the calendar everything
is modular and easy to find and select
it has a lot of functionality and it's
enjoyable to look at aunty use our
runner-up in this category was the
official app for the score Google Talk
was a pretty decent service but when
hangouts came out after Google i/o
things got so much better it's free and
it's google app but what it does is send
SMS and MMS messages and is the official
chat service of google plus what else
can we say SMS MMS improved video
chatting improved group chatting setting
moods hundreds of emoticons in a brand
new design were among the most important
features that were added before the
revamp google talk was a respectable
chat client since the revamp hangouts
has become a must-have application for
pretty much everyone with a google
account a runner up here was feedly
Google keep has been in like four or
five of our app lists in 2013 and thus
has earned its spot as our most useful
app of the year it's a note-taking app
that quickly and easily syncs to your
Google Drive account it's free in the
Google Play Store and it's really quite
unique when we first got a hold of
Google keep we knew it would be on our
best of 2013 somewhere it is fun to use
syncs automatically to Google Drive
where it is easily
accessed by going to drive google.com /
keep and the various colors and no types
allows you to easily organize your
thoughts in a simple interface that's
also easy to manage our runner-up in
this category was the Android device
manager clash of clans started out on
iOS and unlike many games made a
seamless and successful transition to
Android earlier this year it's a
massively multiplayer online real-time
strategy game where players build their
village up defended against Raiders
complete a campaign and fight against
other players simply put this game is
all multiplayer the campaign is just
there to give you something to do when
you're bored the real and constant
objective is to raid other people to
take their resources and earn trophies
so you can make yourself stronger and
higher ranked it has a healthy base of
players from both Android and iOS all
competing against one another constantly
it's difficult and it requires thinking
and strategy to excel in our runner-up
in this category was eternity warriors 2
Lulu is an app unlike any other the
premise is women sign into it using
their Facebook accounts and then they
write men they can say good things or
bad things about them but the defining
characteristic is that men can't join so
what women are saying is completely
hidden so they can't see it this app has
encouraged negative and brutal
commentary from both men and women and
you know a woman only app is offensive
and terrible when even other women are
angry about it men can't opt out of it
unless they delete their Facebook
accounts and we're so sure that angry
jealous ex girlfriends are raiding men
objectively men don't like it and women
don't like it but it's still popular
somehow it's like the Jersey Shore of
Android apps our runner-up in this
category was the cyanogen mod installer
app our reversed game category was truly
a difficult category to decide upon we
in the media do not usually talk about
terrible games because well you really
don't want to hear about them so for
this we decided to go with the worst
possible game that we could find whether
it was popular or not and thus the Miley
Cyrus puzzle game okay let's take a look
at all the things this app does wrong
the gameplay is derivative and boring
even for children the celebrity cameo is
a blatant attempt to cash in on keyword
searches it doesn't help that the
pictures of miley cyrus are wildly
outdated the interface is gross and
uninteresting in short this game fails
on every conceivable level this game is
so bad that it's also our runner-up for
this category I had to play it to get
footage and I regret every moment of it
I wouldn't be surprised if it installed
malware also because it's the only other
thing it could possibly do wrong
market were game dev swing for the
fences this game was like bunting a foul
ball with two strikes don't download it
the worst app category was much easier
because there are few apps that bombed
as bad as Facebook home did this year
for those who may not know Facebook home
is a lunch a replacement app with such
breakneck features as folders and
Facebook integration I could sit here
for an hour and discuss all the reasons
why this app is terrible it doesn't
compete with other third-party launchers
on any valuable level in terms of
features or functionality the app sucks
so bad that it killed a smartphone and
somehow made HTC's feature look even
bleaker when your product is so bad that
it makes other companies look bad that's
about as low as you can go for shame
Facebook even though it's only been out
for a few weeks grand theft auto san
andreas is the epitome of what people
have been asking for in a game in this
game you play as an ex gangbanger named
Karl who returns to his old neighborhood
to seek revenge on the people who killed
his mother it's available in the Google
Play Store for 699 it has nearly
everything we could have asked for it
has dozens of hours of gameplay side
quests a big open world for gamers to
explore an actual storyline graphics
that aren't terrible and a lot more it's
not some puzzle game or gag game like
Angry Birds or temple run it's a
full-blown console level video game that
provides a full gaming experience here's
hoping we see more games of this caliber
and depth in the year 2014 and our
runner-up in this category was dead
trigger 2 at first we did everything in
our power to figure out if there was
another app that could go here because
we didn't want to mimic the Google Play
stores list in any way however we simply
couldn't avoid the facts duolingo is an
educational game that teaches people new
languages by using a combination of
voiced in text lessons and it is the
best app of the year what we wanted to
find were applications that push the
envelope further on Android sure there
were apps like timely and cal calendar
but those apps didn't really bring
anything new to the table they simply
took what was already there and made it
look better duolingo actually changed
things never before had an education app
garnered as much attention and show that
you can have useful successful education
apps with mass appeal if any genre
needed proof of this it was education
it's totally free to use and everyone
should speak multiple languages anyway
it's good for the brain this app should
be on every smartphone period and our
runner-up in this category was helium
