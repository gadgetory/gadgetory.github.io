smartphones for just about any size
nowadays Samsung has certainly been
making the rounds with their tab and
note devices of which there is now an 8
inch version and as a note tablet it
brought a little friend along age Josh
of Agartha manager authority what's
going on everybody
and this No
is the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 if you've
gotten used to 7 or 10 inch form factors
the note 8 is in the middle and it's
most similarly sized competitor is
probably the iPad Mini what you get here
is Samsung's signature plastic design
that is prone to fingerprints and can be
a little slick to the touch the 8 inch
screen is surrounded by a decent bezel
with the quintessential button layout at
the bottom the tactile home button
flanked by back and menu the rounded
look is basically all around though the
sides are thicker and flat enough to
grip around the back is just the 5
megapixel camera and down in the corner
is of course the s-pen as far as tablets
go this is a pretty thin device and 8
inches it's about as big a device can
get before one-handed grips are
impossible it is really pushing it
though the point of it however is that
you can lay the note 8 in one hand or
just barely grip it so that the other
one can tap in right away with the pen
for a reasonably priced 8-inch tablet
Samsung had to obviously make some
concessions this does sort of start with
the display with the barrage of 1080p
displays coming out these days the note
8 instead sports a TFT capacitive screen
capable of 1280 by 800 resolution and
189 PPI you can pretty much see the
difference right away due to the bloated
TouchWiz icons there is a decent
contrast and the saturation while quite
colorful still doesn't rival the Super
AMOLED found in Samsung smartphones the
pixel density leaves text looking decent
but somewhat pixelated when zoomed in
just right ultimately this is definitely
a good screen for reading and when
viewing pictures and videos it still
proves quite enjoyable it's not a bad
screen by any means you can just say it
just matches its price point now
performance on the note 8 happens to be
quite good a 1.6 gigahertz XC nose for a
quad-core processor
powers this tablet and does a good job
of it rolling through the elements
brought little-to-no stutters and any
pauses I might have run into were more
due to updating apps than sheer
performance
antutu gave this Note 8 a score close to
18 thousand which is still an impressive
score the mali-400 MP graphics and 2
gigabytes of RAM helped make gaming and
multitasking easy overall the note 8
should please pretty much anyone looking
for
snappy tablet experience the compromise
is taken to keep the note eight decently
price to continue with the hardware I
should note that while there is a phone
capable version available overseas we
get the Wi-Fi version here in the states
and in it you get the usual list of
connection capabilities like Bluetooth
GPS though in this version there is no
NFC and thus no SP 16 or 32 gigabyte
variants are available though a microSD
card slot on the side allows for
expansion of course the big story here
is the S Pen snapped into the bottom
corner the S Pen is a fixture of the
note 8 and it certainly awakens the
tablet when removed for the uninitiated
the S Pen is essentially a stylus with a
button for added functionality its
presence can be registered through taps
drags and even hovers over the sensitive
screen writing diagramming and even
general navigation are possible with the
S Pen and it is a big draw for this line
of Samsung's devices it's a very handy
piece of hardware to have and before
long you could start using it more than
your finger it's also worth noting that
you can now use the S Pen on the
capacitive keys
despite the portions of this tablet that
have been removed for affordability the
S Pen is definitely its ace in the hole
you would think that a 4,600 milliamp
hour battery could last for a really
long time for the non removable battery
unit in the Galaxy Note 8 however that
is mostly true after using this tablet
for about a week I was happy to see that
a whole day of moderate to heavy usage
was really no problem however once I had
the device ready for another day's work
it wouldn't last for too long on that
second outing average users will
definitely get just over 2 days from the
note 8 which is good but power users
might even be able to drain this battery
in one very busy day so battery life is
only very decent despite the high
capacity that the note hate is packing
the camera on the note aid works just
about how you would expect for tablet
optics the 5 megapixels and the lack of
a flash should give some of the story
away already though we all know taking
pictures with the tablet is a little
weird it's really there just in case you
need it that being said it gives only
decent photos and there are only a few
modes in the app like panorama or burst
shot it's not an exceptional performer
and is definitely there more as a
required feature than selling point
which brings us the software which is
TouchWiz through and through the bloated
and colorful elements returned with a
few adjustments in this jellybean 4.1.2
build you have the power widgets up top
in the notification drop-down and a
couple navigation additions like the
Palm motions as a straight user
interface there is not much else to say
until you factor in the s-pen with this
stylus you get a bevy of new ways to
perform multiple tasks a page body
function immediately shows you what you
can do with the s-pen the moment you
remove it as snow gives you a ton of
different ways of jotting down notes or
doing quick drawings but there is more
that the S Pen allows in navigation for
instance an air View function gives you
previews as you hover the pen over
certain elements and a quick commands
pop-up allows you to quickly jot down
search term or location to jump to the
button on the s-pen is important for
some of these extra functions as
pressing it down while doing the motion
will trigger the gesture my favorite in
particular is the cutout which lets you
surround a portion of the screen and
only capture that part the resulting
image can then be used for scrapbooking
or quick messaging as I said before it
doesn't take long for the S Pen to
become an extension of your fingers and
it's added functions do make it pretty
fun when you take it away however this
is just a classic Samsung experience
whether or not the S Pen will matter is
entirely up to you and finally price as
I've mentioned earlier that our
concessions made to ensure that the note
8 remains decently priced in the end
this Wi-Fi version of Samsung's tablet
comes in at $399 u.s. and so there you
have it it really boils down to just one
question how much are you willing to pay
for the s-pen it's obvious that this is
the main appeal for this tablet with its
lackluster camera only decent battery
life and the pretty typical TouchWiz
experience especially when you take away
the S Pen but in its size market the
Galaxy Note 8 does bring a pretty good
screen along with above-average
performance so for the average user
doing things like media consumption or
ebook reading will turn out to be a
pretty fun experience the S Pen does add
some functionality for productivity but
it's really up to you whether or not
that puts the Galaxy Note 8 over the top
