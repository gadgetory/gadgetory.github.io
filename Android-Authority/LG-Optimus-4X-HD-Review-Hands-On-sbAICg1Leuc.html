Clayton Norbert and Rhoda 30.com today
I've got the lovely lg optimus 4x HD
this is in the white version and this is
the 16 gigabyte model now we'll go over
some of the hardware on this phone and
then later in the video we'll review
some of the software as you can see here
we've got a Corning Gorilla Glass 4.7
inch true HD IPS display IPS stands for
in plane switching which the liquid
crystals are arranged in a way that it
provides a great viewing angle it's a
lot different than the Samsung or the
sama LED devices that Samsung has been
putting out anyways we'll go to the back
see we have our speaker port this is our
charging port and then we have our
headphone jack our power button is
located right here on the top and then
we have our volume rocker right here up
and down so we'll peel the back off
really quick just to expose what's in
there as you can see here we've got our
removable 20 150 milli amp battery now
that's more battery power than the HTC
One series or the galaxy s3 by 50
milliamps we've got our internal storage
expansion where we can put our mini SD
cards in here I've got 4 gigabytes in
there external storage and then we have
our sim card slot and this might be
available for AT&amp;amp;T users but it's at the
FCC right now so we'll just see what
happens in the US anyways we'll just put
this back on goes back on with the
breeze all you have to do is just press
it sleek form factor really solid phone
it's nice in the hands it's not too
light and it's built really well anyways
we'll turn on this beautiful display as
you can see here we have our lock screen
and when we press it we can basically
press anywhere and then just swipe it
open to unlock it so we'll unlock that
and we're greeted with our lovely
optimus 3.0 user interface now this is a
skin that LG puts on the Android 4.0
operating system much like Samsung might
incorporate TouchWiz or HTC uses sense
but this is LG's it's really nice it's
not bloated there's not a lot of
bloatware on this phone when you get it
and so that's another plus but anyway so
we can just go through some of the
hardware this phone has a Tegra 3 quad
core processor
which is insane this is a very fast
processor and in fact has another v core
that operates at 1500 megahertz to keep
the phone running in a idle state now if
you're not doing something that's
graphically intensive or you're just
doing a small task you might be
operating on that v core just to keep
you moving at a slow pace and not kill
your battery but this does have great
battery life anyways we'll pull down the
status bar get to some of the quick
actions we can do here we've got our
quick memo vibrate Wi-Fi we've got
Bluetooth airplane mode rotation
brightness and NFC now an MSc is a
really cool feature I'll get into that
in a minute
we can go to our settings menu and see
here we've got our Wi-Fi Bluetooth the
usual things incorporated in the cell
phone when it comes all of our settings
here LG's done a nice job of a you know
not bloating this device and not packing
it with too much garbage you don't want
we'll just scroll through the apps we've
got our downloads and widgets as well
we'll just check out some of the apps
such as the camera there's a lot of cool
intuitive features having to do with the
camera so we'll just open her up now we
see here of course I'm just shooting my
white background here but we will get an
idea for how fast this camera is right
now just snap a few pictures in my hand
and I'm basically just firing as fast as
I can right now we don't have a rapid
shot like on the HTC One X or G Galaxy
s3 but we did get a few pictures off
it's basically the speed of maybe the
Galaxy Nexus we've got our front-facing
camera where we can see what's going on
in the front so there's that we've got
our zoom feature
there's my fingers and we can go back
this is our autofocus basically
controlled by our finger when we're in
the camera mode we've got our self timer
and settings optimized for Time Machine
slot
so take a picture with that and the time
machines slot I must give us the options
to share or set as something anyways
we'll just go back from that we've got
our camera settings which include the
brightness the focus the image size the
focus has auto or face tracking auto
will give you automatic and face
tracking is where you can tap on
someone's face or the screen we've got
our image size seed mode I saw a white
balance color effects the timer
geo-tagging we can turn off our shutter
sound and we can choose where to store
it whether it be in our internal storage
or in our SD card we've got our camera
help guide now anyways we can go to our
video recorder and on our video recorder
we have some of the cool Ice Cream
Sandwich things like the big mouth big
eyes small Mouse small mouth excuse me a
lot of just the funny animations that
come on the Ice Cream Sandwich operating
system and also include some backgrounds
or in space put the device on the steady
surface I might as well just do that oh
and it's like a nice little green screen
I can say hello to Andy how you doing
man how's space whoo that's cool if my
hand wasn't on a white surface I'm sure
this would be a lot better green screen
but that's a cool feature anyways we
will just exit from that and I'll give
you an idea of some of the cool stuff
you can do with the camcorder whoops I
keep pressing the stinking button there
oh and we're going to want that so
anyways here's our camcorder you can see
that I've got my hand there just for the
sake of the video and I'll record a
video just move my hand along here all
we need is some footage just so I can
show you some stuff on here thumbs up
peace out please now we'll go to our
gallery we can check that movie out and
while viewing that movies we can
actually slow it down in real time
and we'll bring it back and actually
speed it up this time so we can have
live tracking of the time with the
videos we can slow it down or speed it
up and we can also track with this where
we want to view in the video we can
slide this along and see basically a
timeline of what we recorded there's a
lot of cool features with the camera
there and we have our nother settings
here we can get to the other videos
we've taken anyways some of the other
stuff we'll just go to the music player
now I've got power amp installed because
I prefer that but we'll go to the stock
LG music player just show you how it
operates and we should find it right
here it is themed with our icons there
and we'll be able to just go to a nice
song here sounds nice we can turn it up
this has some Dolby audio built in and
it sounds nice with the headphones at LG
provided as well there's our Dolby
insert ear jack to use the Dolby mode I
guess and we can navigate away and see
that our music was still running up here
in the status bar and we'll do one of
our quick memo apps actually so let's
say I'm listening to this guy and I want
my buddy to listen to the same song
quick mode and bring this whoops you can
actually do that and I'll erase this and
I will use the red pen so we can see we
have a lot of different pen options
there
and we have a crude memo telling my
buddy to listen to some chroma star
anyways that's a really intuitive
feature though because no matter what
app you're in you can just pull down the
Quick Menu or though give me the quick
memo and you can just pop her down you
can even just put it on a blank canvas
like that
or you can just do it on the surf so
what you're working with and we can
either save it or just discard it by
pressing back anyways that's our music
player all right let's check out some of
the web browsing on this bad boy
it says Ice Cream Sandwich so there's a
revamp browser and see we have our
little lg tab right here we have the
back and forward buttons we also have
our zoom in our add it to avid bookmarks
if we add a tab it'll bring us to Google
I believe I'm connected to the Wi-Fi
check out our bookmarks we've got our
history most visited and we've got our
saved pages which I have none let's go
back this is our tab sorting utility
just swipe left and right to get the
tabs away that we have open and it will
search for android authority
there we go there's a nice little button
for calm on the keyboard but the
spacebar is a little tiny and I need to
connect to Wi-Fi so was it low as I'm
just gonna show you some of the settings
menu here
stop save to bookmarks go to home page
share page find on page you can request
the desktop site I love that because I
hate the mobile sites
save it for offline we'll check out the
labs and we can activate some quick
controls go back
we'll just refresh the page see we don't
have our little lg tab here anymore we
can move our finger in to the left and
we have our Google Labs add the tabs
we've got our tab utilities open a new
browser window bookmarks and this
settings once again we can go back to
labs cuz I want to turn it off and
got our general settings we can set our
homepage toolbar form autofill privacy
and security accessibility advanced
bandwidth and check in for another video
about more of the software having to do
with this beast of a phone you guys
because we'll have one up so stay in
tune with Android authority comm and
subscribe to our YouTube if you like the
videos guys catch you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
