authority now personally I think
wireless charging technology should be
built into every mid-range and high-end
phone unfortunately it isn't but I think
it should be built in because it frees
us at least in part from all those cable
nests that we have here I get some help
here if you do own a phone that has
wireless charging you probably didn't
get a wireless charging pad when you
bought your phone today I'm going to
look at three of the top-selling pads
and see how they work and how they
perform so before we go on to look at
the individual wireless charging pads
and test their performance I wanted to
look quickly at how wireless charging
works back in 1831 Michael Faraday
discovered electromagnetic induction
where electricity is made by passing a
magnet through a coil of wire today we
use this phenomenon for a wide range of
applications including transformers
electric motors generators solenoids and
wireless charging ok to show how
wireless charging works I want us just
to do two very quick experiments I went
down to my local hardware store what I
have here is a nail I wrapped it round
with some thin copper wire I've got one
end here already attached to a 9-volt
battery I'm now going to attach the
other end to the 9-volt battery and I
want to show you that what we get is an
electromagnet okay so that's basically
current running through a coil will
produce a magnetic field now that's an
important principle so what Faraday
discovered was the fact that this
principle works in Reverse now I have
here a coil of copper wire wrapped
around a nail I have to project to my
multimeter normally we would use a
galvanometer but I don't have one so I'm
just going to use a multimeter and I
have here a magnet now what happens is
when you bring the magnet close to the
coil in fact normally through the coil
you get a tiny bit of electricity
created I'm going to zoom in now to the
multimeter so you can see this tiny bit
of current that's being generated now
for Chi charging it always
a lot more complicated a lot more
sophisticated but it's the basic
principle magnetic fields and coils can
generate current which charges the phone
for my testing I chose three popular
Wireless charges Samsung's official
Wireless Qi charging station the anchor
ultra slim wireless charging pad and the
ravpower Wireless Qi charging pad to
test the wireless charging pad I've come
up with three criteria first of all how
easy is it to align the phone onto the
wireless charging pad secondly what
feedback do I get from the pad that the
phone is properly aligned and then it is
now charging and thirdly how long does
it take to charge now for all three pads
I'm using the same phone the galaxy s6
edge now for some context the s6 Edge
has a 2600 milliamp hour battery and
using Samsung's wired quick charger that
comes with the phone it will charge in
about 1 hour and 20 minutes from 0 to
100% there are two more things I want to
mention first the charging cycle of a
lithium-ion battery is performed in two
stages this is true of standard wired
charging for quick charging and for
wireless charging
during the first stage a constant
current is applied to the battery they
when the batteries around 80 to 90
percent fall depending on the exact
design the current will be lowered but
the voltage will remain the same the
second thing is that to measure the
voltage the current being used by the
charger I use an inline USB volt and amp
meter however this will only tell me the
current and voltage being used by the
charger itself
it can't reveal what is happening at the
coils
the Samsung is the first of our circular
pads which we are testing whereas the
anchor wants to be ultra slim the
Samsung pad brings some shape and design
the lower half of the charger is smaller
and it curves up to a full pad the top
of the pad is ringed by an LED strip
which allows a notification like to be
easily seen and on top of the pad is a
silicon circle which holds your phone in
place aligning the phone the pad is easy
enough you just need to put the center
of the phone in the center of the pad
and you can place in any orientation
that you like when you place a phone on
the pad you get a nice reassuring blue
glow from the ring around the top of the
charger if you're using a galaxy s6 or
s6 edge and I guess a note 5 or an S 6 +
edge then the LED goes green when the
phone is charged charging time was just
over 2 hours and 40 minutes from 0 to
100% the Charter draws 6 watts of power
fairly consistently until the battery
reaches around 90% of the charge then it
starts a tail off at the end of the
charge cycle it was drawing around 2.5
watts
allowing the phone on the anchor is
simple enough you basically just need to
put the center of the phone into the
center of the pad since the pad is
circular you can place the phone any
orientation you like it doesn't need to
be straight up down or horizontal there
is however no rubber or silicone on the
pad so it's the most slippery of the
three having said that I didn't have any
trouble getting the phone to stay on the
pad however the phone might be prone to
being moved off-center if you bump into
your desk accidentally the pad doesn't
come with any kind of beeper or buzzer
and the only indication from the pad
that you are charging the phone comes
from a small LED unfortunately LED can
be easily obscured by your phone if you
place it with the end overhanging the
LEDs position however your phone should
also give an indication that it is
charging correctly or alternatively it
isn't hard to form the habit of avoiding
certain orientations so the LED is
always visible in terms of charging
performance the anchor performed just as
well as the Samsung and the ravpower it
charged from zero to 100% in around two
hours and 40 minutes the pad was using
around 6 watts of power for the first
couple of hours until the battery
reached around 80% and then it started
to decrease slowly at first until about
90% and then more sharply as the battery
reached its full charge
unlike the other two charging as the
ravpower is rectangular rather than
circular personally I prefer this design
as it defines very clearly where the
phone should be placed however like the
other pad you don't actually need to
place the phone long ways to match the
pads design you can actually place it at
any angle as long as the center of the
phone is in the center of the pad
it's also worth mentoring that the white
circle around the power symbol in the
middle of the pad is an anti-slip
silicon which helps minimize slipping or
movement due to NOx as well as an LED
that shows the phone has been placed
correctly on the pad the ravpower also
has a built-in beeper with sound when a
good connection has been made this gives
you a reassurance that everything is
working as expected the performance of
the pad is very similar to that of the
other two it takes around 2 hours and 40
minutes to charge the Samsung Galaxy s6
from 0 to 100% the charger draws over 6
watts of power for just the first 2
hours until the battery gets close to
90% full then it starts to decline
eventually dipping to under 3 watts as
the battery reaches its full charge
so what does all this mean well the
first thing we learn and it may be a bit
obvious but it's worth pointing out is
that wireless charging is slower than
why it's charging especially if your
phone has a quick charge technology
built into it the second thing we see is
that all the pads charge the phone in
exactly the same amount of time 2 hours
and 40 minutes now this is because the
chesse standard specifies how much power
can be transferred from the pad to the
phone and all the pads have imprinted
that standard very well in fact they
could all be using the same components I
have no idea so the third thing we
really understand is that you're buying
decision will be based on price on
design and on functionality and not
necessarily on how quickly the pad
charges the phone and so there we have
it I personally was expecting there to
be a difference in the performance of
the different wireless charging pads but
what we found out is that they're all
the same within maybe one minute of each
other personally I was quite surprised
about that my name is Gary Sims mandrill
authority I hope you enjoyed this video
if you did please do give it a thumbs up
also don't forget to subscribe to and
royal authority YouTube channel and also
please leave some comments below to tell
me what you think about wireless
charging do you have a wireless charging
pad do you use it do you have any good
experiences any bad experiences and as
for me I'll see you in my next video
