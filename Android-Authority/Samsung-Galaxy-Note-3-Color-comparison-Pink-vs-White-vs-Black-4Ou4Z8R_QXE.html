what's going on everybody and we were
here at peplum digital focus one of the
events that happens alongside Aoife ad
for Lin rather Grand Hyatt Hotel in the
middle of potsdamer platz it's a
beautiful area but here at the Samsung
booth at Capcom we wanted to show you
the Galaxy Note 3 once again but this
time in the various ways that you can
get it and here we have three different
colors that are available to you of
course all three of them have the
wonderful new backing that is available
the textured plastic that almost makes
you feel like it's leather because the
stitching that you see on the sides but
we just want to sort of show you the
ways that they do look in these three
different colors so as you can see you
do have the black on black the usual
white as well the one that you might
know very well especially from the
Galaxy S series but also you do have
this hot pink here so we're looking at
here is the hot pink version
you know it doesn't matter who you are
if you are into pink this is actually a
good way of representing that so turning
on the screen the screen does look very
good with that pink color around it thin
bezels and is still a great way of
expressing your love for this color so
just kind of going through the elements
right now we're doing here you still
have the silver sides the silver lining
to all of the power button is that the
camera itself has a bit of a rose gold
going on there
then of course the and itself comes in a
lovely pink color
so this is just a color comparison of
these three phones we'll go ahead and
put that one aside we'll go for the
classic white over here
there you are of course we all know that
the light looks really great on the
Samsung phone in this case you don't
even have the fingerprint see because of
the wonderful new back so that's what we
have
they're the classic white screen still
looks great with the white outlining but
some people might prefer
a more black outline to their screen
because it really helps accentuate what
the screen is showing it and as you can
see here that is definitely the case
it's very very nice here you really the
screen really pops out because the black
around it is a contrast to the colors
and the brightness that you get from it
and then if and then what I mentioned
before was that stitching on the sides
that definitely make it feel like this
is more like leather rather than just
plastic it's a very very nice touch that
they they've done on this but overall
the biggest part about these phones is
the update to detects replies gracious
brilliant alright so these are just the
color comparisons on these of course the
unique one in this in this one is the
pink one here where you have the classic
white in black so once again we're here
at pep comm digital focus at Aoife in
Berlin stay tuned because we are Android
