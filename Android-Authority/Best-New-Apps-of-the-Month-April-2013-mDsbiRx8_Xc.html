Hindy the android authority app guy
after the intro we'll be talking about
the best apps of april 2013 first on our
list is a game called Cut the Rope this
is a very good looking at simple puzzle
game that takes an old crusty puzzle
game formula and helps freshen it up a
little bit it does a pretty good job too
at the time of this video it's rocking a
4.9 rating in the Google Play Store that
should give you a clue as to how good it
is here's how the game works you have to
feed two adorable little monsters candy
and every round to do so you must /
ropes and chains use special powers and
overcome obstacles to get the candy to
each monster each level gets a little
bit harder and instead of assigning 3
stars based on score the 3 stars are
actually in the level and you must
collect them both free and paid versions
are available in the Google Play Store
if you've played the first three dozen
hunters from Gameloft then you know what
kind of game to expect from Dungeon
Hunter 4 for those who don't know
Dungeon Hunter 4 is a hack and slash RPG
where you explore places kill bad guys
and learn new skills unlike the previous
three games the fourth reportedly has a
decent storyline some Google Play
reviewers have gone so far as to say
this is what the previous three versions
should have been aside from having an
improved storyline the game has improved
pretty much everything else to graphics
controls the works if you want to get
into a new dungeon crawling RPG you
could do much worse than Dungeon Hunter
4 FL Studio is among the most popular
software's and people use to make music
while it may not compare professionally
to some things like garageband or pro
tools FL Studio has a solid set of
features and is definitely more fun to
play with for beginners iOS has had a
mobile version for a while and now so
does android it runs it a pretty hefty
price tag of 1999 but for that you get
most of the FL studio experience the
interface will be familiar to people who
have used the software but not overly
difficult to learn if you've never used
it before there are a few features
missing from the other versions of FL
Studio and a few people have had
problems installing it but once the
kinks get worked out this is an awesome
app for audio production for Android
this next step is another puzzle game
and it's called them floor escape this
is a simple game that will have you
clicking dragging tapping and tilting
your phone to solve puzzles as you try
or by floor to access the elevator to
escape somewhere it's a wanted ly simple
but surprisingly addictive premise only
a few of the puzzles repeat themselves
such as putting things in their proper
spots but the games
to find a unique way of making you do it
it's fun addictive simple and some of
the puzzles are genuinely difficult to
figure out not impossibly so but we came
across a couple of noodle scratchers
next on our list is Iron Man 3 and
consequently the second gameloft game to
make the list this month this is
actually a really nice game when it
works properly the graphics are really
good for a mobile game the controls are
good and the gameplay is fast-paced the
only issue we had with it where there
were a couple of parts of the menu that
lagged even on the Nexus 4 otherwise
everything went swimmingly it's free to
download and play in the Google Play
Store and unlike most free runner games
this one actually has a storyline who'd
have thought it ninja SMS is a unique
SMS handling application that is really
nice for people who text a whole bunch
instead of notifications and having an
app to open ninja SMS opens a small
window whenever you get a text message
you then open the window reply close the
window and go back to whatever it was
you were doing this takes significantly
less time than opening the texting app
replying backing out of the text app and
then reopening the app you are running
so people who send a bunch of texts
every day will barn this pretty handy
and the main app you can change things
like theme and who your favorite
contacts are the next step on our list
is surprisingly popular for how simple
it is and it's called split camera for
Instagram it's a simple camera
application that's meant to do just one
thing take split pictures for some
unique shots for your social media sites
it's pretty simple to use and you can
really take some imaginative shots with
it the first thing you do is take a
picture of something then you take a
picture of a second thing and the app
combines the two into a single picture
you can take a picture of the same thing
from different angles or different
things you can also share to social
media sites that aren't Instagram the
last step on our list is when we're all
familiar with the venerable swipe
application true this app has been
available for a long time in various
ways OEM is Pakatan is a stock keyboard
on many phones and getting the swype
beta isn't all that difficult however
swipe is now finally available in the
Google Play Store as a standalone
application that's right no more hoops
to jump through or any nonsense you can
now just go to the Google Play Store
download swype for a buck and have it
whenever you need it this is especially
great for people who want the official
stable swipe instead of the occasionally
buggy beta version the several year long
wait is over swipe is now available to
all without exception if you take a
gander at our leaderboard you can see
how these apps stack up against one
another as usual this isn't our personal
ranking system this is based on the
ratings in the Google
a store which means this is how you the
consumer rated them there is no bios on
our part to check these apps out we put
the links to all of them in the video
description so you can check them out at
your leisure once again I'm Joe Hindy
