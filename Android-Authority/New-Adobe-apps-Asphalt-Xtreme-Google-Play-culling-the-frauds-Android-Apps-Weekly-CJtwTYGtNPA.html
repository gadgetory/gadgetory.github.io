handy the Android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 164 so let's get
started a report released this week
indicated that YouTube read only has
about 1.5 million subscribers several
things have contributed to this number
for starters YouTube read doesn't have a
ton of original content and no really
big hits yet they also don't advertise
it very often despite the low numbers
YouTube is fairly happy with their
growth and have decided to move forward
with creating more original content
giffy offered up its services to the
beleaguered vine users this last week
the service expressed that it wants to
turn all of those seven-second vines
into gifs and give them a permanent home
on Goofy's web site it will be launching
a tool that will not only turn those
videos into gifs but also hosts the
videos themselves it could be a big move
for giffy as they are the most popular
gift providers out there right now
Google Play is going to start cracking
down on applications that try to use
devious means to improve their rankings
for years now applications have been
able to get fake reviewers to leave tons
of positive reviews to give them a
better ranking than they probably
deserve a new backend feature is going
to try to stop that from happening
developers that engage with it will have
their efforts toward and repeat
offenders will simply have their
applications taken down this is great
news
IFTTT made some big decisions this last
week it has ditched the recipes moniker
in exchange for athletes they have also
added new functionality into APIs to
make them more powerful than they were
before on top of that they have merged
all of their mobile applications into a
single one that's also after IFTTT was
added into Google assistant big things
are happening with this application and
this company and it's been a whole lot
of fun to watch the latest Google Play
newsletter arrived at our doorsteps to
tell us about the top trending
applications from October of 2016
they were flip share the meal anchor
LinkedIn learning and CNN mobile and on
the game side of things PewDiePie's
tuber simulator FIFA mobile soccer
frozen freefall icy shot Dan the man and
shuffle cats for the top trending games
if you downloaded any of those
congratulations you were part of the
statistic brave browser got every
released this last week meanwhile the
previous brave browser went back to
being link bubble the new brave browser
has most of the features of the ole
so there aren't many changes for those
who have used the browser before for
those who don't know brave browser
offers ad blocking at privacy protection
and security features along with a
fairly simple browsing experience it's a
free application if you want to check it
out
the trail is the latest game out of
Peter Polly knew for those who don't
know he's the guy who also did go to
splack and white fable and other games
in this title you'll be walking along a
trail while you do a variety of other
things you'll be able to craft and trade
items make a fortune and join towns in
order to create communities it also
features some charming if somewhat retro
graphics the trail is a freemium game
though and it has the usual pitfalls the
life stage is kind of like snapchat but
for high school kids the basic premise
is that you make little videos and then
post them for everybody to see the
difference being that only people from
your high school can see it every post
is public and you'll be asked to
identify stuff that you liked in that
you don't like it definitely needs a
little bit of work and the application
doesn't feel like the kind of quality
you'd expect from Facebook however if
they can work out the kinks and make
sure no creepy older people join in it
could be a lot of fun for kids the
latest game in the asphalt series has
finally hit Google Play Prior titles in
the series gave you tons of cars and
tracks to race them asphalt Xtreme
differs from these by giving you things
like monster trucks sports utility
vehicles and other similar vehicles
you'll then be racing them on a variety
of off-road courses it maintains a lot
of the things that made prior games fun
and fans of the series should be able to
just jump right in like the prior titles
it is a freemium game Adobe released not
one but three applications this last
week the first one was Adobe comp CC
which allows you to layout ideas using
photos text shapes and more
the second was Adobe Photoshop sketch
which allows you to sketch using layers
which can then be exported to
illustrator or Photoshop
finally Photoshop fixed was released
which allows you to retouch and edit
photos using tools like red eye removal
Spot Healing clone and others all three
applications are free to download but
you'll need an Adobe Creative Cloud
account in order to take full advantage
there in the Google Play Store right now
for even more Android apps and games
