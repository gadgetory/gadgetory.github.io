but when I fix it did a repairability
video on the much-anticipated galaxy
note 7 they gave it a sad score of 4 out
of 10 ouch the team at iFixit have put
their screwdrivers and plastic pride
tools to work on the shiny new Galaxy
Note 7 and awarded the phone a rather
dismal repairability score of just 4 out
of 10 while this is admittedly an
improvement over the galaxy s7 which
scored just three out of 10 the note 7
has the same easy to break and hard to
replace curved display glass and having
glass on both the front and back makes
for double crack ability on the positive
side i fix it notes that a lot of the
components on the note 7 are modular and
therefore easily replaceable if
something goes wrong of course accessing
the interior of the device without
breaking either the display or the glass
back is a bit of a problem I fix it also
notes that the improved cable routing
means that on the galaxy note 7 the
charging port assembly can be removed
without having to take the screen off
this is big news as charging ports are
usually one of the first things to go on
any smartphone so removing the
possibility of damaging the display when
replacing that is a big plus now it
should go without saying here that
unless you are at the very highest level
of geekery pay someone else to do this
don't try it at home your phone will
suffer I know oops alright nothing to
see here move along let's talk about
Google's new duo a video calling app
Google highlighted the simplicity of duo
an app that lacks the bells and whistles
of skype or even Google's own hangouts
they say this duel takes the complexity
out of video calling so that you can be
together in the moment wherever you are
said the company simple as it may be duo
is not completely bare bones one of its
coolest features is knock knock which
basically lets you see the person who's
calling before picking up you also get
end-to-end encryption which aligns with
Google and Facebook and Apple when it
comes to protecting users privacy now as
of just two days ago dual was available
to some users on the google play store
we expect that they're going to be
rolling out pretty soon but
more importantly it is available both on
iOS and Android meaning that mother
Google is going to take on FaceTime and
you know who else is going to take on
Apple Xiaomi right in their own backyard
Xiaomi is no longer just a start-up
known as the apple of China China's
largest privately funded startup is
preparing to enter the US market at
least according to Bloomberg even just a
few years ago Xiaomi was simply unknown
outside of China and what took off as a
start-up became one of the top three
smartphone makers in 2014 with a
beautifully crafted handset that cost
less than four hundred dollars it makes
sense that Xiaomi has seen big success
now of course the major issue for xiaomi
and many chinese manufacturers is the
fact that their competitors have
previously sold their phones through US
carriers so how will shall me deal with
that Hugo Barra shamis VP spoke about
that the u.s. is a market we definitely
have in our sights we will lead with
social media with the channels that
allow us to get in touch with the young
generation that are enthusiastic about
new technology we're definitely going
there so how will show me plan to do
that exactly well likely by selling you
their phones directly online completely
sidestepping the carrier altogether and
with great phones and come on they make
great phones at such a bargain price
that's a pretty compelling offer hey
android army Jase here hope you guys are
well I'm really sorry that this week's
weekly is late but my camera died and so
I had to scramble to get a new camera
and get everything set up but we're here
let me know if you have any comments or
questions below i'm also on twitter
