but when I fix it did a repair ability
video on the much-anticipated Galaxy
Note 7 they gave it a sad score of 4 out
of 10 ouch the team and I fix that have
put their screwdrivers and plastic pride
tools to work on the shiny new Galaxy
Note 7 and awarded the phone a rather
dismal repair ability score of just 4
out of 10 while this is admittedly an
improvement over the Galaxy s7 which
scored just 3 out of 10 the note 7 has
the same easy to break and hard to
replace curved display glass and having
glass on both the front and back makes
for double crack ability on the positive
side iFixit notes that a lot of the
components on the note 7 are modular and
therefore easily replaceable if
something goes wrong of course
accessing the interior of the device
without breaking either the display or
the glass back is a bit of a problem I
fix it also notes that the improved
cable routing means that on the Galaxy
Note 7 the charging port assembly can be
removed without having to take the
screen off this is big news as charging
ports are usually one of the first
things to go on any smart phone so
removing the possibility of damaging the
display when replacing that is a big
plus now it should go without saying
here that unless you are at the very
highest level of geekery pay someone
else to do this don't try it at home
your phone will suffer I know
oops alright nothing to see here move
along let's talk about Google's new duo
a video calling app Google highlighted
the simplicity of duo an app that lacks
the bells and whistles of Skype or even
Google's own hangouts they say this dual
takes the complexity out of video
calling so that you can be together in
the moment wherever you are said the
company simple as it may be duo is not
completely bare-bones
one of its coolest features is
knock-knock which basically lets you see
the person who's calling before picking
up
you also get end-to-end encryption which
aligns with Google and Facebook and
Apple when it comes to protecting users
privacy now as of just two days ago dual
was available to some users on the
Google Play Store we expect that they're
gonna be rolling out pretty soon
but more importantly it is available
both on iOS and Android
meaning that Mother Google is gonna take
on FaceTime
and you know who else is gonna take on
Apple Xiaomi right in their own backyard
Xiaomi is no longer just a start-up
known as the apple of China China's
largest privately funded startup is
preparing to enter the US market at
least according to Bloomberg even just a
few years ago Xiaomi was simply unknown
outside of China and what took off as a
start-up became one of the top three
smartphone makers in 2014 with a
beautifully crafted handset that cost
less than four hundred dollars it makes
sense that Xiaomi has seen big success
now of course the major issue for Xiaomi
and many Chinese manufacturers is the
fact that their competitors have
previously sold their phones through US
carriers so how will Xiaomi deal with
that Hugo Barra Xiaomi as VP spoke about
that the u.s. is a market we definitely
have in our sights we will lead with
social media with the channels that
allow us to get in touch with the young
generation that are enthusiastic about
new technology we're definitely going
there so how will Xiaomi plan to do that
exactly well likely by selling you their
phones directly online completely
sidestepping the carrier altogether and
with great phones and come on they make
great phones at such a bargain price
that's a pretty compelling offer hey
Android army chase here hope you guys
are well I'm really sorry that this
week's weekly is late but my camera died
and so I had to scramble to get a new
camera and get everything set up but
we're here let me know if you have any
comments or questions below
I'm also on Twitter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
