rumors and just different renders they
are finally here we are out here at the
pixel event this is the pixel 3 and this
is the pixel 3 XL
now if you look at these from my design
perspective they look really really
similar to the pixel 2 in pixel to excel
at least on the back they've got that
same googly curve but you can see on the
back here instead of doing a glass and
then aluminum they've actually got glass
and then glass again it's actually
Gorilla Glass 5 but they've got this
soft touch on the back which really
differentiates the main glass from this
back glass and this allows for a lot of
different things that pixels haven't
traditionally had but I'm really glad to
see they're adding them in like wireless
charging and ip68 water resistance and
the wireless charging is fast wireless
charging - you can pick up this pixel
stand for $79 which adds this fast
wireless charging capability it also
kind of turns it into a little mini
Google home so you can use it to talk to
the Google assistant and you can also
wake up to the morning with your alarm
and kind of shut it off as if you were
using a normal alarm now if we move to
the front of the phones it's obvious
here that these screens are much much
better than they were last year we had
that weird blue tint issue with the
Google pixel 2 XL but that is definitely
not the case here these are still OLED
screens so you're gonna get those deep
blacks and those white whites but I'm
not really seeing any blue shift here at
all it's really just looks amazing the
pixel 3 XL is qHD and the pixel 3 is
going to be 1080p and of course this
pixel 3 XL is going to have that giant
notch and yeah the leaks and rumors were
true the notch is pretty much bigger
than any other notches we've seen before
but the thing that this knotch
adds is a wide angle camera and the
pixel 3 also has this wide-angle camera
but you're not getting quite as much
screen real estate as you are on the 3
XL now what this wide-angle camera does
is allows you for to take these group
selfies and group shots but you really
just couldn't get in the pixels before
it when you're in the camera app you can
zoom out from the main sensor and just
kind of get a much wider field of view
and I think that's really important to
get in phones especially when you're
taking a lot of group selfies or just
selfies with you and a friend there are
other cold portrait mode capabilities
like the
to black and white everything around you
and make you and the store the subject
just really pop out and you can also do
things like adjusting the aperture after
you take the photo which is something
that we saw in a lot of other phones
this year as far as the rear cameras go
we're still just getting one rear camera
on each of these devices and Google
seems to be wanting to tell the world
yes we can do just as quality of a job
as everyone else with one rear camera
the portrait mode here is still really
really good and Google is saying that
they have better edge detection than
last year there's also oh is in these
lenses you should get some really
buttery video there's also things like
focus tracking so you can track on a
certain object while they're moving and
it should keep focus the entire time
another cool camera feature that Google
showed off is this new night mode camera
feature which allows you to take photos
in really underexposed areas and it will
raise them to make them look a lot
better than they did previously now this
takes a few seconds to work but it looks
really amazing in the demo and we're
really excited to get our hands on this
feature when it launches later this
month so now we've got to talk about the
hardware and these are still pretty
flagship phones they're running
snapdragon 845 64 to 128 gigabytes of
storage and 4 gigabytes of RAM and a lot
of people are a little bit worried about
that but Google has always been about
software and not really that much about
hardware so we're hoping that Google has
optimized Android enough to work pretty
well with 4 gigabytes of RAM we're gonna
have to see how this holds up in the
future the Google pistol 3 and Google
pixel 3 XL are coming in clearly white
just black and not pink and the not pink
has this little orange power button
while the clearly white is getting this
little teal power button if you want the
just black phone you're just getting a
black power button so that's effectively
been it I hope you guys have enjoyed our
hands-on of the Google pixel 3 and pixel
3 excel if you want more details head
over to our site Android Authority comm
because we got a ton of articles
detailing all the new things that
Google's announced here and stay tuned
for future videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
