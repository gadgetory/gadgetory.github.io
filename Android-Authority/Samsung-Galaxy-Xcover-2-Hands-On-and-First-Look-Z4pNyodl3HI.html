phones that we're seeing at the Samsung
booth at mwc we have this interestingly
rugged-looking common and for good
reason because it actually is pretty
damn rugged it is the Samsung Galaxy
Xcover to a bit of an odd game doesn't
necessarily roll off the tongue right
away but nonetheless you're looking at a
phone here that can withstand the
elements so you have a very hard shell
cover over here it is waterproof it does
provide for a lot of protection and it
should be able to withstand up to one
meter of depth if you're if you happen
to drop it in a large pool perhaps but
nonetheless as you can see there's a
very very industrial design on the back
there is a lock down here to make sure
that the back cover does not come right
off not very easy to do with my nail
there but nonetheless it provides a lot
of rejection the camera on the back is a
5 megapixel camera have a vga camera on
the front right here as you can see it
just looks like it kind of looks like a
phone that you would have seemed like
animatrix or something very very steep
almost steampunk like as a matted feel
around the entire phone so she in the
back pretty much everywhere except on
the screen and maybe the side
these little lines right here to know
that this thing this thing is pretty
tough you do get jelly bean 4.1 in here
and a 1 gigahertz dual-core processor
with one gigabyte of RAM with your knees
alright so we're just kind of taking a
look at the galaxy xcover 2 because it
is perhaps samsung's foray into the
absolutely absolutely rugged and sturdy
phone market so if you're somebody that
loves to go hiking or if you really just
want to take out all your frustrations
on your phone throw it everywhere this
is the phone for you the samsung galaxy
xcover 2 so once again it is joshua

has to offer in its galaxy line here on
