forgot what this place look like but
tech news kept chugging along and first
up is some pretty sweet-looking hardware
and that sweet look and hardware is the
honor magic it's now official
but first the bad news this phone is
only slated to be sold in huawei's home
country of China it will be available
from several retailers including the
Mall JDT Mall and sunning it's possible
that honor will bring the magic to other
markets but there's no official
statement on the matter but the honor
magic is supposed to feature some
interesting AI elements one of these
standout features is the wise screen
which combines a sensor in its frame and
an infrared sensor in the front-facing
camera what exactly does this do when
the owner of the honor Magic picks up
the phone the frame sensor and the
camera are supposed to recognize the
owners hands and eyes which then turns
on the screen when the phone is put down
by the owner or put away in the pocket
the screen is supposed to turn off in
one second another feature is called
face code intelligent recognition any
message notifications on your phone will
only reveal themselves to pre-registered
faces that means you shouldn't have to
worry about anyone picking up your phone
and seeing messages they're not supposed
to see now let's talk everyone's
favorite topic Google specifically
Google driverless cars Google has just
announced that it plans to spin off its
self-driving car project into a
standalone company called
lame-o the new company stands for quote
a new way forward in mobility according
to John Kasich CEO of way moe
this news corroborates early reports
that Google would drop its plan to build
vehicles with no steering wheels or
pedals the reports noted that Google
would instead focus on the technology
powering these cars that can be
installed in third-party vehicles God
dang Google you're smart that's smart
way Moe isn't completely ditching its
dream to create a fully driverless
vehicle without steering wheels and
pedals though craft succes that back in
October 2015
one of
fully driverless cars without steering
wheels or pedals drove around in quote
everyday traffic on the streets of
Austin Texas while Google now way Moe
has certainly accomplished a great deal
in the self-driving car space there's
still a ton of work to be done Demetri
dolgoff head of self-driving tech at way
Moe says the next steps are to build
better Maps make ride smoother and to
improve navigation in harsh conditions
like heavy rain and snow because if
we've learned anything over the past 20
years is that the true power is in the
software not the hardware that can be
commoditized over time there's a reason
Google is Google well if you all thought
that Pokemon Go was a big deal
SuperMario run is set to be shy I got to
pay for that on its first day of release
SuperMario run raked in 5 million off 5
million installs according to a new
report from mobile app insights firm
sensor tower these figures put it ahead
of even Pokemon go in terms of first-day
performance although it must be noted
that Pokemon go was only available in
select regions at first and that Super
Mario run has only seen an iOS release
so far analysts have already predicted
that Super Mario run will see 50 million
installs in its first month of release
which will only be on iOS devices due to
Nintendo's exclusivity agreement with
Apple but when the game eventually lands
on Android the install rate will explode
hey Android army chase here it's been a
while since we've had these chats I've
been away for a while on vacation I had
to take a break from the great white
north I was in Bahamas and Florida and
other hot places having a great time but
I am back now on the Android beat if you
want to follow me and chat it up some
more you can follow me on Twitter and
Instagram right there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
