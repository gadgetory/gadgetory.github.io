the android authority app guy do you
like to read I know I do and after the
intro we're going to show you some of
the best e-reader apps for Android our
first app aldi co reader is among the
most popular apps on the list with over
10 million downloads and Counting this
key reader is a good one to check out
whether you've been using ear eaders for
a while or you're just starting out it's
simplistic interface and controls focus
on reading without a bunch of extra
stuff to worry about on top of
supporting most eBook formats including
epub pdf and Adobe DRM encrypted ebooks
I'll decode users will have a variety of
bookstores to choose from these stores
managed to find most of the popular
titles and even some of the obscure ones
that we searched for combining the
available content with the simplistic
interface LD Co is a very solid ereader
for everyone better World Books the next
eReader on our list takes a wholly
different approach most apps on this
list have a store built into the app
where you can download and read all from
one interface but our world books
differs in this area as you can buy
books from their official website first
then import them into the app you can
also import books you already own into
the app so you can buy from any other
online bookstore if you want to the app
itself is very nicely laid out if a
little simple you get the standard
features like text size page numbers
transition animations and night mode for
the reading enthusiasts who already has
a big collection and just wants a new
app this is a great ereader replacement
it's only drag is that the online store
is a little skimpy but as mentioned you
can import books so you don't actually
have to buy them from better World Books
to enjoy the app as an e-reader like
better World Books our next app cool
reader is a standalone application there
is no store attached to it and it relies
on the idea that you already have an
e-book library that needs to be ported
into the app cool reader features all of
the usual stuff like night mode and text
formatting but it also adds some extra
flair like simple searching on your SD
card for books and even some app theming
once you get the books imported opening
them and reading them is a cinch book
pages are themed like a real aging book
which adds some comfort to the eyes in
comparison to the white screen and black
text that most readers have additionally
there is a feature where you can have
the book read to you it's a creepy woman
robotic voice but at least she gets most
of the words right
so if you're looking for an e-reader
with a little extra Flair and have a
decent collection already cool reader
could be what you're looking for FB
reader is next on our list and it has
definitely earned a spot here much like
prior apps it works as a
stand-alone eReader if you have a large
collection however if you're new to the
e-reader world there are some online
bookstores available to buy your books
if need be in addition to the stores
that come with the app you can also add
new ones if you have the URL otherwise
the app has the standard features night
mode some page themes which include the
popular sepia and wood themes and other
various settings you'd expect to see in
an e-reader transitions are faster than
you'd find in other applications as well
Kobo is an application that aims to
compete directly with the big dawgs like
Amazon and look admittedly when you
first open the application it can be a
little obnoxious there are a lot of
notifications a lot of attempts to get
you into the culture of Kobo and other
distractions however once you turn these
off or at least turn them down to a
tolerable level Kobo is a very enjoyable
ereader as an e-reader Kobo comes with
all the standard stuff it also has a few
unique features like the ability to
actively comment on a book as you're
reading it if anyone else stumbles upon
the comment they can comment back most
books don't have a lot of activity but
when you find one that does you can take
part in a fun discussion that really
adds a third dimension to ebook reading
there is also a Kobo store that carries
a healthy selection of books if you
thought we'd be doing this list without
the Amazon Kindle app you were sorely
mistaken there are many who aren't fans
of the Kindle bookstore but it really is
one of the best ones out there it has a
variety of titles all the standard
features are there and the Kindle Store
is one of the most trustworthy sources
of literature on the Internet
for those coming from a Kindle reader
device the news only gets better once
you register your android device with
your email and password you can access
and download any ebook you previously
bought for your Kindle so if you're
making that switch from an actual Kindle
e-reader to say an Android tablet or a
phone or a phablet you won't have to
start your collection over or even
change how you purchase and read books
last on our list is Nook because it is
the biggest competitor to the Kindle
Store one can expect nearly the same
level of content from the Nook as you
got from the Kindle app during my
searches I was able to find all the same
books by all the same authors that I
searched for so if you're looking for
popular moderately popular or older but
still popular literature and magazines
you should have no problem finding the
stuff you like with Nook of course as an
e-reader the Nook does very well it has
all the standard features so people
won't be missing out on anything there
one thing we really enjoyed about the
Nook app was it's ridiculous page
turning animations
it's the closest we've seen the real
paper I mean look at it how cool is that
if you don't want the Kindle and you
still
a well-known source of literature look
is what you're looking for if you take a
gander at our leaderboard you can see
how these apps stack up against one
another if you're unfamiliar with our
rating policy that's fine because we
don't have one this leaderboard is based
on you the people and how you rated
these applications in the Google Play
Store
there was no bias on our part once again
