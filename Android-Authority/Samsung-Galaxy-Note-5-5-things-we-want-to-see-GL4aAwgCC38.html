unveiling of the samsung galaxy note5
coming out a day that we kind of didn't
expect normally every single year the
new no device is unveiled at Eva in
Berlin but this year Samsung decided to
bump up the date a couple of weeks well
we look back at the Samsung Galaxy Note
4 in a Galaxy Note 4 now video and last
year it was met with a lot of general
claim from the design to of course the
s-pen the trump card of the note series
so we're hoping that this year's edition
is just as good if not better than the
one that we have here in my hand right
now so it's Josh Flagg are from android
authority what's going on everybody and
here are five things that we want to see
from the brand new Galaxy Note 5 if
you've been following all the coverage
on Android oricom you would know by now
that a lot of leaks have already
happened so we already have a bit of a
snapshot of what to expect from the
galaxy note 5 however all that is still
speculation until the phone actually
becomes unveiled so in the meantime we
will still present to you our wish list
for the brand new phone let's address
the elephant in the room right off the
bat features that we didn't see in the
galaxy s6 with a new design language and
the latest galaxy s phone users were
actually really miffed to see the
expandable storage slot and the
removable battery go by way of the
dinosaur granted the base storage
options were finally bumped up to 32
gigabytes but plenty of power users
found this simply not enough for their
storage needs paying more money for 64
or 128 gigabyte models was also simply
out of the question for most users
removable battery might be something we
can forgive for reasons that will get to
in a second but expandable storage is a
feature we know is one of the first
features you look for in this spec sheet
and then lament over when it's left out
now another reason why the note series
all of them really have been very
successful is because the large battery
underneath has become a hallmark of the
phablet form factor so the galaxy note 5
has to have a battery if it's not
removable that is as big as the power
users need it to be that's the thing
with Samsung though there's some
disparity among the different models in
their flagships and even in some of
their mid-range offerings that show
where some features are highlighted and
then in other cases they're just plain
missing just look at the samsung galaxy
s6 active which comes with an incredible
3500 milliamp hour battery
has proven very reliable for all of the
highest usage days leak suggests the
note 5 will come with three thousand
million Bowers we suppose this will
suffice but obviously we will want more
especially because Samsung has shown in
the active that higher battery
capacities can be found in their phones
now what the Galaxy Note line did best
in the last few years is succeed where
the Galaxy S line did not now just look
at last year when the sleek an
incredible note for completely redeemed
the design language that many of us
didn't like in the galaxy s5 while
providing even more and arguably better
features if the leaks that we've gotten
recently are any indication the design
of the galaxy note 5 will not only
follow that of the s6 it may also mean
the lost of those just mentioned
features even then we just aren't too
sure if a mostly glass design will work
for a larger note and for the bigger s6
edge+ for that matter the note 5 might
set a precedent for the note series that
simply wasn't true before so the best
that we can do for now is hope that the
note fives design makes us fall in love
with it the way that the note 4 did last
year and if glass and case designs are
really what we're going to get from
Samsung this year perhaps this might be
the first year that we see the note line
get some real true variations after all
a glass body might be kind of fragile
and even though last year we had the
note edge we're already getting an s6
edge+ this year that pretty much fills
that gap so looking back at the galaxy
s6 and the s6 edge despite being very
beautifully designed devices there was
also the active line that I keep harping
about that addressed a few key aspects
that the originals did not mainly
durability and battery life not to
mention the extra input in the active
key for which I gave the phone a huge
stamp of approval now we would say we
want an active key in the note 5 but the
s-pen adds enough of its extra input
already anyway dual glass design could
make the note 5 one of the most
expensive and most delicate devices that
will require a death grip if we're
getting a larger version of the s6 edge
which is simultaneously a note 5 with a
curve and missing the S Pen then why not
throw another active edition in there
somewhere for a good measure and finally
we gave the s6 and edge very high marks
for its dialed back interface not only
did it slim down in features and
annoying tutorials it was also optimized
for Samsung's powerful in-house XE nose
process
now due to the very nature of the note
line especially considering the a spin
we don't really expect the note 5s
software to be quite as Spartan as it
was in the s6 but we do hope that we at
least see the same types of
optimizations and the same type of speed
from the new note device and speaking of
the s-pen we do hope that the brand new
version of this stylist is able to
really keep a lot of its potential
without really clamoring for so much of
your attention plenty of features of the
note 4 s S Pen were useful especially
using the stylus as a kind of mouse but
the learning curve was steep enough that
not too many people ever pulled it out
if the S Pen is easier to learn and its
features are made almost indispensable
to the note 5 experience this year we'd
be happy to pop out the stylus more and
so there you have it for the five things
that we want to see from the samsung
galaxy note5 the brand new device is
pretty much going to get the updates
that we expect it to get in certain
aspects like the quad HD display and the
wonderful camera we already loved the
one from the note 4 so we only expect
the note 5 to really give us the kind of
experience that we're looking for in
picture quality but certain things like
expandable storage feel kind of odd to
have to hope for but that is where we
are in the smartphone market today so we
hope that you guys don't really blame us
for keeping our fingers crossed that all
of the things in this list do end up
coming true so as always thank you guys
