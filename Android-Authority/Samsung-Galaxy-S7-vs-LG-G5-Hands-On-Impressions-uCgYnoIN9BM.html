head-to-head at MWC 2016 this is Joshua
Vergara from Android Authority what's
going on everybody and this is the
Samsung Galaxy s7 versus the LG g5 now
while one of these devices is keeping to
the design language from last year the
other one is making a very drastic
change the Samsung Galaxy s7 might look
a lot like the one from last year but a
new feature is coming back from the
original galaxies and that is the micro
SD card slot which is now part of the
sim tray but ultimately this is the same
metal frame and dual glass panel design
that we saw from last year only this
time both the s7 and the s7 edge will
also have edges on the rear now this
makes the phone sit very nicely in the
hand and if you use the note 5 and knew
that this was a nice ergonomic feel then
you now have it in these smaller and
much easier to Handl 5.1 inch Galaxy s7
on the other hand you have the LG g5
which looks vastly different from the
one we had last year the power button is
still on the back but now that houses
the fingerprint reader and this metal
body design is pretty much just a
unibody but still is able to have a
removable battery now we will talk about
the modular design of the LG g5 in our
first look extensive video but
ultimately what you do is you actually
slide out the bottom panel and you are
able to take out the battery itself snap
it off and then add it to new modules
that will add functionality to the
experience of the LG g5 aesthetically
it's really your choice if the galaxy s7
feels way too familiar to you at least
the LG g5 is starting to think outside
of the box and even if that might be at
the detriment of those who love to the
LG G lines design at the very least
you're getting some new features in the
g5 that are outside of the norm the
galaxy s7 is still economically better
in this particular comparison because it
sits so nicely in the hand due to the
curves on the back of the phone now both
displays on here are bringing always-on
display technology and features and
basically what that means is that when
locking the phone you will have a
display on the screen that will still
show the time or any other pieces of
information that are available in both
cases however though the galaxy s7
provides a little bit
more control and a few more features in
terms of its always-on display it is
still rather limited and in the case of
the g5 you could put a signature on this
particular feature but it might get cut
off because it can only handle so many
characters but nonetheless 5.3 inches is
what you get in the LG g5 in an IPS
construction quad HD of course and the
AMOLED on the 5.1 inch sized galaxy s7
provides the kind of colors that you
would want out of a display if the
punched out colors of the AMOLED really
speak to you performance is going to be
a big part of both of these devices and
the LG g5 wears the Snapdragon 820 badge
quite proudly the 820 is going to be
powering a lot of different devices and
it that includes all the modules and
even a VR experience on the other hand
the galaxy s7 is of course going to be
powering a number of peripherals also
like the gear VR but at our meeting
today Samsung true to form was keeping
pretty mum about whether or not it was
the Exynos 88-90 inside of their devices
and we will be able to confirm that
later on and we do think that it is
indeed going to be that processor as the
rumors have been claiming but even then
the performance already feels quite good
on both of these devices and everything
has been heavily streamlined
in the case of the galaxy s7 it still
feels like the TouchWiz of yesteryear
and it has a lot of the features kind of
hiding in plain sight as you go to the
settings you find that a lot of advanced
features are available but if you get
into one particular setting in the
galaxy s7 there is a galaxy labs area
where you can actually turn off the app
drawer instead just move all of the
icons to the home screens and that's
where they all live of course that is a
controversial move for pretty much any
manufacturer but in the case of the
galaxy s7 at least you have the option
to turn it on or off on the other hand
the LG g5 went ahead and mixed it all
together there is no app drawer in this
version of Android marshmallow that is
installed on the LG g5 and we did think
that that was a bit of a bummer when we
first used it what LG did say however is
that market research showed that a lot
of people are looking for more
streamlined and more and simpler
experiences on their smartphones and
eliminating the app drawer also
eliminates a few of those confusing and
convoluted menus that would be used if
you were trying to uninstall remove or
just move icons around
but still between these two operating
systems it's a little bit of a toss-up
while Samsung however did keep a lot of
the features inside of their TouchWiz LG
has been trying to really streamline the
experience and certain features like the
qslide are no longer available so if you
want even more features and let's say
multitasking features on the galaxy s7
it might provide even more functionality
for you over the LG g5 both devices also
have fingerprint readers and they're
just located in different places but
have the same exact way of triggering
them the power button on the g5 is on
the back and then you leave your index
finger there and it will activate a but
the home button the iconic home button
rather of the galaxy s7 is here and a
little bit more flush with the body so
that you're able to just press the home
button leave your thumb there and then
it is able to unlock and in Hardware
both of these phones have a lot to give
but the galaxy s7 keeps things fairly
conventional you have all of the
different connections available within
but power consumption has been given a
huge boost because the galaxy s7 comes
with 3000 milliamp hours already
available now it also provides wireless
charging which the LG g5 does not
however both phones are able to use
quick charging in order to get the
batteries up to speed in little to no
time at all
but the LG g5 takes the crown in
Hardware solely because it is an
expandable experience pop out that
bottom panel and remove the battery and
you can put the new battery into a new
module which will actually put more
functionality onto the phone this was
shown in a couple of main examples
including a hi-fi audio DAC that could
be put on the bottom to enhance the
audio experience with hi-fi audio or a
camera module called
the cam Plus which is basically a camera
grip that adds even more battery to the
entire experience well and it provides
hardware buttons for the camera
experience like a shutter button a video
record button zoom and just a way to
trigger the camera from anywhere in the
phone this is a very out-of-the-box way
of thinking for the LG g5 and if
functionality over form is definitely
what you're looking for then there might
be more to offer in the LG g5 over the
galaxy s7 that's not to say that the
galaxy s7
doesn't have a great camera up its
sleeve either as the
point-seven aperture 1.4 micron pixel
size 12 megapixel camera on the galaxy
s7 should be able to provide some really
great photos especially in low-light
given the construction of the actual
sensor on the other hand the LG g5 has
its own tricks up its sleeve adding in a
wide-angle lens on top of the
conventional camera that is there so
that you are able to get even more into
your shot by having a much wider field
of view 135 degrees worth to be exact
and it is a fairly seamless experience
to zoom in and out of elements on the
viewfinder which will then trigger the
change from one lens to the other it
basically comes down to different
experiences while you might have had a
different design language between these
two devices now you have completely
different experiences and expandability
the galaxy s7 is or refinement of last
year's design but it does bring back a
couple of key features that a lot of
users were wishing were in the galaxy s6
if the s6 was everything you wanted but
it was just missing those few things
then maybe the s7 is now the perfect
smartphone for you the LG g5 on the
other hand feels that there is going to
be a stagnation in the smartphone space
and is trying to buck that trend by
creating a whole new ecosystem for the G
line yes--it's design might be radically
different and some people may not be
able to really fathom that but because
of this new design we now have new
functionality adding in the modules
whether it be the cam plus the hi-fi
audio or even the VR 360 ecosystem will
allow the LG g5 to provide even more
experiences to the general user and we
are excited to see both of these phones
in action when we finally get our review
units so stay tuned for a full vs.
between these two including camera
shootouts and you will be able to see
which one of these phones is definitely
for you until then keep it tuned to

both of these phones and MWC 2016
