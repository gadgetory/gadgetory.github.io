phone completely different than any
other phone Sony's ever made but it
takes some design cues from previous
devices in its lineage and while older
experience were sharp corner bricks of
devices the XE 2 is feeling a lot more
natural and I mean that quite literally
the xperia x e 2 is designed around
water Sony wants this thing to fit
perfectly in your hand and the shiny
back reflects well pretty much
everything this is one of the most
reflective devices I've ever used and it
honestly reminds me a lot of the HTC u
11 the phones even waterproof with an IP
68 rating which fits pretty nicely
around the whole ambient flow design
philosophy if you only saw this phone
from the front side you'd probably be
tricked into thinking that Sony hadn't
changed the design at all it's really
squirted off like the previous
experience but it does have slightly
rounded corners that might give it away
as an imposter the other subtle
difference here is the addition of dual
stereo speakers Sony's added a very thin
slit at the bottom to send sound towards
you and it's also using the earpiece as
a secondary speaker now these speakers
actually sound really good and I'm
actually preferred them to the pixel to
excels though they didn't seem to get
quite as loud
Sony's also completely redesigned their
vibration system with what they call a
dynamic vibration motor this is much
larger than typical vibration systems
and it was designed to immerse you in
your media this happens with video music
and really anything that makes sound
from your phone after testing it with
music and movies I found that it's
really nothing more than a gimmick I'm
glad Sony put more thought into the
haptics on this phone but I'd really
have preferred that they focused on
making that vibration motor as good as
the iPhones before mixing it in with
media the xe2 is using a 5.7 inch 1080
by 2160 panel at 424 PPI and it honestly
looks great
Sony hasn't switched over to OLED yet
but I am totally fine with LCD for now
it's still pretty difficult to get a
good OLED
unless you're one of a few select
manufacturers and I'd prefer that Sony
used a great LCD display before using a
mediocre OLED one the screens HD are
compatible to mean you can watch all
that new content with less banding and a
much wider range of color there isn't a
ton of HDR content out there right now
unless using a streaming service like
Netflix but the phone can actually
upscale non HDR content to look better
than it did previously they included a
copy of the Jumanji trailer on this
thing to demonstrate the HDR effect and
it actually looked pretty good we turn
this thing over you'll really start to
see where Sony changed the design the
phone's pretty thick at 11.1 millimeters
but I really didn't mind the thicker
rounded design makes it easier to hold
which is really important with this
phone because otherwise it's a little
unwieldy the fingerprint reader and
camera lens are really just placed in
the wrong spots almost every time I
picked up this phone my finger landed
directly on the camera lens sony says
that they went with this Omni balanced
design to help make it feel even lis
distributed but I would have preferred
that this was a little top-heavy if it
met the fingerprint reader and camera
were in a better spot the xe2 is
slippery like really slippery they fell
out of my pocket probably a dozen times
this week and I've got a number of
hairline scratches on the screen I need
up needing to set it facedown on the
table while I worked and even then it
made me a little bit nervous the rear
camera is 19 megapixels and it was
honestly pretty disappointing this is an
HDR enabled camera that can shoot 4k
video but the quality was just lacking
photos didn't seem to adjust well to
different lighting situations and the
highlights almost always seemed blown
out
Lulay shots resulted in smeared images
which I can only assume was the fault of
badly adjusted shutter speed and they
really hoped that Sony improves on this
camera in their dual lens Xperia XC 2
premium the selfie camera is sadly
equally as bad it's 5 megapixels which
is a little bit low for today's social
media fueled world and the images came
out looking pretty soft other
manufacturers are rapidly making these
front gamers better and I'd really like
to see Sony jump on that train ignoring
the bad quality of the camera itself
Sony's
often some interesting features to make
this phone more valuable for a small
subset of users the 3d imaging feature
is back and it produces higher quality
models than last year's model Sony's
enabled the front facing camera to model
your own face and I was actually pretty
surprised at how well it worked this is
a really neat feature though so it's
only really valuable if you're a 3d
animator or just won a 3d bust of your
own head Sony's also reintroduced the
960 FPS super slo-mo feature at an
updated 1080p resolution but the footage
just looked bad I tested this in an
extremely well-lit environment but the
video still came out super grainy it's
fun for a good minute but it's
definitely unusable for any serious
projects when it comes to the internals
the xc2 is one of the best phones you
can get right now
it's got Qualcomm's latest snapdragon
845 processor 64 gigabytes of internal
storage with microSD card expansion and
4 gigabytes of RAM now you could
definitely fit some more ram in there
and I'd love to see the storage expanded
to 128 gigabytes but the 4 gigs of ram
was more than enough for everyday use
and having the option to upgrade storage
is awesome some other phones manage RAM
much worse than this thing and I never
saw any lag during multitasking with a
variety of apps performance was the
least of my issues here and I'm really
glad that Sony made their Android Oreo
skin so simple and uncluttered that 8:45
is actually pretty great with battery
life I saw about 6 hours of screen on
time with the 3180 million power battery
and the phone charged up really really
fast with Qualcomm quick charge 3.0
though I'm hoping that they pick up 4.0
in the next version of this phone Sony's
new phone reimagines what the Xperia
line is meant to be its specked out
internals wonderful screen and great
speakers make a strong contender but
does this awkward shape gimmicky
features and $799 price tags still make
it worth of purchase
well I like this phone quite a lot I'd
probably wait to see what oneplus and
Google do before jumping into a new Sony
flagship so that's the sony xperia x z2
