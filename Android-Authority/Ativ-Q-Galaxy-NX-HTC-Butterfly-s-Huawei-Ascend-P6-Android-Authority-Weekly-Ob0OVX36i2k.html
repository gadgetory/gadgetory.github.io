for Joshua Vergara do you feel the need
for news I know I do it's time for
android authority weekly earlier this
week while everybody else was probably
suffering from a case of the Mondays
Mark Zuckerberg flew to South Korea to
meet with Samsung word on the street is
that he's trying to coax them into
making a facebook phone here's the thing
remember when everybody ran out to buy
the HTC first no of course not because
that didn't happen I'm sure Samsung is
very well aware of this HTC might have
needed Facebook but Samsung certainly
doesn't sorry mark in the beginning
phones were big then they got small then
they got big again now the race is on to
see who can build the slimmest phone
enter the huawei ascend p6 now we've
known this one was coming for a while
but as of Tuesday it's official and it's
looking pretty nice at just over six
millimeters thick and weighing in at
only 120 grams you've got a quad-core
1.5 gigahertz huawei processor 2 gigs of
ram and a 4.7 inch 720p screen not bad
now yeah people are saying it looks a
little like an iPhone and it does but
little but it's still worth keeping an
eye on now turning in the complete
opposite direction HTC announced a
successor to the HTC butterfly on
Wednesday that actually focuses on
battery life instead of being thin
enough to cut a cake with what's it
called the HTC butterfly s okay so maybe
they still need to work on their naming
scheme a little bit but forget that
because it looks like the butterfly s
could give the HTC One a run for its
money 5-inch full-hd display faster
processor blah blah blah i could go on
here's what's really cool it's packing a
3200 milliamp hour battery which puts it
right up there with the note 2 battery
wise not to mention it's got sense 5
boomsound the ultrapixel camera and
blinkfeed since we first saw how well
the Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 performed
we've been waiting to see what the
performance on the top of the line
qualcomm snapdragon 800 would be well
preliminary results are in and just wow
all com invited a few folks to take a
look at the new system on chip and many
a benchmark was run long story short the
snapdragon 800 beat pretty much
everything that was thrown at it except
for the Tegra 4 which held its own in
certain tests the chipset will be
showing up in some pretty big deal
devices later this year so luckily it's
not going to be too long until we see it
have you ever wanted to take everything
you love about technology throw it in a
bucket and end up with one big awesome
thing well that's basically what the
Samsung active q is Samsung took the
ropes off of this monster at its
premiere event in London it runs windows
8 but it also runs android 4.2 we're not
talking about dual booting either
Android 4.2 runs in a virtual machine
allowing you to switch between windows
and android whenever you want at the top
of a button it's a tablet but we're
talking an Intel Haswell chip 3200 by
1,800 pixel resolution a qwerty keyboard
and an S Pen because why not right now
what's it going to cost now how could
Samsung top that news well they couldn't
really but they did announce the Galaxy
camera and X if you looked at the galaxy
s4 zoom and thought I want less phone
and more camera you're in luck the
android-powered Galaxy NX will have a
four point eight inch touchscreen 1.6
gigahertz quad-core processor 2 gigs of
ram and 16 gigs of internal memory along
with better camera specific features in
general but here's what makes it very
cool it's an interchangeable lens camera
so more serious photographers will be
able to choose the lens depending on the
results they want all those features and
flexibility do come with a price though
literally the verge estimates that the
galaxy NX will cost close to one
thousand dollars with the kit lens don't
buy one for your kids is what they're
saying around the launch of the HTC One
there were a lot of rumors saying the
HTC CEO Peter Chao said that he would
resign from the company if the HTC One
didn't turn the company around it didn't
and he didn't according to him he never
said that now a lot of executives are
leaving the company but Chow says and I
quote I'm not going to find another job
he told HTC shareholders that the
company's ultimate goal is to get back
to the ten percent market
at once had and hopefully go even higher
a lot of us here at Android Authority
think that one of the biggest problems
with HTC has been lack of marketing
apparently the company agrees as they're
preparing a 12 million dollar marketing
deal featuring iron man himself Robert
Downey jr. insert movie reference here
and that's it for this week folks we'd
love to hear what you think down in the
comments you can find a written
companion to this video android
authority calm the link is in the
description Josh will be back next week
same time same place and I will be back
to my usual gig hosting android
authority QA we answer your questions
every Wednesday I'm Chris what for
android authority and as always thanks
