android authority what's going on
everybody and of course here we are at
Aoife it is that time of year again I am
here with our lead editor bogged down
and we're just here to be able to bring
you all of the best coverage from fifa
2014 with all of the new releases coming
from all the different companies now you
probably know quite a few of the pieces
of information that are coming out
already because well if I actually
hasn't particularly started yet because
as is becoming the trend here at
different trade shows like this a lot of
announcements actually happened before
the show itself starts and we've already
seen quite a few things already but I am
in trolling the fact that we are here in
Berlin and beautiful Germany and it's
actually a pretty nice day out right now
we are at the end of the first big press
day which is why you might be able to
hear it in my throat that I've been
talking all day about all of these great
phones that are coming out right now and
we had Samsung like I mentioned already
and today was the unpacked event we also
had a sous in which they talked about
their eyes n watch which was a pretty
good offering and we do like what we see
from that as far as Android wear devices
ago and we actually just got out of Sony
and I have a ton of videos for you
they're taking a look of live from the
show floor at the Xperia Z or Zed 3 the
compact version of it even the Xperia e3
which is a entry-level version of the
Xperia line and also the z3 tablet
compact which is a great little eight
inch offering a great tablet already in
its own right but we also have a
SmartWatch from Sony that is now
adopting Android wear so you have the
sony smartwatch apparatus now with
Android wear as the operating system
within now like I said bog down and I
are going to be here bringing you all of
the best coverage and we are really
excited to see what we're going to find
here at Aoife this year and we're really
looking forward to everything that we're
going to find on the show floor and
beyond with all the different meetings
we have with various companies and
whatnot so make sure you keep it tuned
here at Android Authority we already
have a lot of coverage available for you
and you can just look forward to even
more coming out as these next number of
days go by and we're going to have a lot
of fun doing this for all of you so keep
it tuned to you for all of those best
coverage videos and also
don't forget to check out the coverage
from my colleagues back at home you can
see all the coverage that they're doing
aside from me being here in Berlin
already so keep it tuned teardrop with
