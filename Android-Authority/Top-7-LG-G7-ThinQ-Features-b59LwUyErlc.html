probably know that that company likes to
stuff in as many features as possible
into these things well they've done the
same thing with the LG G 7 and there's
so many the list that we're really just
gonna give you our top 7 features of
their new phone so here's the top 7
features of the LG G 7 first off we've
got what LG is calling the boombox
speaker now what they're doing with this
is they're basically using the phone as
a resonance chamber to really help push
sound out of the device there's only one
set of bottom firing speakers in this
phone but it gets really loud you could
really place this at any point in your
house and you're gonna be able to hear
it from across the room it's a lot
louder than most phones get and we
really didn't have a problem with it
even at super high volumes so next up
we've got the super bright display so
yeah LG isn't using an OLED panel on
this thing they're actually using an LCD
but it gets really bright up to a
thousand nits that's a lot brighter than
most phones and you're gonna be able to
go outside no problem and see this phone
even in direct sunlight next up we've
got portrait mode and yeah most phones
have portrait mode nowadays but this
phone does something extra it actually
produces a depth map that goes along
with the image so you're able to move
that bokeh slider even after you take
the picture the front-facing camera is
actually pretty good too at 8 megapixels
and it also has a portrait mode now this
is a pretty big deal because the pixel 2
was really one of the only phones that
could do a good front-facing portrait
mode and you're gonna be able to get
this on this LG phone too LG even
brought back that super wide 107 degree
camera so you're gonna be able to get a
huge field of view and this is really
useful if you're out with friends and
want to get every one of the frame now
speaking of the camera LG has added some
AI that it thinks is going to help you
get that shot it can recognize up to 18
different scenes to help perfect the
color of what you're shooting a picture
of and it'll give you four different
options after you take the photo to kind
of add a layer of color on top now while
we were testing this feature the camera
recognized random objects as ham and
sandals which is kind of weird and I'm
not really sure why LG would want to
recognize these things but it's in there
so maybe this will be tweaked and
perfected in the future
now the pixels got the squeeze feature
and Samsung's got the bixby button
Baljeet decided to go with a Google
assistant button instead of either of
these I personally really like this
because I use that squeeze feature all
the time and it's really nice to just be
able to walk down the street hit a
button and automatically activate Google
assistant so unfortunately you can't
currently remap this button but LG said
it wasn't completely out of the picture
they told me it might come in a later
software update if they get enough
people that want it so if you really
want that make sure your vocal about it
in the comment section below the LG G 7
is completely waterproof with an IP 68
rating now this is really nice because
you're able to just walk outside in the
rain or you can even take a shower with
this thing and with that super loud
boombox speaker you don't even have to
have a Bluetooth speaker in your shower
you can just kind of jam to your phone
honestly most phones should be
water-resistant at this point but
they're not so I'm really glad that LG
added this feature in and I really hope
that other people start to adopt this in
the future so yeah this phone has a
notch but LG knows that some people
really don't like that notch so they
added an additional secondary display
feature which lets you cover it up if
you don't want to use it you can color
this in with black gray or even
gradients of color so well you should
probably just use that extra space to
see the time of notifications you can
really just cover it up with black if
you don't want to see that at all I
personally like filling it in with black
because it made it seem like there
wasn't a notch at all but if you want to
use it go for it so those were our top 7
features of the LG G 7 now there's a lot
more features in this phone so if you
want to see those make sure you check
out the hands-on and we'll cover all of
them in the full review later on so what
are the features of the LG G 7 that you
want to see us cover in the full review
