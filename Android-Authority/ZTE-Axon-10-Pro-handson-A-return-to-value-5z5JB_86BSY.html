Francisco today and now we're taking a
look at ZTE snoo phone the axon 10 Pro
now this phone is actually pretty high
spec to get things out of the way it's
got a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 it has six
to eight gigabytes of RAM and as also
has 128 gigabytes of storage or 256
gigabytes of storage and the surprising
thing here is the 4G and 5g model
actually look pretty much exactly the
same now the 5g model does have any
special type of liquid cooling that
they're not finding in the 4G model but
because the 4G model won't be getting as
hot that's not going to be a problem the
axon 10 pro also has a four thousand
milliamp hour battery with Qualcomm
quick charge 4 and wireless charging so
you can charge this up really really
quick if you use the included fast
charger or you can actually put it on a
wireless charging pad so that's another
option as well
the display is a six point four seven
inch F HD Plus AMOLED panel and it
actually looks pretty good it's cut
curved sides so it kind of looks like
that high-end Huawei type phone or maybe
Samsung and for a ZTE phone this
actually looks very decent it's also got
this motion smoothing functionality
which basically upscales the frame rate
there's actually pretty useful for
things like games we saw this on that
axon 9 it's really nice to see this
coming to the axon 10 and pro as well
now it's also using a water drop notch
for the front-facing camera and that's
20 megapixels which is pretty high
resolution for a front-facing camera the
rear cameras are where the axon 10 Pro
actually gets pretty interesting now
like every other flagship we've seen
this year like the Huawei P 30 Pro the
Samsung Galaxy has ten and a couple of
others we've actually got three cameras
on this phone so you've got a wide-angle
camera a standard camera that is
actually using that new Sony sensor it's
48 megapixels which Bin's pixels to
create these really nice 12 megapixel
images and you've got a 3x telephoto
zoom lens which is probably the best
lens or most convenient lens on this
camera as far as UI goes we've got what
ZTE calls stock Plus which is basically
stock Android but with a few useful
additions it's actually extremely nice
as extremely
Luud you've got things like google
photos built-in for the gallery you've
got things like google lens built right
into the camera it's very very
tight-knit integration with Google Apps
and I feel like a lot of hardcore
Android fans are going to be happy to
see that now unfortunately you don't
have a headphone jack but you do have an
in display fingerprint reader and so
you're kind of coming really really
close to what Samsung is offering the
only thing you're really missing here is
that headphone jack they're also a few
other little interesting things here
like this AI optimization layer which
predicts the apps that you're going to
use on certain times of the day it'll
put them in a ram so that they launch
faster it's kind of just an optimization
thing
now the 5g version of this phone is
going to go on sale in June for 899 euro
which is a little bit expensive but it
is a 5g phone if you want to have the 4G
version actually went on sale a few days
ago on May 7th and that's gonna cost you
599 euro this has just been kind of a
quick look at the ox on 10 Pro make sure
you stay tuned to Android Authority com
we've got a full write-up on everything
that this phone actually offers and I'll
catch you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
