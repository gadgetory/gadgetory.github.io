Android authority and this is the new LG
g8 thank you it's LG's flagship phone
for 2019 and on the surface it's really
great but it does have some kind of
gimmicky features that make me kind of
question what LG's point is with this
phone so let's dive right in okay so at
first glance the LG G 8 looks a lot like
the g7 from last year and I don't think
that's great because the g7 was already
a little generic looking but LG did
refine it to make it feel better the
first thing you notice when you pick up
the g8 is that it's a little bit thicker
and that's to compensate for the bigger
battery which is also a plus and I wish
more manufacturers who would make their
phones thicker so their batteries last
longer
I've been able to make the LG G 8 last
me all day on a single charge I'm only
getting like four hours of screen on
time but that's also with streaming a
lot of podcasts so that's not going to
count towards it if you do end up
switching the display resolution to quad
HD instead of the out-of-the-box Full HD
your battery is going to drastically
decrease because this is an LG phone it
has all the extras that you'd expect it
has a headphone jack down here which is
also equipped with a quad DAC it also
has an IP 68 water resistance rating
handy Google Assistant button on the on
the side which I actually use quite a
bit and it also has wireless charging
now on the front of the phone it also
does look a little bit more modern than
the LG G seven did for two reasons first
is that LG kind of made the sides curved
around to make it feel a lot easier to
hold and and less sharp I guess when
you're swiping around and also because
this is the very first G Series phone
with an OLED display and I know what
you're thinking LG has gotten in trouble
for OLED displays in the past for not
being great or at least less good than
Samsung's displays but this time around
the OLED screen is actually really nice
colors are really accurate and you can
kind of tune it to your liking also on
the front of this display you'll notice
a little notch at the top and honestly
it doesn't really get in the way I don't
mind it and
for a couple days of using this phone I
completely forgot about it but you'll
notice inside that notch there's a
front-facing camera and two other little
sensors but there's no ear receiver and
that's because LG implemented something
called a crystal sound OLED display and
I actually really like it it produces
good sound and you don't really have to
worry about holding the phone up to your
ear when you're on a phone call and like
putting your ear in a specific place
this year you can actually like cover up
the speakers on the very bottom and
still like hear sound coming from the
display it's actually really nice one of
the great things LG has been doing with
the G Series is implementing this
feature called boombox and it basically
uses the inside of the phone as a
resonance chamber to produce better
fuller audio the problem is the LG G 8
is one of the slipperiest phones I've
ever used and because the boombox
speakers vibrate the phone so much when
you put it down on a table or something
and it doesn't have a case it just
vibrates and moves so much actually
right when I got this I put it on a
stool a wooden stool and I received a
phone call and just from the vibration
it slipped off the stool so if you buy
this phone buy a case save yourself a
bunch of money the LG GA is a flagship
phone and it has the flagship specs to
back it up it has the latest Snapdragon
processor it has six gigabytes of RAM
and I know what you're thinking other
companies are putting in eight gigabytes
and sometimes even twelve gigabytes of
RAM but I haven't had the g8 slow down
on me once no matter what you're doing
on the phone whether you're gaming or
just swiping through social media or
whatever I don't think you'll have a
problem with performance and speaking of
swiping through your phone
LG's software is actually pretty good
it's very minimal
LG's using a lot of Google Apps instead
of replacing it with their own stuff and
I quite like that it's nice looking at a
phone and not seeing a ton of duplicate
apps now there are some but not as many
as you'd think now I do have one little
pet peeve and I know this is just a very
personal issue but I really don't like
the app drawer on this
phone it gets so annoying every time you
download a new app you have to like
Reese sort it alphabetically otherwise
the new apps just go to the back of the
list and when you delete an app from the
grid it just kind of remains this open
spot it's really weird around back the
lgj has a dual camera setup and the main
sensor is 12 megapixels and it has
bigger pixel sizes this year so
low-light photography should be better
the secondary camera is a wide-angle
sensor 16 megapixels and it has a 107
degree field of view and this is pretty
much the same wide-angle sensor we got
last year with the g7 and I really like
it actually you can zoom out of photos
pretty wide and you don't see much
distortion in the photos like you do
with some of the new Samsung phones
overall picture quality is good not
great
I think LG's a little bit behind the
competition at this point now don't get
me wrong I really do like this wide
angle sensor but image is taken with the
12 megapixel sensor are just kind of
lacking in detail everything I take is a
little bit blurry and out of focus and
that's even with my arms like completely
still
I found images to be just the right
amount of saturation but LG's noise
reduction is a little bit too over
aggressive it struggles in high contrast
situations in some of the camera samples
you can see here a lot of the highlights
are blown out LG also threw in a night
mode with this camera it's called night
view and it does an okay job at making
everything a little bit easier to see in
low lighting conditions I don't think
it's anywhere near Google pixels night
sight but it's decent the LG G 8 is also
one of the first phones to feature
portrait video mode and it sounds cool
in theory but I don't think it works
well in practice like at all basically
the dual camera system on the back can
attempt at least to separate the subject
from the background but this doesn't
really work well for video every time
I've taken a video of my dog or somebody
walking around it just kind of looks
like it's constantly trying to catch up
with the subject and
the whole video just looked weird on the
front there's an 8 megapixel selfie
camera and it also does okay it has to
have really good lighting conditions to
get the skin tones right and I just feel
like the skin tones that it does get
right it just kind of overly softens
everything and it makes it look like
there's a beauty mode turned on when
there actually isn't right next to that
8 megapixel selfie shooter are two extra
sensors there's an IR illuminator and
time-of-flight sensor and LG calls this
set of the Z camera and basically what
this does is is it enables you to
interact with your phone in different
ways and more secure ways for starters
you can use a 3d face unlock feature
that is way more secure than some other
phones out there you probably won't be
able to fool the g8 with just a photo of
yourself like you can with some phones
here's where it gets really weird this
whole front-facing camera setup also
allows you to use something called hand
ID and basically this records an image
of the hemoglobin levels in your hand
and you can use that as another way to
unlock your phone so you're probably
wondering to yourself why would you ever
want to unlock your phone like that you
have to touch it anyway to interact with
it so why not just use the fingerprint
sensor well let's say your hands are
dirty or something and you're baking
bread in the kitchen and you don't want
to wash off your hands you can actually
unlock your phone with just your hand
and then you can control your phone with
your hand as well so we're gonna do a
demonstration for you here we haven't
been able to get the hand ID feature to
work when we hold the phone in our hand
so in this case we're gonna put it down
on a table so all you do is you hold
your hand over the camera and it should
recognize me sometimes it doesn't like
to
there we go now we're in okay so you see
there's this little green and purple bar
up here that means it's searching for
your hand and once you see that you kind
of make this claw shape with your hand
it's a little awkward you can see a
little digital version of my hand on
here it's kind of cool
so these are two different shortcuts
that I've set up YouTube and Google
assistant and if I want to do assistant
and do a voice command
just kind of move my hand over and it
starts listening to me this is pretty
much the only feature I found that works
that I that I would want to use but
let's try YouTube because that's what LG
uses and a lot of its examples so we'll
get the feature to work again
and move over to YouTube and do it again
to press play they could you volume to
just kind of twist your hand
now in my testing this has been very
hit-or-miss
and when it misses it's really
frustrating and honestly you'll just
want to use your hands with your phone
just like you normally would
who is the LGG eight four and should you
buy it to be honest I really can't say
who this is for because it seems like
there are so many other great phones on
the market at this price point that the
LGG eight just kind of gets overshadowed
don't get me wrong I do like this phone
a lot it's a good phone
at everything that you would expect it
to be good at it's good at it has a
great screen it has good audio it has a
bunch of extras that a lot of people are
after but I think LG is focusing in the
wrong areas now it's dual camera system
is kind of a step behind the competition
it's nowhere near pixel three level and
it's not even up to the Galaxy S ten
level and that's really too bad because
this is a good phone it's just priced a
little too high it launches this week
for eight hundred and twenty dollars in
the US and I think it's a little too
high of an asking price for what you get
here especially when there are things
like the pixel 3 and the Galaxy S 10 out
on the market right now so I want to
know what you think about the LG G 8
would you buy it and do you think it's
better than say the galaxy s 10 be sure
to leave a comment below and let me know
what you think and give this video a
thumbs up if you liked it subscribe to
our channel if you haven't already and
we have a ton of other camera samples
and performance benchmarks and
everything you could ever want to know
about this phone in our full review
