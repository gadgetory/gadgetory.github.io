Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to another episode of
Google Play weekly in this week's
episode we're going to talk about the
sequel to flappy bird a PC classic
coming to Android and a little bit of
controversy so let's get started first
up this week is a wallpaper application
that made headlines thanks to its
material design it's a wallpaper
application called Wally and there
really isn't all that much to say about
it it offers a large number of
wallpapers through wall based CC which
seems to have a pretty loyal following
what I found interesting though was how
material design took what was a
functional but boring application and
made it more enjoyable to look at aunty
use and that makes me excited to see
more material design apps in the future
next up is an application that's
essentially just a digital pimp for
strippers the application is called
clover and it does pretty much what I
just said it does it's a service much
like uber that allows consumers to
browse strippers by a variety of
categories including gender once you've
found what you like you can then have
them sent to the location of your
choosing to perform the uber business
model seems to be working well enough to
extend into the adult entertainment
industry and it's going to be
entertaining to see how well it does
there while we're on the topic of
potentially controversial applications a
judge in Brazil has ordered Google and
Apple to remove the application secret
from users smartphones you may have
heard of it before the application is
called secret and it's an anonymous
social media app that lets people spill
secrets anonymously the app has been
officially outlawed in Brazil and a
judge there has actually ordered Google
and Apple to remove the application from
people's devices remotely believe it or
not Google and Apple can actually do
this but they usually reserve it for
removing things like malicious software
neither Google or Apple have responded
to the demand just yet but they do have
a few days to mull it over before they
start getting fined okay let's get back
to some good news Firefox currently has
chromecast support in its nightly builds
I say that because their nightly version
actually does currently have chromecast
support which was added this last week
if you really want to you can always go
sign up for the Firefox nightly and get
it right now but if you're patient it
should make its way to the regular
Firefox sooner rather than later at this
point it's just working out the bugs and
preparing it for the stable release
and to end our new segment last week
let's take a look at what google updated
this week Google sheets got an update
that improved how the app handles
Microsoft documents as well as general
performance and formatting improvements
an update to Google Drive out of the
activity stream that you can commonly
see in the Google Drive website it was a
pretty quiet week for Google but given
the last few weeks we knew a slower week
was coming eventually so who wants to
see some trending applications as usual
if you want to check any of these
applications out you can find the links
in the briton companion which is in the
video description below ignore no more
is an application that made waves this
last week because it was developed by a
housewife who got sick of her kids not
returning her phone calls the premise is
easy you have a parent account and you
can add your kids as child accounts if
you try to get ahold of them and they
don't answer you can remotely lock their
device until they call you back it's a
great tool for parents but kids are
probably not gonna like it so much
surgeon simulator is a game that's new
in Android but an old favorite on PC in
this game you play a surgeon who must
perform operations on people in the line
of general medicine and dentistry you
essentially just perform the surgery
while keeping the patient alive however
thanks to the loose gameplay you can
have some McCobb fun with this game it's
a tad expensive but it's pretty fun
swing copters is the spiritual successor
to the wildly popular flappy bird game
that was made popular and subsequently
killed off earlier this year if you were
hoping for something different you're
going to be disappointed but if you're
hoping for pretty much the same thing
but horizontal instead of vertical
you're going to love this game there's a
free and paid version but otherwise what
you see is pretty much what you get
microsoft onenote received a pretty
substantial update this last week that
includes new handwriting recognition and
a tablet-optimized you I the handwriting
recognition is a fun feature and you can
write with a stylus or your finger but
by far the more interesting part is the
tablet UI because one common complaint
with Microsoft applications are their
lack of tablet supports here's hoping
this translates to more in the future
last up this week is blur blur as a
launcher from the makers of evolve SMS
and talent for Twitter that offers a
Google now launcher style experience but
without Google now instead developers
can create custom pages for their
applique
and when users swipe to one side third
pages will show up alongside everybody
else is instead of google now like it
does on the Google now launcher it's
definitely a neat premise and you can
check it out right now for free if you
want to stay up to date on the latest
and greatest in Android news and reviews
