handy the Android authority app guy when
link bubble was first released my
Google+ feed exploded and that's usually
a pretty good indication that it's an
application that I should be checking
out so in this review we're gonna see if
link bubble really is that good so what
does link bubble actually do it's a
floating window web browser that opens
links in the background
so you don't lose your spot in whatever
it is that you're doing this can be
helpful for a number of reasons
especially if you surf the web fairly
frequently what happens is you find a
link and then you click on it and then
link bubble will have a little floating
icon that lets you know when the target
is finished loading there are two ways
you can use this application you can
have the auto opening abled which will
open the website up as soon as it's
loaded or you can go into these settings
disable the auto open and then the site
will load in the background and you can
deal with it as you please
the developer has recently updated the
application to make this easier and the
option to change this is now better
labeled other than the main function you
can share links to practically anywhere
in the top-left is your main sharing
service which can be changed in the
settings to whatever service you want it
to be in the top right is the full list
of places to share if you're sharing it
somewhere else if you want to close a
page you literally fling it toward the
bottom of your screen to close it if you
want to close all of the bubbles you
manually drag just one bubble to the
bottom and wait for it to say it close
all and then let go
overall it's a fairly easy and simple
application to use once you get the
flinging bubbles thing down controlling
everything is practically second nature
and you can go on with your business
while link bubble takes care of links in
the background if you're a fan of
measuring stats there's even a function
that will show you how much time you've
saved by not waiting for websites to
load link bubbles design is very minimal
when you're not using it it's like it's
not even there and when you are using it
it's just a floating window with a
couple of floating icons that you can
easily get rid of if you need to
everything is organized in a manner that
makes sense it takes a second to
logically explain why there are two
share buttons but really that's just so
you can expedite sharing to the service
you regularly use which we ended up
finding quite useful the big design
elements are the controls flinging the
bubbles around to make them do your
bidding seems a little off-putting at
first because you're usually not used to
flinging anything around on an Android
phone
however like we stated earlier once you
get used to it you can fly through your
open tabs it doesn't take all that long
to get used to
okay so here's what we liked about link
bubble this is truly unlike anything
I've ever used before if I were asked if
there were apt they could perform the
same functionality I would draw a blank
because I really don't know of any other
ones it's technically a web browser but
the way it operates is unlike any other
web browser for people who browse on a
frequent basis opening up a lot of links
at once and dealing with them later is
infinitely more preferable to opening a
link than going back to the app and then
opening another link etc it really does
save you quite a bit of time so far
we've seen virtually no incompatibility
is it opened pretty much all of the
content we asked it to without too much
of a problem I'm sure there are some
sites or video streaming formats that
the app doesn't support but we couldn't
find them you can customize the share
buttons to whatever you want them to be
so if you're a Twitter person you can
make your quick share to Twitter or if
you're a Google+ fan you could make it
to Google+ this was a really nice add-on
and really helped expedite the sharing
process on links that I actually wanted
to share perhaps my favorite part of
this application is how browser loading
times don't really matter anymore if it
takes 15 or 20 seconds to load a web
page so be it you're not sitting there
looking at the blank screen waiting for
it to load you can go do your own thing
until it's done and then come back and
read it and that is something that I
thought was really special and here's
what we didn't like so much there is a
wide gaping chasm between the paid and
the free versions I'm not complaining
about prices or anything because the
price is very reasonable but you can't
really experience the brilliance of this
application on the free version arguably
it's best feature is the ability to open
an assemblage of links let them load in
the background and then browse them at
your leisure
the free version limits you to a single
tab so users of the free version won't
get that experience and that's just a
little bit of a shame we did run into
some occasional lag and a force closer
to it's a new release so it's not that
big of a deal and we're sure future
stability and performance improvements
will rectify these issues but for now
they are still there overall this is an
amazing application when you fork over
the $4.99 for the paid version you will
literally cut the time you spend staring
at a blank web browser waiting for a
page to load to almost zero
it makes surfing social media more
enjoyable because in my experience I
found that I was clicking links I may
not have otherwise clicked on because I
didn't want to wait around for them to
load or worry about losing my place in
the other app so it allowed me to have a
more rich experience on my current
Android device it did have a few very
minor issues here and there but
most of it will probably be fixed in
coming releases between the moment I
started reviewing this app and the
moment I released this video there have
already been at least two updates and
that's very encouraging at the very
least you should try the free version it
doesn't give you the full experience but
it does give you an idea of what you're
in for and what you're in for is
something pretty awesome once again i'm
