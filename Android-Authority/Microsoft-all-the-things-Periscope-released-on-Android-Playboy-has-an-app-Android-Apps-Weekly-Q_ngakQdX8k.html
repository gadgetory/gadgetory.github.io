brought to you by anywhere gallery for
Android wear hello ladies and gentlemen
I'm Joe handy the Android authority app
guy and welcome back to another episode
of Android apps weekly we've got some
headlines let's get right into him last
week we talked about the latest Humble
Bundle this week as a gift anyone who
gets the Artifex Mundi Humble Bundle
will also receive steam keys for Mac
Linux and windows so you can play on
mobile or on your computer it's still a
nice way to give to charity and a good
way to get some cheap games an
interesting new development may add
quick reply functionality to any
messaging based notification developer
Muhammad Agee is working on a route free
application that will add quick reply
functionality to almost anything without
you being required to do well anything
it's not out yet but it looks very
promising
okay so Microsoft did a whole bunch of
things this last week so we're gonna
group them all together they announced a
Windows 10 companion application that
will help you sync your Android phone to
your Windows 10 computer for improved
functionality they also announced an
application called Microsoft one clip
that will be a cross-platform clipboard
application which could be nice Cortana
for Android has been officially
announced although there is no release
date yet lastly Microsoft announced a
partnership with 18 OMS that will see
Microsoft Office pre-installed on their
tablets for even more Android apps and
games news updates and releases don't
forget to check out this week's
newsletter which is linked in the video
description below there we have the
complete list of everything that
happened this week if you're so inclined
you can also sign up with your email
address and we'll beam this info to you
every single Friday ok folks take a look
at the apps and games that made a big
splash this week first up this week is
forum watchface and this is probably the
most ridiculous Android wear watch face
that I've ever seen it's developed by
the same guy who brought us Muse a live
wallpaper it works like this the watch
face will display whatever background is
on your phone then it will let pretty
much any Android wear watch face sit on
top of it as long as it uses the Musee
api it's a pretty nifty idea and
free to use the Google spotlight stories
actually isn't new because it used to be
a Motorola specific application this is
actually a storytelling application that
lets you view immersive short stories
using 360 degree video 2d and 3d
animations you can Fayyad ish '''l
stories if you want to and it really
does bring something special to the
table beware though because not all
devices are supported but thankfully
it's free to download you may have
already seen periscope if you watched
our best android apps and games from May
of 2015 video periscope is a live video
streaming app released by Twitter it
allows you to livestream from your
smartphone camera to all of your Twitter
followers you can also watch old streams
stream privately and it enjoys full
integration with Twitter it's an
interesting application that does things
a little bit different Microsoft
hyperlapse is an interesting camera
application that helps you create
stop-motion videos it actually came out
last week but we couldn't try it out
because of the lack of device
compatibility this week it got some more
devices added to the list if you want to
try it out you'll have to become a
tester on Google+ and then download it
it's a pretty nifty little app and it's
worth a shot and you can find the
directions on how to do it in the video
description below last up this week is a
new application from playboy called
playboy now despite its namesake the
application contains hardly any nudity
and it's actually pretty safe for work
it's a news application that gives you
updates on celebrities nightlife and
other activities and events that one
might read about in Playboy that said it
does still carry a mature 17 plus rating
in the Google Play Store it's worth a
shot if you like playboy thanks again
for watching the show everybody but
let's take a moment to get down to some
serious business any time gallery for
wear is a gallery application that
allows you to sync photos between your
phone and your Android wear SmartWatch
in the free version you can sync up to
20 photos and if you go premium you'll
be able to sync an unlimited number of
photos it's a simple application that
seems to work well and even include
support for pinch-to-zoom on the Android
wear device it's a fun little
application and a great way to see your
pictures on your wrist give it a try and
show your support for Android apps
weekly once again I'm Joe Indy the
Android authority app guy-wire here why
