potentially double the work but the
story is not as simple as it seems an
undoubted leak ooh look into our
smartphone future or what it could be
gets bogged down by problems we are
still having today it's Joshua Vergara
what's going on everybody and this is
our full review of the ZTE axon M
obviously this phone is a foldable
device with two screens comprising the
outer shell and at first glance when it
is closed it might look like the
original Nintendo DS revealing the two
displays shows the 5.2 inch full HD IPS
panels that can be used either
independently or together like one large
canvas and that yields an effective six
point seven five inches of what can be
described as a tablet like surface we'll
get into the actual experience of using
these displays a little bit later but
one thing I do have to say is that these
IPS panels are decidedly average now
take it on their own it's 5.2 inches at
full HD resolution and the resolution
doesn't bother me a whole lot it's more
about the color reproduction for a film
that's supposed to be literally all
displays all the time it doesn't really
scream eye candy when the experience of
looking at these things for media or
gaming hasn't exactly been on par with
plenty of other flagships there's very
little to say about the inner portion
after all the camera's not even found
there it's found atop the main display
and it is used for both rear and front
facing functions all of the buttons are
to the left of the main screen including
the power button which has a fingerprint
sensor embedded in it unfortunately if
the power button is a little bit
recessed into the body of the device
which makes it a little bit awkward to
press especially if you're using your
right hand and you have to use an index
or middle finger to unlock the device
there's also another button down here
that can be used for triggering the
shutter in the camera and you can double
tap it to even launch the camera but
since this is an 18 T exclusive device
what AT&amp;amp;T wants you to know is that you
can program holding this button down to
trigger Direct TV in a mode called
TV mode now I wish I could say more
about TV mode but basically it's just a
shortcut to opening any programmable
media application it actually doesn't
change the functionality of that app or
the way that it is shown in the display
a whole lot overall it's the heft of
this device that lends it a sturdy feel
and when used in the closed
configuration it is a little bit thick
which means that it feels pretty secure
in one
unfortunately there's one big issue with
this a lot of users out there might
complain that a glass panel on the back
gets really smudged up by one's
fingerprints well that's the same case
here except that glass panel is an
actual display so the more you use this
phone in this configuration the more
you're just smudging up something that
you potentially will be looking at so
before we get into the experience of
using a dual screen phone let's talk
about the specifications and one of the
reasons why I'm doing it this way is
because the specifications are actually
not the best the Snapdragon 820 one is
what powers this with 4 gigabytes of RAM
expandable storage beyond the included
64 gigabytes and a 30 180 milliamp hour
battery we've seen plenty of other
phones this year with single screens
have 6 gigabytes of RAM or even 8
gigabytes of RAM and Rock the Snapdragon
835
so ZTE is kind of shooting itself in the
foot for not trying to put the absolute
best specifications in a phone that
might have to pull double-time and as
far as battery life is concerned using
the phone in the close configuration
with just one display brought about four
hours of screen on time which is kind of
typical for a full HD display phone like
this however opening up the device and
using it as much as I could throughout
the day in a dual screen fashion kind of
cut that battery life in half and it
kind of tickled me a little bit how much
that made sense I got about two and a
half hours of screen on time when I was
trying to use the phone as much as
possible with both screens so let's get
the camera out of the way as well
because it is made up of just one unit
that is above the main display a 20
megapixel shooter that lacks a number of
enhancements that are kind of necessary
for most flagship cameras the main issue
here is the lack of optical image
stabilization the app does feature quite
a few different modes and is actually
somewhat robust in its manual mode but
unfortunately it's a bit of a pain to
have to flip the phone around every
single time when you want to take a
selfie or just a regular photo but the
problem is that this shooter while
seemingly powerful on paper just doesn't
get the job done without stabilization
pictures had blur in all but the
brightest conditions alongside this main
issue is the cameras trouble with
dynamic range even with HDR on the lack
of stabilization also shows in video
capture where shakiness tends to break
the otherwise decent 4k capture while it
can be a decent shooter in the brightest
of conditions the way it falls apart and
even medium lighting is hard not to look
at the rest of the phone is fairly
standard including
headphone jack and a speaker that is
powered by Dolby Atmos it's not the best
speaker out there in terms of sound
quality but it does get decently loud so
if you're sharing content with one other
person for example in the tent formation
that you're seeing here well you might
have a pretty good time sharing content
with them this tent configuration and
using the mirrored mode so you can show
the exact same thing on either display
is one of the cooler aspects of using a
dual screen phone like the ax on em but
how about all of the other uses for a
dual screen device all those
possibilities are designated by the M in
the soft key bar which changes the
display mode it is actually possible to
only use the left screen even when the
phone is unfolded there's also a
stretched mode where both screens in
portrait are used as one big canvas a
mirrored mode like I just said for the
10 formation and finally a dual mode
where either screen can be used
independently for multitasking now for
the kind of user that quite literally
wants to dual monitor Android this is
the only device that can do it and
multitasking is definitely a good thing
to do on two screens of the axon M for
power users out there who want to be
able to do as much as possible at the
same time well here's an example I'm
reading my script over on the left and
then here is YouTube on the right
showing a piece of video content it's
something that I did very often with
this and there a couple of other
scenarios where this multitasking was
actually fun and came in handy one of my
favorite tasks has been for gaming in
this example I used Final Fantasy 9 I
promise I'm gonna finish it eventually
on the main screen while the secondary
display showed a walkthrough that I
referenced whenever I got stuck one of
the issues I did get into sometimes was
Android pulling focus with an app like
YouTube that is made to work in the
background if you have YouTube right
especially it will continue to play no
matter what however if you have
something like Netflix clicking on the
Netflix panel will then pull focus from
the other application and vice-versa
meaning that the Netflix video might
actually pause when you're doing
something on the other screen in another
mode both displays can be used together
as a whole canvas as the software
stretches applications out and you can
force this on pretty much any app this
is the most interesting but ultimately
the most flawed approach however where
on the one hand you have the double
screen real estate but on the other hand
there is a distracting line of bezel
that cuts right down the middle another
thing I did notice with the display is
that the second display plays a little
bit of catch-up with the first display
if you're scrolling up and down
applications like Reddit for an example
you can see that there's a tie
tiny fraction of a second delay on the
right screen as you're scrolling on the
left one it doesn't really destroy the
experience of using this display however
it is something that you can't unsee
once you notice it this extended mode
definitely has a bit of a WOW factor but
even those people that were impressed by
it when I first showed them it got a
little bit annoyed by those same nagging
issues the second time around and that's
kind of the story of this device I later
realize that what I was doing here was
tolerating some of the bigger issues and
those issues all had to go back to the
same reason the software not even
mentioning the fact that the performance
specifications don't lend themselves to
the best multitasking in general the
software turned out to be less equipped
for the task it comes down to that lack
of attention to detail for example why
not make it so that the phone could be
used in a single screen mode but switch
to either display at will so you can
flip it around or when in the stretched
configuration why does Instagram require
the phone to be in landscape mode all
the time even when auto rotate is off
and while we're added why is the
original multi-window Android function
disabled even when using the single
screen maybe I don't want to unfold the
device but I still want to be able to
multitask a little bit and even better
imagine the possibility of having three
or even four applications open at once
even if the specifications are already
kind of cut at the knees so if you have
include into it by now the ZTE axon M is
a story of trade-offs you get two
screens on here and multitasking could
be a joy on here but it requires users
to adapt and to have a lot of patience
now we give ZT a lot of credit for even
making this device and we really wanted
to like it but putting an extra screen
on a phone like this doesn't really
change things if you don't work on the
core experience first and that in a
nutshell is the problem with the ZTE
axon M now if you're looking for this
kind of form factor this kind of
multitasking this kind of experience
specifically then that's fine but for
everybody else having a phone like this
is just not going to dramatically change
your existing Android life as always
thank you guys very much for watching
and hope you enjoyed this review of the
ZTE axon M now I know I sounded a little
bit harsh on the phone in this review
but the first dual screen smartphone
comes with a lot of expectations and the
fact that the X on em doesn't really
meet most of those expectations hit a
little bit harder than we expected it to
still we'd like the device we think it's
a great concept and we're excited to see
what comes next and if
you really want multitasking the axe on
em just might be the phone that you're
looking for even if it doesn't fulfill
too much else otherwise but nonetheless
you can stay tuned Sandra Authority for
more about the axe on em and more about
all of the flagships we've had in 2017
as we're drawing this year to a close so
with that in mind happy holidays
