Galaxy S 4 s battery life as I am well
I'm training Plan C for Android
authority and I'm going to show you guys
a few ways to maximize the battery life
on your Samsung Galaxy s4 so kick back
relax and enjoy the ride
alright guys so I want to preface this
whole video by saying that Android
authorities on mark has already covered
ways to maximize the battery life on
your Android device so what I'm going to
do is kind of cover some of those same
features but I'm also going to give you
ones that are maximized only for the
Galaxy s4 the first thing I want to talk
about is hardware now B Samsung Galaxy
s4 is 2600 milliamp hour battery doesn't
quite seem to cut it so if you're really
worried about battery life what I
recommend doing is either picking up
from your OEM another 2600 milliamp hour
battery that you can swap in and out or
picking up a third-party extend life
battery at this time no OMS have
extended batteries but there are a lot
of third-party manufacturers out there
that do the next thing is I very much
recommend not running very many widgets
on your home screen now I do know that
that's a hard thing to do since there
are so many of them but I really
recommend especially not running any
live widgets such as this one from
Falcon Pro the reason is is because it's
constantly updating your tweets and
whatnot which is consuming battery I do
know there are a lot of widgets out
there almost every application that you
download out of the Play Store now has a
widget which is very very accommodating
but I would definitely recommend not
using very many of them if you're trying
to conserve battery now the next thing
that I'd like to talk about is sort of
on that same scale but a little bit
different this one has some of the same
features that mark talked about in his
video but it's also a little bit
different because the galaxy s4 gives
you a very quick window in how to shut
extra features off which this device is
absolutely crammed with so you can turn
off things such as Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS
sound all from this little deal but you
can also turn off all of the S features
like airView s being smart scroll all of
the top features that the Samsung Galaxy
S 4 is so known for but I would
definitely recommend keeping them turned
off if you're worried about consuming
battery because it will eat it up like
you would not believe now the next thing
I want to talk about is wallpapers now
this is kind of something that you might
not really think about too much
wallpapers do tend to eat up your
battery especially live wallpapers
now luckily on the Samsung Galaxy s4
there's only two actual live wallpapers
of course you can download more out of
the Play Store but out of the box there
are only two as you see here which I'm
showing you right now now the problem
with these days is they consume a lot of
battery the whole time that this screen
is up they are consuming it so what I
recommend doing is not using any live
wallpaper at all or even that much color
in your wallpaper I recommend using a
solid dark color because this is a Super
AMOLED HD screen it means that every
color is pulling its own light so when
you have a dark colored background it's
not pulling any color as you can see
here I do have a little bit of red in my
background but it's definitely pulling a
whole lot less power if it would if
there was a lot of color or vibrant
colors in it so I suggest that now the
next thing I want to talk about here is
power saving mode now when Mark did his
video about conserving battery life on
Android devices period he talked about
how OEMs have this certain OEMs have
this capability in previous devices well
the Samsung Galaxy s4 across the board
has this in there so it will slow CPU
power usage their screen power your
haptic feedback which vibrate and haptic
feedback or another thing that will
definitely eat up your battery life
something that we don't really think
about but it will definitely eat it up
okay so the final thing that I want to
talk about today and conserving the
battery life on your Samsung Galaxy s4
has to do with that amazing 1080p HD
Super AMOLED display now because it is
so big at five inches and it's pulling
so many pixels it does consume a lot of
battery life so what I suggest doing is
messing with your brightness now it used
to be told that turning on auto
brightness can served a lot of battery
well I'm here to contradict that by
turning on auto brightness the light
sensors of the device are constantly
searching for light and consuming
battery so what I suggest doing is
turning off auto brightness and just
manually turning down the bright list as
low as you can while still seeing the
display at a decent level alright guys
those a few ways to maximize the battery
life on your Samsung Galaxy s4 and don't
forget to click the link in the video
description below to head over to
android authority comm to read the
written companion of this video also
there's another link in the description
below which i talked about earlier in
this video which will take you over to a
video that mark from android authority
did talking about maximizing battery
life on your Android devices period so
we'll kind of give you across the
broad spectrum of Android devices
instead of just the Samsung Galaxy s4 so
definitely head over and check that
video out as well I really hope that you
guys enjoyed this video and you took
something away from it we have a whole
bunch more videos planned for you guys
talking about maximizing battery life
and all sorts of things for all you
Android users I hope you enjoy
again I'm tre Clancy with Android
authority and don't forget that were
your one-stop shop for all things
Android take care guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
