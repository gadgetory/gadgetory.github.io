a new outlook might make the new one
touch watch one that you might want to
look out for especially if you're
looking for a simple way to get into the
SmartWatch game instruction regard from
Android 30 what's going on everybody and
this is a look at the Alcatel OneTouch
go watch now the go watch might look a
little bit familiar to you it's deriving
from the styles of some pretty trendy
maybe some g-shock like watches that are
out there but really this is a shell
that comes right off the unit itself and
can be interchangeable with other ones
so you can customize the go watch to
what you really like it to be that being
said however the band also comes off
quite easily so customization on this
watch all around seems to be pretty easy
the goal watch however is a pretty
simplistic watch that is available for
the Alcatel line but can still work with
android smartphones and really it's
almost like having a bunch of different
applications on just your watch if you
tap in the middle you will have a lot of
different applications including looking
at your heart rates that will allow you
to just perform some simple tasks on the
watch itself it might not be quite as
elegant as Android wear and we've
already seen this particular OS in last
year's version of the Alcatel OneTouch
SmartWatch but now it is being rebranded
into the go watch to go along with the
go plays smartphones what we're looking
at here is an is an IPS display at one
point to two inches that's 240 by 204
resolution and it's powered by a cortex
m4 underneath the servers we have a 225
million power battery and because of
what the go watch keeps to doing it
should work for between two to five days
and charging should only take about an
hour which is what Alcatel is saying
this watch should be able to do having
the watch on our hands it does actually
to me feel like a real Smart Watch
version of a g-shot but it does have
some extra functionality
now one fun part of the go watch is the
fact that it tries to assess your mood
if you hold on the new go button that's
on the front there then it will start
reacting to all of the different sensors
what you might be doing at the moment
and also your heart rate and tell you
something that might enhance what you're
up to right now it might tell you to go
love or
to go scream or to go eat even and to do
any number of things that are available
inside of there and if you press the Go
button one more time
despite the emoticon in the middle and
the various emotions that you might have
gotten at the top there it will share
automatically to the phone that it's
connected to to your social media
platforms so for the younger crowd it is
a fun way of sort of just sharing what
they're up to and it's also pretty
accessible and also comes in at a pretty
good price point a pretty cheap as well
so that anybody can get into the
SmartWatch game without really breaking
the bank that being said the Alcatel
OneTouch go watch is a pretty necessary
update to the original OneTouch
SmartWatch it does have a new shell to
it that makes it a little bit trend here
and it might not be for everybody but we
do applaud them for making the change
forward to be able to reach a whole new
level of people so keep it tuned to
android authority as at some point we
probably will be getting the Alcatel One
Touch of go watch and kind of show you
what it's like for the budget minded
person especially for those of you
parents who want to get something trendy
for their kids without really having to
break the bank and even get them
something a little bit more fragile like
other Android wear iterations so keep it
into Android or for even more from our
coverage here at Aoife in Berlin here at
the Alcatel meeting that we have looking
at our new products</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
