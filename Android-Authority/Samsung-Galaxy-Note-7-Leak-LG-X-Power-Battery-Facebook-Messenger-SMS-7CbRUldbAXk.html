galaxy note 7 being released or
announced on August second is becoming
more and more likely the real question
is will there be an edged and regular
variant or just an edge variant let's
talk about that well this image here
looks like it could be an invite to be
sent to the press or possibly for a
promotional poster that could be seen by
the public either way there are several
key points we can glean from it now
first is the most obvious and that's the
confirmation of the previous rumor that
it would launch or be announced on
August second this summer secondly the
design language is clearly stylized in
such a way that the number seven is
featured which gives further credibility
to the rumors that Samsung will indeed
skip six in order to have caught up in
consistency to the galaxy s7 handset and
third the design language clearly shows
off curved edges which line up with the
recently lead content suggestion that
the note 7 will have a curved display
this in of itself of course has caused
much outrage among some fans who are
teeming with anger at Samsung for
releasing only an edge display model but
will it be so and forth the information
also specifies the launch will happen in
New York City and will be streamed via
YouTube not unlike HTC did with its
recently released 10 now the real
question of course is about those curves
it seems obvious Samsung will indeed
launch a galaxy note 7 edge but will it
be the only option will it be standard
while this is mere speculation the
likelihood is quite low given that one
Samsung continues to release traditional
galaxy s handsets to the edge display
costs more and therefore will raise the
price and third many people simply don't
like curved edges Samsung has managed to
repair some of last year's damage by
including microsd support with the s7 so
what would seemingly be foolish for it
to anger note buyers once again by
forcing upon all of them a different
display dynamic what do you guys think
now let's talk the LG ex and it's
rumored to have a massive 4100 milliamp
hour battery official details are
sketchy for the moment but from the
high-level look that LG gave us the X
power looks like the most interesting
device in the batch as the name suggests
the X powers big selling point is the
4100 milliamp hour battery that's quite
large for a device that's just 5.3
inches for comparison the devices like
the s7 active and mate 8 feature similar
batteries in much larger bodies from an
older leak we know that the LG X power
will feature a 720p screen a mediatek
mt6589 16 gigabytes of onboard storage
and 13 and 8 megapixel cameras now even
if the new X line turns out to be
completely forgettable it's good to see
large batteries making their way down
range if LG can put a 40 100 million
power unit in a relatively thin
mid-ranger like the X power we have
reason to hope that the company's next
flagships will be just as good if not
better now last up is facebook Messenger
and how you can now send text messages
from Android smartphones remember when
you used to be able to send SMS text
messages with the facebook Messenger app
well then it mysteriously vanished and
never heard from again well it looks
like Facebook is hell-bent on continuing
to play games with our hearts because
the social giant has returned SMS
support for messenger on Android devices
but last will it remain probably is the
answer to that question David Marcus the
VP of messaging products at facebook
says that this SMS integration is pretty
robust allow me to send voice clips
stickers and your locations in just a
few brushes of your fingertip this all
plays into Facebook's clear intentions
to make this app your one-stop shop for
all your textual communication today
nearly anything is possible if you can
dream it your team can build it makers
of collaboration software that helps
your team work better together create
and share content organized results with
the flexibility of confluence they even
have instant messaging and video chat
with HipChat you can also manage code in
real time with the power of bitbucket
visit atlassian calm and see how JIRA
confluence HipChat and bitbucket can
give your team everything they need to
succeed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
