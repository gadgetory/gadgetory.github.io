on everybody and this is the Google
pixel book and our hands-on at the event
in San Francisco now Google released a
ton of new hardware but what we see here
is the pixel book their newest version
of a laptop line that uses Chrome OS
however you could say that this pixel
book is the one that's really trying to
break it into the mainstream it's a
12-point 3-inch foldable laptop that
runs Chrome OS but has full support for
the Google Play Store which means that
all of the place for applications you
might already enjoy on your Android
smartphone can be used on this laptop
and that includes applications like
Adobe Photoshop Lightroom mobile and
also snapchat so you can use the camera
on this laptop in order to do some
pretty amazing snaps when you use what
is bundled with it the pixel pen now the
pixel pen does allow the pixel book to
have a little bit more of a creative
application however the Google assistant
is still like with all of the other
products at the helm of this product
even a button dedicated to launching the
Google assistant is found on the pixel
book and it allows for basically the
usage of Google assistant the way you
would use it in any other apparatus you
would bring it up ask it a question
using the built-in microphones and then
you will get your answers but using the
pixel pan you would actually be able to
not only select text and be able to
bring that into the Google assistant but
you can actually circle just about
anything on the screen and be able to
search for it using Google's own search
algorithms you can see in this example
that we circles even just a picture of
Ryan Gosling from a recent movie poster
and it showed us that it was Bladerunner
2049 and you can do that with pretty
much anything on the internet if you
need to figure out just what the heck
you're looking at but what really gives
a pixel book a ton of capabilities is
it's convertible nature when closed you
get a great look at the wonderful design
that comes in at only two point four
pounds and it's an incredibly thin
laptop but you also get a look at the
design language that you would see on a
regular pixel with that glass panel at
the top open it up and you can use the
device as a traditional laptop fold it
all the way back and you would be able
to use it like a tablet which is handy
when you have the pixel pen or you can
just fold it back maybe 80% of the way
and put it in what we would call the
10th formation it's also no slouch in
the spec department the baseline model
is running the Intel KB Lake Core i5
processor and there is one with an i7
processor
with a gigabytes of RAM and 128
gigabytes of on-board storage that is
expandable to up to half a terabyte not
that you're going to need that much
since chrome OS mostly lives in the
cloud
overall the pixel book looks like the
Chrome OS laptop to beat especially with
its very sleek form factor and it's
convertible nature we will take a look
at it in the future when a full unit
arrives with us and we'll give you our
full review somewhere here on Android
authority keep it tuned to Android
authority for all of the best from the
Google event here in San Francisco
including our hands-on with the Google
pixel 2 and the pixel 2 XL and then
remember to bring it on back here for
more because we are your source for all
things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
