magazine UX it's the add-on that was put
on to TouchWiz by Samsung that added a
second home screen to your tab pro
experience or note pro experience rather
they are only found so far on the pro
line of tablets and yes they are
basically a front-end to flip board as
an application so we wanted to show you
the magazine UX and really kind of show
you what it's all about I'm going to
demonstrate that by up creating a new
home screen using the magazine UX and
showing you what things you can put onto
there so it's josh regard from android
authority what's going on everybody and
this is your future focus on the
magazine ux so we have a bunch of
different widgets here we'll start off
with start off with some applications
now we're gonna take a look at these
applications from calendar email gallery
all the way over to video and what
you're going to notice here is that the
majority of the applications that are on
here actually don't pertain to anything
but Samsung Samsung applications so if
you wanted to look at your gmail or if
you wanted to have maybe a controller
for let's say google play music on there
you're not going to get it here from
there we're going to go ahead and move
into the news and now the news here
pertains to pretty much all of the
different categories that are available
inside of your Flipboard application now
it is a curated list so what you're
going to do is pick a few of these and
then you can delve into Flipboard a
little bit more and pick the different
sources that you'll get so for me I like
photos on design for obvious reasons and
then after that let's put science and
technology for even more obvious reasons
and we're going to add to those using
our social media now on the social media
side you actually don't have that many
choices one that is actually kind of
peculiarly not there is facebook so that
is a little odd but the one that
probably pertains most to me will be
YouTube so I'm going to go ahead and add
YouTube on there and that should do it
that's pretty much everything that you
have to know about just the widgets that
are available for the magazine UX and
that's pretty much all that you have so
with that pretty much done we do have
other ones here I don't really use
Flickr Twitter I I use a tweet deck
instead of the regular Twitter
application all the different news
outlets are right here and
here are the applications just a recap
so with that in mind that's just going
to tap on the screen that we created in
there it is so in this case since I want
to have the calendar have a lot of
information on it it is bigger we do
have two new sources right here and then
we have YouTube I would actually like
YouTube to be bigger so I'm going to
bring it to the top here and as you can
see it moves it over down here you do
have the ability to after you press and
hold on a widget to start looking at the
widgets again but also you have the
change layout here that would just
shuffle all of the tiles there for you
so if you can't really figure out a nice
way of doing it you could just let the
application figure it out itself or the
magazine UX figure it out by itself
rather but for the most part it's pretty
easy to just get everything situated and
in order for you to change the sources
that might come up there you have the
menu button that's right here and it
will bring up this pullover that pulls
the information from the Flipboard
application as to what kind of sources
you'll be able to use now I have had a
problem with this in the past where it
takes a long time for this to populate
and sometimes it doesn't do so at all
but what you should be seeing here is a
list of different sources not only
categories and groups of sources but
actual sources themselves like let's say
android authority that you can get
specific stories from in there and as
you can see here it's not really loading
up right away and I actually haven't
been quite too sure why so this is one
of the flaws that happens to be in this
magazine UX yes it is a little bit buggy
still if this is any indication but
ultimately once you kind of get
everything set up it does give you a
nice glimpse into some of the news and
some of the social media that is out
there in your in your feeds now one
thing that I have mentioned plenty of
times in the review videos for these
various tablets is the fact that when
you really want to take a look at the
content like for example this just
kidding gamer video up here if i were to
tap on there it would load up Flipboard
instead of taking me straight to the
actual video itself which is what I
obviously want to do but if I were to
hit here it brings you to yet another
page from where you see the actual
article in Flipboard once again finally
hit play one last time and it will
finally play just us a little bit more
time than I would really hope the
magazine UX would make you go through
but it's a for the most part smag the
magazine you
x is a nice addition it's something that
TouchWiz has needed because it's looked
the same for years but there are a few
things to work out and hopefully Samsung
will do so in the next iterations of the
magazine UX either on the pro line or on
the actual phones themselves like the
galaxy s5 so until then keep it tuned to
android authority for all of the best
coverage we have the tab pro line of
tablets that we have been reviewing
recently and we have the tab pro 10.1
coming up pretty soon but also we have
of course the samsung galaxy s5 if you
saw all of our coverage of it from mwc
2014 in barcelona spain you'll know that
we are excited to take a look at that
phone and really put it through its
paces so for all of that coverage to
keep it tuned here give us thumbs up
