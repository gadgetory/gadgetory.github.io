to you by Full Sail University so you
guys may remember a few years ago a
video came out about the iPhone 5 just
before its release it was a concept
video suggesting that maybe one day the
iPhone 5 might have a holographic
capacity and be able to project a
holographic keyboard on your table from
the phone and you'd be able to
functionally use that keyboard to type
on your iPhone now of course this was
fake this was a concept video but that
did not stop some news outlets from
publishing it as if it were real
namely a Fox News affiliate from New
York State now I'm not suggesting the
video we talked about today is fake
because it is not but it does
demonstrate the tendency for us human
beings to not look very deeply into
things so we're gonna take this essex
edge bendgate video and look a little
deeper so a very brief history of
bendgate goes a little something like
this
last year my fellow Torontonian and
youtuber lou from unbox therapy took his
iphone six-plus
and found that he could relatively
easily bend the phone just under the
power button and he did a video of this
and it simply blew up it blew up so much
like 65 million views or something
insane like that that some people
accused him of having not so pure
motives so he did the test again in
Dundas Square in downtown Toronto in one
cut one take with a whole bunch of
witnesses and he did the same thing
again now all of this precipitated a
shall we say more scientific approach to
bendgate
proving that all phones will Bend under
enough pressure but some phones will
Bend more easier than others Ben tests
whether done manually or with well
collaborated testing rigs are now the
thing to do with any new hot device and
these days it doesn't get any hotter
than the galaxy s6 edge the folks that a
phone insurance company called
SquareTrade took it upon themselves to
verify just how well the Galaxy s6 edge
would hold under pressure and for good
measure SquareTrade also tested the
original bendgate victim and
high-profile Android flagship phones now
to break it down for you the galaxy s6
edge in the iPhone six-plus both
suffered permanent damage at a hundred
and ten pounds of force while the HTC
One did a little bit better bearing a
hundred and twenty pound load however
because of its curved construction the
glass on the galaxy s6 edge broke right
away while the glass and the other two
devices broke at a much higher load this
shouldn't be a surprise the dual curved
on the sheet of Gorilla Glass 4 covering
the s6 edge induces stress points that
simply don't exist on a flat pane of
glass now Samsung not one to take this
line down have their own response samson
is not denying square trades findings
but the company says a hundred and ten
pounds of force is well above the force
that a phone that is sat on in the back
pocket would endure which is around
sixty six pounds of force secondly
samsung points out that the galaxy s6
edge can withstand a higher force if the
force is applied on its back rather than
on its screen without offering an actual
figure samsung is asking SquareTrade to
conduct the stress test again which
targets both front and back sides and
open the test results to the public now
Samsung makes a very legitimate point
here a hundred and ten pounds of load is
well above what any smart phone is
designed to endure
that's a heavy amount of abuse now if
you take five pencils and you put them
all together in your hand and you try
and snap them that's gonna take
approximately sixty six pounds of
pressure so that gives you an idea of
how much pressure 110 pounds of load is
that is quite a bit now I wanted to
clear up something that was said by
mkbhd and Liu regarding whole bendgate
thing a few months ago if you remember
the second video of Liu on unbox therapy
where he bends the iphone six-plus again
he points out that not all phones are
like this he bends the iPhone 6 plus and
then he goes and tries to do the same
thing to his Moto X and it's a no-go the
Moto X would not Bend at all mkbhd
claimed that this was because the Moto X
had a magnesium chassis and it added
much more strength but I found out that
it was more to do with geometry than the
metal in the chassis there is a redditer
who gave a very intelligent and lengthy
response to the whole magnesium versus a
loom
chassie question and he said that the
metal had nothing to do with bendgate
and it had to do with the geometry of
the iPhone six-plus it's very big long
and thin and that's why it bent so much
easier whereas the Moto X is not just
thicker but it has a concave design
which added strength to the structure of
the phone so the moral of the story here
is that a thin device comes at a price
and that you should just take care of
your devices and try not to sit on them
so I promised you guys I'd talk about my
new phone just came yesterday the Sony
Xperia z3 compact let's start with the
things I don't like the phone is slick
so slipper in fact that I know it's
inevitable this phone is going to get
dropped so I have to have some sort of
case or bumper on it covering up an
otherwise gorgeous device there is no
lip on the bezel of this device so if
you don't have a case on the device
there's a good chance that you're gonna
scratch it when you put it down on a
table or some other surface they may
have little bits of sand or dirt or grit
it's gonna scratch the glass and my
third and final grandpa the phone it's
kind of a big one and it surrounds the
microSD card support although I have a
64 gigabyte class 10 card in there it's
really really fast I have stored all my
data my my video my photos all my
podcasts of music I can't store apps on
the SD card at all
so that means I'm confined to the 16
gigabytes of internal storage that's on
the device that doesn't suck right now
but 18 months from now that's gonna suck
what's up with that Sony now what do I
love well it's the obvious the whole
story around this phone is that it has
flagship power in a one-handed device
it's fantastic it's also very premium
when you hold it you know it's elegant
and sleek and expensive I also love the
dedicated camera button I don't know why
every device doesn't have that and
finally I really like the near stock
Android experience I put Google launcher
on there and it's fantastic it's very
similar to my Nexus so I've said this
before if you watch youtube videos about
mobile operating systems you really
might want to consider career in mobile
technology mobile tech is where it's at
and Full Sail University
online and on campus mobile development
bachelor's degree program can teach you
all the skills you need to take
advantage of these opportunities in this
degree you'll learn the specific
technology used in creating and

growing industry visit Full Sail dot edu
forward slash authority so if you guys
have any more questions about the Sony
Xperia z3 compact please put them in the
comments below I'll do my best to answer
as many as I can you don't have forget
about my brothers in Android jaws Joe in
the tectum to come along and Chris Gary
