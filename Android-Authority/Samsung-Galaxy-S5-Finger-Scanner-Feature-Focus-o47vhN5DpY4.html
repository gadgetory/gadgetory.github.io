coverage of the Samsung Galaxy s5 with a
look at the other hardware edition that
was put into the phone the fingerprint
scanner hey it's Josh regard from ESRI
authority what's going on everybody and
this is your future focus on the Samsung
Galaxy s5 regarding the finger scanner
alright and here we are with the Samsung
Galaxy s5 now I figured one of the best
ways to really show you what the finger
scanner is all about is to just set it
up with you right now so I'll go ahead
and just jump into the operating system
and we're just looking through
everything here are the app drawers and
whatnot but I'll just jump over to this
settings page now as you can see the
settings page has been updated it's now
all made up of circles and everything is
categorized in these pull downs that
allow you to kind of easily find the
various settings that you're looking for
and as you will find here in the
personalization area is the finger
scanner so let's go ahead and jump right
in now once I hit on fingerprints
manager in order to register my
fingerprint you'll see that it'll tell
you what options are available for using
your fingers of you know for various
functions and the main one here is the
fingerprint lock of course but you are
also able to verify your Samsung Account
with it so if you were to sign in to the
Samsung your Samsung Account you can use
the fingerprint scanner to have your
credentials already in there and it will
get you in so we'll just go ahead and
jump in now this is where you will
actually register your fingerprint so I
will probably just use my index finger
here and we'll just scan this up to
eight times for it to really register
that fingerprint so here we go
oops yeah you have to start at the
screen and come down on the pad of your
finger not the tip so you have to just
be kind of precise with it it's not all
that difficult to be honest and that
swipe should be finished all right and
this is where you would create a
password in case for whatever reason you
don't want to use your fingerprint and
you'll be able to just create one right
now so I'll just do that there you go
the fingerprint has been registered so
we'll just go ahead and hit OK to select
the screen lock the screen lock right
here and it says it's medium to high
security and that is pretty much true of
fingerprint scanners do allow for a
little bit more security when it comes
to your unlocking of the phone now
before I even show you the fingerprint
scanner in action to unlock my phone I
do want to show you real quick well
actually you can see it right there
recognized and we're right in you are
able to register up to three
fingerprints on here so you can maybe
have your middle finger or your thumb or
something like that now one thing that
is important to remember though is that
you have to swipe it in that particular
way right over the home button down here
so if you wanted to register your thumb
it's not necessarily that you can turn
on the phone and then swipe your thumb
in this way that is not true it would
have to be like that so the ease of use
on there might not be the best but
that's the reason why you have that
password in there as well so let's go
ahead and just head right back one quick
thing here you can see that there is the
verify Samsung account right here you
can enter your fingerprints in there and
it will get you in because it knows that
it's you and then after that that's
pretty much everything - the settings of
the fingerprint scanner so I'll just
head back to the home page turn off the
phone now I will have to say that one
thing I wish that this was able to do
was kind of always be on so that if you
did swipe your finger over it while the
screen was off maybe the screen would
turn on that would save a little bit of
time but that's a little bit of wishful
thinking on my part instead you would
unlock the phone and then you aren't
able to swipe your finger and get right
into the operating system so that pretty
much does it for the finger scanner I'll
show you again maybe one or two more
times while I'm wrapping up here
stay tuned to Android authority for all
of the best coverage especially our
coverage of the Samsung Galaxy s5 we are
looking at some of the newer features on
here and in this case we looked at the
finger scanner it is pretty useful in
terms of security but the one thing that
I would say is it does add a little bit
of time when it comes to getting from a
prone position into the operating system
itself so for some of you out there it
might not be the best solution for for
getting into your phone quickly but at
least it does add that level of security
that some people have really wanted so
keep it tuned to Android for all the
best coverage drop us likes on our
videos because we love to see those
thumbs up and also remember to subscribe
