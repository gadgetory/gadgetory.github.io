domain.com still undecided about which
is the best android smartphone for you
in 2015 I can help you out with that
quick ground rules before we start I'm
not going to list out all the specs from
each phone that's going to make the show
get very long and boring but I will show
you a quick screenshot of those specs
and give you the commentary on what I
think is most important about that
particular device here we go and right
at the top of our list is the Samsung
Galaxy s6 and s6 edge the korean giant
has finally delivered on a truly premium
galaxy s experience melding a glass
front and back with a metal frame most
tech journalists and even everyday tech
enthusiasts agree that the redesign is a
welcome one
of course samsung's new look isn't
without sacrifice ditching samsung
staples like a removable back and
battery the micro SD card slot is also
absent in the galaxy s6 another major
change for the galaxy s6 is the
processing package with Samsung electing
to leave behind qualcomm solely offering
up its Exynos 7420 processor pairing
with the three gigabytes of ram and
finally the software has also been
scaled back a bit with the latest
iteration of the galaxy s but maybe you
like the idea of the s6 but are hoping
for something that's a little edgier
while the galaxy s6 edge offers the same
specs but adds dual edges and a few
special features that take advantage of
the phone's unique design next up is the
Nexus 6p and as the successor to last
year's Motorola Nexus 6 Google recently
unveiled the Huawei made Nexus 6p the
device is the higher end of the two
Nexus phones announced at Google's event
and that's incredibly apparent when you
look at the spec sheet it comes with a
big 5.7 inch quad HD AMOLED display
superfast Snapdragon 810 processor a
giant 3450 milliamp hour battery and an
impressive 12 megapixel rear-facing
camera now the Nexus 6p is pretty cheap
also considering the specs and build
quality you can purchase it from the
Google store starting just at $4.99 us
next up is the LG g4 while maintaining
the design language and the unique al
moments of its predecessors LG's attempt
to stand out on the design front
involved adding a subtle curve to the
display and the availability of
different back cover options and a hard
plastic or leather variants speaking of
back covers this will make geeks very
happy the LG g4 is one of the very few
flagships to come with a removable back
cover which makes possible even a rarer
feature a replaceable battery a gorgeous
quad HD display a great camera
experience and a smooth and fluid
software iteration make for a fantastic
device if what is missing in other
flagships kept you from buying them the
g4 just might be the phone that you're
looking for but if you aren't completely
satisfied with the LG g4 perhaps the v10
will suit your needs better it has the
same powerful Snapdragon 808 processor
and 16 megapixel rear facing camera as
the g4 but with a few extra features
kicked in most notably the v10 sports a
secondary ticker display LG calls the
second screen this extra display aims to
provide its users with useful
information without the need to turn to
the main screen it will display app
shortcuts notifications and even weather
and battery percentage information next
up is the motorola moto x style here
motorola tries to reach the perfect
balance between performance simplicity
price and well style by style were
mostly referring to customization a
factor which has been an integral part
of the Moto X experience since day one
customers can use the Moto maker to
manipulate their devices aesthetics to
their will you can change the color of
the metal areas and grave the back and
even choose from a plethora of back
options including materials like leather
wood and rubber now this list would not
be complete without talking about the
big boy on the block the samsung galaxy
note 5 it's hard to nying that Samsung
has always been the king of large screen
smartphones and it still holds true
today with its crystal clear 5.7 inch
display powerful Exynos 7420 CPU and a
killer 16 megapixel rear facing camera
the Galaxy Note is one of the best
Android phones available on the market
today with all that said though this
device doesn't come without its caveats
samsung's decision to omit the microSD
card slot and removable battery have
been a controversial one over the past
few weeks
special among Samsung diehards even with
those notable emissions the note 5 can
still be considered one of the best out
there and finally let's talk about the
Sony Xperia z5
it may not stray too far away from other
Sony handsets on the design front but
there's nothing wrong with that
it's one of the sleekest and most
elegant smartphones on the market thanks
to its mostly glass design and metal
frame it also has some pretty solid
specifications under the hood the z5 is
powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810
processor backed by three gigabytes of
RAM and comes with a big 2900 milliamp
hour battery
it also features Sony's new 23 megapixel
Exmor RS camera sensor microSD expansion
up to 200 gigabytes and a fingerprint
sensor that's embedded in the home
button now some of you may be wondering
about the z5 premium and why that's not
on our list
well we haven't finished a full review
on that yet but this article that the
show is based on will be updated on a
regular basis check it out in the links
below what do you guys think what did I
miss what should I've added let me know
in the comments below I'll be reading
them now for those of you who remember
me from two YouTube channels ago how to
become TV which is still going on I got
the dot TV instead of the.com thinking
that when I had a little bit of traction
I would then buy the dot-com domain name
from the person who owned it but that
was a false move I should have changed
the name to something where I could have
acquired the dot-com from the beginning
now why is that because no domain name
extension tells your story with the same
degree of trust as a dot-com or dotnet
domain name.com and dotnet domain name
