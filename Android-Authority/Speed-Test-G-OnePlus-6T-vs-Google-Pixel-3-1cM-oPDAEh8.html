Andrew Authority now hopefully you saw
my announcement video over on the Gary
explains channel talking about this new
system I've got called speed test G
which takes the best of speed tests and
the very best of benchmarks and combines
them together to give a whole new way to
define and measure the real-world
performance of a smartphone and today
we're going to be pitting two phones
against each other that I think are
gonna be quite exciting we're gonna be
pitting the oneplus 60 against the
Google pixel three so without any more
waiting let the testing begin obviously
these two phones are quite different in
many many ways however at the heart of
each device we find the same processor
the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845
now the 845 is an octa-core setup it has
a four core it's a 75 cos then for
course it's a 55 calls and then of
course the Adreno 630 GPU probably the
biggest difference between these two
devices in terms of the processing is
that the oneplus 60 has 8 gigabytes of
RAM and the pixel 3 has 4 gigabytes of
RAM those we've been really interested
to see how they do
head-to-head okay so let's go we've got
blonde plus 60 on the left and the pixel
3 on the right hand side everything
looks to be neck and neck at the moment
they've both gone into the blur test and
now into 204 8 there's a message there
saying that game mode has been turned on
I wonder whether that makes a difference
for the oneplus sixty further down the
road we will see and now we're into the
bloom test again lots of CPU and GPU
usage here because the blooms are being
created by the GPU there and let's see
they're both doing quite well ok into
the SQLite test all the pixel 3 is going
rocketing ahead bet it's already
finished
and while the 1 plus 60 is a little bit
behind it's doesn't fission and now it's
going to the cube says now that would be
about four maybe five seconds at the
oneplus 60 has dropped a beat there so
will it be able to catch up as we go
through the rest of a test it's now into
the 2d gaming test while the pixel 3 has
now gone on to the 16 thread test this
is quite interesting I don't know
whether this device is going to be able
to recover from that miss Howe
we had down there in the SQLite 216
thread test going well on both machines
and now we're into the unity testing 3d
testing on the pixel 3 we're now also in
there on the oneplus 60
both these rights to have the same GPU
in them so they should be able to get
through them roughly in the same amount
of time they both look to be fairly
smooth now while we're waiting for this
test to finish I do want to remind you
can get more speed tests G videos over
on the Gary explains channel make sure
you go over there and subscribe and
please do leave a comment telling me
what other phones you would like to see
me compare in this kind of format then
we're coming to the end of a test yes
the pixel 3 has finished that test now
doing the last test which is the
compression test and so is the oneplus
60
can it maybe catch up at the last moment
here no it can't
pixel 3 come in at one minute and 44
seconds and the final score for the
oneplus 16 was one minute and 49 seconds
Wow there you go what a results of the
pixel 3 was actually faster than the
oneplus 60 now while it was technically
the winner because it did come in first
actually that difference is really quite
small and can be down to the deviation
in individual test runs so overall we
need to declare this an actual tie well
hello my name is Gary is Sims and this
is Andrew authority I really hope you
enjoyed this video if you did please do
give it a thumbs up also please let me
know in the comments below what did you
think about this test run do were you
expecting the 60 to really beat the
pixel 3 are you surprised the
performance there of the pixel 3 also
please tell me what you think about this
new speed test G format ok please don't
forget to subscribe don't forget to
share this video amongst your friends
and on social media and that's it I'll
see you the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
