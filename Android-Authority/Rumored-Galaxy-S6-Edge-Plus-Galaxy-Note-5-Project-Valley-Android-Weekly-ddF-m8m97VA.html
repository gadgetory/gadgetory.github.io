brought to you by huh indies hair I know
what you're thinking shut up Jason get
to the news and rumors regarding those
phablets here we go alright so let's
start off with the galaxy s6 edge plus
the latest rumours hint at a 5.7 inch
display complete with the dual curved
edge display of the galaxy s6 edge
previously a 5.5 inch model had been
rumoured furthermore Sam mobile suggests
that the handset will ship with android
5.1 point 1 out of the box and that the
smartphone will arrive in q3 2015 we've
already seen an early build of android
5.1 point one running on the galaxy s6
so a newer version of android seems
likely for samsung's upcoming smartphone
now a new trademark for a samsung
handset has just been spotted in south
korea which points to a product called
the s6 note although the trademark
doesn't contain any hardware details the
note name tag suggests that this is a
larger handset it's possible that the s6
edge+ is actual name could end up being
the galaxy s6 note now what about the
note 5 arguably the biggest device to
come later this year is the new note and
as we approach the summer months the
rumor mill begins to reveal what we
expect from samsung's next flagship
phablet according to a new report which
cites Samsung's employees talking on a
Chinese social network Weibo the galaxy
note 5 will have a USB 3.1 type-c
connector and if this is true the galaxy
note 5 could be one of the best devices
of the year it's interesting that
Samsung is considering using USB type-c
especially when rival OEM Sony ruled out
using it in its smartphones if the
galaxy note 5 has a large enough battery
the ability to use it to charge another
smartphone will certainly be of use of
you carry more than one phone samsung
will also reportedly pair USB type-c
with USB power delivery v 2 point 0
which can deliver up to a hundred watts
of power and should mean that new
technology will charge your handset a
whole lot faster USB type-c will also
mean you can transmit
it to a 4k display in full native
resolution the folks at Sam mobile have
obtained information about a new device
Samsung is working on allegedly called
project valley or simply project V said
to be in the very early stages of
development the key feature here is a
pair of screens and specialized gestures
to alternate between them a caveat is
given that the product may never see the
light of day let alone a public
unveiling and could be terminated at any
time given the nature of the code name
project Valley there is the obvious
implication that the device will fold at
least somehow the question is or problem
rather just how advanced such a feature
would be years ago sony released the
Sony Tablet P which features two screens
that fold it into one larger one the
same was true for the Japanese exclusive
NAC madea's w dual screen smartphone and
let's not forget the echo arguably the
grandfather of them all still these
devices all use two separate panels to
achieve the desired effect if Samsung is
working on something this rudimentary it
would call into question the logic
giving that all three of the
aforementioned devices fared rather
poorly on the other hand if Samsung is
developing this prototype as a way to
commercialize its foldable AMOLED
dispatch then there's a lot of potential
just look at how the Galaxy Note edge
worked is a great indication of the
potential as said device featured two
separate screens fused together into a
product that had a very intuitive and
unique way of interacting with it now
it's important to note here that this is
simply a patent filing and may actually
never end up in a store but it is
interesting to get a peek into Samsung's
research and development now we heard
some crazy rumors that Blackberry might
be considering producing an Android
device for sources familiar with the
matter are telling routers the Waterloo
Ontario manufacturers getting ready to
release an android device these internal
sources claim that blackberry is likely
to release a phone running the android
OS this autumn it's said to come with a
touchscreen and one of those physical
keyboards that continue to keep the few
crackberry fans around using this dying
platform
it wouldn't be your usual blackberry
bold like device and keyboard though
this unique blackberry phone is said to
have a slide out keyboard that you can
opt to use or simply ignore now when
blackberry was approach for an official
statement they said we don't comment on
rumors and speculation but we remain
committed to the blackberry 10 operating
system which provides security and
productivity benefits that are unmatched
what one might argue that this is a
desperate attempt to gain more market
share but that seems to be far from the
case the idea is probably to promote the
BES 12 security services running on
other platforms BES 12 works not only
with blackberry 10 but also with Android
iOS and Windows Phone and since android
is the most prolific mobile OS in the
world it only makes sense to try and
show the world what BES can do with it
or maybe our friend Christina Mora said
it best when she said this keyboard is
like a good-looking lover you have a
one-night stand with it feels good to
the touch but it doesn't make the best
alternative in the long run let me know
what you guys think in the comments
below so I just finished watching Game
of Thrones no spoilers no spoilers no
spoilers but I gotta tell you Oh a
little bit of me died inside tonight
died oh god I don't think I could handle
it let me know in the comments below
what you thought about today's show I'll
be sure to read them and you can follow
me on Google+ or Twitter and I'm uh
morning my game of thrones hangover I
shouldn't see you later on this week on
android weekly you don't wanna forget
about my brothers in android always
working super hard to be your source for
all things android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
