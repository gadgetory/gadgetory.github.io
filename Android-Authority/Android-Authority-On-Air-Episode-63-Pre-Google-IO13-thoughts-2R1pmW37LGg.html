original android hangout show on google+
I'm Derek Ross not I'm Dan Charlton I'm
Johnathan Franklin and as you can tell
Scott Anderson is not with us this
evening unfortunately he couldn't be
here but he's here in spirit I'm sure so
so let's get started and find out what
we're gonna talk about this evening well
as you know pretty much the mecca of all
Google and all Android things is
happening in a few days in San Francisco
it's pretty much Christmas in well this
year it's Christmas in May and we're
going to talk about what predictions
thoughts expectations you know what we
want to see or what we think we're going
to see in a few days from google at i/o
13 and who will find out that bill gates
thinks that we're frustrated or
frustrated and that sucks because we
can't create documents on our android
devices that he thinks we can so we'll
talk about that uh we got some app
updates as usuals we're gonna yell about
some carrier stuff you know they're
doing LTE you know because they've been
doing that forever now and we've hit
some devices we talked about some cool
root stuff I have cm 10.1 on my HTC
droid DNA and we'll talk about some
patents so so let's say yes let's let's
get started here all right so as we said
I of 13 is in a few days so what are we
looking to see what do we think we're
gonna see what what rumors and
speculations you know can we put
together in hell what do we want to see
that we might not see so Android 4.3
chances are it's coming in that chances
are that's the version number but
version numbers really don't matter yeah
it could be could be version 4.7 2.3 I
don't really care version numbers don't
mean anything but we've seen various
logs Oh on our website as well as other
Android news sites show android 4.3
in the web blog so chances are that's
gonna be the version number but like I
said that doesn't really matter so so
what what what do we think we're going
to see with Android 4.3 well we know
that a few months back on code google
com bluetooth low energy or Bluetooth
smart was referenced and that that's a
big thing because what uses and what
needs bluetooth low energy or ble google
glass and right now there's no official
support for Androids that's a big thing
I mean HTC has their own you know
Bluetooth Low Energy stack Samsung's
doing it so just their own Bluetooth
stack yes and Samsung's doing it but no
they're not the same they don't work the
same so to have you know a unified
stance on it that's great so we'll be
able to have more Android devices
support this down the roads and throw
chances are they'll be using similar or
the same code so that that's awesome I'm
excited for that you know so we can
highly speculate that thats coming since
it was mentioned it might maybe possibly
be supported down the road um one thing
I'd love to see that you know
unfortunately we can say that iOS does
it better you know iOS does do a thing
or two better not very many but right
now iOS backs up your your app data so
there isn't there isn't an official
solution from google to do this sure you
know your wife i'll be backed up it'll
automatically restore all your apps from
the Play Store but you know when you're
on level 72 of Angry Birds that's not
going to be backed up unless you
download a third-party app and do it
yourself so it'd be nice to see you an
official stance on that what do you guys
think is that something that you want to
have your ear your data automatically
being backed up yeah i mean i'd like to
see a bit more of a unified approach
from google in terms of all of their
data storage right you get usually
around 10 gigabytes of storage in your
gmail you get 5 gigabytes
origin your drive you get unloaded
storage in your pictures through google
plus you get another unlimited amount of
storage for your contacts you get
another 20,000 songs worth of songs it'd
be nice if all of this was unified into
drive just as separate special folders
for each of these things that adhered to
all the different data limits that way
you could unify all that stuff and have
all of your data back ups and have a lot
more control over those backups because
right now they sink sometimes but it's
not really clear when or how or where
that data goes and you don't really have
any access to it after the fact so if
they exposed all of that and made it
more you know user-friendly and
controllable that would really give
people all that back of ability they
need as well as a unified access to
everything to be dry that's a that's a
big point another thing in it that even
Chrome OS does better than android does
there in terms of drive is just a
android is a really good file manager
from you know to we think about how
files are done you know most of your
desktop operating systems if they had a
file manager then really manage music
and pictures and does is right now
you're really depending on the
independent apps to manager media that
we're a really good file manager would
alleviate a lot of that problem
absolutely if it had like an open API
where even companies like Dropbox the
fuse box or something else I in it at
one place yeah would be a big really
good thing for Android to have just as a
stock option for anybody yeah could be
huge alright so you know androids huge
obviously we have no clue what's coming
what awesomeness is going to be bestowed
upon us but we do know something so we
do know that an android gaming center is
coming you know there's there's a
million signs out there Google hired you
know a gaming industry a bigwig you know
and his title on linkedin was android
place to do you know header manager you
know for a while and then got changed
you know we've seen leak
from the myglass app that had all sorts
of code referencing Google games thanks
to android police is amazing APK
teardown and thanks to a new APK
teardown the new google services app
that the google services after those you
don't know is the little green g icon it
has all of your google services inside
it such as google for google apps yeah
yeah for for your google app that it's a
one-stop shop for all your google apps
settings basically and the Google+
sign-in and stuff like that so a new
version started rolling out to people
and when you rip it apart d compile it
and start digging into it enjoy police
found out that there's all sorts of game
stuff out there and that's how chances
are that's how it's going to be
delivered to you that you know they
found stuff for notifications
matchmaking leaderboards achievements
invitations and even cloud syncing your
game data so that's kind of what we are
talking about but it's it's another way
to do it so if it's not a game well you
can't sink it so anyways uh what we
still do need some type of the app
backup to the cloud but so will we see
multiple wait you know leaks
speculations about games so we know
there's something coming around a google
game studio a google games play games
you know but there seems to be something
missing so a piece of the puzzle you
know we see everything lining up in a
row surrounding something but it's not
complete yet so is it going to be a
separate app is it going to be a piece
of hardware um and that brings me to the
next speculation that that i have and
that we have here in android authority
um we think there's going to be a google
TV reboot I don't know what to call it
so we'll call it that um feel free to
buy thank you call it a new platform
right isn't there a session titled the
new Google TV platform well yeah yeah
yeah we see a session at i/o called the
the future of Android TV and in
it's a it's a google TV session called
called the future of android TV so that
makes a lot of sense and when you read
the description it says learn how to
develop on the new Google TV platform so
so right there that basically means that
a new platform is coming and it's maybe
going to be Android it's not gonna be
for Tony comb anymore and welcome was
Android well yeah android though so you
start so you start digging you start
thinking a little bit anymore you know
there's tons of companies that have
these little hdmi sticks they call them
google TV but it's not then we have we
know it and Nvidia and and then their
gaming device you know and then you have
oh yah and their gaming console you have
you have all these android games with in
sexual hardware so i don't think that if
the android game studio or game center
or play games is going to be all
software i think we're going to see a
hardware device and it's going to be a
google TV reboot I mean all the signs
are pointing in that direction um you
know I I think that that's going to be
Google's answer to that and I think
we're going to find out here in a few
days and we're going to be pretty
excited that that you know we're gonna
that Google is going to take over the
living room that way since Google TV is
awesome as it is it hasn't been adopted
by the masses and you know what is
adopted by the masses console games you
know every everybody has xbox
playstation you know whatever so I I
think I think that's really going with
that um I still think that's going to be
difficult for them to accomplish if they
want to go after the console market
they're gonna have to do so by producing
console level games you have console
level games you have to have console
little hardware to run those games I
don't care how good the Snapdragon 800
and the Tegra 4 and the Exodus whatever
comes after the octa are they aren't
going to be good enough to run what you
can run on an i7
and you know a top-end nvidia graphics
card and android really supports x86
there's no reason that they shouldn't
try to attack a higher-end console what
there's there's still a slight hole and
I don't know if I can say this
universally about Android but I know
that I can say this about all of the
hardware that Android has two day to run
on its 32 bit oh yeah so yes it runs on
x86 but I don't know if it runs on
64-bit is Android itself capable of
addressing more than 4 gigabytes of RAM
I don't know find out I guess we'll find
out you know here in the future what
what's actually happening so some of
their speculations beside Android itself
and besides no new google TV hardware um
we know that Babel is pretty much coming
and it chances are it's it's not going
to be called Babel anymore it's gonna be
called hangouts and you know that makes
sense the name makes sense I really
don't care what it's called I've said
you know publicly before it can be
called well I won't say what I said it
would be called it can be called poop
messenger you know in the and I don't
really care i'm gonna use it the name
really doesn't matter to me it matters
to other people but that's just me so
but calling it hangouts makes a lot of
sense because google is heavily driving
um google+ you know heavily driving
google+ services home to users so
calling it something that already exists
or expanding upon hangouts even further
to make it a unified messaging platform
then that makes perfect sense to me um
but you guys think about that you know
think that make sense until i mean you
have to build off of your previous you
know reputation there and it's not like
there's anything wrong with google's
current services they're just too
they're just too many Oh what I'm
curious about it is what will happen
with talk that's what I'm you know I'm
curious about well the thing is talk and
hangouts are kind of already sort of
half acidly integrated in that you can
launched hangouts now from talk right
like you use feel to do video chats and
audio chats through talk and now they've
replaced that functionality with
hangouts so I don't think that it'd be
really difficult to replace talk with
just like the chat box that comes in
hangouts and have that just be- the
video right for just a chat only the
thing is you've already got integrated
into hangouts phone calls so why aren't
the integrating voice all right is that
it's also interesting because talk is
the one google at the of all the
Google's core application suite on
phones is locked into the system
partition on phone some that's not in
the market hopefully they have the
foresight to make it able to be updated
on the market easily for anyone I would
hope that any unified messaging comes
just as an update to talk even if it's
renamed and as a new icon just builds
off about because talk well I think that
they would distribute in a fashion it
allows the talk app to be suppressed no
as the app itself would be downloadable
from the mark from the Play Store the
one I think that movie on the handle it
I mean cuz right right now think about
it so all these android devices have
talked installed and now people go out
and maybe it comes with up maybe it
comes with Google+ is part of the you
know Google+ messenger or it's a
separate app who knows however it's
going to be deployed but so and then now
people have talked you know it might be
confusing for people you know what what
is overcome well you say that but you're
also smarter than the average bear yes
but so is Google
right all they have to do is distribute
via the market have them have the Play
Store look at it as an update to talk
and as a standalone app if that's if
that's how it downloads itself
automatically for the user it suppresses
the the talk app that's in the system
they can't remove at that point that man
know then that makes sense if their
placement app if it's going to be in an
upgrade to the current existing talk app
yeah I mean it'll be a standalone new
app and replacement but it'll be kind of
the same way that drive just suddenly
replaced as an update google docs yeah
I'm hoping it really takes that route
because yeah google knows how to code
for the platform that they freaking
design right like they they can make
this happen pretty easily well I guess
we'll find out so let's talk about some
other apps uh gmail gmail gmail could be
a lot better um it could it could looks
similar and acts similar to Google Plus
you know with slide-out navigation you
know so you're seeing all of your
folders listed and they hide when you're
not using them and you know could be you
know that's slightly more colorful it
could be more hollow fide you know if
you will so I'd like to see a little you
know do gmail is very simple i'd like to
see it change a lot like those renders
we saw you know maybe a month or so ago
where a fan put together some artwork
and it looked in all up a lot like
Google+ but it was gmail I was a big fan
of that and John I think you're going to
talk about in here a minute some things
that happened along those lines updating
existing apps such as Google Shopper and
Google Earth but before we get to that
um maps google maps you know great
extremely powerful we'll use it every
day we love it but the iOS version is
gorgeous not to say that the android
version isn't gorgeous but the Iowas
version looks a little bit better so
maybe we'll get a more Hollow esque in
more holo design
with maps I'd like to see some type of
updated design with it the music is
worth mentioning to light the last of
the honeycomb Tron yeah how how is this
house music still look music hasn't been
updated besides functionality since
since Tron honeycomb you'd be fed of
bats know that it needs it needs to get
beautified it needs it needs cards it
needs to look like Google now you know
theythey you know and it needs to look
like the new play store yeah yeah it
also needs better functionality it kind
of sucks right now and the last update
to it actually made it worse all right
so google recently pushed updates for
Google Earth and Google Shopper and in
these new new versions have the new
slide-out menu similar to Google Plus so
it looks like they're starting to update
apps maybe to have that but there's some
menu inconsistencies that exist in
current apps and these new apps address
you know some of that problem so we're
going to see more of this get it fixed
in the future so right now current
problems with slide outs are nobody can
really decide whether the action bar
should stay anchored or should stay you
know when the curves I'm sorry so the
action bar stay will anchor when the
slide-out menu is open so you should you
always have the action bar there or not
you know as the menus you know sliding
in and out slide men now now some
applications move the list out of the
way as if the menu is underneath it's
hidden and some make the menu appear as
if it hovers over the the main app so
there's a different implementation then
we really don't know you know we need a
guideline Google we need to say this is
how you do it always do it this way um
the up arrow the up carrot is used as a
visual indicator for both slide out
menus and also for
navigating back the previous way so you
don't really know is if you hit back is
it going to you know go back or is it
gonna you know just pop the slide-out
menu back you know there needs to be a
like some type of unification there some
someone say yep this is how you do it
always do it this way um so the solution
to get rid of some of these
inconsistencies Google pushed an update
like I said to earth and to shopper that
showcase a three-line menu icon similar
to what you see on web sites and also
the chrome overflow menu I'm just
holding it up emotion let me out alright
so those are you watching right now hold
that there for a minute let's focus it's
really semi it looks just like the what
they change the chrome menu to after the
ranch it's exactly am I menu that looks
just like the action overflow tunes it's
pretty yeah that you know I think you
said it all felt it looks like it looks
like chrome it looks like chrome and
that means that there's a menu under
there and if you slide it there's a sub
little animation that actually makes the
menu appear almost like the three dots
smaller to indicate this it's it's
really cool it hovers over instead of
just popping the list out of the way it
just hover straight over like that and
nice it's a lot yeah so it it it's nice
it looks it's looks similar to Google
Plus but better because the the menu the
menu lives menu yeah the menu is a menu
the menus a menu so you know when you're
gonna bring out the menu when you're not
so maybe we'll see this new design come
to you know Gmail maybe we'll see it
come to everything everything yeah i
mean i'd like to see you come to
everything I'd like them to pick
something and bring it to everything not
just to some things for most things but
taking everything well you know I
already elapsed have their own like it
it seems like every different you know
development team our designer has their
own slight interpretation of the holo UI
and you know and each each app is
slightly different on depending on what
they want to do it'd be nice to have a
guideline I hope they put a library out
for developers to take advantage of this
like the day that they show these
applications off because it needs to be
you know you can't fix facebook and
other ones like that but you can at
least get your other developers on board
for one thing so let's move on here you
know besides apps what else we going to
see it I oh well I think we're wearable
tech is going to be popular I mean
obviously glass is a big craze right now
and I think Google will show us some
nice use cases for glass such as apps
you'll make it more than just
notifications and sharing a little bit
of data here and there maybe we'll get
you know some nice demos or some nice
information about some some new apps
that are coming out specifically for
glass to make glass more attractive to
the general public and there's also been
some rumors about an android smart watch
coming from the Android team so that's
that's interesting um I'm curious to see
to see if that rumor comes to fruition
about you guys when you think about a
android smart watch at il hmm I'm not
really wild about the SmartWatch idea
the reason half the reason I don't wear
a watch is because I have a smartphone
but if I do wear watch it's going to be
an Omega Seamaster so I'm not gonna put
a digital device on my hand again I mean
I just like the simplicity of having one
device to have to manage instead of
having multiple yeah I don't even an
accessory that's just a front end to my
phone it's not that hard to get my phone
out it reminds me of the days when you
had an mp3 player and the phone and yeah
you handle laptop and all that you know
I mean it's almost like they're trying
to circle back around to that just
because the hard oh the hardware vendors
are trying to dig to find something to
make money all right so I so I see
you're saying you don't want you don't
want a pebble cuz pebble was you know
notifications and not a whole lot more
than that
so what if it was stock Android and it
did more you could run apps on and you
know it was more than Google now I gotta
run on something that's a freaking inch
and a half across maybe you wanna look
at your tasks you will look at the the
weather yeah but this is all still just
basic front-end great like it's still
Gary pulling the data off my phone well
we don't know that I would assume so it
would pull it off your phone otherwise
Jesus now have an other data plan for
some freak another device so okay so you
know i'd like i'd really like to see a
SUV you guys are saying i would like to
see in the future the SmartWatch do away
with the phone the SmartWatch has my
cell radios in it it has you know GPS
and it has Wi-Fi in it it is my phone
and then I use glass to make all my
phone call so I don't need I don't need
a third device you know I don't need the
a smart phone in my pocket I i have my
SmartWater and my google glass and and
that does everything for me see and like
what I'd like to see is one one device
that's potentially not a smart anything
like not even something you can interact
with necessarily just a box you carry
with you that is your computing device
for everything and then you have your
watch and your glasses and your tablet
and your phone or really not even the
phone because you have headphones
through the glasses but your computer
and everything else just runs off that
box by proximity
you're a little power cube yeah so
you're always working on the same day
it's always unified because everything
else is just a terminal it's just a
front end for it okay all right so which
would also make all of those endpoints a
lot cheaper because they don't need to
carry all the sensors and all the
everything else so in terms of hardware
chances are rumors speculate that
there's going to be at some type of
nexus 7 refresh a new Nexus 7 Nexus 7
reboot dear God do not call it a nexus 8
for that matter don't say Nexus 5 and
don't say Nexus 11 because those numbers
are those numbers don't mean a damn
thing besides a speculation on artwork
and you like you know the internal
numbering scheme for Google devices and
Nexus devices you know so I'm sayin new
Nexus 7 because I don't know anything
else besides that and chanted what's
that saying yeah no calling it the nexus
8 because it's the next number is just
dumb dumb because then what happens when
you know okay so if the next Nexus phone
is the 5 and the one after that's the 6
is there then going to be a nexus 7
phone well yeah so what do you know it's
the next what happens when the seven
eight nine runs up to 10 well that's cuz
you know 6 is afraid of seven to seven
right like obviously they're going to
have to do something to like to start
duplicating numbers because they can't
just keep incrementing them when they've
already used ones in front of each other
yeah I I think it's a silly uh yeah and
then people saying is based on size only
know because the nexus 4 is a four-point
something what sort of Phi that is for
but whatever in the nexus 7 27 inch and
then 10 inch for nexus 10 but that
doesn't mean they were the Nexus 11 is
good 11 inch to I you know if this this
conversation is making us more dumb
right now talking about it so let's get
back to nexus 7 reboot rumors but specs
and leaks in spec sheets showing up
online so we're hearing rumors saying it
might be a tenant
screen and it might have a Snapdragon
processor now then you some yeah I think
there's some things you want to say
about this nexus 7 Snapdragon processor
am i right well we've been seeing rumors
for a pretty long time not that this
device is going to have a Snapdragon
processor and I've seen a lot of
different rumors as to which Snapdragon
processor it's going to have just the
other day I saw some we're running a
headline about it having an s4 pro or
the same thing that's in the nexus 4 um
I've seen rumors but having a Snapdragon
600 same thing that's in the HTC One and
the s4 and I've seen rumors very
recently that say it's going to have an
800 I'm kind of skeptical about it
having a Snapdragon 800 processor though
because that is going to be a very top
end processor and this is going to be a
very priced low-end device so I'd be
very surprised to see the Snapdragon 800
debut in a two-hundred-dollar device
other than it does that would be
processed through huge slap in the face
of nvidia i mean that that processor is
coming out you know the you know this is
just as Todd supposed to be coming out
in devices that you can buy early third
quarter so two in july august and let's
say the new Nexus 7 isn't available
until june or july well that which makes
it a year past the last one the original
Nexus 7 so that could make sense it once
availability but still you're not going
to get talk to your high-end you know
processor straight off the shelf the
exact same day the budget tablet
launches you know it could it could show
up in a nexus 10 in the fall but seeing
it I I just don't yet know yeah I one of
our commoners making this uh I'm never
going to try it the last name there I
asked which Snapdragon doesn't include a
modem and that's the s4 pro which is why
I think that's actually a pretty
legitimate rumor because it doesn't
include a broadband modem it just
includes Wi-Fi
so I mean that's to give them the
freedom that pretty easily add any
network sport that they want but it
would also give them the ability to sell
a cheaper version of it just by not
having that hardware yeah I want to call
one of our commenters you know saying I
did they like the Nexus 7 HD you know if
it comes with a higher res screen and
that's that's cool and all but you know
I I think a simpler name is better you
know we don't need to start taxing on
numbers to the end of it I swear the
kerwin is HD yeah it's just 720p yeah
and then we start you know getting into
things like you know asus nexus 7 4g LTE
HD like yeah we don't need to do that to
the Nexus all let's keep it simple let's
keep it clean let's keep it sexy and
yeah in fact I actually think that's
something that Apple has done well with
their branding where they've done away
with the numbers on the iPads right it's
just the new iPad every time under me
yeah you know we laugh at that but it i
like that you know yeah hey here is one
device for releasing it every year it's
always called the same thing and if you
want the cheapest version you know that
you're getting last year's model with
someone selling you an ipad for cheaper
yeah you're getting the you know 2012
the 2013 right just like you're getting
a camry it's always a port it's always a
toyota camry it's just what model year
exactly a you don't want it oh so what
camera you do you draw i drive a camry
74 oh right obviously not the same thing
as one that was made in 2012 00 so you
driving a car that's 30 years old no no
this is uh the 74th edition of my in
well the other side is even if you buy
the same tablet four times that year
you're always getting a new one yeah
it's a new one every single time you
talk it doesn't matter if it's before or
not is the next comes always newer than
the last one you add yep so besides a
Nexus device I think we'll see
um chances are it'll be a new nexus 7
just because then the previous the
current Nexus 7 is up is almost a year
old so we have to see something to
refresh it and I want Google to let us
know make us want to buy the pixel you
know I think the pixel is very expensive
and it's not a device that everybody can
afford so make us want it want it do
something with chrome OS that is going
to shock and awe us into wanting to buy
the pixel you know have all those
bloggers out there that rent you know
that wrote the pixel off about how it
was horrible have them eat their words
and say wow when they said this device
was for what's next they were they were
right this device is for what's next I
want that that shock and awe to come
with crema less because so I think we've
talked a lot about what we'll see what
you know we think we'll see some
speculations and rumors and thoughts on
google i/o so what I want you guys do
that are watching live right now or if
you're watching later doesn't matter let
us know in the comments what you would
like to see at Google i/o if you think
we missed something or if you think
we're absolutely crazy and we will see a
nexus 5 damn it and we will see a nexus
8 and everyone is going to buy the nexus
11 or maybe you think it's the nexus or
something I'm sorry I'm still gunning
for the nexus 4 20's where I am guess he
that post i made earlier anyways um so
so Bill Gates he everyone knows who Bill
Gates says he needs no introduction he
took to the news media and he said
Android users you're frustrated so what
exactly do you mean by that well I'm
gonna read you the quote here he said a
lot of those users are frustrated they
can't type they can't create documents
they don't have office there so we're
providing them with the benefits of
something they've seen
and made that a big category but without
giving up what they expect in a PC a
little bit later he goes on to say
Windows 8 Windows 8 is revolutionary in
that it takes benefits of a tablet and
the benefits of a pc and it's able to
support both of those so if you have
surface all four of you surface pro
you've got that portability of a tablet
and the richness of a pc in terms of the
keyboard microsoft office and of a pc so
Dan how do you feel that you've never
been able to create a document on
Android no I can't say that's true in
fact I've done that my transformer prime
is quite good for content creation and
hey wait supports a keyboard it doesn't
necessarily support microsoft office but
it supports formats that Microsoft
Office also supports so such as Google
Drive right google docs right it's
interoperable with Microsoft Office it's
not necessarily a full replacement I
can't do things like PowerPoint or a
vizio or a lot of other but for basic
word processing this w base consumer is
going to use yeah it works pretty soso a
John are you frustrated that you can't
create documents with Android yes well I
mean there are so many platforms that
can create documents but Windows Phone 8
is the perfect example of how irrelevant
the Microsoft Office argument is
becoming to the average consumer they
don't even give a cut to be to be
completely honest it's not a selling
point anymore at all and the people are
running to tablets because they don't
have bloated software suites that
confuse them because most people when
Microsoft asked them what they would
like to see come to the next version of
office people will rattle off features
that office already had that they had no
clue how to get to so it's nice to say
oh you can create this kind of stuff on
there but people just don't
want to they're not buying it for that
so yeah he wasn't buying it so they can
read the emails not so they can write
the you know five page report yeah i'm
going to you that is not about how many
features you know excel has or word has
or powerpoint has it they are loaded
with an insane amount of features now
think about how many features you
actually use on your day-to-day basis
the average everyday functions can be
done in google docs and sheets and
slides and well the other thing is it's
pretty easy to break the capacity of
spirit google spreadsheets yeah its
surface area surface is a decent
compromise there but it's not a laptop
i'm sorry but the keyboard is not a
laptop keyboard it is not the same it
doesn't feel as good but if i want to do
a lot of typing in a lot of creation i'm
getting a laptop or a desktop to do it
i'm not doing yeah in-betweener that's
not as good as one or the other at do it
you know and people have shown with
devices like ipad or android tablets or
cones that they're willing to pay for
simpler devices that are catered to a
singular purpose people are willing to
shell out money if it does that in a
really good way yeah it's not and i
think good james williams one of our
friends here on google+ said it best a
while ago when talking about windows 8
in surface pro he said that it doesn't
do either of the functions that you know
that it can do very well it's like a
half-ass tablet and a half assed desktop
in one you know if it can't do either
one great but it could have to ask each
one of them yeah they overreacted to the
problem in half assed at the exact same
time alright so android users that are
watching and listening are you
frustrated but you can't create
documents do you need windows 8 to come
in and save the day is windows 8 the
revolutionary product at the end of the
tunnel let us know in comments um don't
get me wrong I actually like Windows 8 I
just don't think that it's any kind of a
huge step
forward so so John we have some apps
that got updated and uh you know without
born us into the ground look let's talk
about some of these apps io 13 since
anybody that may be going in the
upcoming week you'll probably be
interested in getting this when you can
scan attendee badges via NFC you can
schedule changes immediately you know
they're immediately synchronized between
all of your devices you have a lock
screen widget for viewing your agenda on
the go you have Victor mate vector-based
maps you have dedicated hdmi output for
live streaming automatic Wi-Fi setup for
attendees that will probably be very
nice there's an off-site attendee mode
for live stream only viewers you can use
Google+ for login it has support for
viewing office hour sessions and you
have improved support for devices with
rtl locales so if you go on Io make sure
you update your application it's got a
lot of goodies in there so you can make
the most out of the conference um
Spotify got a pretty significant update
with the biggest one being that you can
filter and sort out your playlists and
tracks better alphabetically you know a
to z war z da it also remembers what you
were listening to the last time you
logged out um another one is viber which
is a common histon messaging application
and it got a very major very
good-looking hollow redesign so if
you're you know if part of the community
that uses viber for doing messaging over
data that one's definitely worth looking
into all right you know I haven't uh
haven't tried viber yet i I've heard a
little bit about it but I don't ly know
a lot about I want to try one of these
days
I just I can't get excited for messaging
solutions that require you to have to
spam your friends and ask them to join
well yeah that that's why I never gonna
know what's app you know cuz ya it's
only as cool as the six people that you
know that use it so if I'm not gonna go
out there and beg everybody I know to
use another app so that yeah that's why
I'm looking forward to to babble so day
in carriers they do all sorts of cool
stuff right yes so 18 he's been doing a
lot lately they launched LTE in some 16
more markets so pretty big expansion on
their ltd footprint trying of course to
catch up to verizon additionally
everybody's been a little surprised by
t-mobile's all uncarrier no contract
approach and so AT&amp;amp;T is responding with
their own no contract subsidiary i guess
called a 0 or aio wireless except it's
no LTE it's going to be capped at for
megan's per second on their relatively
paltry hspa+ network uh and you can get
for the low low price of four dollars a
month i'm going to talk text and 250
megabytes of data megabytes of data
megabytes so that's not huh so for $55
you can step that up to 2 gigabytes and
then seventy dollars gets you seven
gigabytes so that's their answer to
t-mobile's much more affordable contract
no contracts because there you'll get
seventy dollars i think is there totally
unlimited everything with you know
actual 4G speeds if this included LTE
those wouldn't really be bad prices no
it wouldn't be bad prices given a little
team right and also i don't get lost I'm
if their hspa+ was as good as t-mobile's
I mean the other thing is LT cost them a
lot less money to operate the network so
it doesn't make sense what I would put
it on net worth it cuz they can keep
crying but despite
from crunch and charge people are so
white hot here's your plan for the three
people that will buy into this then yeah
so uh John what update says come out I
know you have a galaxy note right and
your device get updated or was it
another new ironically uh on the fifth
verizon pushed a four-point 1.2 update
to the galaxy note 2 but in canada the
galaxy note the one that's a year older
just got four point one point two so
about what verizon's on pace with this
year old devices I Canada so if you have
the original Galaxy Note you're going to
get jelly bean 4.1 point to which
includes a lot of improvements to
Samsung's own applications like you get
the pop-up video browser a lot of their
premium suite and you know even more
important than that you give the
jellybean features like Google now on
expendable notifications in them it's a
lot more buttery than what you have so
generously now be worth grabbing does
that nation ladder is it specific
carriers that is a good question it just
looks only have Canada I've listed here
so i would guess it probably um i would
guess the majority of canadian carriers
are probably starting to get how imagine
the note was probably like it was here
where it was limited on what carriers it
was carried on to being with anyway not
too familiar with kenneth oh sorry I
guess we're gonna have to get a Canadian
correspondent that what we'll do is
we'll talk to the guys over at Android
Coliseum and will those guys are ya
pretty awesome and we'll start bringing
them in here we have Canada carrier
updates and they can cover that segment
for us also a hockey news section for
them and I am in canada news uh here's
Ryan Moore with the hockey update
so what other device gives as a bad job
we've got a rumor because he has an
announcement tag for May thirtieth and
its imagination begins with a capital G
on the banner so second edition of the
optimus G may be coming up it'd be
interesting to see what they have to
announce because the optimus g pro is a
very competent device now so it'll be
interesting to see what their and the
g2's had some pretty monster spec rumors
with a Snapdragon 800 and a 1080p screen
and a 13 megapixel camera and all the
other bells and whistles that you can
imagine oh jeez really jumped on getting
the hardware out quicker than a lot of
other yeah that helps a lot in this
market mmm on the root for routing
arrahman a paranoid android chat heads
multi-window support this is a their
edition of it called halo if you haven't
seen the YouTube videos on that
definitely look around find it because
it's really cool how they do it this is
what they consider to be how you do
multi window on Android it's available
for every single application as a
notification replacement and it's very
similar to facebook's chat ads where you
can move it around anywhere on the
screen you can be in the middle of a
game if you check a notification it
pauses the foreground applications you
can handle it and it uses their I bird
engine to only take up a fraction of the
screen kind of as an overlay you do what
you got to do and you go right back to
the foreground app and start it right
back up um the developments really
coming you know pretty fast they're
pushing how fuzz out um they haven't
really put the source code out for
everybody that ports from my nexus but
if you have a Nexus device you can try
this out and it's really coming along
very quickly and it's the best
multitasking solution on Android and
I've seen so far it's a lot better than
things like Samsung's multi window
because it's it's static you know it
it's not
you're not send your controlling
different parts of the screen this is in
one place it's consistent and its really
really convenient it's nice to see that
the innovation that's coming out of the
custom rom community in some of the ways
that they're pushing the Android stack
to do so much more than then you know
what it does out of the box whoever does
paranoid Android's like the names for
what they come up with really needs a
job with an oem because halo just made
sense and it's just really cool you know
if that was on a sheet advertising in a
carrier that would just seem like a
really cool feature yeah no that's true
so in in other routing news cyanogenmod
10.1 has rolled out RC 12 some 40
devices and RC 2 is now starting to roll
out as well or I guess soon we'll be
rolling out this is this is really very
very ridiculous they're basically
pushing a release candidate release so
that way they can have one out before
Android 4.3 or five point 0 or whatever
new version it is comes out on Wednesday
Wednesday they've been working on 10.1
for six months now and are finally
getting a release candidate I get it
they support some 40 devices and that's
ridiculous I don't think anybody else
supports that many devices right like
I'm not trying to knock how hard that is
I worked on cyanogenmod projects in the
past I totally understand what it takes
to get all these devices merged in and
working together in one code base it's a
pain but that's also made worse by all
the extra stuff that cyanogenmod does
now that used to be a lot more
streamlined and simple and it was a lot
more about getting more and more devices
support basic almost straight up AOSP
support with some very light
modifications on top they've gone very
much the same with a lot of the OEMs
have where it's such a heavy level of
customization that it takes so long
updated for all of these to my sins
and so as they keep trying to support
more more it's just going to slow things
down more I mean seriously pushing out
an RC just in time for the next version
of android to come out like what you
didn't know there was going to be
another version of android google has
said for quite some time one release
every six months two per year right like
this isn't news then kept people in the
dark about it they've been saying it for
years well cm9 and CM 10.1 also hit hit
their final release stage a few days
before the same day that is becoming a
habit I forget what it was but the day
it must have been when 4.1 came out so
so it have been cm9 finally hits table
the day of io last year because nobody
believed the new version of android was
coming out and then the day that it came
out cm9 became stable I remember but now
it was stable for a while I would get me
wrong it you know there might even a bug
or two but and they wanted to clean up
as many bugs as possible before saying
it was stable and I'm sure that's the
same way that it is now you know its
board it's stable enough there's a bug
or two that isn't a showstopper that
they were just trying to tweak here and
there yeah but you know what china
jamaat used to be the cutting edge of
the custom rom community and when
they're struggling to put out a release
candidate not even a you know 10.1
release but over RC two days before I oh
yeah their thing that is not a batch you
remember OMG be you know ha yeah you
know what was rumored we go MX I think
there's a market for a rom like that now
that's just straight up from source
google you know yeah compatibility
modifications only you know and you know
i think that i think this is why
paranoid android remember we had them on
the show of things like they switch to
their own Fork because waiters engine
mod becomes such a pain now yet they
didn't want to deal with you know
they're you know bugs and they didn't
want to wait for night leads to become
stable and early
candidates and you know monthly bill
didn't want to do that they wanted to do
their own thing so now they're based off
a OSP and and they're tearing up
haha I mean they're doing a look I
they're doing the most innovative things
out of any custom rom right now no I
have degree and I mean I don't want to
sound like I'm dissing the cyanogenmod
desk because they do a lot of really
hard work and I'm friends with a lot of
those developers and I'm not saying that
they aren't working our asses off they
are but I think that if they had some
better project management and some
better organization in terms of the way
they they control the process broke out
some of the customization abstracted
that away in terms of development not
just in terms of you know abstracted
encode but the actual management and
lifecycle of an abstract away from the
rest of the Brawn development they could
move things along a lot smoother and a
lot faster right you don't need to have
your entire rom at a release candidate
stage because this one happens and done
everywhere that sounds like the roms
fine it's just this one half that's not
yet ready to RC so don't release them at
the same time right you don't need to
either way cm does amazing work they do
they absolutely no it would be nice to
have things hits table faster but
there's always things such as running
unofficial unstable builds on your phone
such as the HTC droid DNA which today
finally got a working camera so I
actually flashed it on my phone for the
first time um it's we've had a
bastardized rom and i'll call text
that's what it was for a long long time
but you know there was no sound or the
salmon work and then you could you could
make a phone call but phone calls sound
didn't work you know and slowly it's
been getting more and more and more
stable and finally today Chad you
remember Chad from the HTC incredible
days dan yeah well he got he got the DNA
uh I'm gonna say two months ago and he
basically said I'm not messing around
we're getting you guys a stable rom and
he just was busting his ass and he got
camera working today and you know what I
can take pictures front facing rear
I took like 100 literally a hundred
photos earlier just trying to break it I
did get a camera force close i rebooted
it was fine but you know I don't let me
take a hundred pictures in a day so I'm
happy and it's AOSP you know you know
it's AOSP for my DNA I like this phone
now I I have hated this phone for the
past couple months but I actually like
it now and it wears the rolls around no
Thursday rolls around and you know
something happens and we on you know a
new Nexus or the motorola x phone rumors
become confirmed and and then I'm like
no I need this phone but but but this I
can okay let me say this now that the
DNA has CM 10.1 this can safely last me
until I get the next phone because I was
getting scared I know what I was going
to do you know I I can't you know I I
didn't know what I was going to do I
couldn't go to a samsung touchwiz phone
you know I need a OSP or our phone that
has supports you know AOSP based rom so
now I'm happy with this film I love this
phone it can make it I can make it last
I may I don't love it but I can make it
last until the X phone or some who knows
whatever comes out even if I'm still
hopeful that the X phone comes down and
Verizon anyways enough rambling about me
um II and uh anything patent worthy this
week to yell about yes so the the FTC in
the dr j been taking comments on patent
trolls basically they call them
non-practicing entities or npe he's a
nice happy acronym but that's a term
that newegg for one doesn't really think
applies in fact they were hood in a
brief and said no these are patent
trolls and it went pretty into detail
about why they are trolls and the
definition of the word troll and how
what these companies do is exactly that
and then proceeded to call them trolls
throughout the rest of the brief
in mean it was a pretty well written
brief beyond just the troll part like
they they raised some very good points
and really we're expressing why patent
trolls are not just making it hard for
the likes of samsung and google and HTC
and motorola but for newegg because some
control has some obscure patent on some
piece of some web technology and then
runs around suing people like Newegg for
having it on their website as though all
of new eggs profits is because of some
button somewhere on one page of their
website and so they have to defend
themselves or else settle because it's
cheaper than trying to defend themselves
this isn't the way the company should
have to do business and I for one agree
with newegg so hopefully the FTC in the
DOJ you know start listening to all of
these companies that are writing these
briefs and do something about the
problem meanwhile in the apples a
samsung case google along with redhead
HTC SI p and rackspace are trying to
file an amicus carry brief in the case
Apple unsurprisingly has opposed it
complaining that Google as an interested
party which on the one hand is kind of
true but on the other hand Apple has
been very careful up to now to exclude
Google from its legal underhandedness so
it's interesting now to see them jumping
out and saying no no no wait Google is
an interested party here there and
essentially in their filing they quite
Google to a co-defendant so it's a
little interesting to see Apple take
that position the other problem there
though is even if you take Google off
that list HTC is the only other company
that has a hand in the mobile software
business at all rackspace SI p and
redhat aren't making mobile phones or
mobile operating systems so the the
brief is still going to come in even if
google's name doesn't end up on it so
Apple is kind of wasting their time on
opposing it but they like to do that a
lot really other than that there hasn't
been a lot of this in the last week or
so well well that's good you know the
less patent wars the better yes it's
almost like a segment we have to report
on but we don't want to you know I wish
author to be no new
yeah exactly well yeah we want the last
news to say okay and this this uh you
know State Department the Justice
Department rolling is going to alleviate
all patent trolls and fix everything no
I want to see the appeals courts hand on
rulings and sake stop acting like
petulant children and go see her binding
arbitration deal with it
negotiate the contract and swing it okay
so i think i think that wraps it wraps
up for the week so remember a few days
from now google i/o all sorts of candy
is coming your way if you want to check
out the sessions and you're not sure you
know when a session is a hearing you're
interested in you can download the
google i/o 30 nap and then you can go
ahead and browse all the sessions and go
in adam to your schedule so even if your
not going like me like Dan and John we
can go and create our schedule of what
sessions we want to watch and build our
own schedule so I would say if you're
big android fan big Google fan you just
want to know what the hell is going on
feel free to do that and then we will be
back next Thursday on time to recap
everything and hopefully sing from the
heavens about the awesomeness that
happened the previous three days so feel
free to check us out on soundcloud.com /
android authority youtube.com / android
authority as well it's facebook.com /
android authority that calms a central
authority we're also on youtube already
said YouTube denied yes these Scott
normally does this I'm messing it up i
will say google corrects i would say hey
Scott Cato Nora yeah hey I sit ups
assistant that I set up stitcher radio I
know we're on there um yeah so such
radio we're on there were on miro we're
on we're pretty much everywhere cuz you
