Android Authority comm and today we'll
be taking a look at gun slugs it's a new
side scroller available in the Google
Play Store for a dollar forty nine gun
slugs begins with a very simple menu
system under options you can view a
variety of things like objectives
controls music and effects and even
activate two-player mode if you have a
Bluetooth controller in each settings
menu you can tinker with settings like
music in the sound effects and you can
even move the controller buttons around
to a spot that's more optimal for you
once that's done all that's left to do
is select your character and hit play
there are two characters to start off
with but you get more unlocked as you
progress through the game the premise of
this game is you are battling the
Blackduck army and preventing them from
taking over the world
fans of 90's 2d side-scrolling shooters
will no doubt recognize the familiar if
cheesy storytelling the game developers
tell that this game is nonstop action
from start to finish and they weren't
lying
you'll be accosted by bad guys from the
second you land to the second you finish
the level you'll be facing mostly ground
troops but there are helicopters to fly
by every now and then mechs that you can
destroy and then take over bosses and an
assortment of other bad guys to keep you
on your toes in most levels there are
various towers you must destroy in order
to complete the level and there are
plenty of other buildings where you can
play minigames or just take a break from
the action if you need to with the
constant action the plethora of enemies
the fun minigames and the nostalgic feel
of gun slugs we gave gameplay a value of
4 out of 5 the graphics make you feel
that you just opened a brand new game
for the Sega Genesis everything about
this game shouts old-school if you are
into these kind of games back then the
graphics will make you feel right at
home since all the bullets are the same
color things are flying around
constantly and the graphics are what
they are it's very possible to get
disoriented while playing gun slug
however we feel this was intentional to
add to the difficulty of the game and
keep things interesting
its no gun star heroes but it's no Zork
either when everything was added up we
gave graphics a value of 3 out of 5
stars
gun slug gets friendly for players who
are strapped for time while levels get
harder as you progress most will take
more than a few minutes to complete that
makes it easier to deal with playing
levels over and over again when you
eventually lose in later levels this
probably happens pretty frequently the
game's hallmark feature for replay value
is that the levels are randomly
generated so no two playthroughs will be
the same this means that you can play
through the game entirely multiple times
without playing the same levels over and
over
again this unique feature helps keep the
game fresh for people who may have
gotten through it once already
like most 2d side-scrolling shooters gun
slugs keeps up the pace and it's random
level generation keeps it fresh so we
gave replay value of 4 out of 5 stars
overall gun slugs is fun and it's hard
the constant action keeps players
engaged while the sound effects music
and graphics bring the nostalgia for
those who enjoyed these kind of games
back in the day
thanks to random level generation the
decent selection of weapons unlockable
characters and the variety of foes the
game takes its sweet time getting old
and boring with Bluetooth controller
compatibility having that second player
option just increases the fun obviously
if you don't like 2d shooter Stan this
probably won't be for you if you enjoy
the constant action of the games of old
then you'll get more out of this game
than the dollar 49 they're charging for
it it's an action-packed rampage filled
with mayhem and awesomeness but it won't
be for everyone so we gave it an overall
value of 4 out of 5 stars
