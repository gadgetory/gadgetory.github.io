experience we're just talking to people
from a bun team they kind of come out of
left field a little bit with their
operating system it appears to be
function on a Galaxy Nexus think I don't
really know as much as they do I'm going
too fast or evil Weaver's here who's
going to explain the UI and I'll press
the closer glimpse of what to expect
ready
data team
okay so over here you basically see a
bunch of running on on the on the phone
so basically we it's the same abundance
on the desktop or on on TV and now it
has a new interface optimized for the
phone as well so what you see over here
basically is the welcome screen and what
you see here is a AP state officials
ation of your personal data showing it
in a very nice way giving a very
personal touch to your phone a little
important thing that you see is that
there are no button sort of no-heart key
battles no soft key buttons the whole
experience basically designed around the
edges today I just allow you to interact
really fast and natural with different
parts of the phone so for example from
the left side I have to launch it
basically and I can I see my dancer that
used frequently we noticed that many
people don't use older apps all the time
and we saw that basically they use Maxim
attendance all the time and I basically
can launch them immediately from the
left side so for example I can go to the
AUSA Tom screen from there and over here
at different home screens right so I the
segregated a few by people of the my
music also music store basically where i
can buy music
the people lens home the home tree in my
running apps with our Father apps well
and also my videos I wish I can access
immediately from there so for example I
go to the gallery app for example was at
the gallery app is native app we both
have web apps and and native app so
Pedro group I could be a web service but
like for applications that require
better performance based we also have
native apps so the galleria absolutely
natively designs let's see what happens
now is when you actually start scrolling
you see that all the controls go away
right so when i scroll back i have the
header i can go to the photos i can go
to events again open a picture from here
and hope what we basically also wants to
do is not obscure the interface with
controls all the time so when you see
for example have a picture you can swipe
from the bottom and i have to control
basically to edit the picture or share a
picture viously might go back over here
obviously
I'm back in my app I the other thing is
that what we saw is that when people
want to change setting and they using
app with many phones the user needs to
go back to the home screen for example
going to set explain the settings and we
wanted to give you usually much faster
way of good diving into settings so
basically we use the top match for that
so you basically go immediately to data
time battery network for example men and
we also had a messages here so for
example of messages i have some direct
functionality with it visco i can i
reply me these deaths and if i'm done
with it i can go back to my app or for
example when i go to the battery the
settings i can go to brightness j said
pull it up a bit i'm back in my app and
then right especially is for switching
really fast between apps so we all sort
of we've used a research that i use a
switch lot between apps so for example
when i go to at a camera double example
want to make a picture and go back to my
to the gallery app i use the right right
that's right from that and i go back to
the home screen and i'm back there
if you happen to switch all the way from
the right it just brings back the
balance oh yeah plank aerosol best way
between the acid ironic mr. in terms of
the hardware that this can function on
this is a they got original Galaxy Nexus
a dual-core bhatia yessir is this still
capable of functioning on even slower
hardware even older hardware well it's
harder now jewel because we expected
when which is coming out next year the
jewel for will be more than made with
the low end where flower will run 49
ethically we also have the superphone
where the kyboot sue will become a
converse device with a lot of talk with
this for a long time well we lost last
year we total partners now and what we
will expect is that when we launched the
boot the phone will also have a possible
conversion I especially where you dock
it and you can eventually run a butcher
from yes that's very attractive in terms
of the language is there going to be any
backwards compatibility with android
apps or they have themselves what
language was in decoded so we are
talking cutie 50 there will be for the
aspects the main language for the bombs
yeah and in terms of when we're going to
start to see commercial products with
the virtue out of the box
release you're looking at here so we are
hoping by the end of this year end of
this year yeah can you maybe shed some
light on some of the partners here
speaking when we are talking about
partners but can't reveal that I cannot
talk about oh yeah so but the fact that
you're targeting or two slower hardware
maybe there's no everyone knows mobile
is really going very quickly in
developing markets over in Asia and
India and China so i right obviously
maybe we can actually look at a ninety
nine dollar smartphone with good
performance in the near future well I
mean a hundred-dollar bill of materials
yeah definitely we can target side and
then very nice thank you for thank you
very much free time you know you're
welcome we don't want to stick down
Android or anything but as competition
in the marketplace always a good thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
