do you want to know about the snapdragon
845 well let me explain so call comic
just had their technical summit in
Hawaii and we've just been getting all
the great new details about the next
year's flagship system on a chip that's
the Snapdragon 800 and 45% during eight
four five so what is it well first of
all it is a 64-bit system on a chip
that's going to be found in Android
phones and also probably in Windows
laptops and we'll talk a lot more about
that in a moment
now inside of it there are lots and lots
of different components that's what a
system on a chip means it's not just a
CPU in there you've also got a GPU
you've got an image processor for the
camera you've got a DSP for doing signal
processing and also for doing some heavy
computation like neural network stuff
you've got security you've got all the
connectivity modem and of course Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth and that's all built into
just one chip so looking at some of the
components individually it's start with
the CPU know the CPU in the snapdragon
845 is the cryo 385 now it's built on
cortex technology that means that
Qualcomm have taken a core design or two
core designs from arm and then they have
tweaked them a little bit maybe some of
the internals may be in how it fits into
the rest of the chip that lay out
physically on the on the silicon and
then they've allowed to brand that as
their own chip design which in this case
of the cryo 3 8 5 now it's probably that
it is the cortex a 75 and the cortex a
55 now if you remember the court is a 75
and a 55 are the two new core designs
from arm that used dynamic and the great
thing about dynamic is that these cores
are now together in the same cluster
which means they can share a lot of the
same buses and all of the same input and
outputs to the rest of the chip without
having to be separate and then kind of
working independently now here we've got
four
high-performance cores caught it's a 75
cores running at 2.8 gigahertz and we've
got for power efficiency causes the cord
it's a 55 running at 1.8 gigahertz so
each of the cores have l1 cache
and l2 cache the l2 on the bigger cause
is slightly larger 256 K per core and is
128 K per core for the a 55 power
efficiency cause but beneath that there
is an L 3 cache of 2 megabytes
now that l3 cache of 2 megabytes works
across just the cause it doesn't work
across the GPU and the DSP as well so
what Qualcomm has added in another layer
of caching which they're calling system
cache which is a further 3 megabytes and
that means that when the CPU and the GPU
want to talk to each other that data can
be cached on chip without having to go
out to main memory looking at the main
memory is slow because these are all
relative terms so we made up all that
caching 3 megabytes across the system
core and then 2 megabytes across the l3
cache and then l2 cache with one
megabyte for the high performance cause
half a megabyte for the power efficiency
cause that's six and a half megabytes of
cache excluding the l1 caches now that's
a significant amount of cache and that's
going to be part of the reason why
they've managed to bump up the
performance here by 30% of course also
the a 75 and a 55 are much more much
more faster performant than the previous
generation anyway but a 30% increase in
distilling it's not as much cash as you
find in the 11 Bionic however we're
getting close to that kind of level now
if you think about a 30% performance
increase that's absolutely amazing if I
said to you that you could buy a new car
or a new television or a new microwave
that in its measure of performance it
was 30% better than the last model that
that's pretty impressive now talking
about memory for a moment this system on
a chip uses LP low power ddr4 it runs at
1.8 gigahertz and you can have a maximum
of 8 get gigabytes in a snapdragon 845
phones we're not going to see any 16
gigabyte phones next year and looking at
the GPU that comes in the Snapdragon 845
it's the Adreno 630 Qualcomm asset and
the next generation they've done a lot
of work from the ground up to build this
new GPU it's 30% greater performance
while using 30
less power which is quite amazing and
also it has a 2.5 times a display
throughput so significant gains in both
the CPU and the GPU performance so the
DSP in the subject in eight four five is
the latest generation hexagon DSP it
does more than just digital signal
processing and also do lots of vector
calculations it's a third generation of
vector engine inside this DSP and
Qualcomm are positioning this for all of
their neural network processing so it
doesn't have a dedicated NPU or neural
engine they're saying you can do this on
their DSP and so that's in the DSP
support all the common neural networking
frameworks including tensorflow light
and also now support halide that
programming language that's being used
for image processing which you'll find
also in google's pixel to smartphone and
the update this will enable that of
course was in android oreo 8.1 and then
also you've got the spectra 280 ISP
which is the image signal processor
which of course is used when data comes
from the camera how you protis all that
information and turn it into movie files
and JPEG files that we all like to use
now the spec the new spectra is pay can
record 4k at 60 frames a second that's a
lot of bandwidth they put in there it
supports a 10-bit color gamut for video
recording so you can actually record in
this new HDR mode which will give you
ten bits of color and also it can do 480
frames per second slo-mo but only in
720p now the the new DSP in the ISP
actually present a problem for Samsung
funnily enough because now that there's
so much extra stuff going on on the
Qualcomm s SOC not just a CPU and a GPU
boot got these extras that are doing a
lot of multimedia work a lot of
processing work a lot of neural network
stuff what happened when Samsung want to
release their next phone and some of
them are using Samsung's Exynos chips
and some of them are using Qualcomm's
where are they going to draw the line
for the lowest common denominator that's
going to be a real pro bar coding
problem we'll see what Samsung released
next year and
see whether they've kind of chipped down
taken down the Qualcomm processor a peg
or two so you can't do this fantastic
slow mode or you can't do 10-bit color
recording if their new occipital
supported we don't know yet
so we instance to see what they come out
with the new external chip - because
these two have to work side by side in
two versions of the s9 or the note 9 or
whatever samsung release also built onto
the chip is called comms acoustic chip
and that's acoustic a cue stick acoustic
and that supports apdex aptX which of
course is the bluetooth codec from kokum
which delivers greater audio quality
than the standard Bluetooth codec and
talking about you've also got bluetooth
true Wireless which is a proprietary
standard from Qualcomm that allowed two
Bluetooth streams to come independently
to maybe a left ear bug on a right
earbud and they both come independently
from the phone rather than one being the
master and it kind of copying the
information over to the other one and
what we're talking about Bluetooth is
also full support for Bluetooth five
built into the Snapdragon 805 three more
things worth mentioning one is that it's
also got the new X 20 LTE category 18
modem which means it has a potential
download speeds of 1.2 gigabits per
second a lot of people get very excited
about the LTE modems I don't quite get
so excited because it really does depend
on what your carrier provides and while
these manufacturers are able every year
to bring out a new phone and bring out a
new modem it's a bigger difference to
change a whole country or a whole state
to have the latest LTE network on it so
we're always kind of a few generations
behind what the actual phones can manage
however for the future that's a really
good sign the sse also supports quick
charge for which is qualcomm ladies
quick charging technology and it's
backwardly compatible with USB power
delivery and if you want to know what
mirrors be power delivery is then please
do check out my video on this channel
where I go into great detail about what
it actually can do for us as consumers
and the last component worth mentioning
is the new security processing unit
that's basically a way of kind of
keeping things like fingerprint data and
passwords and all
education process is very separate from
the cpu so even if some kind of malware
managed to get on to the low levels of
your CPU here's now another barrier that
protects this biometric information and
protects your digital information it
actually has its own CPU probably a
cortex m3 it runs its own little
operating system and the CPU will talk
to it and say hey let's do some
authentication here and it's a separate
entity so overall I'm pretty impressed
with what the Sundering 845 is offering
in terms of the specifications got the
latest CPU or using dynamic from arm
you've got the latest GPU from quark on
themselves and on top of that you've got
the DSP and the ISP and the acoustic
chip audio processor and then you've got
the security processor you've got access
to eight gigabytes of lpddr4 Ram it
looks really really impressive cause we
won't know how impressive it truly is
until we see phones launched next year
but talking of phones being launched
Qualcomm did make it very clear that
this chip is optimized for Android and
for Windows running on arm so with this
year we've just seen the launch of the
laptops running Windows on the
snapdragon 835 and next year absolutely
we're gonna see laptops running windows
on the snapdragon 845 so - go central
