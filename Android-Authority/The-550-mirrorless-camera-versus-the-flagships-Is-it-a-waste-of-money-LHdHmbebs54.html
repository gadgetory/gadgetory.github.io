is the Panasonic GS 850 it's a compact
mirrorless camera cost $550 it comes to
body and kit lens which is a twelve to
thirty two millimeter one and I've been
using it for the last few weeks now
taking photos videos I used it on a shot
recently on location for a VR video and
it got me really thinking about why
would anyone spend five hundred fifty
dollars for a dedicated digital camera
when you have all these smartphones
nowadays that could take stellar photos
and videos so far this year we've had
some stellar Android smartphones
released you have things like the LG G 6
the huawei p10 the Samsung Galaxy s8 and
all three are known for the cameras and
the performances so in this video I'm
going to compare those three devices
against the panasonic GX 850 and you
guys can make the determination as to
whether or not 550 dollars is worth
putting into a dedicated camera by
itself or maybe just go with one the
smart phones that I mentioned the other
main reason why chose bgx 850 is because
of its price point $550 it's pretty
inexpensive when you consider mirrorless
cameras on top of that it is super tiny
and compact when it comes to testing I'm
not going to do a whole lot of
controlled tests instead I'm just going
to set them all to the automatic modes
and snap photos and videos now for the
Panasonic GX p50 I'm going to use the
kit lens that comes with it so that's
the 12 to 32 millimeter one that's an F
3.5 to 5.6 aperture the first shots I'm
going to show you here are some outdoor
scenes with excellent lighting now this
first one here with a path leaving some
trees in the background I got to say the
GS a 15 the SI managed to do the best
because they handle the exposure details
dynamic range and color accuracy very
well logistics has some great looking
details but the clouds look a little bit
overblown and as far as the p10 is
concerned it just seems to appear a
little bit lower in contrast so it looks
flatter the results are the same with
this next
shot the Jets a 15-8 managed to do the
best for the scene the district's isn't
too far behind but you just have that
weird exposure again with the clouds and
with the p10 it still has the lower
contrast look with some software details
for these next few shots I'm going to be
strictly focusing on details performance
so with this first one here of Megaman
they all look fantastic but when we look
closer we do notice that the g6 tends to
look over sharpened and the p10 just
seems softer and overall gotta give it
to the GFC 50 for this one because you
can see more details in the shot for
example the fine dust specks that have
collected on this helmet
the results are no different with this
shot of the bricks here the s8 just
seems a little bit overexposed overall
but when it comes to details the g6
again looks extremely over sharp and
it's not terrible but still more sharper
than GX 850 MBSA and a p10 appear softer
yet again and finally for these last two
images of bb-8 and the statue the
results are no different again get the
strongest details capture out of the g6
GX a 50 and the s8 but the pretend
contains to look slightly softer in tone
than the rest when it comes to taking
selfies there's a clear winner here and
that's the GX 850 because it features a
tilt table 180 degree screen and it's
also leveraging the same Micro Four
Thirds sensor to snap the photos so
details are extremely rich with this one
it puts a shame the other cameras the
p10 and si do nice and taking selfies
but the detailed capture can't compare
to the GX 850 you can see it
specifically in the eyebrows they're
clearly defined whereas with the g6 they
appear smudged for these next few shots
I'm going to talk about their low-light
performances and I got to stress again
that I'm going to be using the automatic
modes for each one to disperse one of
the books on the shelf
both GS 850 and si really stand out for
the strong characteristics the g6 has a
noticeable level of noise throughout the
shot and the p10 is color reproduction
appears just washed out in tone moving
on to the shot of the Easter eggs it's
kind of weird because the GX 850 has a
warmer color tone than the rest but if
we look deeper into the shots the g6 and
the GF say 50 you really stand out for
their details especially in the carrot
you could see those individual strands
string they're clearly more defined more
so than the s8 and the p10 blast shot
yeah is kind of interesting with the
lawn in the pathways crossing through it
there's a strong light source in the
scene so everything looks yellowish in
tone but yes there's something weird it
seems to be increasing the exposure
because you can kind of see the outline
of the tree way in the background that's
pitch black for all the rest but this
comes at the expense for more noise in
the shot now it doesn't really impact
its details capture which is second only
to the GX 850 these next we shot should
be interesting because I'm using the
manual modes under low-light
unfortunately you can adjust the
aperture on the smartphones but I tried
to make it as uniform as possible so I
set all four to ISO 100 and the shutter
speed of ten seconds obviously there is
also going to be different because the
GS 850 has an aperture at 3.5 at its
widest while the g6 p10 and s8 all have
apertures of F 1.8 F 2 point 2 and F 1.7
but it's British out of Mega Man the SI
is able to accumulate the most light
which in the process produces a high
exposure now the GS 850 has the best
balance out of the bunch due to its
exposure details and the white balance I
mean while the g6 is the softest and has
a greenish tone and the p10 does just a
little bit better going back to the shot
of the easter-egg this time I shot them
in almost complete darkness there's only
a little bit light reflecting from the
jacinth hallway so it's really
interesting what the result is so using
automatic mode all three phones manage
to expose more the details while the GX
850 just look dark however there's a
dramatic shift when you use their long
exposures and the GX 850 takes the crown
because of its exceptional details
capture you can actually visualize the
sparkles on those Easter eggs but
they're nearly indistinguishable on the
smartphones the next area I want to go
into is 4k video recording now I said
all four devices to automatic mode 4k
capture at a resolution of 3840 by 2160
pixels and they're all shooting at the
same 30 frames per second this person of
the statue in the garden is particularly
interesting because all four devices
deliver sharp looking footage
what you can expect when the lighting
conditions are ideal the only one stand
out from the rest is the p10 which tends
to favor higher exposure but besides
that it's really tough to notice any
significant differences between them
but next out of these cars in this
parking lot details performance out of
all four our great can't complain about
them but the s8 and the p10 seems to
handle dynamic range a lot better than
the rest
the GX eight fifties footage seems a
little bit overexposed and the g6
continues to have that overblown look
with the clouds it's under low light
shooting the easter eggs again we do
notice a great deal of noise in this
footage from the three smartphone so it
appears very grainy it becomes more
noticeable when you crop into the videos
but we still like it more than GX 850
because it's footage is by far the
darkest you can barely notice any
details in the shots and out of the
bunch
it looks like the s8 seems to be the
brightest after taking all these photos
and videos it makes you wonder why would
someone choose to pay five hundred fifty
dollars to buy a compact mirrorless
camera and that's a very interesting
question because if we're to look back
at the test that we did here we did
notice that the GX 850 performed very
favorably in a bunch of them and most
situations it was the best out of the
bunch but we wouldn't say that the gap
was significantly more than these
smartphones and it goes to show that
today's smartphones are more than
capable of snapping some really good
footage if the conditions are ideal so
as we've seen in the testing there's not
a huge difference in terms of quality
between the GX a 50 and these
smartphones if you're just going to be
using automatic mode of course that
changes a little bit under a manual but
if you're willing to invest more money
into the Micro Four Thirds system get
different lenses that's where you can
see a substantial change in performance
and quality so what I'm trying to say
here is $550 might sound risky when you
look at how these smartphones rivals the
GX 8 fifties quality when you use the
automatic settings but if you're able to
invest into the system and maybe pick up
a couple lenses you'll be convinced and
really begin to see the difference in
performance out of these smartphones and
this mirrorless camera so what do you
guys think I've been using the GX 850
for several weeks now
really love it for its compact size and
its overall performance it's a great
backup camera as well but then again
these smartphones nowadays can also be
more than capable just as long as the
lighting conditions are ideal so if you
