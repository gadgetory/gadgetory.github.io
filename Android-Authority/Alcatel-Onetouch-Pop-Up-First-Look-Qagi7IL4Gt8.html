Authority and we're taking a look at an
entry-level device here from Alcatel
OneTouch this is the pop-up and just to
go over some of the design elements of
this device really quickly it's made
entirely of plastic but it actually
feels really nice it's actually got a
very solid build to it is also really
easy to use in one hand which is kind of
what I really like about it you can't
really say that about too many
smartphones these days so the one hand
usability is really good on this device
and one of the cool things is it comes
in a bunch of different colors for the
backing so you should be able to find a
color that's going to suit your taste
and just go over some of the internal
specs you're looking at a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 610 with 2 gigabytes of RAM
and there's 16 gigabytes of internal
storage and there's also micro SD card
expansion as well so you can get access
to that by taking off the back cover and
it's also a dual SIM device so you can
take advantage of two SIM cards on this
phone which is pretty cool so you can
take this for you know your own personal
carrier and also a carrier for travel
and things of that nature so as far as
the operating system goes you're looking
at android 5.1.1 and it is a mostly
stock version of lollipop so you're not
going to find too much going on here as
far as customization
Alcatel has done a really great job of
keeping the experience pretty close to
stock you'll see some slight differences
with the icons but other than that it's
pretty much a stock lollipop experience
which is really great so that's going to
really help out as far as the
performance goes with the camera you're
looking at a 13 megapixel camera on the
rear and a 5 megapixel camera on the
front for all your selfies and video
chats the screen is a 5 inch 720p screen
it's a LCD display IPS LCD and it looks
pretty good it's very bright very
colorful it's a really nice looking
screen especially for this screen size
but that's really it for the pop up it's
going to be available in q4 in Europe
for a price of one
seventy-nine and us price will keep you
posted on that so that's pretty much it
for this devices stay tuned for the rest
