the motox actually kind of missed the
mark by not having super high-end
specifications well now that the Moto X
is officially out we can compare it to
those top-tier devices hey it's Josh
regard from Android 30 what's going on
everybody
and this is the Moto X versus the
Samsung Galaxy s4 as should be obvious
from the get-go the Moto X is trump card
in design is the Moto maker not only are
you able to customize the color of your
phone further cosmetic changes will come
in the future Samsung Galaxy s4 on the
other hand comes in only a handful of
colors the Galaxy s4's main advantage
comes from its 5-inch screen here and
the fact that it is one of the easiest
larger screens to handle the general
aesthetic remains pretty classic Samsung
with the glossy plastic that can be
slippery to the touch it's a material
choice plant if people are admittedly
getting tired of but it is pretty tried
and true for Samsung a tactile home
button is upfront with the typical
button layout on the sides of power
opposite volume rocker the very thin
back cover is removable allowing access
to the battery and SD card slot for
expandable memory it might be a little
bit harder to manipulate it than the
Moto X but the ham gymnastics on the s4
are kept to the minimum I will say this
about the Moto X I really missed being
able to reach the top opposite corner
with one hand the X does come with a
smaller 4.7 inch screen that affords it
as smaller all-around form-factor
motorola's design choice of having a
very curved back did pay off as the
ergonomics of this device were very high
the are no tactile buttons upfront and
the button layout is all on the right
side and instead of a glossy plastic the
X employs a soft touch plastic that
isn't nearly as slippery or prone to
fingerprints it might be somewhat
thicker at the peak of the curve around
the back but then again the curve is
supposed to help alleviate all of that
despite its material choices the Galaxy
S 4 deserves a lot of credit for having
one of the easiest to handle five inch
screens available now it's feat of
improving on the footprint of the galaxy
s3 is definitely one of its strongest
suits but then the Moto X reminds us
that we have to know what we really want
out of our devices a smart phone with
such easy and simple handling is
something we often take for granted
these days I think when you want to keep
things simple the Moto X is probably the
most accessible smartphone
available but of course it is because of
the smaller screen that the Moto X has
been able to achieve that in this battle
we have the fight between 720p and 1080p
resolutions so on the Moto X we have a
screen that plenty of spec hungry people
have already lamented 720 resolution is
what you get at 312 PPI but don't get
hasty and disregard the X because of
this because this is a great performing
little AMOLED screen for the most part
you won't be able to even tell you're
looking at a lower resolution screen
unless Sayed you put it right up next to
a galaxy s4 and you go searching for it
side by side with the galaxy s4 is a
great Super AMOLED 1080p resolution
screen capable of 441 PPI the Moto X is
actually able to hold its own but the s4
screen is bigger it better fits the
current trends and is absolutely one of
the best out there when you want a
bigger overall display experience for
let's say gaming or media consumption
the s4 screen is stellar
having that super saturated color
profile does lend itself to more vivid
colors than the Moto X but the X does
take advantage of the AMOLED technology
itself with its active notifications
ultimately it comes down to size if your
eyes are really that good at finding the
quality difference then perhaps you
would go for the s4 but in the
respective sizes both of these screens
absolutely achieve great results sure
you can look at this as last year's
specs versus current specs but that
would just be hindsight at best I have a
better metaphor for it though that I'll
get into in a bit first of all here's
the samsung galaxy s4 with its
Snapdragon 600 processor that clocks in
at 1.9 gigahertz backed by the Agena 320
and 2 gigabytes of RAM there's no doubt
that the current crop of phones sporting
this package are among the fastest and
best available and this isn't even
mentioning the Snapdragon 800 that is
starting to pop up there might be the
occasional bit of stutter here and there
but it doesn't hinder tasks in the
slightest performance on the s4 has
remained reliable and it scores in
benchmarks support this you'll get good
and fast performance on the s4 no
problem and that's why the Moto X was
rather lamented due to its engine under
the hood but it seems Motorola knew
exactly what they were doing yes you get
the Snapdragon s4 pro of last year
clocked in at 1.7 gigahertz and backed
by the Agena 320 and 2 gigabytes of RAM
as well however a couple of extra cores
were added in
for governing a specific tasks like
voice recognition and they really do
lighten the snapdragons load altogether
this is called the Motorola x8 computing
system and you know what it gets the job
done
lower scores in antutu don't adequately
show just how fast this phone can go
this is likely due to the operating
system being pretty damn close to fully
stock Android but also it's probably
because of these optimizations after all
we've had over a year already
to get the s4 pro right and therein lies
my metaphor think about this the way you
would think about cars perhaps an engine
or let's say a performance package from
a few years ago continuously gets
tinkered with over time and eventually
becomes a much more optimized version of
its former self in that way we could be
talking about the Moto X however we
could also be early adopters of the more
updated performance packages that have
more power in them because obviously
we're getting better every single year
and in that case we could be talking
about the Samsung Galaxy s4 either way
you're going to get great performance
from either one so if that helps you
kind of put things into a little bit
more perspective than great basically
this is just me saying try not to be way
too speck hungry and just disregard the
Moto X just because it doesn't happen to
have the latest and greatest that is out
there today when it comes to hardware
this battle can be summarized in really
one word practicality either you use the
features Motorola put into the X or the
myriad of extra Samsung put into the s4
in the case of the Moto X Motorola and
Google wanted to enhance your Google now
experience voice recognition is always
on due to those two extra cores and when
you say okay Google now and comes up
right away for any and all commands it's
incredibly handy and coupled with the
active notifications they are really
quite practical especially if you're
already a Google now user in other specs
the X comes with a non expandable 16 or
32 gigabytes of on-board storage along
with the usual bevy of connectivity
tools the s4 on the other hand sports
expandable memory on top of it 16 32 or
64 gigabytes of on-board storage it is
in all the other extra sensors though
that Samsung wanted to keep their focus
my full review of the s4 will give you
the rundown of all of these extras so
check it out if you haven't already but
if you worthy of mention are motion
sensors barometers or thermometers
measuring your surroundings and s health
and an IR blaster there are a lot of new
ways of navigating your phone and it's
clear that the s4 wanted to be more than
just your smartphone the Moto X on the
other hand seems to just want to perfect
your smartphone experience so it's
quality over quantity here but it's up
to you which one of those two words
accurately depicts either one of these
phones capabilities we do have to award
the Galaxy s4 a little bit of an edge
here in terms of battery solely because
it sports a replaceable one having a
spare 2600 milliamp hour unit handy is
always helpful but that being said the
Moto X with its 2,200 milliamp hour
battery is able to get the full day's
job done battery saving features on both
devices perform well and the way the
Moto takes advantage of the AMOLED
screen helps keep things pretty steadily
powered by the end of a long day I
consistently had at least 20% battery
life available by bedtime on either
device so it comes down to that spare
but you'll get a pretty standard level
of longevity in either phone the camera
situation does favor Samsung's pedigree
just a little bit more afterall the
Galaxy S line has pretty consistently
brought great optics to the smartphone
markets the galaxy s4 app comes with all
of the new features that again are
explained in my full review but include
drama and eraser mode along with dual
recording the 13 megapixel picture
quality is where the s4 strengths are as
the colour reproduction makes nearly any
picture have a high level of vibrancy
there is little doubt that the Galaxy s4
sits atop the camera phone market which
is why for what is supposed to be a
flagship device the Moto X does
disappoint with its camera offerings you
get 10 megapixels in a much simpler app
as this is almost stock Android we're
working with the interface uses touch
and swipe navigation and comes with only
a few extras like HDR and slow-motion
video you are able to easily access the
camera app by flicking the phone about
so quickly getting to your shot is more
than possible the quality suffers a bit
as the colors end up quite muted
compared to their real-life counterparts
I will say that the sharpness though is
really up there as pictures have great
detail and remain very crisp so it's
really a shame that the coloured has to
suffer for those looking for the utmost
in quality there is no doubt that the s4
takes it here as pictures are just
objective
better the Moto X camera interface is
easier to use and his pictures are very
sharp though for some that just might
not be enough let's get right to the
Moto X in this software section as stock
Android as it gets the Moto X interface
is pretty much what we Android it
through easy aspyn over
Motorola's enhancements don't change the
general aesthetic really at all and add
quite a bit of functionality users of
Google now like I've said will likely
get a real kick out of using the voice
recognition service that activates it
just say ok Google now and you're ready
to give whatever commands you want after
that you get Google esque home screens
notification drop-down with shade and
the general aesthetic in this 4.2.2
version the galaxy s4 on the other hand
employs the TouchWiz we all know and
love or hate it's more bloated and uber
colorful elements make a return with
Samsung's sensor enhancements for
navigation you can see in the
notification shade just how much you're
able to do with this 4.2.2 version of
TouchWiz hand gestures we're moving
about air view for zooming into things
and even tracking your diet and exercise
or all possible Samsung really packed in
everything they possibly could and thus
it gives you a ton of options if you
feel the new ways of navigating will
prove useful the s4 is loaded with them
otherwise the Moto X is about as
excessively simple as it can get for
either phone the on contract price
remains pretty much around $1.99 even
though that price might seem a little
steep for the Moto X this comparison
should help you keep in mind how these
two phones are actually closer on level
than you may think
unlocked both hid around a $600 mark
with the s4 hitting generally above it
and the Moto X slated to be closer to
550 and so there you have it
yes this comparison would have been
one-sided if we were dealing with just
any mid-range phone but as the Moto X is
continuously proving optimizations can
go a really long way and can be just as
good as updating the hardware itself as
both phones are around the same price
this is truly an exercise in knowing
what it is you really want customization
of the Moto X has brought plenty of
people over to its platform but in
general it gets closer to perfecting the
system we already have in place the s4
on the other hand adds new options to
the system and in the process might be a
little too overwhelming for some we have
to grade phones here either way and as
long as
you're plenty confident in which
experience will better suit you then the
choice that you make should end up being
a good one
as always thank you very much for
