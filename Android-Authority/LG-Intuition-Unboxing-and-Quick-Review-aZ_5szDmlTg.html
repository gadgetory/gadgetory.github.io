youngberg with android authority calm
your number one source for all things
android today I've got an unboxing and
quick overview of the LG intuition for
Verizon Wireless now we all know that
Verizon Wireless is not huge in the
phablet game they did not get the note 1
they did not get the HTC rumored phablet
that we were kind of hoping for but they
did get the LG intuition and I
considering I needed a new daily driver
because I broke my galaxy nexus I
decided by pick one up so let's go ahead
and unbox it go over a few of the specs
I did purchase this today has been out
for maybe a week at this time of filming
and I am a verizon wireless customer so
I decided I would get a phablet and try
it out because I have been dying for the
awesome screen size anyways I did have
an enjoyable time at the verizon for
once I did not get any of the usual crap
i would get a nice young lady helped me
out with activating this phone and kind
of telling me some of the features and
some of the cool hot scoop for verizon
now anyways the LG intuition is a five
inch device it's really really big as
you can see right here in my hand it
just looks massive we do have our galaxy
s3 right here and it's almost it's
nearly dwarfing the galaxy s3 and the
galaxy history does have the four point
eight inch display now anyways other
cool specs this does have a dual core
processor it's a snack dragon s3 variety
clocked at 1.5 gigahertz we've got one
gigabyte of RAM we have 32 gigabytes of
internal storage we'll get into some of
the software here in a minute after we
see what else is in the box so you have
a nice little tassel here we can pull to
reveal the rest of the contents you have
our starting manual here we do have some
LG NFC tags because this phone does have
an NFC chip and with Android for dot 0
dot 4 we can definitely utilize the nice
features of NFC anyways we have another
compartment here here's where we find
our stylist now on this stylus is a
little less intuitive than the S Pen
with the Galaxy Note 2 of course in fact
we don't even have a place on the phone
to keep the stylus so that's going to be
a bothersome feature
for some but you know you can buy other
styluses in the store at any cell phone
store really to use with this device not
really anything special about this style
is compared to aftermarket stylists you
can use with any device so but we do
have some cool intuitive features that i
will get into things will set the stylus
on the phone aside see what else we have
we do have our travel adapter which is
our AC adapter and our USB data cable
this does not come with headphones
apparently but that's not a huge bummer
for me because i have so many pairs it's
ridiculous anyways this does have a
screen resolution of 6 no excuse me of
768 by 1024 pixels so it's got a pretty
nice resolution we've got a 256 PPI so
the pixel density is pretty nice to kind
of get in here and we can check this out
anyways it's running Android for dot 0
dot for ice cream sandwich hopefully we
do have the jelly bean upgrade on the
way this is also running the Optimus UI
which we saw on the lg optimus 4x HD on
the lg optimus G also will have the
Optimus UI see we've got a 2080 milliamp
battery non-removable unfortunately so
we've got a very thin profile it's
really nice i like the display this
phone does have a lot of haters but you
know that's because we've got a lot of
samsung fatboy's but here android
authority we aren't specific to any sort
of brand we just love android and if
you're getting anything besides the
iphone 5 we commend you for it now as
you can see we do have a lot of
preloaded apps we've got a lot of cool
features go ahead and look at some of
the cool um physical features of this
phone as you can see right here on top
we do have our little USB our micro USB
slot you can in fact cover that up to
protect any dust and debris from getting
there this is our power button it has a
nice illumination effect as you can see
really classy this is a well-built phone
we've got metal around the sides on the
bottom we do have a plastic back here
with some nice LG branding and of course
the 4g LTE from verizon our NFC chips
located right down here got some
speakers here it megapixel camera in the
rear let's see
we have in our front we've got 1.3
megapixel front facing camera anyways
this is our intuitive button for the
quick memo of course when we press this
button we capture a screenshot and it
looks like i haven't used it yet so
we're going to have to go through some
initial steps which i will do later
anyways this does have the dedicated
capacitive buttons for the back home
recent apps of course and then of course
our menu button I have not played with
this phone at all I actually put it back
in the box right after activated so i
could give you guys a nice unboxing
video of course we're going to have
comparisons software hardware smackdown
between this MV galaxy s3 we're going to
have a full review for the LG intuition
as well but just some other cool things
about this we are running on the 4g LTE
network from verizon i don't have that
in my area right now we'll go ahead and
go into some of the apps as you can see
here it's giving me my initial
instructions we have a row of five apps
plenty of space can scroll through we
also have our folder for downloads and
widgets now I don't particularly hate
the LG Optimus UI but I am definitely
definitely waiting for this to get a
root method i'll probably put some cm10
on here and then we'll actually see some
comparison between this and the note 2
now the s3 processor is a little
outdated it's not as powerful as the
Snapdragon s4 that we're seeing
especially not the Snapdragon s4 pro
that's coming in variance of phones to
the US and internationally now but it is
very very powerful 1.5 gigahertz as you
can see it is not lagging it all go
ahead and try out our stylist here very
responsive I'm going to be happy with
this phone and of course if I'm not I'm
going to be getting something else you
guys know me and you know us at android
authority we got to cover all of the
great phones anyways this is the quick
Metalab can simply tap right there we
can click the shown up not show this
screen again and then I can show you and
as taking a screenshot we can write on
it make notes and stuff we can save it
and also share it and of course like I
said we'll get a full review of all the
software and hardware about this phone
anyways guys that was a quick unboxing
and quick demo of some of the software
and hardware features in
the LG intuition for Verizon Wireless
verizon's first phablet phone first
phone over 5 inches in screen size and I
think this is going to be a promising
phone it does have a lot of haters as I
said a lot of people um are going to
pick sides between this and the samsung
but we got to remember we're all android
fans here um you know that's not
something we should be disputing but it
is everyone's opinion anyways guys
