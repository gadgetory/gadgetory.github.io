Youngberg with Android authority calm
your number one source for all things
Android today I've got an unboxing and
quick overview of the LG intuition for
Verizon Wireless now we all know that
Verizon Wireless is not huge in the
phablet game they did not get the note 1
they did not get the HTC rumoured
phablet that we were kind of hoping for
but they did get the LG intuition and by
considering I needed a new daily driver
because I broke my Galaxy Nexus I
decided I pick one up let's go ahead and
unbox it go over a few of the specs I
did purchase this today
has been out for maybe a week at this
time of filming and I am a Verizon
Wireless customer so I decided I would
get a phablet and try it out because I
have been dying for the awesome screen
size anyways I did have an enjoyable
time at the Verizon for once I did not
get any of the usual crap I would get a
nice young lady helped me out with
activating this phone and kind of
telling me some of the features and some
of the cool hot scoop for Verizon now
anyways the LG intuition is a 5 inch
device it's really really big as you can
see right here in my hand it just looks
massive we do have our galaxy s3 right
here and it's almost it's nearly
dwarfing the galaxy s3 and the galaxy
history does have the 4.8 inch display
now anyways other cool specs this does
have a dual core processor it's a snack
dragon s3 variety clocked at 1.5
gigahertz we've got one gigabyte of RAM
we have 32 gigabytes of internal storage
we'll get into some of the software here
in a minute after we see what else is in
the box so you have a nice little tassel
here we can pull to reveal the rest of
the contents we have our starting manual
here we do have some LG NFC tags because
this phone does have an NFC chip and
with Android 4.0.4 we can definitely
utilize the nice features of NFC anyways
we have another compartment here here's
where we find our stylus now on this
stylus is a little less intuitive than
the s-pen with the Galaxy Note 2 of
course in fact we don't even have a
place on the phone to keep the stylus so
that's going to be a bothersome feature
for some but you know you can buy other
styluses in the store at any cellphone
store really to use with this device
it's not really anything special about
this style is compared to aftermarket
stylus you can use with any device so
but we do have some cool intuitive
features that I will get into things
will set the stylus and the phone aside
see what else we have we do have our
travel adapter which is our AC adapter
and our USB data cable this does not
come with headphones apparently but
that's not a huge bummer for me because
I have so many pairs it's ridiculous now
anyways this does have a screen
resolution of 6 no excuse me of 768 by
1024 pixels so it's got a pretty nice
resolution we've got a 256 PPI so the
pixel density is pretty nice to kind of
get in here and we can check this out
anyways it's running Android 4.0.4 Ice
Cream Sandwich hopefully we do have the
jellybean upgrade on the way this is
also running the optimist UI which we
saw on the lg optimus 4x HD the lg
optimus G also will have the Optimus UI
see we've got a 2080 milliamp battery
not removable unfortunately so we've got
a very thin profile it's really nice I
like the display this phone does have a
lot of haters but you know that's
because we've got a lot of Samsung
fanboys but here Android authority we
aren't specific to any sort of brand we
just love Android and if you're getting
anything besides the iPhone 5 we commend
you for it now as you can see we do have
a lot of preloaded apps we've got a lot
of cool features go ahead and look at
some of the cool
physical features of this phone as you
can see right here on top we do have our
little USB our microUSB slot we can in
fact cover that up to protect any dust
and debris from getting there this is
our power button it has a nice
illumination effect as you can see
really classy this is a well-built phone
we've got metal around the sides on the
bottom we do have a plastic back here
with some nice LG branding and of course
the 4G LTE from Verizon our NFC chips
located right down here got some
speakers here 8 megapixel camera in the
rear let's see
we have in our front we've got 1.3
megapixel front-facing camera anyways
this is our intuitive button for the
quick memo of course when we press this
button we capture a screenshot and it
looks like I haven't used it yet so
we're going to have to go through some
initial steps which I will do later
anyways this does have the dedicated
capacitive buttons for the back home
recent apps of course and then of course
our menu button I have not played with
this phone at all I actually put it back
in the box right after activated it so I
could give you guys a nice unboxing
video of course we're gonna have
comparisons software hardware is smack
down between this MV galaxy s3 we're
gonna have a full review for the LG
intuition as well but just some other
cool things about this we are running on
the 4G LTE network from Verizon I don't
have that in my area right now but we'll
go ahead and go into some of the apps as
you can see here it's giving me my
initial instructions we have a row of
five apps plenty of space can scroll
through we also have our folder for
downloads and widgets now I don't
particularly hate the lg optimus UI but
I am definitely definitely waiting for
this to get a root method I'll probably
put some cm10 on here and then we'll
actually see some comparison between
this and the note 2 now the s3 processor
is a little outdated it's not as
powerful as the Snapdragon s4 that we're
seeing and especially not the Snapdragon
s4 pro that's coming in variants of
phones to the US and internationally now
but it is very very powerful 1.5
gigahertz as you can see it is not
lagging at all go ahead and try out our
stylus here very responsive I'm going to
be happy with this phone and of course
if I'm not I'm going to be getting
something else you guys know me and you
know us at Android Authority we got to
cover all of the great phones anyways
this is the quick memo app you can
simply tap right there we can click to
shown up not show this screen again and
then I can show you and that's taking a
screenshot we can write on it make notes
and stuff we can save it and also share
it and of course like I said we'll get a
full review of all the software and
hardware about this phone anyways guys
that was a quick unboxing and quick demo
of some of the software and hardware
features in
the LG intuition for Verizon Wireless
Verizon's first phablet phone first
phone over five inches in screen size
and I think this is going to be a
promising phone it does have a lot of
haters as I said and a lot of people are
going to pick sites between this and the
Samsung but we got to remember we're all
Android fans here you know that's not
something we should be disputing but it
is everyone's opinion anyways guys
