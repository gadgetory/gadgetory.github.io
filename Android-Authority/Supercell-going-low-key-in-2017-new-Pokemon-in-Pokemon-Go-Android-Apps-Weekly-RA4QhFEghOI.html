Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 179 so let's roll that
intro and get right into those headlines
a study came out this week that revealed
that only one in ten people still use a
new application after one week that
number drops to about four or five out
of a hundred people using it after 30
days retention rates are higher in some
areas like North America and they're
also higher on iOS than on Android in
general androids new instant ABS feature
could dramatically change these numbers
when people try out apps without
actually having to install them word
around the digital grapevine indicates
the super cell isn't developing a game
this year the popular developer released
clash Royale in 2016 and then eighty-six
percent of the company was purchased by
10 cent for eight point six billion
dollars in short it was a pretty busy
year the team plans to double down and
improve their current selection of games
right now however a new game is
scheduled for early release in 2018
early this week princess music became
widely available on streaming sites once
again Prince had previously removed his
music from the streaming sites in 2015
and only gave the rights to stream them
to title he sadly passed away in 2016
and the powers that be decided to bring
them all back for everybody there are 27
albums and compilations available on
most major streaming platforms they also
announced that purple rain and two
unreleased albums were getting remasters
that are due out in June of 2017 Pokemon
go received a huge update this last week
niantic has added 80 new pokemon into
the mix and the new ones predominantly
come from pokemon gold and pokemon
silver some even have gender variance
that you can catch the update also
included some visual tweaks to make some
actions easier evolution items at pokey
stops new items in general and a lot
more niantic also announced that a huge
update was on the way which includes
trainer be trainer battling trading and
some new combat mechanics Google lost a
court battle this last week a court in
Marshall Texas ruled that Google was
violating patents for the anti-malware
software baked into Google Chrome Google
will have to fork out 20 million dollars
in damages although google claims that
the patents were invalid and they didn't
do anything illegal clearly the courts
disagreed the patents belong to two
independent developers and unfortunately
one of them did pass away in 2012
one year before the court case started
in 2013 slice and rise is a fun little
time waster where you play as a ninja
your goal is to climb as high as you can
and you'll also have to avoid obstacles
and kill bad guys it features colorful
graphics simple controls and some
magical items that can help you out
there is a pit of lava that follows you
up so you'll have to be quick about it
as well the premise is a little simple
and the mechanics aren't overly
inspiring however the game is completely
free with no in-app purchases and that
makes it great if you're low on money
amazon chime is a new communication
platform eventually it'll be intended to
take on companies like skype and slack
most of its features will be oriented
toward business users you'll be able to
schedule meetings share documents and
engage in simple chat rooms it's not
going to replace slack or skype right
now but it could be a good option with a
little bit of work it's free to download
and check out if you want to there are a
couple of subscription options for those
who need additional features we wouldn't
recommend it just yet but it is
something to keep your eye on third star
is a platform game with some fun
mechanics you play as two girls and
peach girl exists in her own little
world you'll have to switch back and
forth between those worlds in order to
progress through each level it features
50 levels and each one has their own
little set of puzzles for you to solve
it also has retro graphics a catchy
soundtrack and it's just pretty fun to
play it's also completely free with no
in-app purchases and that makes it
another great option for those who want
to game on a budget face app is an
application that changes your selfies it
was super popular on iOS and thankfully
the android port actually kind of works
the way it works is that you take a
selfie and then you apply a filter the
filter will make you look older and
younger like a dude like a woman or even
give you a smile if you didn't provide
one you can get some really goofy
results depending on the expressions
that you use you can also make collages
that you can also share on social media
it's a free application that you'll
forget about in a couple of weeks but it
could be a fun couple of weeks batman
arkham underworld is a strategy
adventure game that lets you play with
the villains of the Batman universe

hideout defending it from others an
online PvP mode and creating gills with
your friends and the game gilger

also a campaign mode that you can play
through peep you want to it's a freemium
game and it definitely looks and feels
like a freemium game however it's a fun
little title for Batman fan
