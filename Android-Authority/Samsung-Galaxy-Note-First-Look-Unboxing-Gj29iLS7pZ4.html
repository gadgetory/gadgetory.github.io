Authority calm today we are doing a
galaxy note unboxing video this is the
easier version of the Samsung Galaxy
Note 16 gigabyte support AMOLED HD
Gingerbread 2.3 Wi-Fi the ibx bluetooth
3.0 so basically is a 5.3 inch display
with dual core 1 by 4 gigahertz 8
megapixel camera and most importantly
the s-pen kind of a stylus that Samsung
created for this Galaxy Note is
interesting device so the unboxing right
now
so basically in the whole package you
have the tablet or phone tablet if you
call it that
quite nice backing there so in the
package what you get is this fear
starter guide Quick Start Guide some
leaflets on warranty Quick Start Guide
manual that tells you how to do certain
things I put in the battery interesting
you would also have inside the package
micro USB cable with charger headphones
which is white curious and as well as
the plastic thing is for the their
phones that's about it
in the package so this then is on right
now that looks really really good
so to basically fit in the SIM card and
microSD what you can do is we can take
off this back casing or this long
lasting on this thing
all right all the plastic is off
okay last one all right free from
plastic so to be sleep win your SIM card
and microSD card all you need to do is
pry open this fun it's pretty much like
the way as to is so just pry it open
give me a second so once is openness to
see the battery which is technically two
thousand five hundred million bits yeah
correct
check it out here 2500
so just swap in your sink this way
according to the sign BG SIM card micro
USB or s in and plug it in
and we'll see how this works by the way
this is the sinus or s-pen as I call it
all right
the android logo of my pin number
alright let's just skip the Google house
at the moment
automatic let's worry about that dates
later
oh let's try that again
let's give next next
alright we are in so it's so moving up
very very smooth as good as the asshole
you've not even better
it means further than that oh and they
incorporate that in fine light blue pink
pop the home screen which is a nice
touch
excellent very very nice so loading
let's give it some time home screens
just booked the same way as touch police
did on the Galaxy s2 in terms of drama
it's pretty much the same except that
you have more apps on your screen this
time you can arrange it in less great
wheel runs on and drive 2.35 interesting
the same features on the TouchWiz is
also available so basically the same
kind of turnover to mute to zoom it was
the same way
so now since I've plugged in my microSD
within a device I'll just give the
speaker's a task perhaps all right so
let's try this one so let's turn on the
volume the speakers are very impressive
it's very loud in trim the video I
suppose uncertain what else can we do
master color tone is video maker
full screen let's try a higher
resolution video remember I have higher
resolution video here somewhere
alright this is 108 or video it's quite
interesting it's very very sharp
you can clearly see the final details
like a clock the linings you can
basically see them very clearly the
trees the leaves you can basically
define the branches even they will see
the fine lines on the bridge first
interesting is interesting this device
is basically one of the interesting ones
that Samsung is releasing let's give a
the Tanner try well as far as I know is
that you can do normal scrolling and
swiping with the S Pen and it's
basically a pen with a clickable pot
here as you can see here that there's a
button on the a spender you can click
and solve like does something so let's
just give the clicker try so what does
it do oh that's nice
it captures screenshots the clickable
button I'm not sure if it does anything
else so let's just save this class so it
works exactly like your fingers does on
the s-pen as far as I need that during
the launch of the galaxy notes on in
Europe they actually show the new hand
gesture so basically just put your hand
over the phone and just swipe he does
the same thing a screen capture so let's
just try that again interesting it's
fast convenient and inclusive we'll find
out more later once the I'll give this
four more test runs
