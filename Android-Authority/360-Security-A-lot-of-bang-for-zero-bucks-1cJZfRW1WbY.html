handy the Android a 30 app guy and in
this quick video we're gonna take a look
at 360 security so what does 360
security actually do for starters it's
an anti-virus application that comes
with a decent set of features they
include real-time scanning of your apps
and files to make sure any potential
problems don't exist anymore
a scanner to find pre-existing problems
and it can detect adware malware Trojans
and more the virus database is updated
from the cloud pretty much whenever you
want it to on top of that it also has a
cleanup function that will find old
forgotten and otherwise useless files on
your device it will then clear out all
of those files to help give you some
extra storage this functionality is
extended to applications as well you can
find and uninstall apps you don't use to
save on space and sometimes conserve
battery there is also a boost function
that clears out running applications
this is actually configurable so you can
leave applications in memory if you want
to we recommend putting all of the
applications you frequently use in the
exception so they don't spend all day
reinitializing and draining your battery
otherwise it seems to work as intended
the app has a bunch of other features as
well one of our favorites was the app
locking using this feature you can lock
various applications to prevent access
and you can set a pattern lock to keep
it secure it works as expected and you
can configure which applications have
the lock and which ones do not there is
also a newer feature that allows you to
block notifications from various apps
this functionality is kind of built into
lollipop and marshmallow but the
application takes it just a step further
you can configure which applications
show you notifications and then it'll
hide the other ones for later viewing
this is great especially for games that
don't know when to shut up along with
that you'll get a call in an SMS filter
that will automatically block incoming
SMS and phone calls from numbers and
contacts that you've assigned this is a
good way to get rid of free Pete
telemarketers and other various
annoyances 360 security has several
other additional features they include
an application manager to help you
uninstall and view applications a data
monitor that lets you set your monthly
limits and keep track of that and they
find my phone feature that is integrated
with Google that will help you find your
device it's true that not everyone will
find every single feature useful but
with the giant list of things available
there's something
there for just about everyone okay now
that we know what it does here's what we
liked about 360 security pretty much
everything you do in this application is
configurable and we really liked that if
you like a feature you can configure it
to your needs and if you don't want a
feature you can opt not to use it the
whole thing is totally your call and
nothing is forced on you which we really
liked the phone SMS and notification
filters are really fun to play with it's
nice getting those set up and knowing
that when your phone goes off it's
because it's something you actually want
to interact with the clean up feature is
pretty nifty a lot of applications have
this one in 360 Security's version works
as well as any of them it's a good way
to get rid of old forgotten and
otherwise useless files to free up some
storage the antivirus security actually
works and it's quick and painless during
our tests that found out the mail where
applications right away and uninstalling
them was really easy the tertiary
features also work really well in fact
during our testing we didn't run into
one broken feature or a forced closed
360 security as a whole seems to be a
very stable application we also really
liked that the Find My Phone feature was
integrated with your Google account
instead of trying to do its own thing
it's so much easier this way and we
appreciated the efforts finally it uses
the Android design guidelines and it
looks very good doing so it is
definitely a good-looking application
it's also totally free with no in-app
purchases which is always a plus the
application appears to be supported by
advertising and the advertising isn't
all that intrusive and here's what we
didn't like so much we loved that the
boost feature is configurable so it
doesn't kill off the applications that
you use often unfortunately it doesn't
come configured hardly at all and
depending on your usage removing that
many applications from memory can result
in many of them popping right back up
again as you use your device
continuously reloading applications this
way can actually make your battery life
worse if you don't use it right again
that's depending on your use case many
of the applications best features are in
the menus it focuses on the boost the
cleanup and the antivirus functionality
we would have liked to have seen the
various filters app lock and the Find My
Phone feature more prominently
represented as with any application with
advertising we would have liked to have
seen a way to pay to remove the ads it's
a small thing since the ads generally
aren't intrusive and there are no popups
anywhere but having that option is
always preferable finally when you first
run the application 360
security will place a few icons on your
home screen all of these features are
available in the application so we don't
understand why they did this and it can
be a little intrusive overall 360
security is one of the best if not the
best
all-in-one optimization applications
available today it's true that a few of
the features require a bit of
configuration to get them to work right
and not everything is perfect with a set
of features of 360 security delivers is
quite impressive and the application
itself is solid and stable if you want
to try it out we'll have that link for
you in the video description below along
with some other important information it
currently rocks a 4.6 rating in the
Google Play Store and has been
downloaded by over 100 million people we
can see why that would be the case it is
totally free to use with no in-app
purchases so there is no harm in trying
it out for yourself once again I'm Joe
