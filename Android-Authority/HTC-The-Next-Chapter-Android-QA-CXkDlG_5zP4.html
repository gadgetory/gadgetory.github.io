brought to you by go to assist the
number one global market leader and
remote support so big shake-up in the
world of HTC this week with CEO Peter
Chou being replaced by cher Wang and
perhaps most intriguing is in the press
release announcing her appointment it
was suggested that perhaps HTC might be
admitting defeat in the smartphone
market altogether now check out this
carefully worded statement by the new
CEO of HTC chair Wang we pioneer the
smartphone industry now we're applying
that thinking to realize the potential
of a new generation of connected
products and services so said HTC
co-founder and chairwoman cher Wang in
the press release that accompanied her
announcement as CEO does this mean that
HTC is admitting defeat in the
smartphone market only time will tell
but it does at least signal a pragmatic
acknowledgement that the company will
never again regain its 2,000 high if it
stays on its current path you see HTC
claimed over ten percent of the
worldwide smartphone market in q2 of
2011 and was the market leader in the
u.s. in q3 in 2011 that worldwide market
share has now dropped below 2% the
company posted an annual loss in 2013
and despite a return to narrow
profitability in the last three quarters
of 2011 sales are stagnant I know what
you're thinking some of you think in
Jace HTC makes a gorgeous product they
should see one is a beautiful phone I
mean it's a knock out of the park
especially the original HTC One so if
they make such a gorgeous phone why
aren't they selling because marketing is
not a battle of products it's a battle
of perception if you read this book I
talked about a couple weeks ago the 22
immutable laws of marketing it just
spills out so clearly what's happening
the smartphone market right now why is
Apple so much wildly popular than any
other manufacturer when their phones
aren't necessarily better it's a battle
of perception not of products but that's
not the only problem that HTC has
combined that with a lack of influence
with carriers feeds into HTC's biggest
weakness over the last few years
being forced into exclusive deals with
carriers has hobble HTC in the US with a
fragmented brand and saddled its devices
with bloatware it has slowed the android
update process eroding HTC's reputation
as the leading Android brand and further
to that battle of perception HTC's
advertising campaigns have been
questionable HTC climbed to its peak
wouldn't let the product do the talking
the quote quietly brilliant slogan was
inspired people recommended HTC phones
and sought them out because they were
really good and there were very few
comparable competitors at the time
hiring Robert Downey jr. as your brand
ambassador and making corn a wacky ads
that don't make even a mention of the
product is the polar opposite of the
original approach and it's no surprise
that it's not working so what's the new
strategy well it turns out it may
already be underway and in short it's
virtual reality cher wang says the
overwhelming response that our virtual
reality product HTC vive received
earlier this month underlies the
importance of these new connected
technologies for our future if you
haven't seen anything about it yet then
it's time you take a look at HTC's
virtual reality collaboration with the
gaming giant valve the vibe has the
potential to be the VR product of the
next few years and if VR really takes
off this time that could send HTC
soaring to new heights the
diversification won't end there because
HTC's executive director of global
marketing Jeff Gattis recently told
International Business Times that the
company's connected products business
unit which was created last summer will
also be tackling the home automation
market now when I say the word fast food
what do you think of McDonald's when you
ask for a tissue paper you don't say
tissue paper you say may I have a
Kleenex when you go to the kitchen
looking for cellophane wrap you don't
ask for cellophane wrap you ask for
saran wrap that's because these products
these services are first in their
category they are top of mind in the
consumer market that's why they win it's
not a bottle of products it's a battle
of perception HTC needs to create their
own category be first in that category
and then promote the category where
that's virtual reality or some sort of
new camera device or wearable device
that's what HTC's got to do there's no
long-term profitability being fourth or
fifth in a category let's hope HTC can
do it so as a geek I'm sure you've had
the responsibility of helping your
coworker solve their computer problems
