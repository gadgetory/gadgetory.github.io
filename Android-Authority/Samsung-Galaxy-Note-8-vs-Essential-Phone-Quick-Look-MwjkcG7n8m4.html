the year and some of the biggest
releases are coming to light including
the latest from Samsung and the newest
entry into the high-end smartphone
market in one corner we have a phone
that's trying to put quite literally
everything into one package and in the
other corner we have a phone that tries
to offer the fundamentals while
redefining what a smartphone user really
requires it's Joshua Vergara what's
going on everybody and we're taking a
quick look at the brand new Samsung
Galaxy Note 8 and the essential phone
just a couple of years ago you would be
hard-pressed to find large screens in
devices that are kind of artfully
compact the Galaxy Note 8 brings its
AMOLED display that is about as large as
the galaxy s 8 plus over six inches with
curved sides and nearly non-existent
bezels dubbed the infinity display the
screen comes with a ton of different
features including the edge UX where you
can have a bunch of panels that give you
a lot of different capabilities and
there's always the always-on display
thanks to its AMOLED nature parts of the
display can be used to always show you
some information and to clearly show you
your notifications a lot of this is not
the case with the essential phone whose
screen is still pretty large at 5.7
inches but it's body overall is a little
bit more compact it also has an IPS
display at quad HD resolution with a 19
by 10 aspect ratio the display gets a
little bit cut by the centered
front-facing camera a small area dips
down from the top and actually adds a
break in the display all the elements
still stretch up to the very top though
and the mixture of the two makes for a
very unique looking device the screens
dictate the sizes of these phones but
it's the no 8 that manages to still be
decent despite its larger size but
overall we have to give the handling to
the essential just because it's a little
bit smaller and also it has the flat
sides that make it very easy to grip and
on the other hand you have the Galaxy
Note 8 which continues the good design
and the good build that we come to
expect from Samsung devices in the last
couple of years the specifications are
all on par with the snapdragon 835 found
throughout Samsung has stepped their
game up however with 6 gigabytes of RAM
in all note 8 phones while essential
keeps the 4 gigabytes of RAM but make
sure that 128 gigabytes of internal
storage makes up for their lack of SD
card expansion in terms of audio you
might get a little bit of that argument
about what is exactly essential because
the essential phone lacks a headphone
jack and requires a USBC adapter
that is of course not the case with the
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 which still has
the headphone jack and the larger
battery to compensate for its larger
display at 3300 milliamp hours the 3040
million Bauer unit in the essential is
likely to be proportionate to its 5.7
inch display we will do more battery
testing between these phones and see
which one lasts longer so when we're
talking about hardware we can bring up
the s-pen the hardware Edition that has
always defined the note the essential
cannot boast any such included accessory
and for people that really need
productivity tools or even just a little
bit of extra fun the s-pen continues to
be one of the most well thought out
companions to any smartphone the S Pen
gains the ability to have screen off
memo edit up to a hundred pages and a
live message feature that makes an
animated gif out of one's written words
the s-pen might go unused for some users
but anyone that gives it a shot might
find some of the best added features
that you can't find anywhere else now
the essential comes with its own
companion accessories even if they are
sold separately and are modular in
nature more will come soon including a
charging dock essential promises that
those connector pins next to the camera
will come in future devices and will
take any and all accessories in their
ecosystem
what is undeniably essential is a good
software experience and there are two
very different takes on that philosophy
here
Samsung continues to refine and
streamline that software as much as it
can
and aside from new S Pen features the
main addition comes to multitasking as
app pair make shortcuts that open up to
applications into multi window
automatically this is great for
multitaskers but the general software
experience is still as streamlined as it
has ever been but it still suffers from
the redundancies of having Google and
Samsung equivalent applications in one
device which is not the case with the
essential thumb as it is basically
Android at its purest with very few
applications added on top of what is
already included in the stock build that
means there isn't too much to actually
talk about here but it is one of the
most reliable and smoothest experiences
we've had regarding Android in recent
phones but that doesn't really include
the camera app before we get to the big
story here Samsung going dual camera we
see essential make good on its promise
to bring dual lenses to their phone it's
a combo of RGB and monochrome sensors
and it's something that we've seen in
other phones mainly by Huawei it comes
to the essential to hopefully bring easy
and high quad
photography however up until the
recording of this video we got to OTA
updates that have added HDR to the mix
and have tried to improve the camera
application which is probably the main
issue here the camera app is a little
bit slow and it can crash from time to
time but we hope that updates are going
to make it and the picture quality even
better the monochrome photos have a lot
of detail in them and it's really fun to
use however we will do more testing to
make sure that the colored photos are
still up to par and even then the camera
app is lacking in a lot of modes even a
manual mode it's a little bit too basic
for our taste and then you have the
Samsung version of a camera which has
pretty much everything you can think of
but the main big addition to Samsung's
camera is a new lens a 12 megapixel 2 X
optical zoom lens that complements the
other 12 megapixel regular sensor they
bring back the live focus feature for
depth of field shooting which is great
for portraits and both lenses have
optical image stabilization which will
really help for those zoom shots and
then after that there are all of the
different modes you're probably familiar
with from past Samsung devices overall
Samsung finally finds itself among the
rest of the dual cameras in the Android
space so we will be testing the zoom
capabilities and report back all results
in our full reviews the essential is on
pre-order now for the price of 699
dollars either unlocked or via Sprint
while the Galaxy Note 8 will go on
pre-order on August 28th which shipments
starting on September 15 and so there
you have it a look at the differences
between the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and
the essential phone there are two
fundamentally different philosophies at
play here with Samsung still continuing
to provide a stacked but overall
reliable experience in their phones and
the essential trying to give users the
best possible experience with what they
deem essential the note 8 might end up
having the dreaded galaxy syndrome where
features go unused after day one and the
essential needs more work on mainly its
cameras to be considered worthy by
serious smart phone shutter bugs there's
always going to be a caveat or a misstep
with other phone but we will continue to
explore them in our full reviews coming
soon keep you tuned to and row 30 for
that and even more on both the essential
phone and the Samsung Galaxy Note 8
subscribe to the channel if you haven't
already to keep up with all of that and
then stick around and head on over to
Android or decom for even more because
we are your source for all things
