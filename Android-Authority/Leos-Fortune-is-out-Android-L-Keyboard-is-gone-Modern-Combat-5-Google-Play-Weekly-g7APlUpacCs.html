Hindy the android authority app guy it's
Friday but before everyone goes out to
hit the bars how about we talk about
some application news that happened this
week we have some Google stuff some root
stuff and a whole lot more so let's get
started our first bit of this week is
for you root users it's been announced
that xposed framework is coming to
android l this has been a subject of
debate and discussion for months since
the original developer of exposed stated
that exposed in its current form
wouldn't work on the Android runtime
however in a statement released this
week robo 89 developer of exposed said
that the legendary framework would be
coming to Android l's version of art I
set it that way because it may not come
to kit kats version but hey we'll see
what happens when the time comes for now
though patience next up google voice
search now allows you to use a phrase to
correct misheard words the functionality
is simple when you do a voice search and
it gets the word wrong you hit the mic
button and say no I said another word
and the voice search app will attempt to
fix it for you this can be very useful
for people who just can't seem to get
things right on the first try the update
has rolled out so most people should
have it if not to be patient because
it'll be there soon and now for some bad
news unfortunately the Android L
keyboard has been pulled from the google
play store according to reports the
application was pulled because it
violated the terms of service of the
google play store specifically the
problem was that it was actually the
keyboard from android l and not a look
like and that means google wasn't overly
happy about it being released it'll make
its way to the web soon enough so if you
wanted just google search that thing and
you will be able to find it you've never
really expect facebook to be on the
forefront of well anything but right now
they're working on android l style lock
screen notifications some of the beta
testers are reporting that facebook is
using a stacked card notification style
on the lock screen as their way of
getting you notifications it seems like
a pretty cool idea and if anyone needed
a good idea it was Facebook if you tap
the notifications it'll open the
facebook application to the event that
you clicked on or you can dismiss it
with a swipe now if only they could fix
those observed wakelock problems in our
last bit of news this week
after a year of waiting we finally have
a release date for modern combat 5 it's
been announced that modern combat 5 will
be out on july twenty fourth and it's
about damn time modern combat floor was
an insanely well done first person
shooter that still adorns many best
shooter lists today it'll be 699 at
launch and it will include improved
graphics a whole new campaign complete
with new weapons and vehicles and an
online multiplayer mode with 12 players
per match I'm super excited you should
be too so who wants to see some trending
applications as usual if you want to
check any of these applications out you
can find the links which is in the
briton companion which is in the video
description below first up this week is
lock lock this unique messaging service
essentially puts a whiteboard on your
lock screen that you can then edit drawl
or add pictures too and it'll sync with
a friend's phone which shows them
exactly the same thing you see it's a
fun quick way to send messages just
don't send anything private because
it'll show right up on the lock screen
it's free to use so why not next up is
talent for Twitter the talent devs made
news this week when they introduced a
new version of Talon that uses the
material design standard it looks really
slick but unfortunately it's only for
those running the Android L preview at
this time they may incorporate some of
this into their current application but
it's definitely something to keep an eye
on once you get Android L commander is
an extremely useful application that's
been quickly gaining popularity over the
last week what it does is use Google
nails take a note command to let you do
things like turn your bluetooth on and
off or your Wi-Fi on and off and a bunch
of other things it also has Tasker
integration and if you use google now a
lot the new should have this app in your
app drawer the chromecast application
was updated this last week as part of
Google's update Wednesday the update
will allow devices running Android
KitKat 4.4 point2 and up the ability to
mirror their Android devices to their
television using the chromecast
application and the chromecast this is a
huge deal because it's one of the very
few ways to do this without root access
and it's the only one done by Google if
you've been looking for more reasons to
own a chromecast here is a really good
one last and certainly not least this
week is Leo's fortune the game found
fame before it was even released thanks
to a demo displayed at Google i/o now
the game is actually out and so far it
rocks a 4.9 rating in the google play
store for a game this 499 that
pretty good the graphics are colorful
and fun and actually pretty decent and
the gameplay is also colorful and fun
you've spent five dollars on something
you enjoyed less than you'll probably
enjoy this so we can't think of a reason
not to give it a shot once again I'm Joe
