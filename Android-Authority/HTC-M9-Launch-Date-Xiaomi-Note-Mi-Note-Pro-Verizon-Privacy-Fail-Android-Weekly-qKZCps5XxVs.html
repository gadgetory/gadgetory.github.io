brought to you by full sail university
alright so the irony of this hit me
pretty hard you know this guy alex jones
he's a radio host broadcaster and the
founder of infowars.com and if you don't
share his political views you might
think he's a conspiracy folk I mean he's
the guy who got into a shouting match
with pierce Bronson on CNN suggesting
that the British might come back to take
us guns and I'm here to tell you 1776
will commence again if you try to take
our firearms that guy now here's the
bitter pill to swallow is that his
conspiracy theories have largely been
right and when it comes to privacy
verizon has proven that that is true
here we go now you might be thinking
Jace this is nothing new governments and
companies have been trying to gather
personal data about us since time
immemorial to use for their own
nefarious purposes but verizon has taken
this just up another level they employ a
cookie that cannot be deleted this is a
special verizon cookie installed on
verizon phones that can be used by ad
companies to track your personal data it
is a genuine cause for concern because
unlike a lot of other tracking options
users cannot delete this cookie here's
how it works the unique cookie is known
as you I'd eh or unique identifier
header the UID H which is used to track
users based on location interests and
more is something that Verizon claims
they don't believe ad companies will use
to send targeted data to consumers due
to the fact that the identifier is
frequently changed but a discovery by a
Stanford computer scientist reveals that
it's not only possible but it's already
being done so unlike other privacy faux
paws they're basically admitting
publicly that you can't go into your
settings and remove this or change the
settings they're going to track you
whether you like it or not and that's
all there is to it now on to happier
news March first is the date that HTC
reveals their new flagship HTC has just
invited us to a Miss
three events scheduled for Sunday march
first now there's no official indication
that this will be the m8 successor but
realistically there's no other phone
that would warrant such a big event
during this time of the year the press
event is set to take place the day
before the Mobile World Congress and
that's fairly typical for a company that
wants to capture as much attention as
possible the invite itself reveals no
clues about what to expect from the
phone with just a starry background and
a cryptic tagline saying utopia in
progress however a few rumors paint the
picture of a powerful Snapdragon 810
equipped device with a 5-inch screen and
a sleek metallic build pretty much will
we come to expect from HTC one's
flagship device I would hazard a guess
that it's going to be bigger than 5
inches can't wait to see it now we've
been receiving reports that the nexus 6
battery has been swelling multiple users
of the Nexus 6 around the web had been
reporting that the Nexus 6 is back is
coming unglued under further
investigation a reddit user experiencing
this problem checked under the back
cover to find that the battery was
expanding causing the cover to come
undone Motorola commented to a Twitter
user saying that they have been seeing a
few devices come unglued some users are
commenting that the battery is in fact
expanding over a few weeks time while
others are saying that they're noticing
it right away when they take the device
out of the box now I've talked to a
number of you Nexus 6 owners in the
comments let me know have you had this
problem at all have you seen any problem
with the battery or the cover I'd like
to hear about it who said the Chinese
only produce cheap devices chemise come
out with two premium options last week
Xiaomi unveiled its high-end me note and
me no pro devices packing in plenty of
quality hardware at quite reasonable
prices we can see here a closer look at
the me notes steel chassis port layouts
and a rather nice curved glass edge at
the back of the handset but Xiaomi has
released a second gallery to show off
its one-handed mode feature a piece of
software that is becoming increasingly
popular and larger smartphones shawnee's
single-handed option allows the user to
select between screen sizes of 4.5 4 or
3.5 inch modes
now you should know the xiaomi note is
not the successor to the Affordable
redmi note this device is a high-end
offering with a 5.7 inch full HD display
Gorilla Glass 3 a Snapdragon 801
processor 3 gigabytes of RAM a
13-megapixel rear-facing camera and a 4
megapixel front-facing camera it also
sports a three thousand million power
battery now the xiaomi me note pro which
features similar design and
specifications with the following
improvements a 64-bit Snapdragon 810
processor a quad HD display 4 gigabytes
of ram and a 64-bit storage option now
for those of you who know me from XDA
developers TV or how to become TV you'll
know that I interviewed countless number
of software developers and what became
painfully clear is that there is a huge
gap in the industry between people who
have the theory and education but lack
the practical expertise and that's where
our beloved sponsor Full Sail University
begins to bridge that gap offered on
campus this software development
bachelor's degree program teaches
programming fundamentals through
project-based coursework allowing
students to graduate with multiple
completed projects under their belt now
the mobile development bachelor's degree
program offers on campus and online
teaches students how to develop apps and
utilities through courses that cover
both iOS and Android development all
students have hands-on access to
technology from day one they receive a
laptop computer at an institutional
discount along with relevant software
and tools now for more info on Full Sail

edward army my name is Jace I'd love to
connect with you right here on Google+
or Twitter I read all my comments and at
replies I do respond to as many as I can
but I did want to answer a question that
I get most weeks about what music I use
in this show I use a lot of different
music but most of you are referring to a
composer named Android della her they
say Andrew damn it Andrew Del occur and
I have linked up his soundcloud page
below super talented guy I use all of
his stuff with premier
and I think most of you are particularly
fond of a piece he refers to as ipad
unbox magic I believe it was originally
composed for my good friend my fellow
torontonian at unbox therapy but I use
that with permission check out his stuff
please use it in your own work if you
like but do give the man credit he's
very very talented and he needs to make
a living by his beautiful work you don't
want to forget about the beautiful work
done by my brother's my brethren and
Android Josh Joe in the tech ninjas
Kevin Lonnie Chris Gary Nash all working
real hard to deliver the best android
content on the planet I should see you
all next week on android week
