might just be one of the most convenient
phones I have ever used where this phone
is incredibly convenient it is also
incredibly polarizing if you didn't
notice there's a full QWERTY keyboard
slotted into the front of this phone and
this is probably the most polarizing
part of this device this keyboard gives
this phone a lot of really convenient
features but I'm honestly still learning
how to type like this again now the keys
are 20% larger than they were on the
BlackBerry key1 and while that helps a
little bit you're gonna have to decide
if you're willing to fundamentally
change the way you type on your phone
but let's take it back to convenience
for a second now there are 35 keys on
this keyboard and almost every single
one of them is remappable this means
that you can set actions like launching
apps sending messages or a multitude of
other things that you would want to do
with a single tap you can also set
different actions for short presses and
long presses so you have over 50
different actions that you can do right
from the home screen all these actions
only previously worked from the home
screen in the BlackBerry key one
BlackBerry decided to add a new key
called the speed key which allows you to
use these actions from different apps
now I can jump from slack to Twitter to
whatever other app I want to just by
pressing the speed key and then the hot
key on the keyboard this is an
incredibly convenient and has pretty
much changed the way I work on my phone
the speak he also gives you the option
of using these actions if you're using a
custom launcher like Nova because that
didn't actually work before there's also
another remappable key on the side of
the phone called the convenience key
this key is really just made to be
remapped to whatever you want and I set
it to Google assistant because I really
liked the squeeze feature on the pixel
to this phone was essentially made for
multitasking but you're probably
wondering if it can actually hold up the
BlackBerry key one had a huge issue
where the three gigabytes of RAM wasn't
quite enough to multitask the way you
probably wanted to but
break u2 has been upgraded to six
gigabytes of RAM which is doing a lot
better on a daily basis this is paired
with a qualcomm snapdragon 616 processor
and 64 gigabytes of storage and while
those aren't the highest specs available
on the market right now it's still held
up pretty well oh and if you wanted more
storage than those 64 gigabytes this
phone does support expandable storage up
to 2 terabytes assuming you can find a
microSD card of that capacity all these
components are powered by a 3500
milliamp hour battery and that can lead
to some really serious battery life my
coworker Jimmy westenberg and I got
about 6 to 7 hours of screen on time out
of this phone and while that's not
exactly the 2 day battery life that
BlackBerry was touting it's still pretty
darn good for a smart phone the phone
can charge pretty quickly too it's using
Qualcomm quick charge 3.0 technology so
while it's not up to date with quick
charge for you actually get the option
of turning on boost mode when you plug
it in which limits background processes
to help it charge a little bit faster
overall I really like the size of this
phone the entire chassis is a little
under 6 inches which is pretty much the
size of most screens these days the
actual screen is only about 4.5 inches
though so you're probably gonna have to
get used to using a screen that small
also having that keyboard below the
screen does make it a little hard to
pull down the notification shade you can
actually remap the currency keys so it
pulls down the notification shade for
you the only time I really found the
screen size to be an issue was when I
was trying to watch a lot of content on
this phone especially since some of my
favorite content creators shoot in a
widescreen format it'll take a little
getting used to to start watching
content on a 4.5 inch screen instead of
a 6-inch one but that's the trade-off
you're gonna have to make if you want
that physical keyboard overall though
the image quality on this phone is
awesome is using a 16 20 by 1080 IPS
panel so it's not OLED like a lot of the
phones on the market right now but it
still looks really great colors are
bright and saturated and it's gonna seem
more like something you'd see on a
computer monitor rather than a phone now
this panel technology does have a few
trade-offs versus an OLED since I can't
individual pixels and it's going to use
a little more energy but LEDs are still
really expensive and the market is still
controlled by one or two manufacturers
speakers in the bottom of the phones
sound okay but they're really nothing
special in fact only one of these girls
in the bottom is actually a speaker and
that's kind of annoying since you can
cover them up pretty easily
blackberry did include a headphone jack
in the top of this phone though so you
can always wear some headphones if you
want to get a more stereo experience the
back of the phone is housing dual 12
megapixel sensors and I was really
surprised with the image quality of this
thing colors are bright and punchy in
the detail and dynamic range were
awesome secondary lens is a 2x telephoto
sensor too and I always love to see this
when there are dual cameras the sensor
is also used for portrait mode and it
actually ended up being really good it
was almost as good is the pixel twos and
it was definitely better than a lot of
the other flagships on the market right
now
unfortunately the low-light performance
of the camera on this phone is not so
good it seems to drop the shutter speed
pretty significantly when you're in a
low-light circumstance and that can lead
to some really blurry images so there
isn't any optical stabilization in these
lenses but blackberry says they're using
enhanced electronic image stabilization
to make your image a lot more stable I
decided to test this in the downtown
streets of San Francisco so I'm gonna
play a little clip and you can decide
for yourself whether or not it's good
enough
okay but in the end this is still a
phone and even more importantly this is
a blackberry so how does the qual
quality actually hold up on this thing I
tested this over a few days and I didn't
have any dropped calls and the call
quality seemed really good the biggest
issue that I had here had to do with the
proximity sensor whenever I was on a
call the proximity sensor didn't really
seem to realize that I was on a call and
my cheekbone kept hitting the mute
button during my conversation this led
to the other person thinking that I've
kept hanging up on them and this
happened multiple times every single
time I made a call this is a pretty big
issue and I know that a lot of people
use headphones when they're on calls but
I think that Blackberry probably needs
to fix this sooner rather than later the
buck Reiki 2 is running on Android 8.1
and their approach to software is really
simplistic it's basically just stock
Android with a few tweaks and a few
extra apps and I think these are all
really well thought out things like
blackberry hub allow you to access all
of your messages from pretty much every
messaging platform in one app and as
soon as you tap on it it'll open the app
and show you the message this up in
particular had a lot of issues on the
BlackBerry key one mostly due to that 3
gigabytes of RAM but I didn't really see
any lag here now the only thing that I
would worry about what the software is
updates the BlackBerry key one was
notorious for not getting that many
updates after it was released and I
really hope that TCL does a better job
to update this phone now a couple other
little things to know about this phone
but there's no wireless charging or
water resistance on this thing I don't
use wireless charging that much so it's
not that important to me but I know a
lot of people who do so just be aware of
that the BlackBerry key - is gonna run
you 649 dollars and I have some mixed
feelings about that price point that's
$100 more than the BlackBerry key one
was it launched and it's actually $20
more than the highest end of one plus 6
with a snapdragon 845 a gigabytes of RAM
and 256 gigabytes of storage at $549 I'd
probably recommend this phone to heavy
multitaskers pretty instantly where $100
more though it's a little hard to
automatically recommend this
I still really like this phone though
and I am considering picking it up
myself it's just for a really niche
subset of users so that's been the
BlackBerry key - if you have any
