by increasing clouds starting during the
evening well how nice of you to tell me
hey it's Josh magar from android
authority what's going on everybody and
as I put in the NOC code in order to
unlock the LG g3 here we are I wanted to
show you some of the new software
features that are here they all pretty
much start with the word smart you have
the smart notify which you saw in the
intro are ready you have also the smart
cleaner which I'll get to in to into a
little bit and then we have the smart
keyboard which is the one you're
probably going to use the most so we're
going to take a look at that first so
here is the LG keyboard you have some
pretty typical settings here already
path input is the one that I always turn
on now because the swiping method of
typing and all of these keyboards
happens to be pretty good already and
the LG keyboard is no exception but the
smart capabilities are found in this
setting right here which is the keyboard
height and layout so we'll go ahead and
jump into there and we have the bottom
row keys which is something that I've
already set up because I use a comma a
lot you just get this one button right
here and you get to drag it up and
select what symbol that button will be
made for specifically I do use the comma
a lot and I would rather not hold the
period button in order to create the
comma so there it is and then finally
what we have here is the keyboard
heights now the keyboard height is
something that is quite useful for
people who maybe want to swipe around
but having the keyboard very small
doesn't make it very ideal having it
very large it does make it more ideal
but it does take up a lot of the screen
real estate and it might not be
something that you want to use all the
time so I kind of put it somewhere in
the middle and then from there I should
be able to type quite easily
easily there you go so that makes it
pretty pretty simple you'll be able to
change it and really cater it to what
you want so that does it there and I did
change the keyboard theme to black from
white that's what the white keyboard
looks like this is the black keyboard
you do have the one-handed operation
right here that we've shown before where
you can have the keyboard on one side of
the screen or on the other side of the
screen to make it easier but when you
already have the keyboard height honest
well enough on a screen just like this
that is actually easy to reach from one
side to the other I think you would be
all right without having to use that one
handed operation too often so here we
are in the general area let me just give
you a quick look around the settings
menu and here is the smart cleaning if
you click on that it will start to scan
the phone for any temporary files or any
downloaded files that that it thinks you
should be able to delete without really
changing a whole lot about the
experience this third one down here the
idle apps well I've only had the phone
for a little while now so obviously the
idle apps is not something that's going
to come up fairly often at the moment
it's only when I have a lot of different
applications that i haven't used and
let's say over a month or so but as you
can see here i can already free up
almost half a gigabyte of of storage
here if i were to clean up the temporary
files so if i were to tap below to clean
that space i could click here and it
will start computing the various types
of files that are there and here we are
the apps cash is where a lot of it is so
if i wanted to clean it up that would
take away the cash you might make some
of the applications have to load those
with those specific items again but
ultimately we would save a little bit of
space and maybe if you have google play
music and you want to put more music on
here rather than having to stream it's
then that might help you out a little
bit now one thing about the idol lab see
idle for one month one thing about the
idol apps that i will say is if you
happen to have bloatware on your version
of the LG g3 like for example i have all
of these korean applications right here
chances are the app idle area is not
going to tell you that you need to
uninstall those because well for all
intents and purposes they need to stay
there so that might be one little
downside of the of the smart cleaning
and that it's not going to really show
you a way of let's say we're moving the
bloatware because obviously that stuff
has to quote unquote
main in there and now finally we have
the smarts notify or the smart notice as
it is called in the widgets area which
I'll show you real quick and yes it is
just a widget it's not necessarily a bar
that shows up anywhere it's just a smart
notice widgets and you can't have it set
up so that the card show up in your
notification panel but for the most part
it's a widget if you don't happen to use
widgets a whole lot on your home screens
this might not be very useful for you
because you prefer a cleaner look but at
least the smart notice is not a very
intrusive looking application it does
take up that part of the grid it goes
right over to the bezel so it does look
pretty utilitarian in its function and
it also in its design so ultimately what
the smart notice is it's you'll get a
bunch of cards that come down if if
there was more than one card but most of
the time we're only gonna have one
notification and it will most likely
have to do with the weather and here's
the reason why if I go into the settings
of the wedges you can make the card show
up in your notification drop-down but
here are the different notifications you
get you do get a few people ones like
for example you get a number from you
get a call from a number that is not in
your phonebook a bunch of times it will
tell you do you want to add that person
to your phonebook if you have a missed
call it will show you a call back
reminder on there and show a button for
you to be able to press immediately in
order to call them back and then finally
you have birthday notifications which is
the one I never see I've had quite a few
friends and the past week or so have
birthdays but I've never got a
notification about it these are the ones
that you're going to see more often than
not the weather alerts are the ones that
you'll see pretty much all the time
especially since you have that weather
application right on the top left of
that widget and we'll just give you in a
nicely worded fashion just a little bit
of a hint or a rather tip according to
whatever the weather will be that maybe
you should bring a sweater because of
weather is going to change or an
umbrella because it's going to rain and
then after that when your battery gets
down to let's say about thirty percent
you'll see the battery saver now the
battery saver will pretty much just tell
you that your battery is getting low so
make sure you need to turn on be it you
need to make sure to turn on the power
saving mode it only comes up with a
certain number of notifications they
might not all be very useful what I do
hope is like Google now which didn't
really start off with a whole lot of
functionality and then eventually grew
into what it is now that the smart
notify will grow into
a little bit more robust and will be
more than just a nicely worded way of
telling you what the weather is keep it

having a great time with and after that
