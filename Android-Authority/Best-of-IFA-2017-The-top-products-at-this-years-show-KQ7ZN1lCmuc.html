a tee for 2017 and you know what that
means it's time for the Android
Authority best Aviva Awards these are
the five biggest products and
technologies to come out of Europe's
largest tech show the LGV 30 was the
unchallenged star of the show and pretty
much the only thing anyone could talk
about in part because the phone will be
shipping globally for the first time the
V 30 looks great on paper and in the
hand with the expectations build up with
various leaks very much translating into
real world experience
Samsung will still ship a truckload more
notates than LG ever will that the V 30
looks to be the most competitive device
that company has ever made as with
previous phones in the V Series a
premium audio experience is baked into
the V 30s DNA with the quad duct
shipping on global units rather than
only for select markets and the super
fund dual camera photography experience
also makes a comeback like the g6 before
it the V 30 goes for a full-screen
display with a characteristic second
screen falling by the wayside to make
room for it but there's now a new
always-on display toggle bar that does
much the same thing be sure to stay
tuned for android authorities full
review which will be coming in the near
future
Sony's smartphone range gains another
couple of flagship devices but also
brings back the popular compact range of
more pocketable devices that pack
flagship levels of power the best
feature on the new xperia x said one and
X said one compact is undoubtedly the
3-d Creator as Sony's camera team have
been able to create an awesome 3d
scanning app using just typical
smartphone components 3d creator lets
you scan someone's face or head or any
other object and turn it into a high
quality 3d avatar with incredible levels
of detail but now you can use it with
some of the preloaded AR apps on Sony's
new devices but you'll soon be able to
upload it as a gaming avatar or even 3d
printed if you want to should you buy
these devices just for that feature
probably not but if you already like
Sony's phones that 3d avatars could be
the icing on the cake while some might
consider 3d creator a bit of a gimmick
the amount of fun it is and the range of
applications that enables means it'll
have a very bright future to keep an eye
out for it where there was once just
Google home there is now a Google
assistant powered speaker by Sony called
the LFS 50 G we're hoping that will
change in time but seeing as Google
assistant is on board you'll obviously
be able to use it for all the same
things you would otherwise use a Google
home for but sony is packed in a few
need features of its own and gestures
for controlling the speaker and IP
x3 splash-resistant certification and
the clock on the side add a little more
functionality to what Google Offers but
these come at a slightly higher price
than homes one hundred and twenty nine
dollar price tag the Sony speaker will
set you back two hundred dollars when it
goes on sale in October but whether you
think it's worth the extra cash or not
at least you now have more options and
another worthy competitor to Amazon's
army of Alexis speakers more and more
smartphones are dropping the headphone
jack so to avoid joining the dongle life
more and more people are turning to
wireless audio in spite of what the
audiophile say Bluetooth audio is plenty
good enough for most people but what if
there was a way to make it better
French startup tempo is pushing the
limits of what can be done inside the
Bluetooth protocol and on the Moto X 4
we got to check out its creation
Bluetooth wireless surround system
bluetooth connections normally let you
stream audio to a maximum of two devices
at once that tempo uses software to
agree to let you stream up to four
devices you can control the volume and
the balance between left and right on
each individual channel and there's no
limitations in terms of device type or
brand whether it's a party amongst
friends or to power your own mobile
disco tempo makes it possible and
although limited to the Moto X fourth
and now it's set to come to other
devices in the near future for the first
time at fo Huawei presented a keynote
and what a keynote it was announcing the
Karen 917 chipset that will arrive in
the mate 10m 810 Pro in October the even
bigger deal was the neural processing
unit the 970 comes with while a lot of
other companies have relied on the cloud
for AI while we wants to keep that
processing on device while we'll have to
wait a little longer to experience
secure 970 s full potential in the flesh
while we had some pretty impressive
numbers to share on stage the biggest
deal about your next smartphone having a
dedicated on device aoi processing unit
is that it will be able to process
demanding tasks much faster and with
even greater efficiency you can read an
excellent primer on the cure 970 by gary
sims at android authority comm for more
stats and figures but the huawei mate n
has just become a whole lot more
interesting with the announcement of the
karin 970 and we can't wait to see why
ways NPU in action so that's it from the
