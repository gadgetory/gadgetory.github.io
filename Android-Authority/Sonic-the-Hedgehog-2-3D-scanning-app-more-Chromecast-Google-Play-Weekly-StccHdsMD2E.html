handy the Android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly in
this week's episode we're to talk about
some big app updates a huge chromecast
update so Google Play Store changes and
a lot more so let's get started
google has updated their venerable gmail
application to version 4.7 and with it
came some new features included is auto
responses printing capabilities and the
ability to attach pretty much any kind
of file you want to an email
unfortunately the printing feature is
available only to people who have a
device running KitKat the auto responder
is nifty if you're on vacation on a
break at work or just busy and can't
respond to emails the best new feature
though is the file types you can now
send virtually any type of file you want
as an attachment
and lastly memory consumption is now
improved thanks to projects felt the
long-awaited updates and Nova Launcher
is now finally available we've been
talking about it for weeks so most
people should probably know the features
by now if you use it you should have
gotten the update by now and if you want
it you can find it in the Google Play
Store this update is pretty much
bringing Kit Kat goodness to Nova
Launcher you'll get things like the font
the folders the scroll indicator the
icon pack and a number of other smaller
theme elements it also gives you the
ability to backup and restore your
settings using your external sd card if
you have one it should work on any
device running Android 4.0 and up people
have been waiting for chromecast to get
more useful and this week it has in this
man with update chromecast can now be
used by VEVO songs a real player cloud
and yes even Plex it is a huge update
and we've no doubt its proximity to
Christmas is entirely intentional
because with this latest batch of apps
the $35 chromecast is looking like a
better purchase than ever
obviously the biggest update here is
Plex but beware you'll have to pay a
little extra to get Plex to cast from
your Android device you can do a lot of
things with Android and soon we'll be
able to add 3d scanning to that list an
application is in development right now
that gives you crazy accurate 3d scans
without a lot of work it's not the first
app that allows for 3d scanning but even
in its alpha stage it's the most
impressive it processes everything in
real time right there on the device
which will be a first in the Android
ecosystem from there you can take a look
at the 3d scan or send it off to a 3d
printer or 3d printing service to have a
reproduction made so far no release date
has been announced last week Google Play
was updated to include an in-app
purchases indicator along with improved
social integration this means
a lot of things but the one that most
people will care about is the in-app
purchase indicator it's still rolling
out so many people don't have it just
yet while the features are simple they
provide a much greater insight not only
into what kind of apps you'd like but
what the apps themselves offer the
in-app purchase indicator is obviously
the biggest improvement people who don't
like freemium games for whatever reason
can now avoid them so who wants to see
some trending applications as usual if
you want to check any of these apps out
you can find the links in the written
companion in the video description first
on our list this week is Angry Birds go
we reviewed this app a couple of days
ago and found out that if you can get
past the obnoxious in-app purchases that
the game itself is actually pretty good
there have been some early jitters like
device compatibility issues but
otherwise it's a fresh face and an
otherwise stagnant Angry Birds lineup
the Android device manager has finally
made its way to the Google Play Store
with it you can see where your device is
and remotely wipe it if anything goes
wrong if you do use this app it's highly
recommended to use a lock screen
password because otherwise whoever
steals your device can remotely wipe all
of your Android devices cover is a lock
screen replacement and it's quite
possibly one of the best ones out there
it's fluid and beautiful with a number
of interesting and useful features it
was just released after a long stay in
the invite-only zone and it's free to
try so if you're bored with your
lockscreen we think you should give this
one a try
Sega re-released the original Sonic game
a while back to rave reviews and that's
likely going to continue with the
release of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 in this
remake you'll be able to play all the
levels you remember as a kid you can
play a sonic tails or Knuckles and there
are even new levels and bosses you can
even play the lost hidden palace zone
levels for the first time it's
definitely worth the $2.99 when dave
frame launched its free edition we found
it to be the best application of its
kind and dave frame prime makes it even
better it extends the functionality with
a number of new features including
custom playlists a variety of
customizable timers getting weather
conditions and soon it'll even support
syncing between devices it's $4.99
regularly but it's on sale for 99 cents
right now for a short time once again
