my name is Jason this is where we answer
your most pressing Android questions
this week we cover things like what are
the most sexy exciting new phones to
come out in 2014 and of course why oh
why are even some Nexus devices being
delayed with their kick-out updates I
thought we just go to the source and ask
Google ok Google what is going on with
Nexus devices and their kick-out updates
Google you still in there yes what's
going on we prefer Josh you prefer
Jewish so rad top let's talk about
KitKat update specifically Nexus updates
I know that many of you liked the video
we did about why Android updates take so
long but many of you said that still
doesn't explain while Nexus devices are
still receiving a delayed update so
there's two things one is that they
often come in geographical stages so
just because you live in Poland for
example and you've heard people in
Canada receiving updates that doesn't
mean necessarily you're going to receive
updates right away there's providers and
networks to deal with and therefore they
come in geographic stay just keep that
in mind and be patient but the second
thing is that and this is a rumor it's
an unverified rumor from not from google
directly but we heard from developer and
android developer named al sutton that
there was potentially a critical bug
release that had to do with encryption
and could have left encrypted devices
unencrypted abul if the user entered the
wrong password after an update and he
argued that it appears that google
wanted to fix this serious problem
before rolling out the kick-out update
specifically with the nexus 4 hence the
unusual delay so I think that has
something to do with it next question
came in was why is it that manufacturers
just don't all use stock Android good
question it really comes down to one
simple question why should i buy one
device over another why should i buy a
samsung s5 that's coming out over you
know the HTC m
aight these OEMs want to add value to
the user experience as value to the
device to distinguish themselves from
their competitors now some might say
well you can distinguish yourself by
just having vanilla android it doesn't
really work that way that might be true
from an Android enthusiasts perspective
but from the men of manufacturers
perspective they want to add value to
that device to distinguish themselves
among all the rest what are some of the
best android phones coming out in 2014
well there's a lot but i wanted to talk
about to today and one is the successor
to the HTC One codename now the HTC m8
it's supposedly it's a rumor right now
no official confirmation that it will
pack a 5 or 5.2 inch screen and RAM of
three gigs the phone reportedly boasts a
2k resolution of 2048 x 1080 and a
qualcomm snapdragon 2.2 800 processor
apparently powers the handset and of
course many people are looking forward
to the Samsung s5 it is believed that it
will be a 5-inch flexible display 2k HD
Super AMOLED display 2560 x 1440
resolution and 587 PPI and is expected
to have a flexible chasis up to 30
degrees 64-bit octa-core processor at
least three gigs of ram a 16 megapixel
camera with 4k capture support quad
front-facing speakers with s Beats Audio
technology a 4000 milliamp hour battery
that is going to be fantastic and of
course Android 4.4 KitKat with next-gen
TouchWiz on top next question came for
Bruno where I asked about the best
stylist pressure-sensitive stylus for
Android devices so Bruna i did some
research on this for you and i found
that you know great reviews about the
incipio and griffin technology but they
aren't specifically pressure-sensitive
the griffin one got great reviews said
it was highly sensitive but it didn't
specify that it was pressure-sensitive
is a bit coy about it but there's two
articles I wanted to check out one from
android authority that goes into the
s-pen in detail of course that is
pressure sensitive it means of course
you have to buy a new tablet if you
don't already have one but the second
one was about the ex
z ultra and this will is compatible with
any pen or pencil that conduct that can
conduct electricity you can use it then
as a stylist I thought that was really
cool so the last question comes from
Alicia giggly and licia said how do i
fix my cracked screen tablet I'm sorry
to pass on some bad news do you Alicia
but we found that you know we bought
this brought 209 when it first came out
and to replace it after labor and parts
it would be about 150 bucks before taxes
ouch so what I can remember and it's
very it's an otter shell for those of
you who know the otter stuff you put the
phone in the shell and then this is
encased in another case that goes into
your belt loop very geeky I don't use
the belt loop anymore but this shell has
been fantastic i've dropped my note
several times even face down and on the
corners and hasn't been a problem
there's nice reinforced corners right
there you can't really see that very
well but now here is the key on this on
this case there is a bevel that comes
around the side it's very small but it
is enough that if it were to drop right
on the screen side flat down the weight
most of the way it would be bared by the
edge of the bevel not the screen display
itself and I think that's the reason why
I've dropped this numerous times that it
hasn't cracked so get a proper you know
shelled case like that and I think it
will do here really well for the next
time good luck Alicia thanks Android
