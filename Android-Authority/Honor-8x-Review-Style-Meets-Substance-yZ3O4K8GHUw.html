or at least that's what it seems like
lately this is a company that is
incredibly prolific putting out phones
the left right and center the honor ax
though is still a very interesting
device it's another device from the
company that manages to offer impressive
looking specs on paper at a relatively
low price normally when reviewing a
device like this I'd run through the
features and the specs and tell you what
was there what wasn't what was good and
what was bad however a few people in the
comments have said that when it's a very
cheap device it just sounds like I'm
complaining so in this video I'm gonna
try something a little bit different
this time I'm gonna run through all the
specs and the features and then we're
gonna say if what you're getting is good
value or bad value or just average given
the price tag of the honor 8x so let's
see how that goes
ok so first up is the screen and this is
a fantastic screen given the price so
it's a full HD IPS LCD display nothing
to write home about there but what's
impressive is the size this is a six
point five inch display is a nineteen
point five by nine aspect ratio and it's
got very thin bezels with an 84 point
four percent screen to body ratio so
what you're getting here is really a
phablet territory it's a really big
display that's fantastic if you like
reading Kindle on there or Marvel Comics
or watching YouTube or Netflix this is a
great screen and I'd say one of the big
selling points of this device if you
want a big screen and you don't have the
cash for say a note or a galaxy s 9 plus
then it is a great alternative next up
is the design and this is also really
impressive actually
it is a aluminium and glass body I
misreported that in the real me to pro
review I'm very sorry I misread some of
the materials that I'd been provided
with this time it really is glass and it
looks the part
it feels the part in fact I'd say
there's nothing of
out this device that would give away the
fact that it isn't significantly more
expensive it feels weighty and cool in
the hand it's nicely curved and of
course it's got that reflective back
panel that honor is really known for I
love my red model it really stands out
without being ostentatious slim bezels
are just the icing on the cake to
present a overall fantastic looking and
feeling device the performance this is
smack bang in the middle average what
you'd expect for the price I can't test
the performance in the ways I normally
would by using benchmark apps because
I'm unable to download and install them
and to to geek bench they just won't
install you might have heard recently
that Huawei and honor have caught some
flak for trying to trick benchmark apps
and fake their scores making their
devices look faster than they really are
their defense for this was just well
everyone does it but that's a little bit
tenuous and it certainly leaves a bit of
a bad taste in the mouth I don't know
what's going on here either the apps and
no longer letting Huawei and honor
phones download and use them or worse
while we are honor preventing us from
downloading benchmark apps at all now so
we can't test how fast our devices are
fortunately I can tell you that the
ki-rin 7 10 SOC that's in here is going
to perform roughly equivalent to a
Snapdragon 660 probably just below that
so don't expect top of the range
performance here occasionally I noticed
the odd stutter the odd pause and then
animation when going through the UI
nothing major but it is occasionally
there in terms of gaming you're relying
on a Marley G 51 GPU and it's perfectly
adequate for playing pretty much all
games on the Play Store but it is a mid
to lower end GPU so expect to see a few
dropped frames if you have it on the
higher graphical settings but like I say
for most people that's not a problem
this is no beast a gaming phone and
don't even get me started on GPU turbo
that only affects the couple of games
like pub G that it's optimized for and
even then you're seeing slightly
increased framerate stability
barely noticeable GPU turbo is a bit of
a marketing gimmick battery performance
is very good for the price this has a
three thousand seven hundred and fifty
mili amp hour battery which is a large
enough in its own right but if you
combine that with the energy-efficient
Kirin seven
si si you have a device that lasts a
very long time in spite of that large
screen okay but what's arguably bad even
at this price is microUSB yes we saw on
the real me to pro but I didn't like it
there either in 2018 this just makes no
sense other OEMs are managing to give us
USB type-c for a low price and even the
honor eight had USB type-c so this is
just barmy
to me is it big deal probably not for a
lot of people after all it's gonna do is
slow down your transfer speeds a little
bit and your charging times however it
does make your device less future-proof
it does mean you're potentially gonna
have to carry extra leads around with
you and it's just backwards facing and
it's really a bit of a Mar and what
otherwise a very forwards facing design
software wise I'm going to say this is
average again you get Android 8.1 with
EMU I on top if you've used an honor or
a while wait device before then you know
what to expect I'm not a huge fan of
some of the aesthetic decisions here but
most of those you can cover up with a
custom launcher anyways it does in my
opinion maybe slow things down a little
bit maybe performance would be slightly
better if it was stock Android but again
it's not a big issue a lot of people
like in UI so average we do have NFC
which you don't always get on devices
for this price point that of course
means you can use contactless payment
apps etc that's gonna be very welcome
for a lot of people also we have a
headphone jack good also dual SIM good
knotch
some people like it some people don't at
least you can turn it off in the
settings if you're in the latter camp IP
rating that is none to be expected
camera are so you see this is the
problem we're trying to put everything
into neat little boxes the camera has
pros and cons and for some people it
will be a plus and for some people it
will be a minus so on the plus side this
has a good megapixel count the rear
shooter is 20 megapixels backed up by a
two megapixel depth sensor so this will
bring out a fair amount of detail of
course the music indeed bouquet and
portrait mode etc low-light performance
isn't fantastic however and there's no
optical stabilization but then you would
expect that and of course you've got all
that AI scene recognition layered on top
now this is a little bit of a
tenshun because AI scene recognition is
very hit and miss sometimes occasionally
I think it does enhance a photo but
other times I think it just ups the
saturation to the point where things
look actually fake and absurd a lot of
the time you'll do better to just turn
off the AI mode I always say with honour
and Huawei cameras that they're really
good if you put the work in but if you
don't they can occasionally come out
looking a bit like I say oversaturated
of the AI mode even with AI mode off
there occasionally a bit warm around the
front you get a 16 megapixel selfie
camera and I think that's actually
pretty generous I do like to have a
decent front-facing camera you can do
portrait mode from both sides and
normally I actually find that on our
phones are among the best when it comes
to the portrait mode but where this new
SOC or what are they no I haven't found
that to be quite the case here so that's
the honor 8x and I've listed off all the
things that are good and bad an average
and I'd say that on the whole there's
more good here than bad as a great
design ring big punchy screen a fairly
average performance in a fairly average
camera as I've said lately there's so
much to choose from in the mid and lower
range at the moment this is a fantastic
time to buy an Android phone for a
little bit less cash and that means you
have the luxury of bail to pick and
choose the features that really matter
to you the owner a text is fantastic for
people who like consuming media on their
device you don't have a huge budget and
who are happy to play around with a
camera that isn't always fantastic the
big downside is the microUSB but that's
probably not going to be a deal-breaker
for a lot of people if it is then
there's plenty else out there to choose
from I hope you found this video useful
interesting guys if you did then please
leave a like please share it around that
really helps us out let me know in the
comments down below what you think of
the honor 8x is it a good option for you
how big of an issue is microUSB what do
you think of the design and the screen
do you like it and of course hit
