authority what's going on everybody and
every photo and video that you're seeing
in this camera versus shootout was taken
on the cameras of the LG g4 and the
Samsung Galaxy s6 edge now we're going
to start off this camera versus shootout
with some self-portraits now in these
selfies it's obvious that the g4 does
tend to overexpose some of the photos
some parts of the photos rather and also
its field of view is a little bit more
narrow the s6 has a somewhat wider angle
but also it's benefits from the wide
selfie mode in which you can use a
panoramic motion in order to get more
people into your shot the g4 does have
those gestures in order to make taking
pictures a little bit more fun but the
main useful one is bringing the phone
down to a viewing angle in order to see
the portrait you just took but now we're
in a casino somewhat lower life
situations in which the g4 is still over
exposing a little too much when there's
a prominent light source on the subject
in lower light shots it will tend to be
more blown out and there's no better
situation to test this out in than a
concert with all of the band members and
everybody being on the stage very very
lit up associated with spot metering
even with spot metering if you're
tapping on the subject you're probably
not going to get a shot that's really
nice to look at and that is when the pro
modes come in taking the pro mode from
the s6 there aren't really that many
settings to manipulate but you can bring
the exposure compensation slider down to
negative 2 for example and you'll get a
somewhat better shot but the g4 was
better at exposing properly despite the
fact that with the higher and faster
shutter speed ISO had to compensate for
and thus there's a lot of grain all over
the place here and with that you can
really take your pick between these two
either you want a photo that's a little
bit overexposed in the s6 or you can get
a somewhat better looking photo in color
and exposure in the g4 that has a lot of
grain
now you're probably noticed already in
those last two videos that when you hit
the record button on either of these
phones the video goes back to the auto
exposure settings it's kind of a bummer
that the manual settings don't do
anything to the video content but now
we're in the Anaheim packing district
where the welded photos will really show
us the kinds of details we can get with
these photos now both cameras do a
really great job with the galaxy s6 as
you should come as no surprise to
everybody
it really does over saturate a little
bit and in some situations it means that
there are deeper blacks a little bit
more contrast but really that punch in
the colors it's a little bit much but a
lot of people do tend to like those and
in the case of the g4 it gets a more
accurate photo because of the color
spectrum sensor but this photo was one
of those rare occasions when the g4
actually saturated the photo a little
bit more than the s6 again very rare
instance but it did happen here but like
I mentioned already the color spectrum
sensor does help the g4 provide a more
accurate photo a bit more drawn back
than the over saturation of the s6 so
you really just have to take your pick
here the g4 will allow you to manipulate
the photo a little bit better using the
manual mode and then of course you can
capture in RAW simultaneously so you can
use the raw capture photo in a program
like Lightroom in order to make it look
the way you really want it to if the
auto photos aren't really your style but
while you guys are enjoying a few more
pictures here between the two and you're
making your own comparisons of course I
do have one remark to say about the
picture-taking experience itself the s6
did introduce a new shortcut in double
tapping the home button to quickly bring
up the camera and you can start shooting
right away but the g4 also has its own
shortcut as well double tapping the
volume down button now the problem is
when you do that the camera comes up and
tries to take a photo now if you haven't
framed the scene in your viewfinder
correctly or if there's just nothing to
take at the time it will take a couple
of seconds to focus on basically nothing
and then once it takes that photo that
extra time is wasted until you're
actually able to manipulate the camera
to get your shot it just makes a g4 that
little bit slower and going from the
prone position to actually taking photos
now here's a video of me walking around
and just a bit of a behind-the-scenes
take on this I put both phones on a rig
on a rail so that they were the same
ecwid distance away from any subject and
then I picked it up and started walking
around with it now this is an OS test
and the larger sensor with the much more
enhanced OS of the g4 really does a
great job here you can see on the left
side with the s6 that it's still a
little bit wobbly meanwhile the g4 does
a great job of minimizing that when in
comparison so that's a really big
feather in the cap of the g4 while the
s6 might somewhat over saturate and the
g4 might somewhat over expose when it
comes to details I do think that both of
these cameras do a really great job it's
only one you really zoom into the photos
that you might find some disparities and
really it's not even that big in this
particular photo you can see that some
post-processing is detracting from the
overall sharpness of the g4 photo and
like I said it really only happens when
you really zoom in if you take the
photos the way that they are both of
them look really great it's just a
matter of which one looks better to you
and that's the reason why despite these
100 crops I wanted to show you some very
concrete examples of a horizontal view
rather than these close-up side-by-sides
in order for you to actually see you
know at a first glance which one looks
better to you and honestly I could take
either one of these photos and either
one of these cameras and probably still
be happy with what comes out definitely
good for social media no matter what but
we do have some very concrete examples
of the color in these video shots I went
ahead and hit record on both of them and
put them on the rig and it's obvious
that in these videos the left side the
s6 definitely punches out its colors a
lot but the thing is the g4 colors are
far from bland and they still look
really nice it's just that the s6 kind
of over achieves and if it's a little
bit too gross of a punch for you guys
then of course the s6 is probably not
the one you want
all right so we covered a lot of ground
in this video a lot of photos and videos
but as I usually do for these camera
shoot outs I want to end with some
foodie pictures so especially for you
Instagram foodies out there and I know
there's a lot of you you can see which
of these phones will be best suited for
your needs
I do think both cameras are really great
and I can't emphasize that enough we've
come to a point in Android where the
cameras are really getting really good
and they are probably able to replace
the typical small point-and-shoot
cameras that people tend to have along
with their phones and that's a great
notion and hopefully it only get better
for more phones in this upcoming year
but nonetheless keep it tuned here to
Android a thority and thank you guys so
much for watching this camera versus
shootout make sure you drop us some
likes on our videos and subscribe to our
channel if you haven't already and if
you haven't noticed by now I went ahead
and put the annotations over both halves
of this video so you can check out the
full reviews for the Samsung Galaxy s6
and of course the s6 edge by lon and
then over on the right you can see the
full review of the LG g4 make sure you
guys do that so you can really find out
which of these phones is better for you
as the g4 was just released to all the
major carriers here in the state so I'm
sure a lot of you guys are really trying
to scrutinize between these two phones
and I hope this one helps you guys out
once you're done with all of that you
can listen to the FDP every single week
and then head on over to android
authority comm because we are your
