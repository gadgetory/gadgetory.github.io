seems like a pretty typical phone it is
a little bit larger at 5.5 inches it has
a good build quality it does provide
expandable storage and a removable
battery and its operating system though
maybe not everybody out there likes it
is ultimately pretty functional but
there is one trump card in the fine
sevens bag of tricks that really sets it
apart and that's what I wanted to show
you and it's called luke fast charging
so it's Josh reguar from Android 30
what's going on everybody and here is
your Opel find 7a feature focus on the
fast charging and so without any further
ado here is the VUCA charger that comes
with the Oppo find 7 and 7a in my case
it's the flying 7a now it does look a
little familiar it looks a little bit
like a macbook charger in that you have
the brick over on the power side with
the integrated wall plug so it's nice
and neat there you go so not too
intrusive and aside from that when you
snake along the actual cord itself you
get the micro USB connector on the other
side now there is a change inside of the
connector and it's not that blue color
that you're seeing right now if you
count there are actually seven pins in
there not to the usual five that you
typically find in a microUSB cable now
those two extra pins do allow for more
channeling of power into the device
itself from your source of power but
that is only part of the magic that is
the vogue fast charging now before I get
into this particular part let me just
explain that typically smartphones and
tablets have an amp rating in terms of
their Chargers of around maybe one to
two amps they are only able to receive
that maximum so sometimes you might get
a particular charger that outputs the
maximum before but it really own it
really never really goes over two amps
in this case however the Oppo find 7 a
and v 7 of course are able to receive a
much higher current of power and the
charger the book charger itself as you
can see right underneath the wall plug
says that it can output 4.5 amps so
you're getting more than double the amp
Ã¤j--
when it comes to the Oppo find 7
compared to tablets and even more when
you compare it to typical smartphones so
just that massive current of power is
going from your source of power into the
device and is providing a huge boost
when it comes to the charging times now
there are some pitfalls when it comes to
using the volkl charger here and well
here let me just demonstrate how the
cord is actually pretty short actually
it's not that long by any stretch of the
imagination now of course this charger
will not fit in most other pretty much
all other smartphones because it has
those two actually has those two extra
pins but the other way around is
actually true in terms of you can use
any microUSB charger to charge the Oppo
find 7 and 7a so in that regard you
should be able to charge it no matter
where you are but if you want the fast
charging which I'm about to demonstrate
in a little bit
you need the proprietary charger so kind
of cutting to the chase a little bit
let's just say this the fast charging
works it is the Opel fine sevens
probably best feature in my opinion and
it's one of the things that I've really
come to rely upon in my daily usage of
the phone and the fast charging again it
really works but I it doesn't really
mean much for me to just say it were
excited to demonstrate it for you
obviously but I thought I would do so by
giving you a real-world kind of almost
everyday scenario so it happens to the
best of us and I think for everyone it's
happened at least once where you already
tucked into bed you're probably looking
at Facebook or you're playing some games
on your phone or maybe you're texting a
cute girl or something but then you fall
asleep and you wake up realizing that
you did not plug in your phone into your
wall charger well a lot of the times
with typical smart phones you might look
at this and think oh I can charge it for
like a little bit of time but I'm not
gonna have enough power to get through
my day well in the case of the Luc fast
charging of the Oppo find 7 a that I
have
well half an hour as is being marketed
will get you from 0 to 75 percent and
that is already pretty incredible but
imagine in under an hour you will be
able to get a full charge on your phone
so plug in the phone as I usually do in
the morning and then go ahead and go
about your morning routine go grab a
bite to eat make yourself some breakfast
take a shower or you know
go ahead and get dressed and get ready
for well it could be a long workday in
which you really need your phone and
after let's say 45 minutes let's say is
a standard ish routine you'll come back
unplug the phone and find that it in at
least in my case as you're seeing here
was charged already to 90% now that's
really incredible the fact that you can
just plug in the phone forget about it
for a short amount of time and then be
able to come back to it and have all the
power that you need that's just a great
great feature of the Oppo find 7 and 7
day I think that is a great idea for
other manufacturers to sort of take on
this model to be honest imagine if you
had a proprietary charger that came with
every phone yes it might up the cost a
little bit but imagine what the benefits
would be because if you have the
proprietary charger you can charge your
phone just like that and of course if
you didn't bring the proprietary charger
with you you can always charge the phone
in a more conventional sense using any
other micro USB charging apparatus so
just a little bit of food for thought
there because battery is always an issue
when it comes to pretty much any
smartphone out there for many users who
are let's say power users and really
want the most out of their smart phones
so keep it tuned to Android authority
for all the best coverage of the Opel
find 7a in this case my full review is
on coming it will be here pretty soon
I'm just going through the future focus
video so you can really see some of the
best features of this phone and what I
think of them in this case the fast
charging is something I've really come
to rely upon and I think that you would
too if you were able to get your hands
on this phone so keep it in - and row 30
for all of the best hit that like button
hit that subscribe button and then hit
up Android authority comm when you're
done with all of that because we are
