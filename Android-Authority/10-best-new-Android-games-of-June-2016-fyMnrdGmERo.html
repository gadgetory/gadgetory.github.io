handy from Android Authority comm and
it's about that time to round up the
best new Android games from the last
month where there's a tale of two sons
is a touching platformer adventure game
where you must use two brothers in
tandem to overcome obstacles and find
the water of life to save your ailing
father
it features decent graphics unique
controls and various puzzles that you
must overcome the key dynamic is using
both brothers simultaneously in order to
solve puzzles and progress forward in
the story it's not overly long but it's
pretty good and it has no in-app
purchases Heroes of Light 2 is a hack
and slash dungeon crawler where you must
explore a castle slay some bad guys and
potentially even save a damsel in
distress you'll get to pick between two
characters from a set of four to take on
your quest and each one has different
strengths and weaknesses the game has
tons of quests magic for you to unlock
and even some charming retro graphics to
boots the cost may seem high for what it
is but there are a ton of things to do
and there are no in-app purchases white
flying whiteout is a text-based
adventure game where you must help guide
a man to safety the core premise is that
there is a man named Adams who has lost
in some Arctic wasteland somewhere and
his only link to the outside world is
you you were to guide him through the
various trials and tribulations in order
to help him figure out what happened who
he is and what's going on
it features rich notifications so you
can play without opening the app and it
has Android wear support as well Mikkel
Rama is a puzzle gamer you must use
various angles and movements to solve
puzzles and progress to the next level
it's not quite as intricate as something
like Monument Valley but it's a fairly
relaxing title that's perfect if you
have a few minutes to kill the graphics
are simple as are the controls and you
should have no problem jumping right in
the game is completely free to play
forever with the in-app purchases being
for optional donations if you choose to
reward the developer for their efforts
never alone Chi Edition is actually a
port of a game that was released on the
Nvidia shield console earlier this year
this touchscreen enabled version is much
like the original where you play as a
young girl and her pet Fox in order to
outsmart enemies solve puzzles and move
through levels it builds itself as an
atmospheric puzzle platformer which is
about as accurate of a description as
you can get
it has decent graphics fun mechanics and
a touching story line it also has no
in-app purchases rodeo Stampede is a
freemium infinite runner game where you
must lasso animals and jump between them
in order to progress through the game
it's made by the same company that did
cross erode and you'll see the
similarities in both gameplay and
graphics during your adventures you'll
befriend animals which are then
displayed in a digital zoo for other
players to view and there you can get
extra rewards based on how good your zoo
is it's free to play with in-app
purchases and not a bad way to kill some
time goat simulator is back with yet
another ridiculous game that simulates
the actual life of a real goat or
something like that this game features
most of the same gameplay elements from
prior games except for this one allows
you to actually build a space colony for
you to rampage through it features the
largest map of any goat simulator game
various items and perks for you to
unlock and plenty of hilarity and mayhem
to get yourself into much like other
games in the series you're either really
gonna like it or really hate it the guy
force reloaded is a top-down shooter
that channels the good old top-down
shooters of old you'll control a ship
and fly around levels in order to kill
bad guys save people trapped on the
ground and dodge enemy fire it has
colorful above-average graphics that do
a good job of looking fantastic while
also creating chaotic scenes for you to
deal with the mechanics are simple
enough and it takes a long time in order
to finish the game it is a freemium
title but it doesn't seem to be as
aggressive about it as other titles
generally our skater is you guessed it a
skateboarding game that developers boast
was created by skaters for skaters it
plays like other skateboarding games on
mobile where you play as a disembodied
skateboard and your finger motions
determine which tricks you do what
direction you travel and how fast you go
it features character customizations
tons of places to skate and fairly
simple controls this one is still
wrestling with some early bugs but it's
not bad overall
foes is a rhythm game and one of only a
few rhythm games that are actually any
good in this one you play a variety of
songs where you must tap swipe and hold
at the appropriate times to get combos
and rack up points
it has a perfunctory storyline about a
girl and her friends who want to create
a band
the gameplay is simple to learn in the
graphics while simple or utterly
gorgeous the mixture of the two creates
an immersive gaming experience that's
actually rather enjoyable the in-app
purchases allow you to purchase DLC
which is one of the few in-app purchases
that don't suck and that about does it
for this one folks if you want to keep
watching we also have our best Android
apps of the month video on our youtube
channel if you want to check that out
the links for these games are in the
video description if you want to check
those out as well and don't forget to
keep it tuned to Android a thorny
because we are your source for all
things Android thanks again for watching
everybody and have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
