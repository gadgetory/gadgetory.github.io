from android 30.com I'd say what we're
taking a look at a free game in the
google play store called monster rivals
most arrivals is a fairly menu driven
game and players will spend a lot of the
time here the first thing they'll do is
create a new monster give it whatever
name they like and then customize the
look players can customize their
characters by selecting a head torso and
special feature these can be further
customized by changing the color there
isn't a lot of variety but most should
be able to come up with something that
they like once that's done players can
fight train go to the item store view
stats and view the leaderboard in the
item store you can buy various weapons
to equip you can also buy gems to equip
on weapons for added bonuses and a
trinket which can be equipped to give
even more stat boosts once you buy a
weapon or a trinket it's yours for good
but you have to repurchase gems for each
new weapon you buy you can view your
stats in the stats screen some stats
include experience until next level
winds total matches damage and other
stats to help you tweak your character
the leaderboard is an excellent way to
track your progress and see how far you
are from the top players training serves
two purposes it helps you work on your
special attacks in battle and it also
helps you unlock gem slots for your
weapon all you have to do is wait for
the circle to close in on the start and
tap based on your timing you receive
stars and that will increase your damage
in battle training also gives small
experience and money boosts when you do
well with a new weapon once you're done
playing with the menu it's time to do
battle just hit fight select your
opponent and the game will load a small
comparison of your stats and load the
battle screen battles Rai driven so
players just need to sit back and watch
the characters to whack each other the
only human control comes when the yellow
bar is under the name fill up they need
get to do the circle star tapping
minigame you practiced in training mode
the battle ends when one monsters health
drops to zero since you have no control
and a lot of this is luck based and not
scale based players watch the game more
than play it and simply hope for the
best All Things Considered we gave the
gameplay a 3 out of 5 star rating the
graphics in this game aren't bad it's
very colorful and vibrant and the screen
space is well designed with no wasted
space the characters are cutesy and fun
although I would have liked to have seen
more customization options the levels
you fight in rotate frequently so you
won't be fighting in just one stage the
whole game as some players have pointed
out there are some graphical issues here
and there but it in no way affects the
gameplay this is about on par with any
flash game you'd find on facebook so we
gave graphics are rating in 3.5 out of 5
monster marbles has no ending players
continuously upgrade and fight not for
completion but to achieve a better
standing on the leader
since the game is meant to be played
forever this helps the replay value
significantly there is a lot that is yet
to be determined if developers continue
to add new unlockable content to the
game then players can keep on playing it
if they don't then this game will get
really old really quick assuming the
developers intend to keep adding new
content so high level players can keep
on playing the replay value on this game
is rated 4 out of 5 when it's all said
and done you really can't go wrong with
monster rival it's free after all so
you're not really giving up anything to
try it at worst if you don't like it
you've wasted five minutes of your time
on top of laying the smackdown on bots
and players you don't know gamers can
also invite their Facebook friends to
play you can race up the leaderboard or
fight one another to see who built the
better monster so there is that aspect
if you're into that sort of thing it
does have a lot of qualities of a
Facebook flash game but Facebook flash
games have a bad habit of not always
being available for Android taking that
into consideration along with the fact
that it's free we decided to give the
overall value of 4 out of 5 star rating
