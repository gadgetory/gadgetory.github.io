Android authority and HTC just
introduced three new affordable smart
phones to their desire line with the 525
26 and the 626 they're all more or less
the same phone in many ways but the 6-2
6 is the most heavily SPECT one out of
the bunch so naturally that's the one we
got to spend time with this is your
first look and hands-on of the HTC
Desire 626 from a design perspective
desire 66 shares a lot of similarities
to the desire I the hit AT&amp;amp;T last year
the body is made of plastic with a
two-tone color scheme some of which
feature a glossy finish and some are
matte but color options will vary from
carrier to carrier and there are quite a
few of them beyond the ones you see in
this video the 66 also carries many of
HTC's typical design cues like the HTC
logo centered squarely along the back
the black HTC bar on the front and the
dual speaker grilles but unlike the HTC
One flagships there's no boom sound here
in fact only one of the grilles is
actually a speaker and the other one is
just there to maintain aesthetics and
familiarity the display is a 720p screen
at five inches so nothing that's really
going to blow your socks off but it will
get the job done and because of these
smaller screen size this makes the
desire six to six very easy to use in
one hand which can be a very refreshing
feeling if you're coming from a much
larger handset inside is a Snapdragon
210 quad-core processor with
one-and-a-half gigs of RAM which kept
things running smoothly during our short
time but I wouldn't be surprised if you
start to notice a lot of stutters and
pauses under heavy loads this is a
pretty old Snapdragon chip after all
that isn't exactly a benchmarking beast
so expectations should be tempered
accordingly eight gigabytes of internal
storage can also be found on board but
if you need more and you most likely
will the six to six supports up to two
full terabytes of expandable storage
keeping the 6 to 6 power throughout the
day is
embedded 2000 milliamp hour battery that
should be good enough for at least a
full day's worth of usage considering
the overall specs for pictures the
camera on the rear is an 8 megapixel
shooter capable of 720p video recording
with the typical suite of sense camera
settings and the front-facing camera is
of the 5 megapixel variety which should
provide for some decent selfies in
software the desire 6 to 6 ships with
lollipop 5.1 out of the box with the
latest sense 7 interface and a good
chunk of these sense features have made
its way over to the 626 like blinkfeed
for aggregating all of your social media
and news stories the brand new home
widget that curates apps based on your
usage and location and the themes engine
to alter the look and feel of the OS
however due to the lack of sensors there
are no motion launch gestures like
double tap to wake or swipe to unlock
but otherwise this is mostly the same
sense experience that you can expect to
find from HTC's flagship s-- except in a
much more budget-friendly form factor
the 6 - 6 will be hitting every US carry
you can think of both big and small as a
postpaid phone on Verizon and 18t and a
prepaid phone on other networks like
t-mobile metro pcs cricket sprint and
other sprint subsidiaries like boost and
Virgin Mobile so far pricing and
availability has only been confirmed for
Sprint starting July 19th for a hundred
and twenty-nine ninety-nine in
marshmallow white other carriers will
most likely be very similar in price
point and will definitely keep you
posted as we find out more but this has
been a quick look of the HTC Desire 66
