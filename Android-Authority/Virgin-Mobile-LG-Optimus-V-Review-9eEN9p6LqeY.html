authority this is our review for the LG
Optimus Vu on Virgin Mobile and overall
I got to say I'm giving a lot of praise
to LG there's this a very quality device
there is no creaks to this design at all
as well as it leaves a great impression
the 3.2 inch LCD display on here which I
believe is a normal LCD is brighter than
a Super AMOLED panel as well as being
brighter than a Super LCD panel which I
have no idea how LG was able to escape
getting additional praise for how pretty
of a display this is but this is a very
very nice display overall other aspects
of this phone that I really was
impressed with there these four physical
buttons down here having chrome
surrounds on them really adds a lot of
visual appeal to this device as well as
them including this brushed nickel
surround piece on top makes it very nice
day you don't you're not toting around
just a piece of black plastic that is
very nondescript they included on a
micro SD card slot with its own access
door on the side so you don't have to
pull the battery cover anymore and all
the physical buttons on this device are
extremely clicky so it's very very nice
to know that you're hitting these
buttons and it's actually doing
something
it has a two-stage physical camera
button which is very very nice I don't
I'm not a fan of on screen camera
buttons I do like that it has a power
port on the bottom instead of being
located on one of the sides of the
device because then it comes in conflict
with a lot of Universal mounts so that
you see out there the 3.2 megapixel
camera has taken some very very good
daytime shots however nighttime shots no
I'm not really that big of a fan of just
because of the it doesn't it lacks an
LED flash or anything when it comes to
the video shots that I've taken with it
the camera takes extremely detailed
video however when it comes to audio the
microphone does a poor job detecting the
the audio that is happening during the
video the speakerphone on here
it could be louder and I'm not really
that big of a fan of how quiet it was
however it did work just fine when while
watching youtube videos that also did
tend to be a little quiet and a little
crackly overall it ran perfectly smooth
with its with its vanilla Froyo version
that it's running here as you can see it
is running a live wallpaper with no
hiccups which is very nice for a 600
megahertz processor web browsing was
very nice and when you look at the touch
screen you can see I've already ran a
test on here was the touch screen is
extremely accurate which is very very
nice for a an inexpensive handset like
this one so other overall with the
physical design I really love you algae
this is a great handset this there's
barely any complaints with it really
maybe this speakerphone is really the
only complaint that I would give the
other praised I would have to give is to
Virgin Mobile for the pricing of the
plan on here because really this is the
king of all prepaid handsets right now
it has great hardware as well as having
extremely cheap plans
Virgin Mobile has a $25 a month 300
minute unlimited data unlimited
messaging a plan as well as having a $40
a month 1200 minute unlimited data
unlimited messaging plan or is $60
unlimited everything which there's
nothing like this on the market this is
a great handset with a great price if
you are not on contract right now run
out and pick one of these up if you see
Sprint probably has 3G in your area I
can't praise it enough
I love the handset I love the service I
did have a couple hiccups when I came to
their data coverage every once in a
while it would drop out even though it
showed that I had full bars and would
stop talking to the network so I thought
that was a little odd so then I would
always just go in and toggle the
airplane mode on and off and then it
would jump on their network just fine
but overall great handset love it great
review definitely tune back into Android
authority for future handsets we'll be
taking a look at a lot a lot of handsets
in the future and hopefully a lot of
them
give as good of a compression as the lg
optimus V thanks for tuning in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
