thought hey what's going on everybody
and here we're taking a look at the dot
matrix cases available for the HTC One
m8 that was just announced and released
pretty much today and what we're looking
at here is a first party accessory which
is a really great prospect from any
manufacturer especially one like HTC now
it might look a little familiar to those
of you who have seen our videos before
and may have seen an Alcatel case that
does much of the same functionality but
instead the HTC One m8 to Dom matrix
case takes on a different outlook as you
can see there hit put on it was put on
using a clamshell for the back that then
has the cover that comes over to the
front as you can see I just turned it on
there and if I opened the case fast
enough you probably saw that it actually
has the information coming from the
screen that comes through the Dom matrix
case so if you have the phone inside of
the case here there are a couple of
functions that you can swipe or tap onto
the screen in order to get some
functionality for example when you're
holding the phone you can double tap
onto any area on the on the screen or on
the cover and it will bring out the
light from the actual screen itself that
comes through the case and if I open it
fast enough you'll see that it is
actually coming through from the screen
itself it's a really nice way of
creating this notification based type of
deal without having to create a case
that has the LEDs
it's in which is what the Alcatel case
had that's the first thought that I had
when I first saw the case but as you can
see here it is a different take on the
same concept that uses the screen itself
now the other gestures that you'll have
have to do with when you're receiving
calls if a call is happening here you
will see it coming up on the dominatrix
case and if you slide up while the call
is going you'll be able to answer the
call or swipe down in order to decline
on it but if you swipe down and nothing
else is going on you can turn on i sure
let me bring up the gesture again there
you go
and it will bring up the voice command
is from here that you can create a voice
command to the phone to be able to
perform a bunch of different tasks and
again if I open the screen up enough
it'll say it'll have to speak HTC sense
voice right here that will allow you to
do some voice commands onto the phone
other than that however it is a very
very transparent case it field it has
the the silicone feel to it that is very
nice not exactly what we were expecting
but now it makes complete sense with the
way that the screen comes right through
the case and if you opened it up all the
way you see you are still able to use
the phone pretty easily without any fuss
at all and it should work just fine as a
case for your phone for protection and
also for functionality as you can see
with all that it can do so one more time
we're just going to go ahead and close
the case and have it on there and if I
were to double tap on the screen itself
you'll see the time come up
so it's Joshua regard from the New York
City HTC launch event for the HTC One m8
and this is the dot matrix case that
comes with it
we do have a unit our selves as well so
I'll put it through more of its paces
while we do our full review on the HTC
One and made ourselves as well but this
is just a really nice smart cover for
the HTC One m8 that performs a few
different tasks in a very elegant way
and gives it a bit of a unique outlook
and it's a first party
there's a first party applica accessory
which is something we don't get to see
very often from manufacturers and it's
nice to see that HTC is really putting
their best foot forward with a case that
is not only stylish but is very
functional so keep it tuned to Android
34 all of the best coverage on the HTC
One m8 in the coming days because we are
