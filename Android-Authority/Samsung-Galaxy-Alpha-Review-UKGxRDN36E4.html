Android authority and the Samsung Galaxy
alpha received quite a bit of attention
when people first caught wind of it
mostly because of that shiny metal band
a material that people have always
wanted Samsung to use but they never did
until now but let's go ahead and take a
closer look at the Samsung Galaxy alpha
and see if it's beauty is more than skin
deep or if it's just more of the same
from Samsung so let's start with the
design of the galaxy alpha because
that's the reason why this phone was
generating so much buzz in the tech
community and if it wasn't for the shiny
new metal band around the frame of the
phone it probably wouldn't have received
as much attention as it did when
everyone first heard about it we now
have proof though that Samsung is
perfectly capable of making a premium
feeling phone and this metal band with
its beautiful chamfered edges on the
front and back make a world of a
difference in how it feels in the hand
compared to the all plastic design that
we've been so used to from Samsung for
so long the Galaxy alpha feels very
solid in the hand and because of its
flat sides and compact form factor it's
extremely easy to hold on to and operate
with one hand which is a very refreshing
feeling especially when you're so used
to using larger Android phones that
require a lot of shuffling in the hand
just to reach every corner of the screen
but with the Galaxy alpha you can thank
it's compact form factor to a couple of
things one it has relatively thin bezels
all the way around and two is the 4.7
inch display on the front which is a lot
smaller than most Android phones these
days but I'll talk more about that in a
sec now the Galaxy alpha isn't all metal
the back of the phone is still a thin
piece of plastic but you're not really
going to notice it much except for when
you actually take it off but I actually
prefer the new back design of the Alpha
in comparison of something like the s5
the design on the Galaxy alpha is a lot
more subtle and it has a nice grippy
texture to it so when you're holding in
your hand it doesn't feel like it's
going to slip out of your hand or
anything like that interestingly enough
even though you can still take the back
off there's no microSD card expansion
it's not a huge deal to me but if you're
used to having that micro SD card slot
that you would typically get on
phone you're not going to get it here
with the Alpha the rest of the hardware
is pretty familiar Samsung with the
power button on the right side volume
rocker on the left although it is choked
up a little high on the chassis than I
would prefer but that's a pretty minor
complaint the typical home button
flanked by capacitive back and recent
app keys are on the front and if you're
wondering the fingerprint scanner that
you may love or hate makes a return here
as well on the top is a standard 3.5
millimeter headset jack and then along
the bottom is your micro USB port and a
single speaker I'm not the biggest fan
of bottom mounted speakers I've probably
said that before mostly because they're
fairly easy to cover up especially in
landscape when you're playing a game or
watching a video but the speaker quality
itself is fairly decent it produces a
pretty clean sound without sounding
tinny although I do find it to be a
little on the quiet side and there
definitely was a few times when I press
the bottom rocker thinking maybe it had
a few more clicks and for max volume so
I do wish that it was a tad bit louder
like I mentioned earlier on the front of
the galaxy alpha is a 4.7 inch display
and it comes in at 720p resolution but
the PPI is still pretty respectable so
you're not going to notice pixels all
that easily unless you look hard for
them it is a Super AMOLED display so the
colors are very vibrant and punchy with
lots of contrast great viewing angles
and brightness Samsung has always been
pretty good with their displays and the
Galaxy alpha is no exception so if
you're a fan of AMOLED displays like I
am you'll certainly have no problems
with this one the internal specs will
vary depending on where you get it but
the 18 t model that I have here is
packing some pretty high in specs for a
2014 smartphone it's being powered by a
Snapdragon 801 chip Adreno 330 and two
gigs of ram if you're looking at the
International model it comes with
Samsung's own octa-core processor and a
Mallee t6 28 GPU instead with high-end
specs you can expect some very smooth
and snappy performance and the Galaxy
alpha definitely delivers it handled
everything I threw at it with ease from
multitasking opening and closing apps
web browsing and playing games the
Galaxy alpha performs just as smoothly
as I expected to I'm not saying there
isn't the occasional stutter or drop
frame but they're all very minor and
it's only going to bother you if you're
extremely sensitive to it on the back of
the galaxy alpha is a 12 megapixel
camera with an LED flash of course so
not the highest-end sensor that Samsung
has ever used at least when it comes to
the megapixel count but 12 megapixels is
still a pretty respectable number as far
as the camera software goes it's the
usual interface that you've come to know
from Samsung so there's obviously a ton
of features here from the typical stuff
like exposure and white balance to dual
shot Beauty phase and all the other
different shooting modes probably more
features than you will ever use but that
is usually Samsung style when it comes
to software since it is 12 megapixels 4k
video recording is possible along with
1080p at
60 frames per second and slow motion
video capture at 720p the picture
quality however is actually not bad at
all photos look very colourful sharp and
vibrant and it does a great job with
handling exposure dynamic range isn't
the greatest but HDR certainly helps
bringing out a lot more detail it can be
a little over-aggressive and photos
might look a little unnatural but I
actually didn't mind the slightly
unnatural oversaturated look in
low-light photos lose a lot of quality
they look very grainy and noisy and
there's just not a whole lot of detail
but for the most part this is a very
solid smartphone camera the battery life
could potentially leave a lot to be
desired depending on your usage it's a
pretty small eighteen hundred and sixty
milliamp hour battery so if you plan on
hammering on your phone a lot playing a
lot of games watching videos and whatnot
you definitely won't be able to get
through a full day with lighter more
regular usage like texting checking
social networks browsing the web you
definitely can get a full day out of it
but like I said it's a pretty small
battery so don't expect a whole lot out
of it and it's kind of surprising that
Samsung would use a battery that was
less than 2,000 milliamp hours
considering the Galaxy alpha is packin
some pretty beefy specs and finally onto
the software the Samsung Galaxy alpha
comes with the latest version of KitKat
Android 4.4.4 with Samsung's TouchWiz
interface on top and pretty much
everything that you can find on the
galaxy s5 has made its way over to the
Galaxy alpha samsung didn't exclude any
features on the Alpha at all they are
all here from smart stay smart pause air
gestures and multi window for some true
multitasking
there is also toolbox that creates a
floating bubble for quick access to some
of your favorite apps and many many
other features my magazine is still one
swipe away from your main home screen
and the animation is still just as slow
as ever but honestly I'm not a fan of it
anyway so I don't really use it and of
course the settings menu is still just
as convoluted and difficult to navigate
as it has ever been Samsung's s health
app also makes a return for logging all
of your daily activities including
measuring your heart rate with the
built-in heart rate monitor right next
to the camera so at least in terms of
the overall features is exactly like the
Galaxy S five like I mentioned earlier
this is the eighteen T model so you can
expect to find a ton of ATT
pre-installed bloatware that you
unfortunately can only disable and not
completely uninstall the Samsung Galaxy
alpha is available now on 18t if you're
inside the United States for one $99.99
on a two-year contract and it's roughly
about $700 unlocked if you want to go
the unlock route so the price is kind of
expensive and it's a little bit
polarizing because the $200 price point
is usually reserved for high-end
flagship smartphones and in some ways
the galaxy alpha does exude a lot of
flagship characteristics like the metal
design the Snapdragon 801 processor two
gigs of ram and 32 gigs of on-board
storage but then there's other things
about it that don't necessarily scream
high-end like the 720p display and the
really small battery and I actually
really like this phone but I can already
see the price dropping to maybe $99 on a
contract and maybe just a month or two
which would be just in time for the
holiday season at the end of the day the
Samsung Galaxy alpha might just be
another phone in Samsung's product
portfolio and it's certainly not going
to win phone of the year or anything
like that but it's not even really about
the phone it's about what the phone
stands for the Samsung Galaxy alpha
offers us a glimpse of something new
from Samsung something I think many
people have wanted to see from Samsung
for a long time now and it's finally
coming and that alone I think is going
to get a lot of people excited but that
is it for this review hopefully you guys
