about Google's daydream their virtual
reality platform one big question many
of you will have is will your device be
daydream ready now what exactly is
daydream ready
well daydream ready is a term Google is
giving to next generation devices that
will have the necessary low latency
sensors low persistent display and
minimum GPU and CPU performance to
satisfy and deliver daydreams VR content
now the bad news is that your current
device will likely never be daydream
ready and that's primarily due to the
fact that your device likely won't have
the necessary sensors and also will not
have a low persistence display now let's
talk about confirmed daydream ready
phones and first up is the ZTE axon 7
the first official daydream VR ready
phone to be announced was the ZTE axon 7
priced at just 399 us the axon 7 offers
a pretty compelling package especially
when it includes support for Google's VR
platform the ZTE axon 7 specs also give
us a first hint at the minimum specs
required for daydream ready phones
including the Snapdragon 820 an AMOLED
display and 4 gigabytes of RAM next up
is the Asus zenfone 3 deluxe even though
the high-end version of the zenfone 3
deluxe recently got a spec bump to the
Snapdragon 820 1 both the Snapdragon 820
equipped models are also daydream
certified considering all three phones
have full HD Super AMOLED displays q HD
is clearly no longer the benchmark
resolution for daydream VR phones now
let's talk about daydream ready specs
and the following specs are absolutely
not official they are simply drawn from
a list of already announced daydream
ready phones first up of course is the
Snapdragon 820 the minimum chipset
required and 4 gigabytes of RAM looks to
be the minimum memory requirement on the
display front at least a full HD OLED
display with low persistence is also
necessary prior to the announcement of
the three zenfone 3 delay
models which have full HD resolution it
looked like qHD would be the minimum
resolution required but that now seems
to have been relaxed and of course all
devices need to be running Android 7.0
nougat to take advantage of its
sustained performance mode for VR also
now let's talk about possible daydream
ready phones based on the specs
mentioned above there are a few existing
devices that could theoretically be
daydream ready the Moto Z the Moto Z
force Snapdragon versions of the s7 and
s7 edge and s7 active and the 1+3 all
have the Snapdragon 820 at least for
full HD OLED displays and at least 4
gigabytes of RAM now I know what some of
you are thinking you're thinking Jase
Google used the Nexus P is a reference
device for daydream developers so
clearly mother Google must have hacked
something in the Nexus 6p to make
daydream work on that particular device
but you should know that the LG g5 the
HTC 10 the xperia x performance and even
an echo Lemax Pro all have LCD displays
and thus are unlikely to be daydream
compatible so how many of you are
holding out for a daydream ready phone
do you care or maybe are most of you
just really confused about what daydream
VR is let me know in the comments below
I'd love to read them
you guys remember from like 15 years ago
when people were making money hand over
fist in the dot-com bubble remember we
didn't call it a dotnet bubble or dot
org bubble we didn't call them dot biz
billionaires we called them dot-com
billionaires because that's the power of
a.com now why is that because no domain
name extension tells your story with the
same degree of trust as a dot-com or
dotnet domain name.com and dotnet domain
name extensions and jet credibility into
your online presence save fifteen
