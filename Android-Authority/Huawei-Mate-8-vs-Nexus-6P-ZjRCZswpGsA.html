head-to-head it's Joshua Carr from
Android Authority what's going on
everybody and this is the Huawei mate 8
versus the Nexus 6p as generally the
case with these vs videos you can find
the spec sheets and the more my new
details about both of these devices in a
full written companion found at Android
30.com but even then we have four
reviews for both of these devices so you
can always check those out at either the
website or here on the YouTube channel
if you want to learn more we actually
have a bit of a split decision when it
comes to the design aspect for this vs
because we have certain people at
Android Authority who prefer the Nexus
6p over the Huawei made eight that said
the Nexus 6p happens to have that black
bar on the top that some people do
sometimes feel is out of place on the
other hand you have the mate eight which
has a more symmetrical design language
but it is a very familiar design if you
are familiar with the mate seven but
premium materials are really par for the
course here no matter which of these two
you get the unibody designs really lend
to a very nice looking and feeling
device and they really feel great in the
hand even despite some slippage due to
that smooth metal but the sides are nice
and flat on both of these and as far as
sizes go there is a slightly taller
device in the Nexus 6p due to the dual
front-facing stereo speakers and it's
5.7 inch display while you have a
slightly wider phone in the Huawei mate
8 because of its six inch display in
general though both of these devices
show a lot of what Huawei is able to
make and the build quality is absolutely
solid across the board so really it's up
to you which one looks better the Nexus
6p did just recently get a Gold Edition
and we personally would love to see in
the flesh the mocha brown version of the
Huawei mate 8 the display situation
might actually be a little bit easier
for those of you who are spec hungry and
that's because the quad HD display on
the Nexus 6p is simply better than the
1080p on the inmates 8 so that would be
a pretty easy decision for you guys that
said that 1080p IPS display on the May 8
is no slouch even if it doesn't quite
have the punched out colors that the
AMOLED provides but media and gaming
across the board is still very enjoyable
no matter which of these two that you
pick and if you want that little bit of
extra color depth and also the higher
resolution then of course the Nexus 6p
will provide that little bit extra for
you it's just that when terms of sheer
enjoyment for the general user we don't
see that much of a difference between
these two performance is actually a
great aspect for these two devices going
head-to-head because you have the two
different scenarios you have the stock
Android experience being powered by a
powerful Snapdragon 810 processor in the
Nexus 6p but on the other hand you have
an in-house made processing package that
is supposed to contend with the software
more saturated and more feature heavy
emui
but we have to give Huawei a lot of
credit because in either case they have
managed to excel not only is speed
really great on both of these but it's
been very smooth and reliable and no
matter what we do for both of these
devices we haven't really been able to
slow them down one bit multitasking and
pretty much getting through all of the
more google-like features in the stock
Android experience Android marshmallow
of the Nexus 6p bring the kind of
experience that you would want out of a
Nexus device but on the other hand even
with its more feature heavy package the
mate 8 is able to move along swimmingly
with no issues at all and for those of
you that were worried that the molle
graphics of the mate 8 would kind of
fall short compared to the Adreno we
actually don't think that there is
actually a big difference between the
two as we've had fun playing games on
both without any problems so while the
Nexus 6p provides the kind of experience
you would want from a stock Android
device what you also get in the mate 8
is a proving ground for the high silicon
Kirin 950 and Huawei is really proving
itself no matter which of these two
scenarios you pick Hardware actually
takes on a different type of story this
time around and that's because the Nexus
line tends to have the more bare-bones
experience while the OEM flagships tend
to have a lot more features but this
time around the gap has actually been a
lot more narrowed we'll start off with
the great fingerprint readers on the
back of either device these are still
the best in class and provide a seamless
and indispensable tool it's easy to just
let the index finger land on the area on
the back of the phone and then your
phone is already awoken and unlocked
very easily as far as the sound
situation goes of course you have the
dual front-facing speakers of the 6p
which provide a great sound experience
now that's obviously going to be better
than
the bottom mounted speaker here of the
Huawei mate 8 which does provide some
pretty good body in the sound but just
doesn't get quite as loud and ultimately
it's just a few steps back compared to
the great experience you find on the 6p
while we did a great job of providing
every radio possible for each may 8th
that you might get so you can literally
use this phone pretty much everywhere
around the world but the Nexus 6p is
also quite versatile and you can find
versions of it that are compatible with
pretty much any major carrier across the
markets that is being put in but
speaking of connectivity you also have
dual SIM capabilities in B while we may
date while the Nexus 6p doesn't provide
that kind of functionality and one of
those trays inside of the mate can
actually be used for a microSD card so
expandable storage is something that the
OEM flagship can boast over the Nexus
line once again and finally the part
everyone should be talking about when it
comes to a hallway device power what we
have in the Google Nexus 6p is a 34 50
million power battery that is powered
and charged by USB type-c now type-c
cords are still a little bit harder to
come by and have taken some getting used
to even for us here at Android authority
but it does charge the battery in a very
short amount of time so when you get
your day and a half about worth of power
from the Nexus 6p you can get it charged
up pretty easily without having to fuss
too much but then we have the four
thousand milliamp hour battery inside of
the Huawei mate 8 in which the am UI
actually does a very aggressive job of
making sure you know certain
applications are taking up too much
power and you can actually black list a
number of them inside of the optimizer
in order to make sure that the power
consumption is right where you want it
to be and with that two days of battery
life can actually be the norm with the
Huawei mate 8 and that's nothing short
of amazing and we haven't even mentioned
yet that the fast charging available
with the mate 8 is able to charge the
phone for a full day's worth of battery
in just about half an hour you really
can't go wrong with either of these
phones in terms of power but if you
really are a power user and you need
your phone to really go the distance
that mate 8 is definitely the companion
you just might be looking for as we get
into the cameras the spec shows that the
12 megapixel shooter of the Nexus 6p
doesn't have optical image stabilization
compared to that of the mate
eight which does n has 16 megapixels
however the actual pixel sizes are a bit
different between these two and we see
in the camera samples later if they
actually make a difference but for now
we're focusing on the application the
applications and both of these are very
different as the nexus 6 piece google
camera provides a number of different
options some modes but really it's a
more what you see is what you get
interface with Auto HDR now I mention
Auto HDR because you have to actually
open up a mode in the mate 8 in order to
take advantage of it that said the mate
8 does provide even more modes a lot of
different ways of getting the kind of
shot that you want including even a
manual mode that does work pretty well
if you need to tweak the shot for a
better picture but as we get into the
actual camera samples themselves we do
find a bit of discrepancy between the
two and with the nexus 6p is larger
pixel sizes just barely making it that
much better than the mate 8 in brighter
situations there's a bit more color
depth also in the nexus 6 piece photos
and especially when you're using HDR it
just simply has a much better way of
interpreting the scene then the mate
which sometimes doesn't even look like
it's doing much at all when you have HDR
enabled while you could sort of give or
take in very bright situations between
these two phones it's one of these
situations get dimmer that you actually
see the Nexus 6p is just bolstering its
hardware that much better you get much
darker photos and much grainier photos
inside of the Huawei mate 8 which simply
just don't provide the same type of
quality that the Nexus 6p does it was a
bit disheartening to see that the mate
aides provided a lackluster camera
experience overall
as they already proved that they could
do a good one in the Nexus 6p
so the Nexus 6p is simply the better
camera companion that you should have in
your pocket and finally we have software
now this is one of those categories that
would be really easy for a lot of people
to pick between because either you're a
stock Android purist or you actually
enjoy all of the extra features that
might come in an OEM skin we do have
android marshmallow at the helm in both
of these devices so a number of the same
features can be found like Google now on
tap that said however the stock Android
experience is definitely very
streamlined and it doesn't look like
it's even trying all
that hard and if you compare it to the
Huawei mate 8 cm UI it also has an Abbe
drawer and a lot of people really
gravitate to that especially here in the
West but the stock Android experience
does provide just exactly what you need
without too many extras and if extras
are what you need then the mate 8 might
be where you have to look but the emui
is a controversial software suite
because a number of his features simply
are not all that useful the knuckle
feature for example is one that you
can't really trigger without sometimes
punching the device and if you are
already failing at using the knuckle
feature then maybe you could have just
hit the icon already and would have been
on your way the dual window function
aside from using the recent apps screen
is also fairly useless because there
aren't that many applications that you
can actually use with it and again we
mentioned the lack of an Abbe drawer
which really makes it a bit tougher to
keep clean when compared to the app
drawer found in the stock Android
iteration we do have to give credit
where credit is due however as the power
consumption features inside of emui are
the reason why its battery can go the
distance so we give it a lot of credit
there and some customization can be had
on here in order to make this version of
Android actually look a little bit
better for you but ultimately we find
ourselves installing third-party
launchers just so we can make emui
look a little bit more of the way we
wanted to here at Android Authority and
that's more of a stock like experience
the Nexus 6p starts at $449 at the
Google Play Store and is available in
many Western markets but the Huawei mate
8 is not going to be made available in
the US though you can always import it
and use it because of all the radios
that it has but that will cost you even
more as it comes in at the general
flagship price of at least 600 or $700
and so there you have it for this versus
between the Huawei mate 8 and the Nexus
6p these are two of the best devices
that Huawei has ever put out and it
really shows just how much they've
matured as you have a very great
experience underneath the hood and great
materials on the outside and between
these two it really is a matter of what
exactly you really need while the Nexus
6p provides the stock Android experience
very smooth very snappy and reliable and
a good better experience you also get
the front-facing speakers and the
promise of the updates that
has always made for the nexus program
but on the other hand if power is really
what you need then we can't fault the
mate 8:4 really showing us just what
it's like to have two days worth of
battery life but that does come at the
expense of the front-facing speakers you
do get expandable storage and you get
the regular USB cord if that is
something you are still getting used to
in the Nexus with type C but you also
get a software experience that a lot of
us here in the West simply are not
really all that much down for so as
always thank you guys very much for
watching I hope you enjoyed this video
versus between B while we made eight and
the Nexus 6p both of these phones are
incredible and have very specific strong
points power being the mate eights and
the experience overall of the Nexus in
the Nexus 6p you're going to have to
choose which one of these will be better
for your experience but we do think that
you'll have a great time either way so
keep it tuned to Android authority for
even more about the mate 8 and the Nexus
6p and you can find their full reviews
