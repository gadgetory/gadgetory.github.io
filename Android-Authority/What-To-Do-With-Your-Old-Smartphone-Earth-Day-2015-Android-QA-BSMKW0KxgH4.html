produce two billion acts of green
we here at Edward authority are gonna
reduce reuse recycle geek style
smartphones could be the fastest growing
technology in the world ever and
nowadays more than one in seven people
own a smartphone worldwide some of us
more than others and sadly that produces
a lot of e-waste and a waste is not
exactly biodegradable bad for the earth
bad humans now I had a serious crush on
the romper room teacher you remember her
I hope that I'll see you again on Monday
for robbery but I remember her saying
reduce reuse recycle and that spirit
let's start with reuse first you can
donate it there are various options if
you want to turn your old Android
smartphone into a charitable donation in
the US you'll find campaigns like
Verizon's Hope line which supports
victims of domestic abuse hope phones
which is dedicated to health workers or
cell phones for soldiers you can use it
as a remote with the right apps you can
control your computer console or home
theater gear you can even look into home
automation your old Android phone can be
a really handy remote control that will
work from anywhere in the house you can
also use it to stream content to other
rooms with the right setup you can even
turn it into a server you can use it to
stream content and share files or even
make it into a proxy server to secure
public Wi-Fi if you can find use for a
portable web server than your old
Android phone is up for the job you can
find a tutorial on how to do just that
by my old friends at X Day developers TV
now let's talk about recycling because
you cannot recycle it here since E waste
is a growing problem some governments
have put pressure on manufacturers and
carriers to take responsibility for the
devices they sell you'll actually find
that the majority of manufacturers and
carriers do offer some kind of recycling
program but they don't always go over
the way to publicize it by returning
your device through one of these
recycling programs you can ensure that
is disposed of safely and that many of
the components and materials are reused
as much as possible and that landfill is
kept to a minimum
now of course another way to avoid it
landing in the landfill is to give it to
a relative or sell it yourself for a
hassle free time you can try an online
service that buys used smartphones in
the UK Envirothon is good stateside you
may want to try gazelle or swap up but
there are plenty of options out there
the basic premise is that you can check
on the site to see what they'll pay for
your phone and then send it to them via
a free post they will test it and
assuming it is as described pay you the
agreed price you can usually opt in to
be paid in various ways like Amazon
giftcards if you don't mind doing a bit
more work arranging the sale yourself
you can probably get more money by
selling it somewhere like eBay
Craigslist or Gumtree but never send the
device until you've been Kade now let's
talk the really easy option and that's a
simple buyback program you'll find that
a lot of big online retailers and even
manufacturers run buyback programs where
they offer a guaranteed return for
specific models of a smartphone the
catch here is that with these deals you
often have to buy a new phone or
something else from them these deals
usually pay a bit more than
straightforward buyback programs because
you're buying a new device Samsung
offers a deal like this where you send
them proof of a new samsung galaxy
device purchase and they'll give you
cash for your old phone
there's also Amazon electronics trade in
which pays you in amazon gift cards it
always pays to compare the prices
offered in a few places before pulling
the trigger on a deal I remember as a
kid in kindergarten our teacher was
reading us a futuristic book about a
time where kids could not go outside to
play because the pollution was so bad
and I thought that must be like 500
years from now no that's now when my
kids were in kindergarten school like
ten years ago we had smog days where
they could not go outside to play
because of pollution that's why today's
sponsor is so perfect for Earth Day
thanks again to our sponsor the Toyota
Mirai the new Toyota Mirai is looking to
the future with sustainability in mind
fueled by hydrogen and leaving zero
emissions behind thanks for watching
Android are me happy Earth Day love to
connect with you right here on Google+

you don't wanna forget about my brothers
