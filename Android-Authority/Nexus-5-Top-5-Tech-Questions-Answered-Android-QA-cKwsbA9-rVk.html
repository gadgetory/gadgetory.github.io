Jason today we tackle the most common
questions surrounding the Nexus 5 like
does it support Qualcomm quick charge
2.0 does it support USB OTG and what
kind of warranty do i get when i buy the
nexus 5 from the google play store okay
stop you're getting a little creepy all
right friends I've made no secret that I
love this phone but there were a lot of
popular or common tech questions and
number one was does the Nexus 5 support
Qualcomm quick charge to point out well
no not really well you see the Nexus 5
has the Snapdragon 800 and that supports
Qualcomm quick charge to point out that
the feature the Nexus 5 uses a Texas
Instrument chip for battery charging and
power path management which does not
support Qualcomm quick charge so even
with a firmware update you are out of
luck now does the Nexus 5 support USB
OTG yes just like the Nexus 7 which
means storage cannot auto mountain
you'll need an application that can
access it now if you have a rooted
device you can use stick mount if you're
not rooted then you can use total
commander and the USB mount plug-in you
can find all those links provided below
move it on to the all-important warranty
question the following is what Google
says on their own support site if you
purchase a device or accessory from the
google play store and it is defective
through no fault of your own you may be
entitled to a refund replacement or a
repair of your device please contact us
and we will work with you in the next
steps and replacement options basically
you have to go through google's
following refund process first you have
to contact google and initiate a return
within 15 days of receiving your device
the next step is to return the item to
Google within 7 days after receiving
your return merchan then when the item
arrives at Google you will receive a
refund within 14 business days now
there's also a manufacturer's warranty
directly from LG and I went to LG's
website where they state that they
provide a one-year coverage on both
parts and labor next up is a really
important question for those of you who
want to make sure that your Nexus phone
will be compatible
with your carrier how do I know what
model I am buying when I order from the
google play store that depends on where
you purchased your phone if you bought
it in North America you have the d820
which has LTE bands for AT&amp;amp;T Sprint
Rogers Telus wind and t-mobile now if
you're ordering from outside North
America you are buying the d821 which
has LTE band thanks for watching android
army my name is Jace love to connect
with you here on google+ or twitter
don't forget about my brothers in
android Josh Joe in the tech ninja Kevin
lon and Chris we're all one big happy
Android family and if you have any more
questions about your nexus 5 put them in
the comments below if I can't answer
them I'm sure someone else will I shall
see you next time on Android QA</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
