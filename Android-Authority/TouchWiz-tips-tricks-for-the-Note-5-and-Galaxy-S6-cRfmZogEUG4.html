Android authority now some songs
TouchWiz UI is something that tends to
polarize people who ever love it or you
hate it now in the past has been accused
of being slow and bloated now thankfully
when Samsung released the galaxy s6 and
the galaxy note 5 it provided a
trimmed-down version of TouchWiz however
trim down doesn't mean it's been
crippled and there are lots of
interesting features built into the UI
that can help in your everyday use of
the phone for today to help you get the
best out of TouchWiz I'm providing you
with my tricks and tips for the new
galaxy note 5 and for the Galaxy s6
so if you're ready let's go where are
the big changes between the Galaxy Note
4 on the galaxy note 5 and of course the
galaxy s5 and galaxy s6 was there is no
longer removable battery so now more
than ever the built-in power saving
modes become more useful let's take a
look at them to get to the power mate
saving mode you go to settings in fact
many of the things we'll be looking at
today you'll find under settings and
then we'll just go to battery now here
you'll find a list that shows you of the
estimated usage time that's remaining
and here under power saving you get
these two modes now the first one the
power saving mode where you go into that
you basically just turn it on or off ok
and it power saving mode will limit the
CPU performance reduce the screen
brightness lower the frame rate and so
on now you can either make it turn on
manually or you can say well when I get
down to 50% battery when I get down to
25 20 percent battery please just switch
this saving mode on automatically to eke
out a few more hours from my battery now
the other mode is much more drastic much
more radical look at the difference here
51 hours it's given me estimate here
here it's give me a set of 115 hours if
we go into the ultra power saving mode
as you can see here from the diagram
this actually does radically different
things it changes the screen to this
grayscale it restricts the apps that you
can use it turns off mobile data when
the screen is turned off it switches off
things like Wi-Fi and if we activate it
like this
instantly we'll see the phone switching
over to the ultra power saving mode and
here we are presented with a very simple
user interface where I only have access
to the phone messages and to the
Internet and
down here estimated usage time four days
4.8 days in fact now we can't add a few
apps into here not very many don't
expect to find your games in here
other things that you're gonna want to
play but there's some essentials
whatsapp Facebook maybe a calculator if
you need it while you're still to use on
your phone and you can add those in
there okay and we can get rid of that I
think we can scroll down there disable
ultra power saving mode and it will
switch back to the normal display so
they go to very good ways of eking out
extra battery life from the galaxy s6
and from the note 5 now you would have
noted from that ultra power saving mode
that the user interface that represent
it was very very simple very different
to the complex user interface with
widgets and so on that we have in the
standard UI now actually TouchWiz has a
different type of launcher built in one
with an easy-access mode so let's go
down to here to settings let's scroll
down till we find ez mode if you tap
there and if we activate it what it
basically does is it presents you with a
much simplified user interface the fonts
are much bigger the pages are quite
different and you can also scroll down
here and you can set the different
applications that you want to appear in
easy mode what that really means is they
just use a large font so that if we
activate that let's see what we get
there it is you see just six big icons
there for your phone for your messages
and so on if you scroll to the right
swipe to the right you can add in some
applications if you want to we can go in
there just add one like that you also
have access to all of your apps by
hitting more apps ok and if we go back
to the home there if we scroll swipe to
the left now this is where you can add
people from your contacts you just tap
on that and you have access to quick
access to people from your contacts so
there it is easy mode some people may
like it some people may prefer the more
complicated standard UI it's your choice
that's what TouchWiz is all about now I
don't know about you but in our house it
can be nighttime and we can all be
almost asleep and the house is quiet you
could hear a pin drop and then suddenly
a notification will come on one of our
tablets or one of our phones and it
could almost wait the whole house up in
fact the kids have a game with Jurassic
Park on it and when a notification can
you get this huge t-rex roared and rings
through the whole house has been very
annoying now luckily in the samsung
touchwiz there is a do not disturb mode
now now you've got the priority mode in
lollipop and there's also a do not
disturb mode in marshmallow however this
is the one that has the TouchWiz is
built into TouchWiz we go here to sounds
and notifications and if you look here
do not disturb now when you activate
this and we can activate it now for
example that will make sure that all
calls are muted except for the alerts
and things that you want to allow
through which we have in the exception
section so let's just look at what we
can do there for example we can say I
don't want any exceptions and everything
should be muted well actually I'd like
to hear my alarms I'd like to hear my
calls
in fact I'd only like to hear calls from
people that are in my favorites list
that means if I get any extra calls if
mum and dad ring if the wife rings it
comes through if someone who I don't
know someone's not on my favorite this
range well I'll talk to them later ok
and also we can find that we could
actually use scheduling so actually it
might be useful to say yes every day of
the week or maybe at weekends or maybe
during the working week I would like to
have the notifications turned off
starting at let's say 10 o'clock at
night I can change that to whatever you
fancy whatever is you're going to
bedtime and I'd like that or
notifications to be off until sometime
in the morning 7 o'clock maybe 6 o'clock
whatever is the time that you normally
get up and that will it ensure you don't
get any annoying messages any pings
rings or whatever during the night time
that won't wake up not especially useful
if of course you're using the phone next
to your bed if you leave the phone next
your bed maybe on a wireless charger or
something the worst thing is getting a
message or a notification right in the
middle of the night and of course it can
wake you up
so that is the Do Not Disturb mode now
of course one of the key features on the
note 5 is of course the S Pen and here I
have the S Pen I've already taken it out
now the S Pen allows you to do lots lots
of different things now one of them is
it gives you quick access to some of
your favorite applications now I've
disabled the mode that allows the Air
Command to carp when I pull the pen out
but if I bring the pen close to the
screen press the button then up will
come air
you see down here these last icons are
ones that I have set so if we now go
into settings here into shortcuts you
can see these are the ones I have set if
we just remove those and let's go back
to the main screen here you can see that
there is a plus sign so if you don't
have any other one set you just hit here
on the plus sign and you say well I
would like to have always quick access
to Google Drive and I would always like
to have quick access to the camera via
this particular air command and there
there we see there is Google Drive and
the camera have appeared up there you
can actually delete s note as well
that's one of the default ones they put
in and go to settings go to shortcuts we
can get rid of all three of them there
if you want to let's go back there again
let's see what there is there we go just
the three there and I can now add
another three there so that's how you
can get quick access to some of your
applications via air command
I just want to switch to the galaxy s6
edge for a moment if you want to find a
way of getting to some applications
quickly a quick launcher for that you
can pull out the edge screen here and
what you'll actually find is that you've
got two screens available here one is
called people's edge and one is called
apps edge and now here you can select
some quick launch icon so there's a
quick way of getting into the calculator
and again we can slip that out like that
and if I hit the plus sign I can add
whichever it is apps and I want Gmail
let's get that there so we can get into
that really quickly let's add another
one okay let's add Dropbox and so on and
so on so you just add these Holmwood and
like that and also if you drag this like
this this cog you can actually set where
the tab is for the handle is for the
edge screen so now if we go back here
you'll see it's now here in the middle
rather than being up at the top and I
can drag it back up to the top again
okay and there we go and now there it is
there's the handle for the edge screen
so you've got people edge and you've got
app edge now if you hit the little cog
sign you can actually activate each of
those effects you want to turn off
people age if you don't want it one at
all then all you're going to get now on
the side here is a page well the other
news and things you can do with the
s-pen of course is capture web pages in
fact you can capture any screen using
screen right
of course you know how to do a screen
shot you just press the home button and
the power key here and that would give
you a screen shot but if you do it
divide the screen right let's activate
that here let's go to screen right here
now that's taken a screen shot and now
it's brought it up for me to annotate
but if I use this feature down here
scroll capture this will allow me to
scroll down through the page and take
another screen shot and now I can do it
again
and I can do it again and I can keep
going until I get to the bottom of the
whole page and this will capture all of
it for me there we go and now I'm done
now it brings that up now here it is
inside the screen write program and look
here's the whole page look at that from
all captured for me like that now I can
go in and of course I can use the pen
next okay we've got a marker in yellow
that's great okay we can go here and I
can you know start to note highlight a
few things like that and I can scroll
down here and maybe let's try a
different pen now let's go with
something in black like that and I might
do something like that okay and then I
might scroll down here a bit more let's
do something else here what else can we
do let's go in something like that okay
if I'm marking this up like that now
when I finished now I'm going out here
and I can say say in scrapbook I could
always save it in the gallery
and so now I brought up the scrapbook
and you can see the whole webpage has
been saved there along with the
annotations that I was making at
different points and they go that's a
quick way of saving a whole long page
annotating it and saving it in your
scrapbook and I said at the beginning
that many of the things we're going to
be doing today will be found in the
settings and what is interesting is that
the settings of course is a place that
we go to a lot and Samsung give us this
rate this set of quick settings here at
the top of the notification shade and if
you scroll swipe to the left you'll find
another set of these quick settings now
if you want to change these if for
example you don't want the location
button there you never use the location
you don't care about that then you just
tap Edit here and here at the bottom are
the ones that are available and here at
the top other ones that are going to be
shown the first set and the second set
when you swipe to the left so let's say
for me I'm actually more interested in
NFC so I might just go up there now what
you notice is that the that's rocked off
the bottom something's dropped off the
bottom there I want to get rid of
location completely now let's put back
in do not disturb which was over there
like that
and now I've got NFC in that place there
and when I bring down there is the
notification shade there is NFC instead
of the location button if I sweep to the
left I can still see all the other ones
including do not disturb there but
there's more if you hit on the Settings
button you'll find there's a set of
other quick settings here at the top
black mode and so on now again if I
don't like this particular set here I
want the NFC one put maybe in here so
again you hit edit and now you can go
down this list and you can tick the
different ones that you want to appear
now if you at best a default you should
only have six in there and that will
just give you two rows of three and
there's my NFC ones come up there now
but I can't actually add up to nine so
if we click on a couple more here like
this that will now give us three rows so
there you go you can set those quick
settings both these ones and these ones
to be the ones that you use the most and
ones that you find the most convenient
to use the default theme that comes of
TouchWiz is actually quite nice with
this noise
ground and these nice head of icons
however touch which gives you the
possibility to change the theme to
something completely different and to
get to the theme library what we do is
we back long press on an empty space
there on the background and that will
present us with his son of editing page
and here you can see wallpapers where
you can change just the wallpaper but if
we click on themes we'll be able to
change also the icons and the color
palette so let's just tap on that there
and here are some of the themes that are
in my theme library that's a default one
these two are shown by Samsung all the
time and this is one that I tried later
earlier and we're gonna apply that later
in a moment we want to see all the other
themes you just click down here on theme
store and here you'll be able to see all
the different themes that are available
these other featured ones and if we come
over here to all you can go through all
of the others that are available now
once you've chosen a theme if you just
click on it you'll be able to see what
is available we better look at the
different screenshots there we go and
once you're happy with it you click
download and you have to be signed in to
your Samsung Account you can then
download it and once it's downloaded you
hit apply now let's go back and apply
the one I downloaded earlier the BMW one
so let's click on there
here is what its gonna look like once we
apply it
okay so let's hit apply yes please and
now we have to wait a few moments while
it applies doesn't take too long and
here we go got to 100% and there we have
it so there is our completely different
theme notice how all the icons are
different the background is different in
fact if we go to apps here we can see
that all the Samsung provided apps are
actually got new icons but the ones that
are made by third parties retain their
original icons and the great thing about
themes of course is that you can just
change them as many times as you like
so you can experiment you don't need to
be afraid about trying different ones
you can always go back to the default
one at any time just by going back to it
clicking on apply as I've done let's
wait for it to apply and then we'll see
that we're back to where we were so
really you can experiment you can change
your themes as often as you like just
see what you find interesting now the
last tip I want to talk about today is
this Flipboard briefing if you swipe to
the left you get the Flipboard free
briefing app which some people don't
want I don't expect it to be there from
using
Android phones it was a bit of a shock
the first time I saw it and I don't
actually personally want it so how do I
get rid of it what you do it get is you
long press on here and then we swipe to
the left and there we see a miniature
page of the briefing and we just uncheck
the box like that and now it's gone away
and now if we hit the home button again
now if I go left in fact there's nothing
there I cannot swipe to the left I can
swipe to the right and see what's there
before but I cannot swipe to the left
now personally I'm used to swiping to
the left and to the right from the home
screen and there is a way to fix that if
we long press here again now what we can
actually do is you can see this little
home icon that tells me that is the home
page so what I can actually do it I
could just set this one to be the home
page like that and that would make this
a default one but really that hasn't got
the Google now on the clock and
everything on it so what we can actually
do is with we long press on this we can
drag it look at that right across like
this and we can plot that now in the
middle so now we see the home screen is
in the middle we've got one to the right
and one to the left and so now if we go
to the back again now we can go left
there and right to there and there you
have it my set of tricks and tips for
the galaxy note 5 and for the Samsung s6
now if you have any extra hints that you
want to provide to the Android community
