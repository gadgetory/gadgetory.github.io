lay echo because of a phone that they
released earlier this year that was the
first to have the snapdragon 820
while the ego is back with the follow-up
on that flagship device but they're
trying to be known for way more than
just the processor in their phone it's
Georgia fiqar from Android Authority
what's going on everybody and this is
the leaked au lait pro 3 essentially you
start off with the smartphones and what
we have here are two different
smartphones one in the flagship space
and the other one in the mid-range space
but we'll take a look at the lip Pro 3
right now now it supports a 5.5 inch
full HD display Qualcomm is powerful
Snapdragon 801 that we've already seen
in the Google pixel 4 gigabytes of RAM
64 gigabytes of on-board storage a
fingerprint reader on the back and a 16
megapixel camera it also has a sizable
4070 milliamp hour battery that LICO
says will charge to 33% in just 20
minutes and also it does not sport a
headphone jack instead it provides
continual digital lossless audio quote
unquote through its USB type-c port now
holding the device in the hand there was
one thing I couldn't get out of my mind
this device looks like a 1+3 with a
fingerprint scanner on it now that's not
necessarily a bad thing it's still a
nice and sleek looking device and with
the metal construction that now is a
glossy construction you have a pretty
flashy device that feels nice and sturdy
and pretty hefty in the hand the cameras
do sound really promising especially
with an 8 megapixel camera on the front
but the camera app shows that it might
be a somewhat simplistic experience of
course we don't have any shots to be
able to show you on the other hand you
have the software which is vastly
different as it usually is from these
Chinese manufacturers in that this
version of Android though it does come
with all of the different bells and
whistles that you would expect in an
Android device it also comes with its
own flavor of the launcher now you don't
have a app drawer on here it is instead
replaced by the late Evie ecosystem
essentially it's a streaming service one
of which that let go when they were
known as late TV was very much known for
after all the Eco now has streaming all
over the place and there are billions of
views on a number of
their original dramas and you get access
to that straight on this device hitting
the live button on the bottom where the
app drawer button would usually be takes
you to the live streaming service where
there are a number of different channels
available that you can stream directly
from and see all of their content but an
extra function that's available here is
the ability to shrink down that window
so that you are watching the live
streaming content in that little window
that can float around and you can move
it around so that it is always available
no matter what you're doing on the phone
by far however the best part about this
device is that it will indeed disrupt a
little bit of what we are used to now in
even the mid-range space of Android
because it will be coming in at 399
dollars but especially if you try to buy
the phone on November 2nd and you sign
up for the company's lei rewards program
you can get the phone with a $100
instant rebate and get it for just 299
dollars now as it probably should have
been everyone in the audience gasped
when they heard this as it has been a
while since we've had a phone at such a
price point that sported some of the
higher end specifications you would
expect from a flagship device priced
like a flagship now Lego also brought
out their mid-range lei s3 and it will
also be available in the lim all in the
US for 249 dollars that is its starting
price and there is an instant rebate
involved there but of course the main
story is the led pro 3 with its rebates
the s3 comes with a 5.5 inch display as
well a snapdragon 650 - processor
instead and 3 gigabytes of RAM with 32
gigabytes of on-board storage and a 3000
milliamp hour battery many of its
specifications are very much the same
including the cameras and also the fact
that it has a fingerprint reader on the
back now this particular device even
though it has a similar size actually
feels a lot lighter than the low pro 3
and it has a non-glossy metal
construction that kind of shines a
little bit less than the low pro 3 and
probably is not as much of a fingerprint
bandit magnet now even though the s3
definitely feels like a mid-range device
we have to give credit where credit is
due and to the low pro 3 is probably one
of those phones you want to look out for
despite the fact that it might come with
a different flavor of Android that we're
not necessarily used to here in the US
on top of that however if the camera
seems to hold up and to the performance
is top-notch as it probably should be
being a flagship of its kind then that
two hundred and $99 price point on
November second and even three hundred
ninety nine across is probably going to
be a hot topic for you to consider in
the end of 2016 so when we get our hands
on a review unit keep it tuned here for
our full review and remember that
Android authority is your source for all
things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
