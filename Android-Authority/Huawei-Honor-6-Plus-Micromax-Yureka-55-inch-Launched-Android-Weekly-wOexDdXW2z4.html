to you by Norton security all right so
I've told you guys before that I think
Asia is taken over I mean we need to
start learning Chinese have our kids
learn Chinese because when it comes to
the tech sector China is kicking some
serious butt and that's only a good
thing for us consumers but not only that
you should know that Micromax is doing a
lot of moves and shakes when it comes to
the mobile tech sector especially with
CyanogenMod and we're gonna talk about
both companies today so raise your hand
if you want flagship power at a cheaper
price well last week in Beijing wobbley
launched a new high-end smartphone the
Huawei honor 6 plus yes they actually
called it 6 plus huawei's latest handset
is a follow up to the bargain honor 6
which arrived in Europe just last month
it is a 5.5 inch 1920 by 1080 LCD
display it has an octa-core Curren 925
system-on-a-chip 3 gigabytes of RAM 16
to 32 gigabytes of internal storage and
8 megapixel front and rear camera it has
a hundred and twenty eight micro SD card
slot support and a whopping 3600
milliamp hour battery the honor 6 plus
features two rear 8 megapixel cameras
that allow for advanced depth capture
and refocusing after you take your shot
just like HTC's most recent flagship
similar to HTC's ultrapixels the
Huawei's dual camera setup also features
larger light capturing pixels within the
camera sensor these measure 1.98 microns
compared to HTC's 2 microns ultra pixels
and should help with the camera
achieving superior results when it comes
to low-light conditions
photography buffs may also be interested
to know that the sensors app sure can be
adjusted from an f-stop of 0.95 all the
way to an f-stop of 16 to sweeten the
deal Huawei is offering up to a hundred
gigabytes of free cloud storage and
access to over 8 million global Wi-Fi
hotspots and the option to make use of
the company's own soft sim data roaming
subscription service soft SIM will start
up exclusively in China for the first
quarter of 2015 and offers access to
data for 80 cents per 20 megabytes or
approximately 4.5 dollars per day next
up is news regarding micro Max's new
phablet micro Max's first phone released
under the U brand launched last week in
India bringing solid specs and
CyanogenMod at a price tag of
approximately 140 bucks called Eureka
the 5.5 inch smartphone will go against
other budget-minded devices available in
India including phones from Zeo me and
oneplus as well as the Google sponsored
Android one Eureka is the first device
besides the oneplus one to run
CyanogenMod over which Micromax secured
exclusive rights in india preventing
oneplus to continue sales in the fast
growing market now think about it that
is pretty impressive specs for 140 bucks
what do you guys think now what many
people have hope for is a fusion of
Google Hangouts and Google Voice and it
is happening a few months ago the whole
world rejoiced as Google finally began
integrating hangouts with Google Voice I
say began integrating because they never
really finished the process while all of
that changed as of last week because
Google is pushing out an update to the
Google dialer app that allows the system
to recognize that it's an actual phone
dialer once you grab the update through
Google Play head to the phone number in
the application click it and you should
be prompted to either use the Hangouts
dialer or the stock phone app now I know
many of you just got Android L or
Android lollipop but it turns out we
have some news regarding Android m and
it's good news for those of us who drive
with our beloved Android phones Android
auto was formally announced earlier this
year as Google's big push into
automobiles the platform doesn't
actually bring Android to your car
directly but instead provides a software
layer according to a report from routers
the next version of Android dubbed
Android M won't just play nice with
vehicle information systems it'll serve
as the brains of the operation
reportedly Android M will arrive next
year or so as a special version of the
OS will be designed specifically for
installation into the
while it's likely the interface and
features will be mostly the same as
Android auto the big difference is that
we won't need our smartphones to access
these features alright so I want to know
what you guys think if you think you
know 20-30 years ago our automobile
market was totally dominated by what we
call domestic cars here in North America
Ford Chrysler and GM see and then you
know foreign manufacturers like Toyota
and Honda just made a huge push and now
dominate the market even here they're
still very very popular and they're
considered you know true or not they're
considered a little better than our
domestic vehicles so will the same thing
happen when it comes to our beloved
wearables and and mobile devices I hope
so because competition is a fantastic
thing what do you guys think thanks for
watching and word army my name is Jace
and I would love to connect with you
right here on Google+ or Twitter
I read all my at replies and comments
and I respond to as many as I can you
don't want to forget about my brothers
and Android right over there Josh Joe
and the tech ninja Kevin lawn and Chris
Gary Nash all working really hard to
deliver the best Android content on the
web I shall see you next week on Android
