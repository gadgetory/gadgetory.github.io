HTC as much in 2017 as now it's all
about creating a device that puts you
first into JV tech T what's going on
everybody and this is your first look at
the HTC u ultra and the you play as the
name suggests the HTC U is a brand new
line for the company and it also serves
as their flagship for 2017 however at
the meeting at the CES 2017 we were not
really able to get any videos of the
phones we only got still images so I'm
going to talk through what really makes
these phones tick and then give you a
snapshot quite literally of what they're
like what you're seeing here is a quick
shot between the U ultra nd you play now
you can see that both of them have a
quite radical change in design when
compared to the HTC 10 the you play is
more akin to the HTC 10 in terms of size
as it has a 5.2 inch full HD display on
the other hand that you ultra the
flagship of the two has the quad HD
display with a large 5.7 inch size
HTC really went beyond the metal
construction that we might all be used
to from them and went for a completely
different way in their liquid surface
design essentially it's a somewhat
translucent but highly reflective piece
of glass that reflects just about
anything that comes in front of it
it makes for a very unique looking
device that changes with its environment
and it was also a little bit tough to
photograph as you can see here you can
see me in the reflection more often than
not what I'm trying to get these shots
underneath the hood that you ultra has
pretty much everything you would expect
from a current flagship the Snapdragon
820 one with four gigabytes of RAM and
expandable storage to go on top of the
64 or 128 gigabytes that are built in
the cameras are a big deal here as HTC
is really putting the best that they can
possibly put on both sides of the camera
the main camera on the U ultra is a 12
megapixel ultra pixel 2 camera with 1.5
5 micron pixels now of course those
larger pixels will mean that you can get
better low-light however it comes with
phase detection autofocus this time
around which is a feature that was
missing in the HTC 10 alongside the
laser autofocus where there are some
changes however are in the front camera
16 megapixels with an ultra pixel mode
essentially what will happen is that the
pixels will band together and instead of
a 16 megapixel shot
you'll get a four ultrapixel shot which
will help with low-light as well
boomsound is still available on these as
far as the built-in speakers go but as
you're going to see in these pictures
neither of these phones has a headphone
jack and a 3000 milliamp hour battery
power is everything hopefully to bring
good longevity even though it can be
charged using qc3 however probably the
main addition to this phone is a
secondary display above the main one
that is a little bit like the v10 in the
V 20 from LG essentially this secondary
display is supposed to give more
information not just your notifications
but also all of the different minders
and different notifications that come
from the Assistant API that is backed by
HTC zone sense companion the Sense
companion takes the Google Assistant
that is available in Android 7.0 nougat
and helps make it even better by
providing information about you not only
will it check in with you about certain
pieces of information but will also pull
data from different applications in
order to get a better contextual idea of
what it is that you need at the time now
there are some changes in the HTC Uplay
which is the lesser of the two devices
it already has as we've mentioned the
5.2 inch full HD display but is backed
by a mediatek helio p10 processor it
comes with three or four gigabytes of
RAM depending on the storage that you
get with it either 32 or 64 gigabytes
but it does have micro SD card expansion
its cameras are also a little bit
different as well both of the cameras
are 16 megapixels but the front-facing
camera does still have that ultra pixel
mode both of these phones come in a few
different colors black white and pink
with a special edition sapphire blue
available for the HTC u ultra that also
comes in at the 128 gigabyte storage
option now while the HTC Uplay will be
made available in select global markets
the HTC u ultra is available now for
pre-order starting today now obviously
we're really excited to put the HTC u
line through its paces and see how it
fares against the upcoming flagships of
2017 personally however I'm really
excited for the AI capabilities and I
want to see how the HTC Sense companion
already stacks up when compared to the
existing platforms of let's say Alexa
and Google Assistant but we're not going
to be able to get to all of that until
we get our hands on a review unit which
should be happening fairly soon so keep
it tuned to Android authority for the
HTC u ultra
you play an even more because we are
your source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
