Authority and we're here Aoife in Berlin
taking a look at the vibe P 1 1 of
lenovo's latest mid-range devices and if
battery life is your biggest concern
when it comes to smartphones the p1 puts
a pretty big focus on that which we'll
get into in a sec but starting with the
design really quick you're looking at an
aluminium unibody design which looks
eerily familiar to an HTC One but that
isn't necessarily a bad thing because it
is a good looking device with good build
quality it's also relatively compact in
size and comfortable to use in the hand
due to the tapered back on the front is
a 5.5 inch IPS LCD display with 1080p
resolution and so far it looks pretty
good with great colors sharpness and
brightness and what 5.5 inches starting
to become the norm for smartphone screen
sizes most people should be perfectly
fine with this particular display the
phone is being powered by a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 615 two gigabytes of RAM with
32 gigabytes of on-board storage with
microSD card expansion for up to an
additional 128 gigabytes and if it's
like many other mid-range smartphones
being powered by the same chipset then
performance should generally be pretty
good and so far it does seem to be very
snappy and responsive going around the
device you've got the buttons and ports
in typical places like the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack up top speaker
grilles and micro USB port on the bottom
and power and volume keys on the right
side but one of the most notable pieces
of hardware on the p1 is the built-in
fingerprint scanner on the bottom which
is actually really great to see for a
mid-range phone it's a press and hold
type and setting it up is very similar
to other fingerprint scanners where you
just continue to press on the button
until your fingerprint is completely
captured and once that is done it's
ready to be used and from the short time
that I got to try it out it seems to be
just as fast and reliable as fingerprint
scanners on more high-end devices like
the galaxy s6
so if you're into biometric security
then you'll enjoy the fingerprint sensor
and it's great to see lenovo bringing a
feature that you normally see on
flagships down to a more affordable
smartphone for the battery you're
looking at a very
large 5,000 milliamp hour battery which
does make the phone quite big in terms
of its thickness but if you're more
concerned about battery life then the
extra thickness is going to be a fair
trade-off another interesting feature
with the p1 is to switch on the left
side of the phone and this is actually a
battery life switch that switches the
phone into a power saving mode which
lenovo claims is supposed to double the
battery life it's a little bit unique
and something we've never really seen
before but it is there to take advantage
of anytime you want to extend the
battery life even further but hopefully
the battery life is more than good
enough that you won't have to rely on it
all too often software wise you're
looking at android 5.1.1 with Lenovo's
custom skin and unlike the fab plus it's
a little bit more heavily customised
with rounded squared off icons and just
a color for UI in general with a few
more extra features also if you're
willing to give up a little bit of
battery capacity for some splash proof
capabilities and a more plastic design
lenovo has the p 1m which is a very
similar phone but with slightly lowered
specs the p1 and p1 m will be going for
a price of 2 80 and 160 dollars
respectively and will be available in
the coming months which is a great price
for two phones that should be a beast in
the battery life department but that
pretty much does it for this quick
hands-on of the vibe p1 hopefully you
