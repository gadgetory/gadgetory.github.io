order of the day as far as the latest
crop of flagship smartphones but Sony
has come a long way after just a couple
of years removed from the Xperia Z and
Samsung on the other hand has been
following the tried and tested policy
for years now with some new elements in
each iteration so how do they stack up
to one another well let's find out
because it's Joshua Vergara from Android
thority what's going on everybody and
this is the Samsung Galaxy s5 versus the
Sony Xperia z2 when it comes to design
not a whole lot has changed with either
device as far as the aesthetics are
concerned with many elements from
previous iterations returning with the
galaxy s5 you get the familiar shape of
the smartphone with slightly rounded
corners and a flat profile the signature
button layout with the physical home
button is back but there are a couple of
major changes such as the integrated
fingerprint scanner in the home button
and the recent apps key taking the place
of the Menu key the Sony Xperia z2
features the same angular design we've
seen from the z1 and the Z before it in
this case as well the button layout
remains the same with a large silver
power button atop the volume rockers and
then a nice feeling dedicated camera
button is well placed near the bottom
while the Xperia z2 features the same
aluminum frame with tempered glass on
the front and the back the Samsung
Galaxy s5 takes a departure from the
glossy plastic back of its predecessor
favoring a soft touch plastic bag with a
perforated or dimpled design another
addition to the s5 is the plastic flap
that covers the microUSB port and it
helps with the
ip67 rating of this device which is a
first for the galaxy line the Xperia z2
also has flaps for the USB port the
microSD card and SIM slots as well to
maintain its waterproof and dust
resistance nature which has been a
feature of the high-end experience the
Xperia Z now the Sony Xperia z2 is
larger overall in part due to the
display that is point 1 inches larger
than that of the galaxy s5 and the
bigger size does result in a difference
in the ease of one-handed use with the
Xperia z2 definitely requiring a little
bit more of a stretch and the galaxy s5
retaining for the most part of the same
handling experience of the predecessor
because of the build material also the
z2 is also
a bit heavier now this might not come as
much of a surprise to you but if you
liked the design and handling of the
original versions of these two flagship
phones then you're probably going to
like what you get this time around and
in this case we do have pretty much a
different battle of glass versus plastic
so that is the material choice that
you're looking for but at least in the
Sony Xperia z2 we have the continuing of
a look that really only Sony puts out
and Samsung sticks to its guns with a
traditional look and feel in the Galaxy
s5 so which one will be better for you
depends on you your tastes when it comes
to the displays we do see a slight bump
up in terms of size for both of these
phones but great quality either way you
get a beautiful 5.1 inch Super AMOLED
display in the galaxy s5 with 1080p
resolution and 432 PPI which gives you
everything you'd expect including the
crispness color vibrancy contrast and
brightness that you would expect
now colors do pop and as I usually say
the saturation is so high that the
colors pretty much jump out of the phone
and punch you in the face and it is
perfect for the bright and colorful
TouchWiz UI the viewing angles are also
pretty fantastic here as well with
things being pretty clear even at Steve
viewing angles the Sony Xperia z2
features a slightly larger 5.2 inch
display also with 1080p resolution now
in in terms of trying to fix some of the
issues with the display of its
predecessor Sony added in a live color
LED technology alongside the triluminos
and x-reality engine basically what this
means is that the screen has extra
colors added into the LCD matrix
resulting in a display with an even
wider color gamut colors that were once
slightly washed out are now incredibly
vivid along with much better viewing
angles the Sony Xperia z2 shows a
massive improvement from previous
iterations of the Xperia screens however
the galaxy s5 continues the tradition
that the Super AMOLED technology has
continued to uphold so in that case we
will say that it's kind of a toss up
here as you might get a little bit
better saturation in the colors in the
galaxy s5 but the z2 is no slouch at all
and plus 0.1 inches is not really that
much of a difference in terms of size
anyway now when it comes to performance
we have what is pretty much required of
either of these devices because both
features the best processing package
currently available the Snapdragon 801
processor with this galaxy s5 rocking it
at 2.5 gigahertz compared to 2.3
gigahertz in the Xperia z2 the audrina
330 GPU is also in both as well
now the Sony Xperia z2 does feature 3
gigabytes of RAM compared to the two
found in the s5 but both should be able
to handle multitasking very easily now
we found really no issues with
performance at all with either device
with the Sony Xperia z2 continuing the
tradition of minimalistic but still fast
when you keep it simple you keep it fast
operating system in the Xperia or
Timescape you I now TouchWiz often gets
knocked down for having some lag or
stutter issues but we found it to be as
seldom as it has been ever in this
iteration of the UI so really you can
take your pick here it just really comes
down to which avenue of multitasking or
even just the kind of look that you want
from your UI now in hardware we'll start
off with the galaxy s5 because it pretty
much features every piece of hardware
you might be able to imagine to put into
a smartphone as has been Samsung's
milieu for quite a while a micro SD card
slot NFC and IR blaster and even new
additions such as the finger scanner and
the heartrate monitor you also get a
full range of connectivity options for
both though the Sony Xperia z2 will be
found primarily on t-mobile in the
States if their previous track record is
any indication and when it comes to the
speaker Sony has changed things up by
introducing front-facing ones in the z2
now quality may not have been as good as
we may have expected but they are still
leaps and bounds better than the Galaxy
s5 having a decent speaker times 2 and
now up front really enhances the sound
and this is a great addition compared to
previous iterations of the Xperia line
and definitely better than just the one
a decent speaker found on the back of
the galaxy s5 you get a larger 32
hundred million power unit in the Xperia
z2 compared to the 2800 milliamp hour
battery of the galaxy s5 battery
performance of both were pretty much on
par allowing me to get a lot of work and
play done in one day and by using the
robust set of power saving features
available in either UI you should be
able to get even more than a day's work
done for
moderate usage and sometimes even some
heavy usage the edge has to be given to
the s5 here though because well the
battery is removable so if you do run
out of juice from the galaxy s5s battery
you can always replace it with yet
another unit the other good news here is
that longevity and wear and tear of the
hardware should be less of an issue with
these phones as both come with that IP
certification that is becoming more of a
trend and finally the galaxy s5 does
offer a little bit more in terms of
hardware with the finger scanner and the
HRM but the usage for both might be
quite limited for most users out there
so we wouldn't necessarily say that they
are top selling points for the galaxy s5
nor would they be real selling points to
put it over the Xperia z2 which provides
a great experience now when it comes to
the cameras we'll find some new
technology that Samsung introduced in
the galaxy s5 while the Sony Xperia z2
hopes to optimize and further enhance
the optics that were already found in
its predecessor as we already said one
of the biggest additions to the galaxy
s5 is the new ISO cell camera and optic
package that brings 16 megapixels fitted
with the new technology that isolates
each pixel from neighboring ones for
higher quality photos you might not have
to hear all of the jargon because
backing up that great hardware is a
software application packed with
features on that is a norm of Samsung
devices but this time around you get
some real practical ones like live HDR
and the selective focus even if the
selective focus happens to be a hit and
miss at times it is still pretty fun to
use and allows you to get some style out
of your photos photos have good detail
and they retain the sharpness even after
zooming in though this is not true for
every case nonetheless the color
reproduction is really great and even in
low light with the stabilizer on you do
get a pretty good photo no matter what
condition you're in of course when the
light starts to go away though you get a
higher level of grain but that's
something we expect from these
smartphone cameras anyway the Sony
Xperia z2 features the same 20 point
seven megapixel camera of the z1 with
some improvements across the board
talking about the app you get a ton of
new features such as time shift video
augmented reality 4k video and even its
own selective focus mode on top of the
superior auto which still I think does a
good job of finding exactly what scene
mode you need for your shot
the picture quality is also pretty good
without any of the smudge enos in the
dark areas that we saw with the z1
originally the level of grain is still
pretty high especially when you're using
the 20.7 megapixel size of the photo but
it does capture the colors very well
it's just a bit of a downer that there
are a lack of options when it comes to
using the camera at its highest 20.7
megapixel capacity and ultimately when
you want to get the best photos out of
here you pretty much have to limit
yourself to the 8 megapixels that are
available when you use say the superior
auto when you use 8 megapixels it does
open up a world of possibilities though
because those pictures turn out pretty
damn good these two cameras probably
represent the closest comparison that we
have for the current flagships that are
coming out you can really but these two
head-to-head and you'll find that with
pictures and either device you'll have a
good time
posting them on social media or even
somewhat beyond if you tweak your
settings just right um so hey you can
just fire up these cameras and have some
fun the ISO sells 16 megapixel camera is
a great performer but Sony has already
had a one iteration to get the twenty
point seven megapixel G lens right and
they continue to improve on it in the z2
and finally we make it over to software
well we might find two different
philosophies at work here we have a
battle between TouchWiz and the Xperia
or Timescape UI now Sony believes in
keeping things pretty simple and elegant
as is evidence from its user interface
which might be a little bit brighter
than previous versions but still retains
its simplicity with only noticeable
editions being Sony apps like the
Walkman or the album gallery and then
after that you have the small apps which
are accessed from the recent apps screen
and allow you quick access to some quick
multitasking however when it comes to
the general aesthetic of the Xperia UI
it is pretty monochromatic it does take
on a darker tone overall but it still
just jumps right out of the screen and
is a very nice looking operating system
that pretty much piggy backs on the
general motif of the stock Android
experience essentially what you have
here is a slightly enhanced version of
stock Android that retains some
quintessential Sony style now Samsung on
the other hand went with in the opposite
direction
typically adding new elements to the
bright colorful and pretty much almost
cartoonish UI the toggles in the
notification drop-down and also the
settings menu have been changed and now
feature a circle motif and
that does make it a lot easier to use to
be fair the biggest addition in the
operating system has to be the mind
magazine a second screen that works as a
News and social media aggregator but
eventually ends up like feeling like an
extra unnecessary step between you and
Flipboard and even then it's not quite
as powerful as the already well used
Flipboard Samsung packs the device with
software features galore with all of the
ones that you remember from before
including the multi window and also
every gestures that you may or may not
use but add-ins things like the toolbox
and even a download booster which
actually does its job pretty incredibly
well and after that you do have the
updated s health app to take advantage
of the heart rate monitor ultimately
we're looking at a version of TouchWiz
that has been optimized and to us feels
like one of the fastest iterations of
the operating system that we've seen to
date on top of that these small
aesthetic enhancements do help it feel a
little bit fresh but we feel like it's
only a matter of time before that
freshness wears off and then we're
looking at a TouchWiz that is still
probably a little bit too familiar for
its own good
so ultimately it pretty much just comes
down to which avenue you want to tackle
in terms of getting your tasks done we
do have the uber feature filled version
of TouchWiz here in the Samsung Galaxy
s5 which allows you to get a lot done
sometimes all at once and then after
that the Sony Xperia UI
which has a more of a stock like
overview but it is also with that
quintessential Sony style you'll be able
to get a lot done no matter which one
you choose it's just a matter of what
tools are available will help you better
while the Samsung Galaxy s5 is available
on all major carriers for the premium
price under two-year contracts usually
around $1.99 the Sony Xperia z2 has yet
to come to the United States but when it
does we're pretty much expecting it to
land on t-mobile one of the best parts
about comparing these two smartphones is
that they're both pretty awesome so the
reasons why you would pick one over the
other might be pretty specific if you
have some specific reasons as to why you
would pick the z2 or the s5 why don't
