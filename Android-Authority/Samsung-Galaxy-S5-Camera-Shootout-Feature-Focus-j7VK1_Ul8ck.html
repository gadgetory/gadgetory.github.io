what's going on everybody and all of the
photos and videos that you're seeing in
this feature focus video we're taking on
the cameras of the Samsung Galaxy s5 but
first a beauty shot selfie and then I
take the Samsung Galaxy s5 over to the
LA Arboretum to take a bunch of pictures
with its camera you're going to be
seeing some artsy photos like the one
you see right here but after that a lot
of plants and flowers along with their
100 crops so you can see the detail or
in some cases the lack thereof but in a
lot of situations you're going to find
that this camera really does capture
color very well and leads to a lot of
vivid photos in the past especially with
the Samsung Galaxy s4
vividness inside of these photos was
really its big meal you and it continues
to be so now powered by the ISO cell
camera what you're going to see also are
examples of various modes like the
selective focus with the NIR focus here
and then the Far focus in this
particular photo and then in the next
photo I played around with the subjects
a little bit to have a bunch in the
front and then you see the palm tree in
the middle in the back that is then put
into focus so you're going to see more
examples of the selective focus in a bit
now let's take a look at some crops now
the focal point in this photo was
actually on the Left where the leaves
are and as you can see the line of the
leaf actually is pretty defined and
separates it from the background now
we'll look at some textual elements like
this gift shop open sign which looks
pretty good but once you zoom in the
Hopa is a little bit blurred and doesn't
have that sharpness that we would like
that sharpness however is found in this
photo where we zoom into the actual sign
itself and find that the text is
rendered pretty well probably because of
the high contrast of the black and the
white and we see somewhere in the middle
with this stop sign the sharpness that
we're looking for in the text as the s
here and the sign itself is separated
pretty well from the background
let's go back to the modes now it was a
super sunny day all over the Arboretum
so I didn't have too many opportunities
to use HDR but this is probably my
favorite example in which the background
was super shady and dark but the high
dynamic range allowed me to really liven
it up now when it comes to selective
focus which I use quite a bit I did want
to get pan focuses in which the
foreground and the background are in
focus but as the software tries to find
the line to draw between the two
sometimes it leaves a bit of blur
between the two particular areas in this
case you can see that blur on top of the
arm of this chair and it leaves a
interesting and kind of hit and miss
type of effect here's my wrist in the
foreground and then when I tried to make
a pan focus here that blur kind of makes
my wrist look really fake in this
particular photo so the selective focus
might be a bit of a hit and miss in this
case it's a miss because you can see
that the red flowers were supposed to be
the foreground but it got blurred out
and then in this case since the lines
aren't really defined in the water it
just had to sort of guess on its own one
interesting feature I found in this
camera was the virtual tour in which you
are able to take various pictures almost
in like a photosphere way moving forward
and to the left and to the right in
order to create a nice virtual tour of
the surroundings that you're in the
video is so small though because well
this is how it is rendered in the phone
at a very low resolution so this is what
it would look like if you extracted it
and after one last peacock sighting
which actually gave me a pretty good
example of the sharpness you can get
from this camera I decided to head off
and grab myself a cup of coffee so here
are some indoor shots using the Samsung
Galaxy s5s camera the indoor shots given
that there's not as much light as you
would have obviously out in the daylight
does yield lesser lesser detailed photos
as you can see in this particular crop
right here nonetheless the camera does
seem to perform quite well and you are
able to have fun with it in pretty much
any situation but the lower the light
the less detail you're going to get in
your photos which is something that we
pretty much expect from smartphone
cameras anyway and now I'm back home
which means there you have it for the
camera shoot up on the samsung galaxy s5
as you saw with all of the
examples the colors do tend to be
captured quite well which leads to a lot
of vivid photos however when you start
to zoom in you find that the detail may
not always be there but in some cases it
is so it might be a matter of keeping
the camera kind of steady or it just
might be some of the coloration that you
find in some of the photos nonetheless
the 16 megapixel ISO cell camera does
help put the galaxy s5 pretty high up
there when it comes to the quality of
its camera and the only other phone that
I feel like in the Android space that
can kind of rival what at least be on
par it either way to the galaxy s5 is
the Sony Xperia z2 so keep it tuned to
Android thority for my camera shootout
on the Xperia z2 as well and also for
all the rest of the coverage of the
Samsung Galaxy s5 stick around and drop
us some likes in our videos because we
love to see those thumbs up and also
subscribe to our channel if you haven't
already and then when you're done with
all of that head on over to Android
