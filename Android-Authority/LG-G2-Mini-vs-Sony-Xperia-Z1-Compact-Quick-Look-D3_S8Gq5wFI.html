by bitdefender mobile security the
shrunken down lg g2 goes up against the
shrunken down Sony Xperia z1 a judge
McGarr from Android Authority what's
going on everybody and here is the LG g2
mini vs. the Sony Xperia z1 compact both
the LG g2 mini and the experience you
want to compact draw heavily from the
design language of their larger siblings
almost identical in fact only shrunken
all around the Xperia z1 compact comes
with the same all-glass design with the
signature silver power button dedicated
camera button and water and dust
protection features of the z1 while the
g2 mini features the unique power button
and volume rocker layout on the back of
the device and the only major difference
between it and its older and its bigger
sibling rather is a move away from the
glossy finish and more to a matte finish
for more comfort and grip even though
the g2 mini comes with a much larger 4.7
inch screen compared to the 4.3 inch
screen of the z1 compact the dimensions
are actually quite similar a testament
to the fact that LG continues to push
the boundaries of design with an ultra
thin bezel on the screen while Sony is
completely okay with the larger borders
around its own as far as displays go the
LG g2 mini packs that 4.7 inch display
with a qHD resolution that's 960 by 540
resulting in a pixel density of 234 PPI
the Xperia z1 compact stands true to its
no compromises in all respects including
the display featuring a 720p 4.3 inch
display with a pixel density of 342
pixels per inch
while the LG g2 mini screen is
serviceable albeit not a little bit
disappointing there is no competition
right now when compared to the z1
compact and once again a comparison of
the two seems a little unfair when it
comes to the hardware under the hood of
the z1 compact is a 2.2 gigahertz
quad-core Snapdragon 800 2 gigabytes of
ram the Adreno 330 GPU and overall it is
comparable to even today's flagships
performance is as smooth as you would
expect the g2 mini comes with instead a
1.2 gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon 400
coupled with 1 gigabyte of RAM but it
should all still be more than enough to
handle most tasks and the camera
department as well the z1 compact comes
with the same 20 point seven megapixel G
lens camera as the z1 and has
with even more software features the g2
mini comes with an 8 megapixel rear
shooter which isn't quite as bad as all
at all but it does come with much less
power comparatively what the g2 mini
does have though is a slightly larger
battery at 24 40 million powers compared
to the 2300 of the z1 compact and
finally when it comes to software you
get the same minimalistic Xperia or
Timescape UI as always on the z1 compact
and while you get the same bright and
colourful Optimus UI in the LG g2 mini
it is packed with software features
which does put it a little bit over the
z1 compact in terms of having features
like the NOC code but being an older
release the z1 compact is available with
Android 4.3 but it's upgrade to 4.4
should give it some enhancements while
the g2 mini will launch with KitKat out
of the box in this case it does have to
do with features as the z1 compact does
come with features like the Walkman and
other a Sony apps that are included in
and small apps but overall it's a pretty
stock like experience compared to the
very full-featured version of Android
found in the g2 with the Optimus UI and
so there you have it for this comparison
and this quick look at the LG g2 mini
and the experiences you want to compact
by Sony now a recurring theme of this
comparison is that Sony decided mini or
compact did not have to mean
mid-range LG unfortunately in this
comparison did not get the same memo
while the g2 mini is more than
satisfactory by itself it comes nowhere
close to the z1 compact in most aspects
that being said both smartphones will be
priced significantly differently the
Xperia z1 compact is a flagship
smartphone for all intents and purposes
and it will be priced accordingly the g2
mini on the other hand is a mid-range
device through and through and this
difference should reflect it in its
pricing which will come lower than the
z1 compact for all of the best coverage
of the LG g2 mini and the Sony Xperia z1
compact make sure you stay tuned to
