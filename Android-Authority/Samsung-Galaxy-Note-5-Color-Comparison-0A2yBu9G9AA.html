Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and s6 edge+
coverage and in those videos you may
have seen a few different colors of the
devices but in this video we're taking
the galaxy note 5 all four colors and
putting them front and center it stretch
of agar from android authority what's
going on everybody and here's a look at
the colors of the galaxy note 5 we're
going to start off with the old colors
the ones you might be familiar with and
then move into the new new right now we
have the black sapphire color that is
really common in the Samsung ecosystem
something you might see a lot in a lot
of users hands out in the wild and
really it still has that translucent
look because of the design of the
samsung galaxy note 4 is taking on that
of the galaxy s6 so it's going to be
pretty reflective but with the dual
glass panel design you're going to be
getting fingerprints all over this thing
but thankfully the black sapphire does
tend to hide it a little bit better than
most and the same goes with the pearl
white again a very familiar color to all
of you out there the pearl white still
looks quite nice and the translucency on
the backing of this and the black
sapphire are actually not quite as
drastic because you won't be able to
really see reflections in the backing
the way that you can with the other two
colors black sapphire and pearl white
are going to be the colors that probably
will be most common and we're not sure
if the next two colors are going to be
available in all places in the West but
we can certainly hope so because we move
into a somewhat familiar color one that
was introduced and became quite popular
with the samsung galaxy s6 the gold
platinum now the gold platinum really
does make this phone look quite
different it has a very different Sheen
to it but its translucency is probably
where I personally don't really like
this particular color it's just a
certain preference of mine that I don't
really want the reflections on the back
to be so prominent but we did hear from
a lot of people already that they really
like the gold and the upcoming last
color and what we really have here is
just a fingerprint smudge a very
fingerprint prone device really on the
backing you're going to have to wipe off
the device if you wanted to look as
pristine as possible as was the case
when we were taking our footage and
pictures of these devices we had to wipe
them down from tebah constantly and
finally we take a look at
titanium silver this is the newest color
one that is being introduced in the note
5 and the s6 edge+ now the titanium
silver is a nice little compromise
between the black and the white so if
you want to find something just a little
bit different without going too far in
either direction this might be the one
for you
but again just like with the gold
titanium I did have a small problem with
the translucency on the back it was a
little bit too reflective and to me
that's just not something that I wanted
to find I kind of prefer matted colors
myself but really it's not a bad color
per se and it does benefit from the
design of the note 5 rather the design
of the s6 which the note 5 is using now
and really all the phones still look
pretty great especially with the metal
frames all around that are just really
garnishes on top of what are these four
great colors so tell us in the comments
below what you think is the color you
might be going for and why and keep it
tuned to Android Authority for even more
about the samsung galaxy note 5 and the
s6 edge+ because we are your source for
all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
