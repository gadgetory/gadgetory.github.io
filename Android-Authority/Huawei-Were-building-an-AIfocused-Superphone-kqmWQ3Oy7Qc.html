future and for them it's all about an AI
focused Super phone that will act as a
double of you speaking at the world
internet conference in China recently
huawei CEO Richard you delivered a
futuristic keynote speech on artificial
intelligence in that speech you outlined
his concept of an AI centric super phone
that ultimately will be in his words a
double of you you then discussed the
emergence of the information
civilization which he says is evolving
in two key areas one richer information
and two more convenient access quote the
increasing digitization and convergence
of information we are now witnessing is
an overwhelming and ultimately
unimaginable trend but it is a problem
that AI can solve so what you is talking
about here is a problem that we've
talked about many times on Android
authority and it's all about the
overwhelming amount of data that we have
from all of our devices and it's only
gonna get worse with the Internet of
Things so how to manage it in a way that
is actually useful and helpful already
most companies that collect a lot of
data don't really know what to do with
it and how to make it actually
profitable and useful for them he's
saying that artificial intelligence will
be able to automate that process for us
according to you this exponential data
growth is becoming incomprehensible to
humans a problem in dire need of a
solution the solution you envisions is a
smartphone powered by advanced AI what
he calls a super phone as you says quote
a super phone goes far beyond making
calls and browsing the internet it's not
only your personal and go-to assistant
for daily tasks but even a double of you
the super phone will introduce a new
information management architecture this
AI focus super phone will no longer be a
passive device meant only for
interactions between the user and the
device but the super phone will be
special because it will proactively
interact with the physical world you
sees the super phone interacting with
the real world with quote abilities
matching or exceeding those of human
eyes
ears tongue nose body and mind now some
might accuse you of being excessively
wordy and vague about how this will work
and exactly what that means but he's
done something very effectively
he has usurped the word superphone it's
not just a smartphone it's a super phone
why would you want to buy a smart phone
from any of these companies when you can
get a super phone from hallway smart
very smart now as you may recall one of
the main software selling points of the
recently announced huawei mate 9 is the
ability to learn over time and be born
fast and stay fast
according to hallway the mate 9 does
this through machine learning that picks
up on your behaviors and preferences and
predicts what you're likely to do and
when using this information the mate 9
might for example prepare an app it
thinks you'll use next periodically
defragging your storage for faster
access or managing system resources
according to your usage habits all cool
exciting sexy even I mean this is the
way we're going a I but I do have some
legitimate fears no I'm no AI expert but
I do understand the basic principles and
my primary fear is that if we don't have
some sort of international body that
governs how and why and the protocols
behind programming AI you're gonna have
advanced AI programs that are heavily
biased think about it if I grew up in an
education system and I only had one
teacher or two teachers and regardless
of how well educated and how skilled
those teachers were I would only be
seeing the world through my teachers
eyes
I need many different teachers for many
different schools with different
philosophies to round out my education
and my fear is that if we only have wal
way programming they're advanced AI and
it's not adhering to some sort of
international standard we're gonna have
problems
just imagine what those are those are
kind of scary so what do you think what
are your concerns when it comes to AI
put them in the comments below I'll be
reading them meet Jeremy Schoemaker
otherwise known as shoe money and he
became famous for this photo
showed off a check that he made from
google adsense and he's become so good
at making online businesses that he made
an announcement that he does not start a
new business unless he can secure the
businesses name in a.com now why is that
exactly
well no domain name extension tells your
story with the same degree of trust as a
dot-com or dotnet domain name.com and
dotnet domain name extensions inject
credibility and your online presence and
who doesn't want to be credible and
