footage about the Moto 360 so we're not
gonna get into too much about the design
however having a round face could pose
some advantages and well disadvantages
but nonetheless I finally have my
version of the Moto 360 and I'm here to
give you my initial impressions on it so
it's not a are from annajura tee
what's going on everybody and here is
your unboxing and initial setup on the
Moto 360 alright and as if to really
drive the point home we have here the
round box that comes that inside comes
the Moto 360 I'll just go ahead and get
started and let's not delay this any
further
there's the watch itself I have the
black leather version so you're going to
have the black rim around the entire
thing and as I remove the actual unit
itself we have a little bit of styrofoam
here in the middle and the watch takes
its form so we'll go to go ahead and put
that right on the side and we'll take a
look at what else is underneath the
surface alright as we already got a
great demonstration on at Aoife in
Berlin with our special presentation
with Motorola we have a charging dock
right here it is wireless charging that
will allow the watch to sit on its side
and still be used as a clock even when
you're not wearing it on your wrist and
here is the charger right here so let me
go ahead and open that up when the time
comes and then be able to charge the
watch and get it ready for our initial
setup but other than that we do have the
manuals right here that come with a
little bit of information but ultimately
that's pretty much everything you get
inside of the box now this particular
unit actually ran out of battery during
my initial setup so I have to charge it
for a little while but I do love the
charging dock that comes with this
wireless charging is great already but
the fact that the display rotates and
becomes a clock when you have it resting
on there is absolutely brilliant I still
think so
ever since Evon brilliant just a few
days ago because with this particular
watch if it's not on your wrist it can
still remain useful but after a short
amount of time I can't really say
exactly how long the watch already
booted up it had 30% battery life and I
was able to continue now what you do
also get in the initial setup is the
applique
motorola connects which will allow you
to customize certain parts of the Moto
360 including the Wellness Center that
does the heart rate monitoring for you
and also the step counter but also
customizing some of the watch faces up
to different types of colors if you want
to really make the experience your own
which is pretty nice I'll probably end
up putting a third party watch face in
here but that remains to be seen but
from there we get into the design yes my
initial impressions on here are about
the same as they were back at Aoife in
Berlin and even before then I Google i/o
I do think that this is a pretty large
watch and it is nice that you have a
very large display on here to be able to
see very large notifications and the
round face does a good job of really
exuding all of the nice chronographic
watch faces now one thing I will say is
well it is a round face and I know in
all honesty I do feel like it's like
strapping an Oreo to your wrist but
because it has a very neutral styling to
it then well it's going to blend in with
a lot of what you're already wearing and
with your particular style you may need
to change the watch band might be
something that I end up doing but the
only other gripe that I have about it
yes that black bar is at the bottom so
it's not a perfectly round face but it's
really just a small blemish on top of
what is otherwise a very well designed
product that does look really nice and
ultimately if you are really Billie
aching about that little bar on the
bottom just because it takes a little
bit away from the full diameter of a
full water out round face then maybe you
should just look past that and realize
that the core functionality is still
there it still works wonderfully and
thus far it's still one of the better
round faces that we have available if
not the only one until we get the LGG
watch our and so there you have it for
this initial look at the Moto 360 my
actual units that comes in the black
leather and it's all right here taking
up a nice rounded area right here on my
wrist it is a large display I'm really
excited to put it through its paces
what are we mainly looking for from my
for review is how it interacts with the
third-party applications that I've
already installed in my android wear
application but from there I'm of course
going to look at mainly battery life now
I already said that I love the charging
and I may have to do it pretty often
because if all of the other reports out
there are true maybe the battery life is
not quite as good on here but that's
exactly what I'm gonna find out so keep
it tuned to Android authority for all of
the best coverage including my upcoming
of the Moto 360 keep it tuned here for
even more than that and also check out
my Aoife coverage I have just gotten
back from there yesterday so you can see
my final vlog from there as well as you
can see in the link right on the side so
