and today we'll be doing a job test of
the Samsung Galaxy s3 and the iPhone 4s
these phones are valued highly by people
who use them and sometimes the
inevitable happens and we drop them
these tests are designed to show what
would happen if that happened so this is
the drop test and we'll be dropping both
phones from the back the side and the
front and we'll be starting with the
iPhone 4s there's minimal damage really
just a cuff on the side so there's only
a few more scuffs on this side here but
the minimal damage really just
superficial I think and
is still working um yep pretty much
bucket there is actually a piece of the
front missing and screen is completely
smash it just got glass in my finger but
it does like this touch screen does
actors to work which I suppose is the
bonus home button is fine
look button is fine screen is not so now
we'll be dropping the Samsung Galaxy s3
again from the back the side and the
front there are three scuffs just on the
side of that but really nothing major at
all no cracking or anything flat ones
so from that drop that is so cracking to
the front three however the home button
is still fine and the touchscreen is
working exactly the same so for that one
you see that the screen is completely
smashed and there's no wall screen on
there so no touchscreen action at all
starting to come back helps but half of
it's still completely gone and the back
thing but just get back on now stop
dropping both phones in a similar way as
we can the iPhone although it's cracked
on both sides is still usable the
touchscreen still works and it's still
connected to a computer however the
Samsung is less cracked but the
touchscreen is completely broken and the
home screen doesn't work at all and
neither does the unlocking it's
completely completely broken
