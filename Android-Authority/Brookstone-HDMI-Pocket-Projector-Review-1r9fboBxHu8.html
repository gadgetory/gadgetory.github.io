that I have about enhancing your Android
experience with accessories is this
review about a projector now I never
really gave projector technology a whole
lot of thought much less mini projectors
however after getting my hands on one I
can safely say I'm in love with
projectors now and you're going to see
why in this review so while I just let
the projector speak for itself
hold on
age Joshua regard from Android Authority
what's going on everybody and this is
the Brookstone HDMI pocket projector one
of the first things you should probably
know about the Brookstone pocket
projector is that the DLP projection
technology that is found inside is made
by Texas Instruments if you remember
correctly we were able to go to the TI
booth at CES and we got to look at a lot
of different projectors this happens to
be one of them
so Brookstone for the most part has
taken care of the shell and all of the
other bits aside from the projection
inside and for the most part it's a very
sturdy product it seems it feels very
nice and it doesn't look like it's very
flimsy certainly no parts rattling
inside and also kind of fits in your
hand it's about half a pound which makes
it very very portable after all it's
called a pocket projector that being
said we'll take a look at a few of the
features that are available on here and
I will admit the Brookstone pocket
projector doesn't have too many bells
and whistles but the reason for that is
because the image is actually really
quite good so we'll start off by looking
at the on and off switch right here that
you use obviously to turn the projector
on and off and I should say that this
projector is able to work on its own
it's a standalone projector it does come
with eight with an AC adapter but
built-in is a battery that lasts a
rechargeable battery rather that lasts
for two hours and that should be enough
for most movies or even presentations if
you happen to be using this projector
for that so there is a little bit of
power that's packed into here but you
can always keep it plugged in in order
to leave it on also there are some touch
sensitive buttons right here left and
right for volume because there are
actually two stereo speakers on here and
even though it's a nice feature to have
on a small projector like this really
you might want to just use the speaker's
that you might have built into either
your computer if you haven't connected
there or to your Android device and just
sort of forgo this however there is also
an audio port on the back that you can
use in order to connect it to an
external speaker also I should say that
the built-in menu while you are
projecting your image is
nonexistent actually because this button
in the middle here just kind of changes
the way that text is displayed on the
screen by putting into a presentation
mode or a regular mode coming around to
the front you see that the projection
comes out there here obviously but also
I have to say that this Brookstone
projector is capable of showing display
resolutions of up to 1080p now that's
quite a feat when you are working let's
say on a computer and you can change the
resolution from 480p 720p to 1080p all
and all the resolutions in between
however I will say that the native
display on this is actually 480p so when
you're moving the projector back you're
trying to get take advantage of that
1080p display you are going to be losing
a little bit of crispness a little bit
of sharpness because it's native
resolution is 480p that being said
though the way that it scales that image
up and when your projector is far away
from the wall in order to get that up to
60 inch diagonal screen display it does
look still quite very good I have had a
lot of fun watching different videos on
this I even got a little bit of video
editing done with it and there was a lot
to like about the image that comes out
of this and that good image is due to
the light rating that is available from
this projection it comes in at 85 lumens
which is actually quite good for a small
projector like this the lower the lumen
rating is the easier it is to mess up an
image when you turn on lights say in a
room or something like that
most projectors required you to have the
lights off in order to make sure the
image looks really good in this case
yeah it is obviously the optimal but if
the lights are on in your room and it's
not too powerful the external lights
that you have then the image should
still come up quite well
and then we come around to the back and
you'll see that the Brookstone HDMI
pocket projector as it says in its name
only has one available output and that
is HDMI that being said this product
does come with quite a with a couple
adapters so that you can use the
included HDMI cord on a few different
places
there's mini and micro HDMI ports for
example the Nexus 10 has a micro HDMI
port and I was able to use this
projector to display
well Game of Thrones on to
so it is still a little bit of a
versatile port to have but there is only
one there and if you see this USB port
on the side it's a little bit misleading
but it does provide for a feature that
you might not find on small pocket
projectors like this the two hour
battery inside of here is actually able
to power other devices like a smartphone
having this in your bag allows for an
extra charger on the side and that's
actually kind of cool and what we're
actually finally going to look at is
what's on the bottom and that's a small
area that you can connect a tripod plate
to as you can see as you saw rather
earlier in the video I was using it on
an old tripod that I don't really use
anymore but now has found a usage for
being the projector stand just getting
the plate on there and then after that
and it's right on to the tripod and
there you go and so there you have it
the HDMI pocket projector by Brookstone
is available for $2.99 at your local
Brookstone or pretty much found anywhere
on the Internet
I can guarantee you give this projector
that one try and I'm pretty sure you're
going to get hooked so that's all from
me Josh if a guard from Android
Authority and I want to remind all of
you that we have videos coming up all
the time on our YouTube page and that
you can subscribe by clicking the link
that appears right here so I hope you
guys enjoyed the review and I will see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
