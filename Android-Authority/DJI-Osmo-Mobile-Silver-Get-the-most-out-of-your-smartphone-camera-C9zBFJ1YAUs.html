and the footage you're seeing right now
was taken using a nexus 6p connected to
the DJI Osmo mobile silver now this
brand new update to the Osmo mobile
smartphone gimbal was announced at CES
2017 and the guys over a DJI were happy
to let us test it out by doing a booth
tour with it
you can see that video over at charge a
oh and it is hosted by none other than
our very own Jonathan Feist however
let's take a quick look at the actual
device itself if you have a DJI Osmo
mobile then there's a lot that is
familiar here there are a few people in
the android authority team that love
this gimbal I have one myself and it's a
great way of getting stabilized footage
from just about any smartphone because
you can use the native camera app and
let the gimbal just stabilize the
footage no matter what kind of movement
you're doing the alamo will silver will
be priced very similarly to the original
Osmel mobile however there are a couple
of enhancements the main one is that
there has been some tweaking to the
gimbal itself that way it should be able
to provide just a bit more stabilized
footage however for the iOS users out
there it is now able to use filmic Pro
as its native application you don't
necessarily have to use the DJI Go app
in order to unlock the full potential of
the device that way you'll have manual
controls in the actual camera app itself
along with using the controls that are
found on the hand grip of the Osmo
mobile itself hopefully we're going to
see that kind of functionality come to a
couple of applications that are
available if you want to replace the
camera app in the Android software off
your smartphone and of course because it
is the Osmo mobile silver it comes in
this lovely looking color which in my
opinion actually looks different enough
to make it kind of enticing the black on
black that the original Osmo mobile has
is definitely a little bit more
inconspicuous but the silver really does
pop out and it does look quite nice at
least in my opinion users have to get
the smartphone balanced inside of the
Osmo mobile silver before they can turn
it on you basically do that by
tightening the different knobs in order
to make sure that when you hold the Osmo
mobile up right to the phone stays in a
neutral position and then you can turn
on the device using the little slider on
the side and it's
the same experience as the Osmo mobile
essentially you can use the native
camera application and then just move
your arm around and you'll be able to
get stabilized footage however you
really unlock the best about this gimbal
by using the DJI Go app the DJI go for
app in particular from the Play Store
works really well on here and even
though it can be a little bit buggy at
times we have seen improvements on it
since the original Osmo mobile the thumb
easily hits the joystick on the front
portion of the Algenol mobile silver and
then there are buttons for recording or
taking pictures which makes using the
device really easy and then of course
there's the trigger on the back that
after a couple of presses will allow you
to reposition the gimbal or if you hold
onto the trigger you'll be able to keep
it looking forward even if you move up
and down and left to right so you can
track your different subjects in the
frame overall we're happy to see this
update to the Osmo mobile to the silver
edition even though the main thing that
it got was a new coat of paint however
with this new version of the oz on
mobile silver we will move forward with
our review of the original Osmo mobile
as there are a few people on our team
who do love using it as their vlogging
companion for their smartphones no
matter what smartphone you have you can
always do well to have stabilized
footage and it just makes videos in
general that much more
professional-looking so to that end the
Osmel mobile and the other mobile silver
now could be a great addition to your
overall smartphone life if you really
want to be able to do video in a very
professional way keep it tuned to
android authority for even more our
coverage of CES 2017 is ongoing we do
have a few more things to show you from
the Consumer Electronics Show of 2017 so
keep it tuned here and remember to drop
