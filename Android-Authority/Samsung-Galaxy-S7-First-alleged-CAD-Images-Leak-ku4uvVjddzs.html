domain.com yes we have the alleged
leaked images of the much-anticipated
Galaxy s7 let's vet them ok I'm going to
dissect these images to see what we may
be dealing with provided that they are
accurate first off based on the image of
the front of the device it suggests that
the Galaxy s7 will make use of the USB
type-c taking a look at the bottom side
of the device shows clearly a
symmetrical elongated ovular port for
charging and second the image suggests
that the home button will be an
elongated rectangular shape the galaxy
s6 had used a larger more ovular button
and third diamond suggests that the
overall front of the design of the s7
will be essentially the same as the s6
the glass back looks to be 4.5 d with a
metal perimeter and separated volume
buttons and finally the front camera
will be located at the extreme right
side of the upper bezel now based on the
alleged second image the Galaxy s7 will
once again have a side loading SIM tray
located on the right side of the device
towards the bottom of an elongated
ovular structure that is clearly visible
and second the camera module will
protrude from the device again the bump
actually looks somewhat larger than it
did on the Galaxy s6 and based on the
final image the s7 will indeed have an
IR port the bezels on the side look
extremely small the rectangular home
button can once again be seen and a USB
2.0 port is clearly visible now I t
skins the case manufacturer that
originally posted these renders has
since taken the post down but they did
suggest that the Galaxy s7 would be
roughly the same dimensions in size as
the s6 but it also suggested that there
would be a galaxy s seven plus which
would be likely close to six inches in
size now the idea of having a 6-inch s7
does address one of the chief criticisms
that many had about the galaxy s6 edge+
and that was that it should have been
released along with the s6 originally or
at least immediately afterwards this
would have allowed people the major
choice of size differences right away
instead of surprising hardcore Samsung
fans later in the summer and I've got to
agree with that none of the information
leaked provided
any details about the Galaxy s7 edge
widely believed to be in development
given the similarity between the Galaxy
s7 renders and the galaxy s6 it would be
a logical conclusion to assume that the
Galaxy s7 edge will thus closely
resemble its predecessor as well the
other major issue is the lack of a
microSD card slot this issue
particularly angered some Samsung
loyalists along with a lack of removable
battery however there are rumors
suggesting that the s7 will indeed have
a micro SD card slot however at this
stage it would clearly not be
accomplished by a dedicated door on the
phone alright for those of you who are
new to how this works I should explain
two things 1i t skins posted this there
are a case manufacturer and then they
took it down right away indicating that
it could have just been a mistake or
they could have discovered that it was a
fake but the second option and in my
opinion the far more plausible is that
this is part of the marketing drip that
manufacturers like Samsung have become
masters at where they leak out little
bits of intriguing information like this
that gives people like me content to
produce that people like you love to see
leaks and rumors it's all good stuff
it's part of their marketing strategy
building up to the official launch what
do you guys think we had our poll posted
on the website you can see here what
most of you thought let me know what you
thought in the comments below you know

but in almost every case when some user
or potential client was looking for my
website what do they do they typed com
