Clayton over at Android Authority calm
today I've got a roundup of a few of the
best keyboards available for Android
phones and tablets I'm gonna be using my
tablet today because more often than not
people find difficulty in typing on
their screen of their tablet with this
dock keyboard so without further ado I
want to show a few of the keyboards that
we have today we've got our Logitech
keyboard our SwiftKey tablet X keyboard
our sliding keyboard our thumb keyboard
and then we've got an Ice Cream Sandwich
keyboard installed now for the sake of
typing I'm going to be using the color
note application and I'm just gonna show
you the keyboards functionalities from
here actually keep in mind we're going
to want to go to our settings and when
we select our settings we're going to
want to make sure that we have all of
our different input methods configured
we'll go to our language and input
settings here and we can configure our
logic type keyboard here our thumb
keyboard swift key tablet X and Ice
Cream Sandwich keyboard as well slide it
will do that just by pressing the little
check bars there and well that'll get us
activated anyways going back we'll go to
our color note application and you can
see here that we have our swift key
tablet X keyboard running now this is
very cool because for the tablet
application it actually allows you to
have these smaller keys so we have our
thumb typing and when we type something
it actually comes up with some
predictions so if we wanted to actually
type thumbnail instead of thumb we could
just set select that and it actually
gives us predictions of what it thinks
we should type next anyways we have our
settings here for the SwiftKey tablet X
which I will click here and we have our
settings our share voice input support
so we'll go to our settings and we have
our languages and layouts
personalization theme advanced SwiftKey
stats
quick tip support and about SwiftKey
tablet x anyways we have our languages
in layouts I downloaded the English pack
our personalization is where we can
learn from Facebook it'll learn the
words that we've typed into Facebook as
well as Gmail Twitter or I can do it
from our RSS feed we've changed the
theme right now my theme is neon but I'm
gonna go back to a light theme here for
the sake of the video we have our
different typing styles we can
choose what our typing style is whether
it be precise or rapid and that we can
choose where our space part does I'm
actually gonna choose always insert a
space because I don't really like it
when it completes the word for me when
tapping the spacebar we can choose what
our quick peer double tapping the
spacebar does and now it's actually
gonna answer a period for us now we can
choose whether or not we want it to do
that so as auto caps and haptic feedback
we can have voice recognition key for
speaking into our Android device and
having it to recognize our voice and
type out what we're saying anyways our
SwiftKey tablet X stats is it tells us
how much of our efficiency has proved
improved by using the Swift SwiftKey
tablet X keyboard and it has saved 70
keystrokes anyway so I'll go back to the
keyboard and now we have our light theme
so we can type around on that and when
we tap type the number key here is when
we get our numbers and we can actually
get all of our punctuation here and then
here the rest of our symbols with some
Smiley's and/or other like math symbols
brackets and US and currency symbols
there anyways when we press ENTER we can
go back to this and we can choose the
switch between a regular and split
keyboard so here would be our regular
keyboard
keyboard and with doing that we can just
go back and forth between the some
keyboard application and the regular
keyboard application so anyways what I'm
gonna do now is click on the little
keyboard icon and choose one of our
other keyboards next I'll just choose
our slide at keyboard now this is a one
that actually is modeled after the swipe
styling of typing so what you're gonna
do here is just slide it so we can go
and we have typed slide now we can
choose everything that we want if we if
we didn't want slide we can choose the
one we did wants so this is how you type
on that you just would go from letter to
letter in a swiping fashion kind of like
the stock swipe application but this has
a lot more functionality
anyways that we have our voice
recognition here we can go to our
symbols here and we have four different
pages of symbols anyways when we click
the slide it we can choose whether or
not we just want to type or if we want
to actually slide it and this is our
different bar here for going down in our
suggestions anyways we'll go here and we
have our English language selected we
can go to our settings as you can see
here this basically shows us the
language settings and here's all of the
available languages there's plenty and
we can backup restore or remove our
application so if we go into the
settings of our slide at keyboard you
can see that we have our language and
dictionary look and feel preferences we
can share and it has our about slider as
well as the skins and speech-to-text
sort of selector here now if we go to
look and feel' we can change the skin of
the keyboard which right now we have to
slide a 3d but I will choose excuse me I
would choose the classic slide it and
apply now we can go to landscape in
full-screen mode and as well as long
press duration and reset visual settings
we have our audio feedback and our
vibration feedback disabled which I like
we can change our language and
dictionary now when we go to our
preferences we can choose what our auto
space does and what our tapping on the
space bar does as well as auto caps and
special characters and we can finish the
next word by sliding as well we can also
restore the factory settings to the
original keyboard
right from here and we can go and choose
our speech-to-text as well as it import
our contacts for it to know what name we
are typing when we're sliding and we'll
go to our next input method which is
going to be the thumb keyboard for now
this is my favorite for as far as thumb
typing on the tablet anyways this is our
first configuration for the thumb
keyboard and this is actually going to
allow us to have bigger tiles to type
with our thumbs this is in an Ice Cream
Sandwich sort of theme and it gives us
tips anyways this is our numbers we have
two different panels for punctuation in
numbers and whatnot we can go back and
when we click on this it can give us our
voice recognition and it can also give
us our settings so here we go when we
click and hold we can choose the pin and
we can choose the tips bar here and we
have our general keyboard settings and
our select layout I'm going to go to the
Select layout and you can choose whether
or not it's a phone split - this works
for the phone tablet layout and I'm
going to choose the 10 10 - 9 inch
tablet layout because this is a 10.1
inch tablet so now this is really
functional we have a really cool
keyboard
and see it gives us all of these
different suggestions so I'll choose
keyboard and with these you can just
choose and you'll get your different
punctuation with your numbers here that
you can hit with your right thumb and go
back and when you're in the thumb
keyboard split here you can choose your
different layouts and I'm not going to
show the message again and so we can
choose it to have an entire thumb
keyboard here for our right hand we can
choose the full layout keyboard and then
we can choose our split thumb keyboard
so this is a really good keyboard if you
want the thumb functionality it's really
fast and easy to use and I find myself
using it a lot this is the one I return
to all the time so we'll go on to our
next one now and our next one is going
to be the Logitech keyboard now with the
rajah type keyboard this keyboards
functionality is it actually learns
where your hands are typing to give you
more of a fluid approach to typing and a
more customized approach so anyways we
can start typing here's our spacebar we
just tap with this and if we go over
like this it gives us our arrow keys as
well as our page up and page down so
this is like sort of an a computer
keyboard style approach our numbers are
up here and I'll just swipe back to get
rid of the numbers this gives us our tab
so we can just type away
interesting it
and I made only one error which is
pretty good because this is one of the
first times I've used this key and this
is really nice for people because it's
very economic and you can get at every
key you want and this sort of sense you
would after learning to type on a
computer keyboard anyways we'll go to
our next input method which is the Ice
Cream Sandwich keyboard and now this is
the free version with the donated
version you can get all sorts of things
such as a themes and is this is just
gonna basically give you the theme of
the Ice Cream Sandwich operating system
this is not a thumb keyboard but then
again all these keyboards do work on
phones so this would be very functional
if you have a gingerbread operating
system phone but you wish to get the
keyboard of Ice Cream Sandwich so here
we have ICS and we can touch it again to
save our predictions oh yes and this
basically gives us a open up it opens up
a menu here and when we're done we have
our input there and if we were to turn
our tablet on to the other orientation
it would just be basically like using a
phone with the keyboard in the bottom
half now anyways we have our numbers as
well as our different punctuation
settings here and our symbols and we can
go back to the ABC and then we have our
voice recognition and when we hold we
can get to our settings and here we go
to our Ice Cream Sandwich keyboard
settings then we can download the
donated version change our haptic
feedback and our sounds onkeypress as
well as our pop-up onkeypress and with
the donated version we can get keyboard
themes and have a different background
image we can change the height and we
can also change the user dictionary well
anyways guys that was a rundown on the
best keyboards for tablets and phones so
