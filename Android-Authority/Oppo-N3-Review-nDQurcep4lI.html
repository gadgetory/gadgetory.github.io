I call the front facing camera conundrum
but while there was a sound idea it just
wasn't very well executed and now they
have come back with a new iteration that
has a motor in the rotating camera is it
enough to up your selfie game well it's
Josh regard from Android Authority
what's going on everybody and this is
the Oppo and three anyone familiar with
oppa will recognize their design
language here in the n3 made even better
with the smaller form factor than the
original and one but I think its design
might be a little bit polarizing
obviously the 5.5 inch screen size puts
this phone squarely in the camp of
similarly sized flagship devices and
that's a very welcome change and a
weighty heft keeps this phone feeling
quite sturdy as well but the very
aspects of the phone champions might
stand out a little too much we'll start
with the Marquis rotating camera which
has a textured plastic feel to it that
seems out of place compared to the rest
of the device that is made of a smooth
plastic the skyline notification light
down on the bottom might be viewable
from the front and back this time but if
you look at it it kind of looks somewhat
like a hitch or a tiny handle of sorts
on the bottom and the O touch area on
the back though now a great fingerprint
scanner is outlined in a rather jarring
silver frame making room for all of
these features means they had to move a
lot of the elements to the sides and
while I don't much mind having the
headphone jack on the top right as you
can see here the microUSB charging port
is on the bottom left and as you can see
here it's just a little bit odd to use
while charging ultimately the m3 has a
clean look that is punctuated by silver
linings and some very obvious additions
though the highlight for me was its feel
overall a distinct line throughout the
frame adds a very tactile element to the
grip and though a larger bezel around
the screen doesn't always hope with the
handling the side-to-side reaching is
now much better when compared to the
original and one because of the overall
smaller screen size personally I enjoy
the way Oppo made the n3 it's almost
like a bare-bones of a powerful computer
that is generally unassuming in its
looks but does go out of its way to
accentuate its own capabilities the 5.5
inch IPS screen brings 1080p
solution with 403 pixels per inch though
its size is just outside the realm of
comfort in one hand it falls in line
with plenty of the more well-known
flagships of similar size due to their
screens in good conditions the colors
are adequately attractive and the
sharpness is where it should be across
the board and all the viewing angles are
pretty good too Oppo opted for
capacitive keys in the n3 for navigation
opening up the effect of real estate on
the screen for whatever games or videos
you might be enjoying but I had the most
trouble with the screen how in broad
daylight as this IPS performer that
should bring good brightness is easily
shunted by direct sunlight even at the
highest possible settings I had issues
seeing what was going on and really that
was the only big flaw unfortunately for
this screen underneath the hood the
performance of the oppo n3 is supported
by the Snapdragon 801 backed by the
Adreno 330 and two gigabytes of RAM and
this is a package that at this point
might be getting a little long in the
tooth color OS might not be the
smoothest experience as it lacks a
certain coherency in its navigation but
the total time getting in and out of
applications didn't suffer due to his
power the only times I had trouble
getting in and out of places was due to
the somewhat small capacitive keys that
aren't always reliable to use and then
there were some stutters in the loading
of the recent apps screen but in other
respects like in gaming the processor
proves that it can still hack it and
thus the n3 benefits in Hardware the
list of features is pretty significant
with the n3 not even counting the
rotating camera which we will get to
later the skyline notification light
starts it off and now it is viewable
even when the phone is faced down thanks
to a second window on the back my only
problem with it is the same as it was
for previous iterations of this the
light only glows one color a bright
white in this case sound quality from
the bottom outed speaker is pretty
standard and it's adequate loudness can
be enhanced via the Mac's audio
application it is a full equalization
suite that I ended up using mostly for a
nice bass boost when using headphones
call quality was actually a bright spot
as the speaker on the rotating unit
produced very loud and clear audio
without any peaking and calls weren't
dropped on the t-mobile network though I
will say that Internet connectivity on
its LTE network was a little bit spotty
at times as we make our way up to the
rotating camera the O touch area
centered on the back now brings a
fingerprint scan
this is the type of scanner that we tend
to really like the touch version rather
than swiping and it's positioning
definitely helps its usage the out touch
is also a button and after you set up
the fingerprint scanner unlocking the n3
means simply pressing down that button
and then holding your finger there for a
quick scanning this security can be used
for unlocking apps as well you can still
swipe along the Oh touch to control
things like the camera rotation but
pressing down to take a picture while in
the camera was used for more often even
if its appearance might be a little bit
questionable ultimately the ODE touches
function is undeniable and of course the
o-click accessory comes standard with
the package and I have done a full
feature focused video on its
capabilities build quality might be
somewhat lacking especially in its
cheaper plastic construction but it has
been able to withstand my punishment
thus far a far-away directional circle
now allows for controls on music as well
as in the rotation of the camera which
does help when you need to think outside
the box to get a good shot off it comes
free with the n3 which is great but some
connectivity and Bluetooth range issues
take away some of its luster as a true
phone location device when you need to
find your phone but you still have to
use the phone to reconnect the Oh click
to it and of course in battery life the
opal entry has to rely on a 3000
milliamp hour battery unit inside for
longevity unfortunately it kind of just
doesn't cut it
on average I got about twelve hours on
the oppo n3 with the screen on time
being just about around three-and-a-half
hours every single time 16 hours on
average is possible with the n3 as long
as your usage goes down a little bit but
you can also get there by relying on the
power saving features which actually are
a bit too aggressive on processing power
and display brightness in general
thankfully though luke fast charging
returns and this time you won't need
that large tethered brick a more
conventional adapter in cord combo is
used but due to a couple of extra pins
in the connector that opal likes to use
you have to use this combo to get about
65 percent battery life back in half an
hour which in my case was the experience
and now we can finally talk about the
rotating camera which now has a motor
built in for automated movements while
the original n1 camera was made to
withstand a lifetime of rotations I do
question how long this small motor
powering this cam
will last thankfully you can always
rotate the camera yourself even if this
happens obviously the rotation can be
obstructed like when the phone is lying
on a table so positioning the phone
properly in general is important but
otherwise the motor has worked just fine
even if I find it to be just a little
bit slow the application brings quite a
few features in what at first looks like
a simplistic interface until you swipe
up from the shutter release a bunch of
different modes appear including the
returning Ultra HD that takes a huge
photo for a moderate increase in detail
capturing the D focus mode is also
available but the manual mode also
allows you to set the focus point in
your photo which I always find much more
ideal and to take advantage of the auto
rotation in the camera the auto panorama
takes out the guesswork in moving the
camera yourself it works pretty well
especially when stitching won't pose a
big issue in your shot rotating the
camera can be done with swipes and holds
on the viewfinder or via the rotation
button for a quick switch now a picture
quality turned out pretty good at least
to me I enjoyed what came out of this
camera about 70% of the time what I
noticed was that the settings for the
front-facing mode were different from
the rear-facing mode though mostly in
color saturation has the self-portraits
tended to be bluer on the white balance
scale low-light performance takes an
expected hit but the dual LED flash is
available for usage unfortunately it
just wasn't ideal for self-portraits
because it tends to flood the subject on
top of the exaggerating Beauty mode and
in video modes the bitrate could have
used a bump up for better quality movies
but ultimately it's the poor audio
capture in these videos that were more
of a bummer but for general photography
out in the wild I thought the entities
camera was a pretty good performer
especially in the rear orientation where
everything from portraits to landscapes
had good detail and nice colors the
entries camera isn't perfect but it does
improve the selfie game more than other
phones that tried to tackle the same
problem and aside from let's say the
poor video implementation this is
actually a camera I'm pretty satisfied
with as a daily companion and finally in
software color OS returns in this
somewhat updated version and as we've
established in the past it's not really
everyone's cup of tea the obvious holes
in the general Android experience are
the lack of an Abbe drawer and some
better transitions in and out of the
various elements color OS takes on a
more ethereal appearance with more muted
colors but
some flashy features depending on your
theme media pages for example bring
attractive looking ways of controlling
music and pictures what'd I miss
from previous color OS iterations is the
gesture panel that came down from the
left side of the notification drop-down
you can still perform the same types of
gestures on the standby off screen
though like DoubleTap in to wake or
drawing a circle to access the camera
now the way color handles the recent
apps screen isn't my favorite to be
honest as it has a list from left to
right that isn't as responsive as I want
it to be and the notification drop-down
shows many of the features available via
a swipe down meaning you have to pinch
out to expand your notifications all of
this is customizable via a theme store
that is actually quite robust so you can
get color OS looking just the way you
want it to admittedly color OS is not
the most polished operating system
especially when it comes to which
translations but it has gone a lot
better in previous iterations I do see a
lot of people putting on third-party
launchers on this particular phone and
that's not really a bad thing but if you
stick with color OS it is far from the
worst Android iteration I've ever used
though the entry isn't available online
just yet for the West we have been told
that it will come in at around six
hundred and forty nine dollars which is
a pretty standard price but still a bit
lower than some of the higher profile
flag ships out there as I stated already
the n3 smaller size from its original
counterpart makes it fall in line with
the flagship class though it's always
worth noting that the entry is the only
one available now with a rotating camera
and so there you have it
the oppo n3 oboes answer to the front
facing camera conundrum while we are
still waiting for a perfect camera
experience that may still seem quite a
bit far off the oppo n3 manages to do
quite well and improve on an idea that
was not as well executed in the original
attempt the experience of using the n3
which includes the O touch and the O
click accessory proved to be enjoyable
and comparable to its mainstream
competitors as it stands right now you
can't get any other phone that is quite
like the n3 and that's part of its
appeal it is stylish to a fault
and yet opus n3 also managed to succeed
in making the unique features get the
essentials right the motorized camera
comes in handy at times but it isn't the
dealmaker here what makes the n3 such a
compelling package is that it improves
on all that made the previous iteration
different I give the n3 one of our
editors Choice Awards for that reason
because if you want something unique
without sacrificing quality
well the entry just might be the phone
you've been waiting for as always thank
you guys very much for watching and I
hope you enjoyed this review of the oppo
n3 it is a unique phone and that is most
of its appeal but luckily even with that
motorized camera it's only one part of
what happens to be one of the best
packages that I think Oppo has put out
yet you can stay tuned for even more
coverage from us and the wonderful team
here at Android Authority and stay tuned
for CES as it is right around the corner
