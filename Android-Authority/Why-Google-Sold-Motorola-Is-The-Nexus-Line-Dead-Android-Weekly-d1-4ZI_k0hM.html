welcome back to android weekly my name
is Jason this past week the world of
Android experienced tectonic shifts
that's right Google sold Motorola
Mobility to Lenovo and Samsung and
Google cooked up some sort of a deal
that means I won't be able to get to see
that magazine UX I was so looking
forward to thank you do you know
anything about this deal that we yes
that's right for those of you who
haven't heard Google sold Motorola
Mobility to Lenovo for 2.9 1 billion
dollars and I asked in last week's
Android QA for your take on that how and
why did that happen and I got some
pretty interesting responses it's 8 shot
says Google is going bonkers Jack
Johnson goes even further because
Samsung got butthurt and Google had to
sell moto to make babies that Samsung
stop crying and messing around with
Android we also had many intelligent
responses one was from Akshay Paul
Akshay talked about the hardware patents
the need to protect their hardware
partners and also the need not to
compete with those partners Miguel
Gonzales also has some great points that
I talked about here in the show but the
t-shirt goes to Kyle because Kyle
brought up a point that not many others
did Google wants to limit the threat of
Samsung leaving Android for Tizen or
other operating systems congratulations
Kyle I'll be in touch with you shortly
and you can give us your address and
t-shirt size now I told you all I would
give you my take and it goes a little
something like this number one is that
Motorola was bleeding money as much as
everyone at Android authority loved the
Moto X and the Moto G the mainstream was
clearly just not taking to it I mean
there was very few sales last year alone
they lost boatloads of money next up is
that patent price on the surface Google
lost almost nine billion dollars but you
need to remember that Google also sold
Motorola home
motorola set-top box to offset that loss
so the patent cost was really about four
billion dollars when you work out all
the math still bad but not quite as bad
as nine billion so thirdly Google has
15,000 patents from Motorola how can
they make four billion dollars with
money to make that all worthwhile I
think it works something like this so
now when people say Google is using
those patents to protect Android what
does that mean and how does it work
it works like this Google is able to
create licensing deals with their
hardware partners that makes money now
it doesn't make a lot of money but the
real money comes from the fact that
those hardware partners are now freer to
create more Android devices more Android
users because they don't have the same
threat of frivolous lawsuits from Apple
all those increased Android users makes
more money for Google that is the hope
that is the strategy or as a programmer
Robert Eric Raymond put more bluntly
this is Google telling Apple you want to
play silly buggers with junk patents
bring it on we'll countersue you into
oblivion now no one knows that these
patents will actually work as intended
including Google but it does act as a
deterrent and hopefully it will force
Apple to the table to negotiate a long
term licensing deal now for some wild
guesses emphasis on the guesses China
that's right
the Chinese government owns a meaningful
stake in Lenovo and China and Google had
a spot in the past about China wanted to
censor Google's search engine in China
but Google was having none of that now
is it possible that Google's sold
Motorola Mobility to Lenovo on the cheap
and the hopes of softening the
relationship with the Chinese government
and getting further into the Chinese
market yes it is but we must remember
that China has invested a lot of money
in alternative operating systems so that
idea may be Bunko we don't know so you
remember that magazine UX we saw from
Samsung at CES that I thought was so
encouraging not gonna happen
setting multiple sources familiar with
the companies thinking the report says
Google Coke Samsung to consider dumping
or altering the magazine UX interface
for upcoming devices it's not known yet
what Google had to concede in order
to get the Korean company to accept such
change but the concession is probably
offloading motorola furthermore there
are rumors that one of the result of
this deal is the death of the Nexus line
according to elder murders in the Nexus
line by Google is over in 2015
yes this line will be replaced by play
edition now it should be said here that
elder does not have a perfect record
when it comes to leaks but I got to tell
you my gut tells me he's right we're
only gonna see Google Play edition
phones no more Nexus in the years to
come thank you for watching again
Android army there was more news items
that I didn't have time to get to but
I've linked to them and below there's
great stuff about the HTC One successor
the LG g2 Pro there's good stuff down
there check it out you don't want to
forget about my brothers in android Josh
Joe and the tech ninja Kevin please
connect with me here on Google+ and
Twitter I connect I read all of them and
I answer as many as I can and also
remember that we have two shows of
Android Q&amp;amp;A coming up this week put your
questions in the comments below I will
read all of them and try and find the
best ones to put in this week's show
talk to you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
