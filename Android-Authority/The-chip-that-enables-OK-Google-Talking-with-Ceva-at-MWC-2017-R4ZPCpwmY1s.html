authority we're here at Mobile World
Congress
I've stopped by the Sivir stand who make
DSP technology now have met up here with
Aaron he'll tell me a bit about them and
what they do
hi oh nice to meet you hey Larry so well
yes eBay is basically a DSP provider we
provide IP just similar business model
to arms only for DSP so we have four
product lines basically one for image
processing and published recognition in
your network stuff like that one for
audio and voice and sensing technologies
another one for cellular technologies
and another one for connectivity that
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi so it all comes in
the form of IP where you can integrate
that interior of SOC and here we have
their solution which is actually
integrated into the galaxy s7 doing the
speech recognition so whenever you say
ok Google to your Galaxy s7 that's our
technology inside through one of our
silicon partners DSP group they make the
chip and the interesting thing about the
galaxy s7 is that Samsung chose to use
the Snapdragon 820 as the application
processor now the a20 has its own
ultra-low power island for these type of
occasions the speech recognition etc for
always-on applications and despite that
Samsung still chose to use the DSP group
solution with our deep inside
specifically because of its internal
power consumption even compared to that
low power and of the Snapdragon so once
you look at the total PCB you can see
here
and that over there in blue is the DSP
group chip during the speech recognition
so from my perspective that's a very
important design win indicating of the
internal power consumption of our
solution that's really amazing I didn't
know that that was there inside the s7
so that's that's amazing
and I see here also we have a smart
speaker which is the kind of things that
are coming to our home nowadays we've
got products from Google and from Amazon
you're also in this field what do you do
here yeah so basically it's it's a
similar concept of speech recognition
only that in the smart home space and
smart speakers you want to have the far
field capability unlike smart phones or
smartphones are usually near field
although we start hearing about a trend
of integrating far field capabilities
even into smartphones now why is that
because you have four mics or three or
four mics in most smart phones today so
you could theoretically do the far field
capabilities the thing is power
consumption again the smartphone battery
is much smaller compared to this smart
speaker battery so power consumption is
crucial again but still again with the
our silicon part of this B group you
have multiple design ways already for
smart speakers and the difference here
so in the galaxy s7 for example this is
a single microphone solution in a smart
speaker as you can see here in this
demonstration Dell three microphones and
the number ranges between two mics like
in the Google home to seven mic luck in
the Amazon echo or eight mics like in
the dingdong but basically this it's a
multi mic application and again power
consumption is crucial so that's a
similar concept only applied to a multi
microphone setup and it it also involves
additional technologies at beamforming
acoustic echo cancellation the
reverberation so other technologies
needed forward the far field pickup to
handle all those echoes and also this
device emits music so you have to
consume the music that's why we have the
acoustic echo console
and in a DSP is brilliant for all those
different things you just mentioned
exactly that involves intensive signal
processing so and an MCU or CPU is a
no-go for that type of application it's
not just like a sensor you know like 100
Hertz sensor those sensors those
acoustic sensors they either 16 2 all
the way to 48 kilohertz so and there's
there are multiple microphones in such a
setup so we're talking about multiple
sensors and the horsepower which is
required for processing that increases
dramatically and yet staying low power
which is a secret yeah battery life is
key yeah so now we've come over to the
Bluetooth Low Energy part of your stand
he's got an audio over ble solution and
of course Bailey v has just come out and
this is more low power and of course
we're gonna see this in our smart phones
hopefully maybe next year our
accessories are gonna get this thing so
it's a whole new thing and you're in
that space right so we have where the
leading provider of IP for Bluetooth and
Wi-Fi so we have a Bluetooth 5 solution
and one of the main innovations in
Bluetooth 5 is as you mentioned the
audio over Bluetooth Low Energy so until
now we have audio over Bluetooth but
that was very per consuming and now we
want to have much more much better power
consumption so we have Bluetooth audio
over ble boost or energy and consider
for example in this applications the
hearing aids or in general the hero bus
or the headset market the wireless
headsets so the power consumption is
critical because the batteries are very
tiny especially in the
so you don't want to mess with the
batteries every few hours like you do
with your Bluetooth headset so
perception is critical and indeed the
audio rebuilding enables you to enjoy
audio over Bluetooth but with much lower
power consumption that you could before
Bluetooth 5 well this is amazing so you
are like the hidden heroes of the of the
voice of audio because your stuff is
built into other people's chips and
that's we as the consumers at the end
benefit from that and I think that's
absolutely great thank you very much for
your time today thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
