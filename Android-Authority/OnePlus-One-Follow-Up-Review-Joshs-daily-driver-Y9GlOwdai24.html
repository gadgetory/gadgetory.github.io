and for the last number of days I've
been using it as my daily driver
obviously because well I bought the dang
thing well now I wanted to give you what
I promised you a follow-up review
regarding all of the changes that may
have come from the pre-production unit
that I reviewed - and now the final
production unit so let's take a look at
those changes because it's Josh regard
from Android Authority what's going on
everybody and this is my follow up
review on the oneplus one so I'm taking
a somewhat unstructured look at the
oneplus one in this particular video
primarily because I just want to riff on
the things that probably have changed
and also give my thoughts on the phone
as a whole because we are finally
dealing with the final production units
as compared to the somewhat pre
production unit that I reviewed in my
video earlier on and you can watch that
full review I'll probably put the link
probably right up there and it's the
white baby skin version baby skin has a
material on the back as they called it
and it comes with 16 gigabytes of
storage despite there being a few sort
of quirks and kinks here and there when
it came to mostly the software aspect I
did say that that was one of the best
phones that at least in my opinion I
have been able to review primarily
because of that price point because
after all it's not very often that I get
to review a phone and be able to buy it
and that's exactly what I did with the
349 version which I'm doing the follow
up for in this particular video as far
as the feel in the hand goes it's very
different in my opinion because the baby
skin white the soft touch ish blah a
plastic on the back of the $2.99 Edition
that I reviewed did seem quite slippery
now while it's still retained its good
looks after quite a bit of time with me
handling the phone I will say that it
had a constant issue of slipping about
in my hand primarily because of how soft
that that plastic is on the back that is
not the case when it comes to the 349
Edition because this sandstone black you
probably won't be able to see here in
the video a - - easily but you have to
feel it for yourself it's the fact that
this almost feels like sandpaper but
doesn't great away at your skin
obviously it still has a pretty soft
touch to it but it's just pretty
textured and in that regard it pretty
much sits and almost grips on your hand
you
year then the soft touch of the 299
white edition and it's something that
I've really liked about this particular
phone but if you look around the device
itself it almost seems a little bit more
polished all around and when it comes to
the display we have the same exact 5.5
inch display coming in at 1080p
resolution that worked really well in
the original unit that I reviewed and
continues to do so in this one it's got
nice colors that's pretty vibrant and
actually it doesn't look that bad when
you're out in broad daylight
the screen while very nice and vibrant
and easy to use it does have some
sensitivity issues not necessarily in
terms of just touch sensitivity but when
you have the phone in your pocket and
you have the screen off gestures on for
example we have the circle in order to
turn on the camera which I will do again
right now there you go so you draw a
circle onto the turned off screen and
you'll be able to turn on the camera
there are a few other functions you can
have like a two finger swipe down to
pause or play the music draw an arrow
back or forth in order to change the
track but the one that kind of gets me
is the V in order to turn on the torch
and if I go here and draw a V the
flashlight would turn on now the
unfortunate part about this gesture is
that there have been plenty of times and
I've seen with my brother who has a 1+1
now as well he's been he's been able to
trigger the flashlight just in his
pocket or even just when it's lying on
lying on the couch right next to him so
it's just kind of something you have to
be careful of and if you happen to see
that the torch is going off you really
kind of just have to go into the go into
the operating system and turn off the
torch or you can draw the V again to
turn it off which is okay but in my
opinion it's probably just easier to
keep it off in the gesture settings so
you don't draw that V the only one I
really keep on is of course the double
tap to wake and then after that the
circle to get easily to the camera as
far as performance goes one thing I'll
mention real quick is I've already
catered the interface to my liking when
it comes to my daily drivers but it is
being powered by CyanogenMod 11s the
specific version made for - the one plus
one that is powered by the Snapdragon
801 and the audrina 330 that is one of
the best processing packages available
and it does a great job on here but also
on the software aspect I have noticed
that there are some improvements across
the board not just in some subtle
aesthetic looks which I'll get into
later but also the fact that the
Masha's that I may have witnessed or
experienced rather in the previous unit
are not happening here one in particular
is vsco cam which just would not work on
my previous 1+1 and in this case finally
does in terms of the hardware aspect
everything is essentially the same - the
fact that the back cover is different
but I will clarify something here the
bottom speakers down here as you can see
are not stereo speakers and that has
become abundantly clear in this final
production unit these are two single
speakers that are just working in tandem
doesn't really provide a left-and-right
experience but I will say that the audio
does get pretty loud unfortunately
without a real stereo like experience
the sound comes out rather tinny not
quite as rich or full as before but
nonetheless it gives the job done
especially when I'm doing things that
are performance intensive like playing
games of which I've done a lot of on
here and if you remember one of the big
problems I had with the original review
unit was the fact that the call volume
was really low luckily that was a
software issue and like I was promised
by the guys over at Sargent mod it was
going to be fixed in an upcoming update
that update has already happened and now
we have the full retail version of the
operating system here in this version
and as such the call volume is great now
being able to store a lot of stuff
inside of this nice phone has been
really the the best experience that I've
had because I've made this phone my
media powerhouse not only does it save
all of my thumbs up music from google
play music but also I've made it my
podcast machine in which I subscribed to
a lot of different channels and love
different shows and I make a player FM
save all of them and I have no worries
about taking up so many gigabytes inside
of the phone with my podcast because
there's so much to spare and of course
we're talking about gaming and I've
really kind of gotten game crazy on here
because with all the space available and
with games not really going over let's
say two or three gigabytes apiece for
the really crazy ones I've been catching
up a lot of games that I haven't
necessarily finished like anomaly 2
which I got really close to finishing I
got really addicted to combo kuru which
is a wonderful game and then finally I
decided to catch up on another game that
I did finish back in the old ps2 days
the san andreas edition of grand theft
auto grand theft auto san andreas and
after that there's a lot more
customization available
because of the themes showcase
application now beam showcase is a
wonderful way of just changing the look
of Sanergy model evanesce on your
particular device because there are so
many different themes on there in the
past there were maybe like a handful
maybe a dozen but now the list has just
gotten bigger and bigger there are a lot
of them in there a lot of them are paid
for maybe a couple dollars you could
change the look completely of your
operating system but there are already
some great looking ones that could
warrant that price like for example a
preview of Android L that takes on a lot
of the aesthetics that the preview the
Android L preview have introduced after
that we have a couple other applications
like for example the Audio FX which has
been given a little bit of an updated
look a lot flatter not necessarily in
the knob that was before but it gives
you complete control over the equalizer
for your audio whether it's through the
speakers or through the headphone jack
and it works really well to be honest I
have been able to get a bass boost out
of it which is something I really like
to do with my music but overall that is
my experience with this final edition of
the oneplus one this is my follow-up
review on what has been one of the
greater surprises of this past year when
it comes to our flagship devices is it
the flagship killer well that is up to
you to say because a lot of particular
aspects of this phone are missing that
you would find on other flagships like a
removable battery the battery is still
only on par it's pretty much the same as
before you're not going to get a super
long amount of time from it but you will
get just what you need in a day's work
after that you are missing let's say
expandable storage but that's the reason
why you would pay that 50 extra dollars
in order to get the 64 gigabyte edition
of this phone and finally after that
really it's like the core experience and
it's one of the best core experiences
that you can get aside from a nexus and
I am going to be doing a comparison
between the 1+1 at 349 and of course the
other phone that comes in at the same
price and is one of our beloved's the
Nexus 5 I will be doing comparison
between those two so stay tuned for that
and keep it tuned to Andrew 30 for all
of the best coverage thank you for

oneplus one and remember we have a
giveaway we did one last week and we're
