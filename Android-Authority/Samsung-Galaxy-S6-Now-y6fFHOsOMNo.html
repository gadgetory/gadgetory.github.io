authority and the galaxy s6 was one of
the most radical changes to the Galaxy S
line for Samsung and with the galaxy s7
right around the corner we thought it'd
be a good time to take a look back
how has Samsung's flagship aged and what
has changed since this released early
last year let's find out with the
Samsung Galaxy s6 now
so the Galaxy s6 was a pretty big design
shift for Samsung last year after many
years of using plastic Samsung finally
gave users what they wanted with a more
premium feeling metal and glass build
and unlike these plastic made Galaxy S
is of yesteryears the design of the
galaxy s6 actually holds up over time
not only because it's made of glass and
metal but despite the many competing
flagships that came out through the
remainder of the year the Galaxy s6 is
still one of the best-looking phones on
the market if you forked up the extra
hundred dollars for the edge version
which is personally the one I prefer you
got a phone that was quite unique
looking with the curved glass that
spilled over on the sides yes a lot of
people thought it looked a little iPhone
II but you can't argue that this wasn't
a better design phone compared to years
past and even with the drastic changes
it was still easily recognisable as the
Samsung phone through and through this
new design change did make a lot of
people happy but like many other samsung
devices it didn't come without its
criticisms features that were
essentially staple features to samsung
phones like expandable storage and
removal batteries weren't available in
the galaxy s6 and this caused quite an
uproar among users who took advantage of
these features obviously to this day the
story is pretty much the same and if you
want the most amount of storage possible
you'll have to opt for the 128 gigabyte
version with the lack of a removable
battery users had to resort to either
fast charging or wireless charging which
are both really awesome features but
it's not so awesome when you have to do
it multiple times a day battery life on
the s6 wasn't that great when the phone
was initially released and it still
unfortunately isn't this could
potentially improve when the marshmallow
update arrives but currently if you want
an s6 that has good battery life the
active is your only choice if you're on
AT&amp;amp;T that is speaking of updates the
Galaxy s6 has received quite a few
updates including an update to the
latest version of lollipop there's no
official marshmallow update in sight as
a
but with the beta version of marshmallow
floating around out there hopefully
we're going to be seeing the update much
sooner rather than later
but at this point it's looking pretty
bleak on if we'll get it before the s7
launches the apps edge feature that was
initially exclusive to the s6 edge+ made
its way over to the regular s6 edge
which out of all the edge features the
apps edge is probably the most useful
whereas the rest of the edge features
are somewhat gimmicky or just cumbersome
to use despite the improvements Samsung
has made to TouchWiz it's still not my
favorite in terms of aesthetics but the
best part about TouchWiz now is the
theme store and when you combine the
material theme with a third-party
launcher you can make it feel a lot more
like stock Android which makes the whole
experience feel a lot more bearable the
display is just as gorgeous as it's ever
been and it's another example of how
well this phone has held up despite
always being one of the earlier
flagships in the year the 5.1 inch quad
HD Super AMOLED panel is still one of
the best smartphone displays on the
market and everything from YouTube
movies and games looks just as good as
it did when the phone first came out as
far as performance goes the Exynos 7420
is a beast of a processor and everything
still feels really snappy and responsive
in my experience apps and games load and
run smoothly as they always have but the
aggressive RAM management is still there
which is unfortunate and the fingerprint
scanner doesn't feel quite as fast as
before it's a very accurate and reliable
fingerprint scanner but compared to many
other more recent smartphones on the
market with a fingerprint scanner the
Galaxy s6 is now feels a step behind one
of the best features of the galaxy s6 is
of course the camera the 16 megapixel
camera takes amazing photos and it's
easily one of the best smartphone
cameras on the market and that says a
lot about this camera considering 2015
was essentially a year where almost
every manufacturer delivered a
smartphone with a good camera it's a
pleasure to use the software is clean
and intuitive and Samsung makes it very
convenient to get to it with the
DoubleTap of the home button
I forgot how useful this feature was
until I started using the s6 again and
it no Nexus phones have something very
similar but more phones need to have a
dedicated Hardware camera shortcut
because it makes getting to the camera
that much easier and faster over other
alternatives like on-screen software
shortcuts but that's going to wrap it up
for this quick revisit of the samsung
galaxy s6
