but what's up guys long hair from
android authority and I'm joined here
with my good friend and colleague
arrived gondia and we're here at
computex 2016 and we just got a chance
to check out the HTC vive we've both
used it before in the past so we've had
a couple experiences with it but we got
another chance to take a look at it here
at computex because they had a couple of
new demos to show us so we decided to
try it out and sort of just give you
guys our thoughts on the experience that
we had so we both got a chance to play a
shooter type game but their vote they're
both very different so the one that I
got to try out was basically sort of an
alien-type shooter game so basically you
you had this grappling hook that allowed
you to teleport through various
different parts of the map and you also
had a bunch of different weapons like a
rocket launcher a shotgun and just your
standard sort of pistol type weapon and
basically you're just sort of going
around destroying alien drones and I'll
be honest it's not the best HTC vive
experience that I've had it was
definitely pretty cool and a lot of fun
but I've played some other demos that
were pretty much exactly like it so I
can't really say that was too blown away
by it but it definitely was a fun
experience but the experience that nabob
had I was actually pretty jealous of
because he played a what I thought was a
much better game so why don't you go and
go ahead and tell them what game you got
to play and what it was like alright so
if you guys obviously follow the site
you'll realize that HTC have got their
own in-house development team building
their own vive experiences and the first
game to come from this is called front
defense it was pretty epic I'm not gonna
lie i mean i'm a i'm a fan of
first-person shooters but there was
something uber realistic about it that
just you it's an experience you can't
quite get from say a console game
an example you don't you in an almost
stationary position you're kind of in
this little calm very very small area
but you've got a semi-automatic machine
gun you've got machine garden you've got
rocket launcher you've got a grenade
you've got a fricking bazooka and all
around you literally from here all the
way around you've got maybe I think one
person on the Left supporting you but
then you've just got enemies from all
over in front of you whether it's up top
whether it's far away in the distance
all coming at you all trying to shoot
you and as you know if you get hit
you're seeing like within the VR
experience you're seeing blood spurting
and things like that right for blood
bank but blood splatter so you can tell
you've been shot I will say really
really quite complex to get the hang of
the game to begin with because you
almost like wait which button I mean
that you're using both grips on the both
buttons of the controller so you've got
the trigger button than the other one
the grapple but it doesn't quite make
logical sense to begin with but once you
get the hang of exactly how to pick up a
gun to reload it or you know pick up a
grenade launcher bring it to your mouth
as if you're pulling the pin out and
love it it's fantastic the probably the
most the the scariest part of that game
is where it's so lifelike that you've
got a tank that's literally just coming
in towards you and then it stops and
then the turret comes down and you are
staring this big turret in the face and
you are you know that if you don't hit
it with a rocket launcher or a grenade
you're about to get blown to kingdom
come and when I say like it's realistic
you throw a grenade at it it can bounce
off if you don't hit right it's that
fantastic so this is HTC's first
homemade game if you will call at home
made and compared to I've used vibe
before and compared to the other
experiences this blows it away you can
tell that they've really understood
explain know obviously what the vibe can
do and they've made a game that is
designed to literally make
the most of item yet compared to the
game that I got to play graphically your
game looked a lot better but it also
looked much more immersive but tell me
how cool it was to pick up that rocket
launcher and shoot it because that's the
part that I was really jealous about
like it was really fun to pick up a
rocket launcher to try and put well a
bazooka trying to put a rocket launcher
in rocket in it here this dude in New
Era going no turn the rocket launcher
bazooka round cuz you got it the wrong
way cuz it's difficult to tell and it's
you know it was really cool to you know
where you've got dude shooting at you
from up top to be able to go haha watch
this look just like yeah just go and
bomb him and then it was although
there's something about that game if you
are if you're lucky enough to have a
viable to buy of Ivan you've got you
know you've got the constraints on
shopping usually you've got enough space
you've got a powerful computer get front
defense and then block off the rest of
your day because you are we only saw one
very small segment of that game but if
it's if the rest of the game is anything
like that that segment you could be
there for hours and days on end right I
think it's definitely pretty awesome
what HTC is doing with the vibe there's
a couple other demos to that we didn't
get to try out they also had another one
with like a whole rowing machine where
you could actually play a rowing game so
a lot of really immersive stuff coming
out of HTC with the vibe so we're pretty
happy we got a chance to check it out it
kind of shows that vo doesn't need to
necessarily be all about fun because the
concept behind that rowing machine game
was what rowing machine experience was
your rowing through space which is it in
touch it makes no sense to me but you
are enjoying via it's a very expensive
set up by the way like super uber
expensive but you're enjoying VR and the
immersive pneus of it you know in a
world you probably wouldn't be but at
the same time you're using it to get fit
and there is definitely oh you know
there's definitely ways that VR can be
applied to
actually more than just gaming gaming
although it's what everyone imagines is
the core crux of ER right now it will
soon become very just a small amount of
what you can do with in virtual reality
so definitely a lot of cool stuff coming
out of the HTC vive but I think we're
going to go ahead and wrap up this video
hopefully you guys enjoyed it there's a
lot more to come at computex 2016 so
stay tuned give this video a thumbs up
