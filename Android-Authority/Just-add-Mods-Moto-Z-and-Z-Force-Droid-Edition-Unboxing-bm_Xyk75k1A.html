made it to our doorstep and bringing
some modularity via some magnets but
we're not able to give you our full
review on it just yet in the meantime
it's charge of agar from Andhra
Authority what's going on everybody and
this is our unboxing and initial setup
of the Moto Z the first thing you'll
probably notice on these boxes is that
these phones are only for Verizon at
least currently they do have the Droid
branding but these phones are going to
be made available for other networks and
carriers soon enough we don't know
exactly when so for now we have the
Verizon versions also I have the Moto Z
and the Moto Z force and as you're going
to see in this video the Moto Z force
has more girth to it it's definitely a
thicker device but everything is still
compatible with it in terms of the Moto
mods going through the box contents here
we have the actual phone itself
obviously which we put aside for a
second there and find a Moto mod cover
already found underneath the Moto cover
we'll give it a bit of a look that you
would remember from the Moto X line but
it is one that snaps right on to the
back via the magnets that are found on
the lower third of the device from there
the USB type-c charger is actually one
that is tethered to the block and this
is supposed to give the phone an
incredibly fast charging time but there
is one addition to here that might be a
bit disconcerting to some because they
have done away with the headphone jack
on the Moto Z and the Moto Z force what
you get here is an adapter that plugs
into the USB type-c port and then allows
you to plug in a regular pair of
headphones taking the plastic off of the
front it was time for the initial setup
now the initial setup focused heavily on
the security feature mainly the
fingerprint scanner that is found on the
bottom of the front of the device
there's that little square right below
the Moto logo and that is the
fingerprint scanner but you might think
that it is a button because of the way
that it pops out from the bottom indeed
it is not a button it's not a home
button by any means because this is a
phone that still uses software keys but
the fingerprint reader was easy to set
up and it was very responsive right off
the bat but there is one extra feature
that I saw in the initial set up the
fact that when you are in the phone
among the different screens of the
Android interface you can just hold your
finger on the fingerprint reader
and it will lock and turn down the
device into standby mode from there you
have the Android iteration that lenovo
has put in here for the Moto Z and it is
very similar to those that you found in
the Moto X and any other moto devices
that you've seen in the past it is
pretty easy to navigate around and even
though these are Verizon versions which
definitely have all of these red icons
that you can already notice that's all
of the bloatware that Verizon puts onto
here it still feels like a pretty speedy
and snappy device even with all of my
applications that were transferred from
my previous phone onto this one going
through some of the specs right now it
has everything you would expect from a
flagship this is a 5.5 inch AMOLED
display coming in at quad HD resolution
everything is powered by the Snapdragon
820 and 4 gigabytes of RAM and as far as
the cameras go which we will be testing
more later on we have the 21 megapixel
camera on the rear with a 6 megapixel
camera on the front the moto Z also
comes with a different camera package at
13 megapixels with a 5 megapixel
front-facing camera now on the Moto Z
force there is a 3500 milliamp hour
battery which is much larger than the
2600 milliamp hour battery on the much
thinner moto Z now you will be able to
get set up with the Moto actions voice
and gestures which you might remember
from the Moto X from before and it is in
an app that is in the app drawer not
really found in the settings using the
Moto gestures and the Moto actions means
that you can have access to the ambient
display or the Moto display by just
bringing your hand close to the phone
and you'll be able to take a quick look
at the different notifications and be
able to action on them as well now what
a voice is on here as well and as you
can see I'm setting it up here and with
my Moto X I of course had the phrase X
activate but in this case I'm using
something different because it is the
Moto Z 0 help me out some initial
impressions on just the build quality in
general as you're seeing in this shot
the Moto Z force is noticeably thicker
than that of the Moto Z and because it
has that shatterproof screen it might be
the slightly more desired device
especially with that larger battery
underneath but all of the different moto
mods which we'll get to in a second are
compatible for both of these but now we
can get into the Moto mods and yes I was
able to get the Moto Z and the Moto Z
force along with the three moto mods
that were shown off at the
about a month ago in San Francisco now
this includes the JBL speaker which
should be able to make this more or less
a loud speaker so you don't necessarily
need to have a small Bluetooth speaker
on you anymore and you also have the
projector a small pico projector that is
able to be angled and auto key stones
onto any surface and finally a case by
incipio that adds even more battery 2200
milliamp hours to be exact on to the
existing battery inside of the Moto Z
and the Moto Z force a look at all three
of these moto mods will be made
available along with the full review so
you have to stick around to see all of
that and more here at and rathore decom
so there you have it for the unboxing
and the initial setup and also initial
impressions on the Moto Z and the Moto G
force I have not taken a look at the
camera yet as I'm going to be taking a
lot of pictures over the next week or so
before we put out our full review now
initial impressions are kind of good
already but that is usually the case
when you first open up a box and get
excited about a new device that you get
to use for a while so you're going to
have to wait for our full review and all
of the coverage alongside with it
including the model mods that will
probably show that this phone is
actually really fun to use despite
having a bit of a different DNA when
compared to the Moto X that we're kind
of used to already keep it tuned to
Android Authority for even more about
the Moto Z and the Moto G force along
with the Moto mods and you can stay
tuned here for even more about the
camera and more in-depth coverage on
these two exciting phones coming out of
Lenovo and moto and only available so
far at least on Verizon keep it tuned to
your for even more and don't forget to
hit up our sibling sites via our source
sound guys and tab times to delve
outside of the world of Android but then
you can bring it on back here to andrew
authority comm and our youtube channel
where you can subscribe if you haven't
already because we are your source for
all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
