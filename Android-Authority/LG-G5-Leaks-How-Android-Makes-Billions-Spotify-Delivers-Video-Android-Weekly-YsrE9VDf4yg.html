brought to you by full sail university
so how exactly does mother Google make
its cheddar well it comes down to both
scale and relevancy now before we get
another more recent leaks regarding the
LG g5 let's talk about Google's 31
billion oracle is engaged in a
protracted lawsuit against google over
its alleged infringement and android
over two of Oracle's Java related
patents in a hearing last week Oracle's
counsel claimed that Google not only
makes money off Android it does so on a
large scale to the tune of 31 billion in
revenue and 22 billion in profit since
2008 on january twentieth following the
original claims google urged a san
francisco federal judge to redact
portions of the public transcript
claiming that Oracle's lawyer leaked out
quote extremely sensitive information
now let's just remember that because
Oracle is seeking compensation from
Google it's in Oracle's best interest to
quote their revenue and profit at a very
high level but that does beg the
question how does Google make so much
money off Android Google makes money
from the ads that are displayed when
users search via one of its apps like
YouTube Google Maps Drive gmail or
Google's many other apps and services
google shows ads and some of these
services but it also analyzes use your
data to improve the relevancy of its ads
it serves in other places and because
every phone user has to sign in with
their unique account when setting up a
phone the data is both accurate and
highly personal and thanks to an
exclusive tip from shy mizrachi we have
another update regarding the LG g5 first
we can reveal that the rumors of the
departure from the tried and true tested
G Series design is actually true with
our diagram revealing that the g5 will
be thinner taller and wider than the
current G Series flagships while the
volume button does move to the side the
power button looks to be retained on the
rear beneath the camera and will
seemingly feature a fingerprint scanner
like we've seen on the latest Nexus
handsets and good news for those of you
waiting for the Xiaomi me five show me's
senior VP has taken to Weibo to let us
know that the company's spring
conference is set to take place on
February
fourth well there is no direct statement
from the company we can all assume that
this is about the shell me me five at
least partly the event is set to last a
couple of hours so we might see other
products to hit the stage well it looks
like the king of streaming music is
turning the video back in May spotify
announced that it would be moving beyond
music to offer video content to in the
form of music videos podcasts and
content created by a selection of
partners according to The Wall Street
Journal Spotify will finally launched
its video content service through its
Android app later this week with iOS to
follow the week after I know you're
thinking score Android first this time
video content will land in the US UK
Germany and Sweden initially we don't
know exactly what video content will be
included in the Android app until
Spotify makes an official announcement
but the report states that the current
content mostly consists of short clips
seeming to focus on contextually
relevant videos in order to engage users
that are just accustomed to leave in the
app on the background to listen to music
you know it's become a bit of a clich√©
now people learn how to create an app
but don't learn how to distribute it and
get it in the hands of the people who
actually want it that's where full sail
is going to be a big help with the
mobile development undergraduate degree
program you'll learn how to both create
and distribute apps and if you're ready
to advance your development skills check
out the mobile gaming graduate program
students receive a macbook industry
software plus iOS and Android devices
and if you're ready to compete in this
rapidly growing industry visit Full Sail
