year after year samsung's asking over
$900 for its note 8 device and Apple's
asking over $1000 just to get your hands
on the iPhone 10 and while most of these
flagships are asking more and more from
your wallet there are a couple of
manufacturers who are trying to swoop in
and fill that budget gap Doogie is one
of these companies they've probably
never heard of Doogie but that makes
sense
there aren't exactly the type of company
who wants to spend a ton of money on
marketing their new mix phone may not
have the best cameras or prettiest
screen on the market but it does have a
lot of the fundamentals that make a
pretty good smartphone and for $200
that's really all we could ask for this
is the mix by Dookie now you've probably
already noticed but the Dookie mix isn't
exactly original it's really anything
but if you took a shammy me mix and you
shrunk it down to about 3/4 of the size
this is probably what you would get it's
got that same candy bar style all-metal
design with a lot of screen in the front
and it even shoves the front facing
camera into the bottom right just like a
Shou but isn't to say that the Dookie
mix doesn't have its own set of features
though it's got a fingerprint reader in
the front and even as dual cameras in
the back to compete with the other top
dogs on the market now these aren't
exactly the best components that I've
ever used but honestly they work pretty
well and for $200 what more could you
really ask for
there's dual speakers in the bottom of
the device which are good enough for
what they are and there's even a
headphone jack peeking out from the top
talk about premium in terms of value
you're actually getting quite a bit
there's four to six gigs of RAM and 64
to 128 gigabytes of storage depending on
the model you get and the octa-core
Helius processor it actually competes
pretty well against Qualcomm Snapdragon
835 doogie even include one of those
ring holders which are also popular in
Asian markets though their packaging
could have been a little less risque
usability wise this phone holds its own
pretty well it's running a custom OS
called duty OS which is based on Android
nougat and the tweaks they made are
actually pretty useful Yogi's got a
custom theme store which lets you
quickly tweak the style of your phone
and it changes everything from the
wallpaper to the icon borders if you
swipe to the left from the home screen
you'll also get a custom curated
newsfeed with five different categories
and while I enjoyed it
you can take that as you will besides
these tweaks this is pretty much stock
Android you get all the settings that
you get into regular nougat device and
I've actually already received four
security updates in the last week or so
I've spent with it now this wouldn't be
a $200 phone if it didn't have some
trade-offs first of all the company is
using microUSB to power this thing and
while this doesn't really disrupt the
usability of advice I would have liked
to see USB type-c in order to keep it
more up-to-date it also uses the USB 2.0
standard so if you're trying to use a
wired connection to transfer data over
this thing you're gonna have to wait a
while the cameras are also very so-so
there's a sixteen and eight megapixel
shooter on the back and while I
appreciate the 1 into X optical zoom the
photos that came out were pretty grainy
and muddy these dual cameras can pull
some fancy tricks like they emulated
depth of field that are popular in a lot
of flagships these days though it does
it a lot worse than something like the
Galaxy Note 8 that being said Doogie did
include some fun filters and even a pro
mode in this phone which allows you to
tweak individual settings like ISO and
aperture the photos also look a lot
worse on the phone than they do after
you transfer them to a better screen so
don't judge them immediately after you
take them this brings us to the biggest
feature and compromise of this phone
which is the display it's clearly
copying the me mix in terms of form but
its resolution is the thing that took
the biggest hit this is a 720p screen
and while you think that might ruin the
phone completely I would actually
disagree
sure you're not gonna be doing VR on
this thing but for a 720p screen it
actually looks pretty good it's made by
Samsung and uses AMOLED technology so
you're still gonna get darker blacks
than you would on any LCD panel for most
of the tasks you're probably gonna be
using this phone for it you likely won't
be disappointed though things like
Instagram or snapchat are obviously
gonna take a hit okay I hear you you're
a bit bummed out about the screen but
having less pixels to push actually
pairs extremely well with the massive
battery in this phone the Dookie mix is
sporting three thousand eight hundred
and eighty million hours of power which
is more than a lot of flagship phones
can brag about these days I got a solid
day and a half using this thing as my
primary device though I was on Wi-Fi
most of the time because it only has one
band that supports 3G in the United
States if you're in the UK or some other
places this thing will pick up a lot
more 4G frequencies but my fellow US
residents will probably want to look
elsewhere the Dookie mix isn't the most
premium phone on the market by a
longshot
it's missing a lot of the extra bells
and whistles that make these current-day
flagships worth the extra cash what it
does have however is a lot of the
fundamentals that make a smart phone
really fun to use on a daily basis and
for $200 I really couldn't ask for that
much more if you liked this review make
sure you head over to the full article
where I've broken this phone down in a
lot more detail and stay tuned to
