unpacked 2019 where they released the
samsung galaxy s 10 plus s 10 s 10 e
galaxy has 10 5g and the new Galaxy S 10
foldable phone there are a ton of new
phones here but there are also a few
accessories that they just announced so
the newest accessory that we are taking
a look at right now is the samsung
galaxy watch active now this is a
cheaper model essentially of the samsung
galaxy watch it doesn't have that
rotating bezel so it definitely is going
to be a little lower end however it does
look really nice
this is about the same price point as
something like a Fitbit Versa it's
around 200 bucks but it features things
like NFC so you can make payments as a
heartrate monitor which is actually
pretty cool what is interesting about
this watch though is as wireless
charging capabilities so you can either
throw it on your Samsung wireless
charging pad that also charges your
phone or if you have a new Galaxy S 10
Koski has 10 plus any of those phones
they have reversed wireless charging
capabilities so if your watch is running
low in energy instead of just letting it
die and not being able to use your watch
at all you can sit down your phone turn
on that reverse wireless charging and
put your watch right on the phone now
likes influence other watches it is
running Tizen which means the app
ecosystem is a little bit limited this
isn't running aware OS although where OS
seems to be a bigger battery hog so this
should last a little bit longer if you
preorder one of these watches you'll
actually get a free wireless charging
pad in the box and at $200 that's really
not that bad of a deal so if you want to
learn more you can have over to Android
Authority comm we've got a lot more
pictures over there we've got all the
specs and we've got all the release
details and pricing so I will catch you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
