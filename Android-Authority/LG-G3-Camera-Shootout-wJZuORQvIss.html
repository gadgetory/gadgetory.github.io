what's going on everybody and every
video and photo that you're seeing in
this future focus was taken on the
cameras of the LG g3 why don't we just
jump right in and take a look at some
foodie pictures now this video is taken
at 4k and you'll see the 4k video sample
at the end of this linked so that you
can take a look at all the 4k goodness
but the reason why I wanted to look at
these photos first before I got into
anything is that they already show some
of the low or lower light situations in
this case we just have the lamp shining
down on the Korean barbecue grill and as
we do the 100 crop we do see that detail
is pretty good but a level of noise is
still very easily seen throughout did
you know that Friday was national donor
day well we do have some donuts here in
these pictures and we're gonna zoom into
those as well
here's a picture of some right now
getting really close in there using the
auto mode on there and as we crop in we
do see that level of grain throughout it
is something that we're going to see
throughout all of these crops in these
lower light situations but os+ seems to
be doing a very good job still as we
still have quite a bit of detail it's
not too blurred as the stabilization
does a good job of keeping things at
least under control and in this
particular case we zoom right in and
there is a little bit of a blur on there
maybe my hand was a little too shaky but
still looks pretty good
here's a selfie that I took using that
gesture where you put your hand up and
once the phone detects your hand you
create a fist event at 3 second
countdown happens it is pretty nice to
use as it keeps you from having to
fiddle with the buttons after that we
have Corona del Mar that very next day
where we took the camera out to the
beach to see what we could get out of
there and it's not a full daylight
situation where we have cloud cover as
you can see up there but it was also a
good chance to use HDR now we're gonna
go ahead and put HDR here as you can see
and not only does the sky look a lot
better you see a lot more vibrancy
throughout all of the at least darker
colors throughout the photo
here's another HDR example as we have
the regular photo and then the HDR photo
it does brighten things up quite a bit
as it takes those different exposures
here's my favorite one though as even
though my fingers right there you're
going to see what I mean when it comes
to HDR right here the HDR takes
different exposures and you can see that
the rows on there looks really great it
may not be fully exposed but it still
looks a lot better than the original it
looks really nice with the Sun in the
background
as you probably saw in that video the
stabilization was actually pretty good
as OAS plus also helps with the video I
have pretty steady hands but it's nice
to get that extra boost after that we'll
go into the specs this is the 13
megapixel shooter and I'm using it at
the full resolution at 4 by 3 aspect
ratio while cropping into certain photos
I did want to show this one because it
looked like it was able to get the focus
pretty well but you see that little bit
of blur because it was a moving subject
but it didn't do a very bad job and
that's because of the laser focus on the
back does a really good job
this camera is leaps and bounds better
in terms of focusing speed when compared
to the LG g2 and when you turn on the
camera for the first time you'll notice
that it is a touch to focus and also
touch to capture interface and you don't
even have any elements on the screen
until you actually want them to when you
hit the menu button unless otherwise
stated the vast majority of these photos
are taken at the full auto and it is the
mode that you're going to be using the
most because you actually don't get too
much control over the various settings
for your photos you can change the
resolution you can change the size of
the videos that you end up recording but
after that there really isn't a whole
lot that you can do in terms of catering
the shot to what you need it to be so
this camera is made to be the kind that
gets you the photos that you need
without much fuss at all and you know
what I will admit it does a pretty good
job it went it might be nice to change
the ISO or maybe the white the white
balance in certain cases but for the
most part all these photos as you can
see look pretty good already even on
this overcast day as far as color
profile goes you will see that these
pictures are all a little bit warmer on
that scale but I do prefer that in my
photos more than having a cool photo
because that blue hue that you get on
cooler temperature photos does tend to
look a little bit less attractive than
warmer tone photos which is what you get
on the LG g3 so ultimately the g3 s
camera is a great performer whether or
not it's the best one out there or
something we're going to have to save
for our comparisons when I do camera
shootouts amongst all of the flagship
phones now that they're all basically
out but ultimately the laser focusing
system is one that works incredibly well
and it makes taking pictures on this
camera not only speedy it makes it a
breeze and also incredibly fun alright
let's take a look at the last two in
this final section we'll take a look at
panorama and I'll sweep through this
entire photo right now so you can see
that not only is
stitched together pretty well actually
it is also pretty well exposed
throughout and I will say that that's
probably because we did have some cloud
cover so the lighting was pretty uniform
throughout the entire photo we didn't
have any sunspots that would change the
exposure one way or the other so you do
have a pretty uniform lighting situation
and also the color profile like I said
before has that warmer tone to it and
then of course to end the day we do have
this sunset photo and here it is just
going through it right now this is a
darker photo because we're just looking
at the ocean and all the cloud cover
above but ultimately this is a panorama
that looks really nice and it's probably
one of the better panorama modes that
I've used on any phone that's far
and finally the magic focus it's a mode
that's available where you'll take a
bunch of photos at different depths and
you'll be able to select between all of
them as you can see here in these
screenshots from the interface I did
find magic focus to kind of work it
wasn't necessarily the most reliable one
it may not be my favorite mode on the lg
g3 but at least in this case it did kind
of get the job done making my whiskey
glass better in focus than the rest of
the field and finally to bring it full
circle we have one more low-light test
using dr. Lloyd right here
this has a lamp shining on it and then I
turn off the lamp and you'll see the
grain and the noise just goes all the
way throughout turn on the flash though
and you'll notice that the flash is
probably not one of the best performers
out there it really does harshing out
the middle of the photo it doesn't have
a very uniform look to it here's another
example with my coaster turn off the
light there's all the noise but once you
turn on the flash it definitely does not
look as good at all as the original
photo if you had good lighting because
it's a pretty harsh flash it doesn't
create a nice uniform light throughout
finally my last two cameras right here
with a couple of items in the background
again the noise is all there and then
you turn on the flash and the middle
portion of the photo gets too harsh
compared to the rest so the flash is not
the best performer but it is there if
you really do need it and so there you
have it for this camera shootout using
the cameras of the LG g3 you can see
right there on the left side we have a
4k video sample using a bunch of clips
that I took with this camera so you can
see the video quality for yourself aside
from the warmer tone throughout all of
the photos I had a really great time
with this camera especially because of
the fast laser guided focus and we will
go into that a little bit more with my
full review which is coming very
so stay tuned to Android authority for
all of the best LG g3 coverage and keep
it tuned here job with some likes
