xiaomin huawei you've got options let's
start off with the lg ray and the plus
points are that the LG ray comes with an
8 megapixel selfie camera and a 13
megapixel rear facing camera this
smartphone is powered by a 1.4 gigahertz
media attack octa-core processor and
comes available with dual SIM card slots
and a removable 3000 milliamp hour
battery you can also select g-series
features like knock code unlock and
camera gestures shot the handset is not
without its compromises though the
processor is paired up with just a
single gigabyte of RAM this system on a
chips Mally 400 GPU isn't even a
mid-range smartphone part these days and
the phone doesn't support 4G networks
although to be fair the phone is
targeted at markets where 3G is still
the dominant network technology the
phone's large 5.5 inch display is only
packin 720p resolution which won't be as
clear as other large smart phones on the
market the LG ray is destined for the
CIS or the Commonwealth of Independent
States this week followed by Latin
America shortly afterwards the phone has
been spotted with a price tag of 232
dollars US in Russia and will arrive in
silver gold and Titan black color
options and as predicted Huawei is not
slowing down with the launch of the
Huawei mate 8 it's a big phone Huawei is
on an upward trajectory both in its
native China where it just took the
market lead and in the west where the
Nexus 6p is being hailed as one of the
best Android smartphones available
details are a little scarce for the
moment because Huawei chose to give them
a date and limited launch in China with
a full global debut to follow in CES
2016 the mate 8 features a six inch full
HD display just like the mate7 before it
covered in 2.5 D Gorilla Glass the edge
to edge design and large display give
them made 8 a fantastic 83% screen to
body ratio the display itself was
supposed to be improved compared to last
year's release featuring a color range
that tops 95% of the ntsc gamut
available in Champagne gold moonlight
silver Space Gray and mocha brown the
mate 8 appears to be comparable in
thickness to the seven point two
millimeter mate
confirming the rumors the rear of the
device is dominated by a large camera
module and a circular fingerprint sensor
invoking the Nexus 6p the fingerprint
scanner is said to be faster and more
accurate than the mate s the curent 950
processor which Huawei launched earlier
this month is the first processor to
feature the cortex a7 t2 and four cortex
a53 CPU cores combined with the Mallee
t-- 880 GPU and not to be outdone Xiaomi
just up the ante in the low-cost game
the company just introduced the redmi
note 3 a metallic 5.5 inch are featuring
a fingerprint sensor solid specs and
selling for a fraction of the price of
its competitors in its class the redmi
note 3 is the sequel to the plastic made
redmi note 2 which shall be launched
just three months ago while the note 3
shares some of the specifications
processor display in RAM the device is a
clear upgrade thanks to the premium
design fingerprint scanner and larger
battery the redmi note 3 comes with a
5.5 inch full HD display that xiaomi
calls sunlight display this means the
screen tunes the contrast and brightness
of individual pixels in order to
maximize visibility in bright light the
processor is an octa-core Helio x10
MediaTek while depending on the version
the memory is either 2 gigabytes or 3
gigabytes of RAM with either 16 or 32
gigabytes of internal storage battery of
the redmi note 3 is a four thousand
milliamp hour a hefty bump over the 3020
million power of the redmi note 2 fast
charging is supported there's also a 13
megapixel rear camera with phase
detection and autofocus as well as a 5
megapixel camera up front now although
the redmi note 3 was the main event at
this launch they did sneak in the
announcement regarding the meet pad to
the metal construction of the meet pad 2
is significantly thinner than the first
take on this tablet measuring at just
six point nine five millimeters it also
loses a good amount of weight down to
322 grams for reference the knee pad
original was eight point five
millimeters thick and weighed 360 grams
in place of the previous package the
NVIDIA Tegra k1 is out and in is the
Intel x5 z 8500
this is a 14 nanometer constructed
64-bit processor with four cores and
backing this up is Intel's HD graphics
and two gigabytes of RAM there's two
storage options available 16 or 64
gigabyte options
there's no expandable storage for this
Wi-Fi tablet finally to keep the lights
on xiaomi has equipped this tablet with
a 6100 90 milli amp hour battery with
support for 5 volts - a fast charging
they claim a whopping six hundred and
forty eight point eight hours of standby
time 100 hours of music playback with
the display off and twelve point five
hours of on-screen time but don't worry
when we get our hands on that tablet we
will test it out and prove it to be true
so what do you guys think of all those
new devices coming out let me know in
