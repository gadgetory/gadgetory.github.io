that the CIA can hack into any iOS or
Android device but it gets even worse
than that WikiLeaks has revealed an
information set being called vault 7 and
the vault 7 is a huge trove of CIA
spying documents revealing the full
scope of what the organization is
capable of now we've known for a long
time that the NSA has access to much
more personal information than most of
us want
but recently suggests that the CIA has
the ability to turn any Android iOS
windows or even samsung tv device into a
covert microphone listening in on
practically anything you say anywhere
anytime now I know what some of you are
thinking you're thinking Jace come on
there's no news here you've had many
shows in the past talking about how
privacy is dead where's the news well
the news is that although Edward Snowden
did put a big spotlight on the NSA
especially the NSA is bound by certain
US laws because they operate largely
within the u.s. that the CIA is not
bound by the CIA does not have to play
by the same rules as the NSA does the
CIA is responsible for spying and
espionage and gathering intent
intelligence from outside the u.s. not
inside the u.s. so they can do largely
what they want and they are saying that
they have 24 zero day vulnerabilities
what is that well it is not any bloody
good let me tell you and Gary help me
understand this I'll share it with you
now generally the practice is that when
someone finds a vulnerability in an
operating system for example the general
practice is to give Google Apple Windows
or whoever 30 days to close that
vulnerability to make it safe for the
users like you and me after 30 days they
can share that publicly because
hopefully if the company has been
responsible they have closed that
vulnerability but a zero-day
vulnerability is something that someone
knows but they've not shared with Google
app or Windows whoever so it's still
vulnerable
and they have the power to expose it for
their own nefarious means the CIA is
saying that they have 24 zero day
vulnerabilities for Android this allows
the CIA to bypass the end-to-end
encryption apps like whatsapp signal
telegram Weibo can find collecting the
message data sent through the device
before the encryption was applied to
those messages this essentially allows
all information input by the user to be
collected by the CIA meaning there is no
hiding information even when using apps
that were thought to once be secured but
I said in the intro it gets worse and it
does in the words of Edward Snowden why
is this dangerous because until closed
any hacker can use the security hole the
CIA left open to break into any phone in
the world and perhaps the most
frustrating thing is that there is very
little you and I can do about it what
are we gonna do stop using anything with
an IP address not very practical Wow now
as much as that angers me I do not want
to sensationalize this I want to be very
careful and clarify that for the average
person they are not listening to your
phone calls they are not monitoring you
in your bedroom monitoring your personal
texts what they are doing likely is
gathering all of our data everyone's
everywhere all the time and then they
have programs to mine that data and look
for flagged information little bits of
red flags that should bring about more
investigation so if there is something
you've done in your background or your
history or family or whatever that
piques their interest that suggests that
you might be doing something they want
to know about then they might
investigate you further but I don't want
to scare anybody in thinking that right
now someone is listening to you on your
phone they don't have enough people in
the CIA to monitor everyone with a phone
they have programs to do that through
data mining let me know how this makes
you feel what would you want to do about
it and come on guys you got to be
practical about it you're not gonna stop
using your phone you're not going to
stop using the
it's not gonna happen I mean an IP
address is in freaking everything you
can't avoid it there would have to be
intense pressure on our political
leaders to not only change this but to
set up watchdog organizations to ensure
that things are transparent and when
they are transparent or there's
something happens where someone has
overstepped their bounds and uses
technology for nefarious means that we
have mechanisms in place to fix that
that's a lot I don't see it happening
anytime soon we're gonna have to build
this whole thing up from scratch now if
you are a developer or an aspiring
developer code is your world you create
it tweak it and lovingly obsess over it
so picking the right repository
management tool is super important
that's why our sponsor at Atlassian
created bitbucket bitbucket is the git
solution for professional teams helping
over 5 million developers build with a
purpose bitbucket gives teams of all
sizes free private repositories with
state-of-the-art features like the
world's best pulled request algorithm
built in continuous delivery and
integrations with your favorite tools
like docker AWS and Azure and because
bitbucket comes from Atlassian you get
the best JIRA integration available
bitbucket is for the code that takes us
to Mars decodes the human genome or
drives your next car visit bitbucket org
forward slash for the code to start your
free account
that's bitbucket org forward slash for
the code try bitbucket today what will
your code do
