Authority and I'm coming to you live
from CES 2016 and we're checking out the
Huawei mate 8 this is Wally's latest
flagship and they mate line up and just
like previous mate devices it is rocking
an all-metal build and has a curved back
that sits pretty nicely in the hand on
the front of the phone is a six inch IPS
LCD display with a resolution of 1920 by
1080 so it's a pretty large phone which
makes this phone pretty big as well but
Huawei has done a really great job of
keeping the bezels small so that it
doesn't feel like a gargantuan
smartphone and the screen actually looks
really good despite being 1080p the mate
8 is the first smartphone to run on
huawei zone keren 950 processor which
has four cortex a 72 cores and four
cortex a53 cores in a big little
arrangement likely made s there are
several different versions of this phone
with a single sim option offering three
gigabytes of RAM and 32 gigabytes of
internal storage while the dual SIM
version comes with either three gigs of
RAM or four gigabytes of RAM and a 64
gigabyte option on the back to mate has
a 16 megapixel camera with f 2.0
aperture optical image stabilization 4k
video recording and a dual tone LED
flash on the front of the phone is an 8
megapixel selfie camera and it comes
with Huawei's Beauty level modes and
1080p full HD video recording below the
camera is a built-in fingerprint sensor
and Huawei has been doing a killer job
with fingerprint sensors lately and the
mate 8 is no exception it's extremely
fast and unlocks pretty much
instantaneously the moment your finger
touches the sensor the sensor can also
be used as the shutter button to take
selfies which is actually a lot more
convenient and comfortable than using
the on-screen shutter button the May 8
runs on Huawei's new emotion UI version
4.0 which runs on top of android
marshmallow and it's very similar to
previous versions of emotion UI like
previous handsets Huawei has added a
range of software features like knuckle
sense for cropping images with your
knuckles or opening up specific
applications split-screen multitasking
is also available now via a long press
of the recent apps key and it works
similarly to what we've seen
other smartphones and it's pretty easy
to use on the mates large display the
whole package is powered by a 4000
milliamp hour battery which always says
will last one and a half days for heavy
users and over two and a half days for
average users for the times when it's
running low while we says the rapid
charging technology will give you a
whole day's worth of usage with just 30
minutes of charging the mate is
launching globally in the coming weeks
but Huawei hasn't confirmed exactly
which countries will get the handset and
how much it will cost but that's pretty
much going to do it for this quick
hands-on look of the Huawei mate 8 it is
definitely shaping up to be a pretty
solid smartphone for huawei so keep it
tuned here to Android Authority for more
because we are your source for all
things Android and CES 2016</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
