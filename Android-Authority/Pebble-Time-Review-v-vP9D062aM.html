talking about the hugely successful
Kickstarter campaign considered one of
the pioneers in the smart wearable game
pebble is back with a clear direction
and an even clearer voice as to how they
want to express themselves differently
from the rest it strata regard from
Android Authority what's going on
everybody and this is the pebble time
perhaps the most important aspect of the
pebble time is its updated design but
this is true inside and out but in the
stark contrast from the taller overall
design of the original pebble the pebble
time is more symmetrical on its face
which makes it look like a tiny
old-school TV on the wrist though the
body of the watch is rather wide there
is still a bezel around the actual
display itself adding further distance
from the screens edges to the edges of
the watch itself and the sides of the
body how's the button layout up and down
with selection button in the middle on
the right and a back button on the top
left a water-resistant microphone is
just below the right buttons ready for
any voice input via Android where the
buttons are perhaps the main difference
between this and other smartwatches as
Saks I'll feel is the name of pebbles
game rather than full-on touch screens
and the buttons start off squishy but
then end with a pretty strong click at
the end feeling pretty much sturdy all
around the usual 22 millimeter prongs
are on top and bottom and provide one of
the main SmartWatch pet peeves I have
the fact that they stick out so much
makes it kind of difficult to find a
replacement watch strap that doesn't
look a little bit weird cuts in the
strap itself will tend to stick out and
they don't fill the blank space enough
to look stylish but the back of this
pebble time houses the charging and
expansion ports through which we will
hopefully see smart straps become a
reality
underneath it the clear indication that
this is a Kickstarter edition of the
watch a reminder that I was an early
adopter design has been one of the most
polarizing aspects of the pebble time
and we can somewhat see why this watch
is hardly close to what the original
pebble looked like and is pretty far
from any actual designer watches and
despite the usage of the word watch I
don't really mind my with smartwatches
having some unique aesthetics while the
pebble time does well is present the
screen with enough room around it to
express itself still and it does so in a
simplistically elegant way with just
enough space for comfortable buttons the
watch isn't all that thick either and is
quite light on the wrist so you might
actually forget your wear
the time throughout the day finding a
replacement watchstrap might be a bit of
a nuisance but even with this black
silicone band on here my dark version of
the pebble time remains pretty
inconspicuous at first glance and then
piques interest on the double take
pebble upgraded the ePaper display to
now provide color which brings a new
level of character to the ecosystems
applications colors are really muted
however which might be expected
considering the nature of this display
though colors make it easy to
distinguish among different elements you
won't really be amazed by this
enhancement the way you might be on
full-on color displays from other
competitors what mattered most about the
original pebble was visibility however
and the time continues that tradition -
mostly positive effects in broad
daylight it's really easy to see what's
on the screen and in highly late
situations that's always on display is a
real treat to have compared to any
others that might have to be triggered
at will but where it does fall short is
in lower light situations where the
backlight just isn't really engineered
to its best potential though bright
enough for easy viewing a hard flick of
the wrist is needed to trigger it but
the movement is a little bit jarring and
doesn't work a hundred percent of the
time and even then the backlight only
stays on for a short amount of time
which can become frustrating while there
is an app in the App Store that tries to
remedy this issue it's just a shame that
this kind of functionality is not better
out of the box and hopefully a
substantial update to the firmware will
make the backlight better on the daily
though the pebble time performs about as
well as its predecessor and that's a
very good thing speed and snappiness
aren't too difficult to achieve when
applications are given a simple but
effective platform to work on an update
to the ARM Cortex processor underneath
is accompanied by a larger amount of
storage so the original eight apps
installed can now become as many as 50
in the pebble time getting among a large
number of applications may prove a pain
from time to time but that's about all
that will slow down users in the pebble
time animations among screens don't take
too long to finish though they keep
tasks from feeling as instantaneous as
they did before but really it isn't hard
to forgive this because the animations
add just as much character as they might
add a very little amount of loading time
the only real slowdown is in the pebble
time application on Android which still
takes a little bit of time loading lists
of apps and watch faces but once we
found what we were looking for hitting
the Add button got it - the watch in a
short amount of track
for time time will tell pun intended if
a year from now the watch continues to
be this snappy but that was pretty much
the case with my original pebble and for
now we're happy with how the time
performs and we're pretty confident it
will stay this way now hardware takes on
a somewhat different outlook in the
pebble time because of further
protection and the addition of voice
commands a dust and water resistant body
puts the time in line with pretty much
any other watch analog or digital or
smart that can take a deep plunge or a
bit of a tumble and keep going Gorilla
Glass 3 for example is the crystal on
the screen so scratch resistance is also
on this watch's protection list where
there's a big enhancement in
capabilities however is with voice the
microphone nestled below the right
buttons requires Android wear to be
installed as the pebble time will take
advantage of where's API for voice input
it cannot be triggered at any point to
perform google searches at least not yet
but it does provide the opportunity to
respond to messages with one's voice and
it works about as well as it does on
Android wear especially if you talk a
little bit like a robot good times keep
on coming with the battery now and one
of the only times that we've ever seen a
battery life claim actually live up to
the hype the double-time can stretch to
a full week's worth of usage before
clunking out and that's what plenty of
vibrations and backlight usage
throughout the day what's even better is
that the charging time is short around
an hour tethered to the magnetic cable
is enough to get the time back to 100%
now this is something that pebble has
been able to boast about since the
beginning and it remains one of the best
aspects of this pebble time the fact
that you don't have to take it off and
put it on a dog every single night and
even when you do have to take it off to
charge it won't stay off your wrist for
very long and that's pretty great
because users may want to keep the
pebble time in eyes reach as much as
possible because this new version of the
software is about as charming and
uniquely voiced as it gets the
underlying foundation of the pebble time
is exactly the same as the original all
applications installed via the Android
app are transferred over to the watch
only now you can put more than eight at
one time not all applications have an
update for the color screen or for the
new timeline yet but all can still be
installed and presented in the original
monochrome versions and notifications
remain a key part of this platform as
any in all applications on the phone are
triggered they then appear as previews
on the watch making it easy to decide if
need to grab your phone or just hit a
couple of buttons on the watch and go
about your day this is without a doubt
the main point of a SmartWatch and one
of those features you must feel for
yourself if you haven't already now the
biggest addition to the way pebble feels
is the timeline and agenda based UI
triggered by going up or down the main
watch face see what's coming up see the
sunrise or sunset times or see anything
you might have missed recently and true
to form of the grey pebble community
there's already an app that can create a
custom timeline entry for a simple
reminder for anyone that is big on
calendaring this is a pretty huge
feature and will only get better with
more apps adding information like sports
scores and travel times but
unfortunately for now the timeline still
feels a little bit bare but we hope that
will change soon enough now what makes
the new pebble firmware is character and
that's exactly what colors and new
animations bring at first I thought the
extra time needed to show these quirky
transitions was time lost but really it
doesn't matter when you get used to them
because once a task is triggered via a
button press you actually don't really
have to stick around to watch them all
happen anyway any time that you do
however a charming and quirky animation
might be just enough to lighten you up
like a star that tells you that you're
all set or an ostrich digging its head
into the ground telling you about muted
notifications recently we got a look
into what Apple thinks a SmartWatch
operating system should look like and
even though it does look quite elegant
it was pretty predictable what they
would do on the other hand we have
Android wear that is more information
based and thus really useful still but
it does feel a little bit sterile under
google's own designs but now we have the
pebble time that isn't afraid to look a
little bit goofy as it still gets all
the same work and tasks done all in all
the software might get a couple of new
abilities and some color but what gives
the pebble such a loyal following is how
unique it is inside and out though I
pledge to $179 on the Kickstarter the
pebble time is available for pre-order
now and will come to Best Buy stores by
the end of July the price there 199
dollars now 199 might seem like a bit
considering there are some high-quality
Android wear watch is coming down and
cost recently even the original pebbles
are easy to find in retail stores for 99
dollars which sounds like quite a steal
these days for a full-featured
SmartWatch
as was already evidenced by the hugely
successful Kickstarter campaign if you
used pebble before then the pledge price
and maybe even that somewhat higher
retail price will probably not really
matter because the pebble ecosystem just
speaks to the users who have used it
already I think I kind of fall in that
category but for everyone else consider
for a second opit falls of nearly any
other SmartWatch touch screens can be
fidgety where tactile input is plenty
reliable battery life on full LCD
screens don't go much further than two
days let alone seven and while the Big
Apple and Google stick to their guns in
terms of look feel and compatibility the
pebble is functional across both
platforms and gets tasks done just as
well without taking itself too seriously
smartwatches are still on the bubble
between need and want
but among the smart wearables that I
have it doesn't take much time for me to
decide which one I do prefer to wear
throughout my day as always thank you
guys very much for watching and I hope
you enjoyed this review of the pebble
time yes for those of you who have never
used a pebble smartwatch before the
price might seem just a little bit steep
but what's great about this wonderful
working SmartWatch is the fact that if
you want an alternative to the Apple
watch or any Android wear iterations you
have a great one right here so keep it
tuned here for even more about the
pebble time and more about all across
Android here at Android authorities
