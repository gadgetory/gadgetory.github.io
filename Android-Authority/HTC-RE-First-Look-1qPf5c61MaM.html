their game when it comes to smartphone
photography while here is their version
of reimagining what is a point-and-shoot
camera hey it's Josh reguar from Android
authority what's going on everybody and
this is the HTC Ari
yes I might look a little peculiar but
this is basically what HTC envisions now
when it comes to point-and-shoot
photography and as a handheld peripheral
it should be able to get you some
pictures in some very tight spaces and
very easily right now I have the
Bluetooth that is available for pairing
and that is the way that it will connect
to your smartphone in our case it was
the desire I that button up top will
allow you to take photos but then also
holding it down will allow you to take a
video now as far as the specs go we're
working with the CMOS sensor here at 16
megapixels and it is actually an ultra
wide-angle lens at 146 degrees and an F
2.8 aperture which is pretty good for a
lot of general purpose photography as
far as video goes you will be able to do
1080p 30 frames per second video but
720p 4 times slow-motion video will be
available as well now when it comes to
the bottom portion of this device we do
have a 8 gigabyte micro SD card included
already but you can always put higher
capacity cards in there to get even more
photos and videos and of course there is
the micro USB charging port that is also
used for data transfer if you wish to
get your files off of the read that way
an 800 20 milliamp hour battery will
allow you 1200 pictures and about a
hundred minutes of continuous Full HD
video recording and another nice feature
about the re is that it is all water and
dust resistant now the form factor of
the Reed might make you want to hold it
a certain way when you're trying to take
pictures and video but nonetheless it is
a small device that is easy to use and
that button is very nice and meaty and
will really tell you exactly when you
took a photo not to mention the fact
that a beep comes out and the light is
shown to show you exactly what you've
just done
it is ridiculously easy to take some
photos with the HTC re but from time to
time you might be pressing that button
and you don't realize that you've
actually taken some photos or some video
which is perfectly fine but as far as
quality goes it is really in the low
light situations
far that we've seen photos that were not
all that pleased with but nonetheless in
good lighting it does provide the same
type of quality that you would expect
from let's say a very high-end
smartphone camera especially with that
16 megapixels and is 1080p resolution
video which we are not allowed to show
you yet but nonetheless we had some fun
with the HDTV and we're looking forward
to putting it through its real paces in
our full review and so there you have it
for this first look at the interesting
HTC re now we know that it's going to be
very easy to use a camera like this and
be able to get shots off but it remains
to be seen whether or not that ease of
use will ultimately be the selling point
when the camera quality may or may not
be where we want it to be so keep it
tuned here to Android Authority and stay
tuned for our full review of the HTC re
when we do get our hands on it and
remember to drop us some likes on our
videos subscribe to our channel if you
haven't already and remember that
