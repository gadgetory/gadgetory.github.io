hopes to stand out from the rest of the
mid-range pack by shipping with jelly
bean and keeping the now classic Samsung
look is that all it takes find out in
our review hey everybody I'm Chris look
not too long ago
AT&amp;amp;T shipped the Samsung Galaxy Express
in the United States now it's arriving
elsewhere with an updated design trading
higher clock speeds for jelly bean but
for now let's move away from the
software and take a look at the hardware
specs the Samsung Galaxy Express I 8730
has a 4.5 inch Super AMOLED display and
runs a Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 chipset
with a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core Krait
processor it has one gig of ram and 8
gigs of internal storage expandable via
microSD the Galaxy Express has a 5
megapixel rear facing camera and a 1.3
megapixel front-facing camera both
capture 720p video powering the device
we're looking at a two thousand milliamp
hour battery looking at the design well
it's obvious that this is a Samsung
phone recently it seems that if you've
seen one you've seen them all with the
only major differences being color and
size button layout is just as you'd
expect power button on the right volume
rocker on the left Hardware home button
on the front the overall feel is good
and it should be a decent fit for most
people
but those would smaller hands might have
trouble with one-handed operation the
phone is light but feels a little on the
flimsy side I'd be careful of dropping
this one whenever we look at phones in
this class the display is usually the
biggest flaw and in this case it's no
different the resolution of 800 by 480
just doesn't cut it on a 4.5 inch screen
though it does work better than say the
larger galaxy grand pixelation is
surprisingly difficult to notice
actually but with the pixel density of
around 207 PPI you'll notice a general
lack of char
yes the only other issue is that the
screen can look a little washed out at
times that small resolution does pay
dividends when it comes to performance
as does the Snapdragon chipset starting
with some numbers we ran antutu
benchmark ten times and ended up with an
average score of just under eleven
thousand almost exactly what we expected
from this chipset thanks to the lower
Reds Epic Citadel performed admirably as
well cranking out an average frame rate
of 50 3.3 frames per second and
high-quality mode and 54 point 2 frames
per second and high performance mode in
the real world performance was
comparable with little noticeable lag
when scrolling through home screens or
the app drawer well it isn't the most
demanding game subway surfers ran
without a hitch
unlike a lot of phones we see running
similar hardware the Galaxy Express runs
Android 4.1.2 jelly bean right out of
the box
Samsung has skinned the device with its
TouchWiz UI in keeping with its apparent
philosophy of giving customers a unified
experience if it wasn't for the version
number and a few jellybeans only
features you wouldn't even be able to
tell what version of Android it runs the
usual lineup of Samsung Apps is bundled
including Samsung's own App Store and
the S suite of tools like S Memo S voice
and s planner most other bundled apps
like the voice recorder and file browser
are useful as well
there isn't that much bloat winner
installed the camera is never the
strongest aspect of mid-range phones but
in good light the galaxy Express did
fairly well capturing crisp images with
good color balance in low-light
performance wasn't nearly as good there
is an LED flash to assist but this isn't
always desirable given how many phones
in this class have full 1080p video
capabilities we were surprised to see
that the Express only featured 720p
video capture the same issues with
low-light were present but otherwise the
quality of the 720p video was pretty
the battery isn't exactly huge at 2,000
milliamp hours but qualcomm chipsets are
generally pretty good at maintaining
battery life the cpu being clocked down
to 1.2 gigahertz helps a lot here as
well
I took the Galaxy Express out of the box
at around 60% battery life tested
heavily for around 6 hours and still had
around 30% battery life when testing was
finished for the first day an 18 hour
day without a charge should not be a
problem here at all
the battery is replaceable so if you
want to carry an extra or buy an
extended battery you're in the clear the
biggest hurdle for the galaxy expresses
that Samsung is kind of competing with
itself here they have other models like
the galaxy gram that offered the same
specs at a different size with different
features not to mention they have a lot
of competition from other companies as
well that said if you want a Samsung
phone that looks and acts like a Samsung
phone for a relatively low price this is
that phone unless you want a bigger one
