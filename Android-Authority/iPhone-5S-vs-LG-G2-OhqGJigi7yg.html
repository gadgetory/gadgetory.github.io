one of the most recent Android releases
its regard from Android authority what's
going on everybody and this is the
iPhone 5s versus the LG g2 from a design
perspective this could be considered yet
another 5-inch screen device up against
the smaller 4-inch iPhone 5s but LG
managed to squeeze even another point
two inches into its small bezel flagship
phone the LG g2 sports a glossy plastic
material that feels jam-packed
underneath it all as the pretty thin
body coupled with its heft give it a
very premium feel
LG went for a unique button layout as
its power button is on the back of the
phone right where your index finger
would land flanked by the volume rockers
while it is certainly different it might
seem a little odd the index finger idea
actually pans out and you realize how
natural it feels after just a little bit
of time on the other hand we have the
iPhone 5s which is much smaller and
continues the iconic aluminum material
tradition at 4 inches in its screen it
is much easier to handle in one hand and
just about everything is accessible from
a neutral grip the button layout is
Classic iPhone with the power button up
top and the volume rockers on the side
under a silence toggler even this
seasoned Android user can appreciate the
design of the iPhone it's still an
attractive device even if its design is
starting to get on a little bit with
such different screens it's easy to
realize that this becomes a battle of
sizes while we have the 4-inch Retina
display on the iPhone capable of 11 36
by 640 resolution the 5.2 inch IPS
screen on the g2 is a 1080p display
though 1080p displays have become very
popular due to their media viewing
experiences it's no reason to completely
disregard the iPhone smaller screen the
Retina display handles the colors of
Iowa 7 incredibly well and media viewing
is still fun if you don't mind the
smaller size reading definitely favors
the g2 however as its pixel density is
much higher and its size makes text
easier on the eyes ultimately it's up to
you what kind of viewing experience you
want but you do have to remember what
handling experience you'll have to deal
with as a result as you'll hear is the
case in plenty of these comparisons
against Android smartphones it's a
matter of powerful Snapdragon processors
up against an updated Apple offering the
LG g2 sports the Snapdragon 800 that
clocks in at a whopping 2.2 gigahertz
and gets double the RAM over its
competition
the 5s on the other hand is one of the
first devices to introduce 64-bit
capabilities in its processor
in usage this isn't quite as important
what is important is that the iPhone
still smoothly gets through its elements
with no stutter or delay just like what
is possible with the incredibly powerful
package found in the g2 in hardware both
of these phones don't have any removable
parts and thus no expandable storage or
removable batteries are included the
iPhone can get from 16 to 64 gigabytes
of storage while the g2 keeps it to
either 16 or 32 the 3000 milliamp hour
battery in the g2 might dwarf the much
smaller unit found in the iPhone but
with different demands in either system
usage obviously dictates overall
longevity otherwise the addition the 5s
has over the g2 is its fingerprint
reader located in the flattened home
button up front it's an interesting and
novel addition whose location makes much
sense but whether or not it speeds up
waking your phone depends on how
accurately you can scan your fingerprint
on that first try in the camera
department both of these phones got
updates while the iPhone 5s got an
overhauled app the g2 was able to add an
optical image stabilization oh is helps
to not only keep photos and videos from
getting blurry with your shaky hands it
also helps flood more light in during
those low-light situations otherwise it
comes with a plethora of modes and it's
app definitely giving you a lot of
control over your smartphone photography
the iPhone 5s brings more modes into its
app which gets a very attractive
makeover as a blurred transition get you
from one to the other additions include
a square mode basically for Instagram
slow motion video capture and a bunch of
filters live filters built in we'll take
a closer look at the picture quality
between these two cameras soon so stay
tuned for that and finally in software
we deal with the Battle of the numbers
when it comes to user interfaces iOS 7
gets a big design update and now as much
flatter includes many translucent
effects and is overall much more
colourful it's a greatly welcomed change
to the OS and even with the additions of
the control center enhanced notification
drop-down and enhanced multitasking it's
a new look with an almost completely
familiar feel the Optimus UI of the g2
on the other hand should be familiar to
LG veterans who know the multitude of
things that it is capable of qslide apps
cue memo and cue remote are just a few
of the many things that g2 is capable of
not even mentioning the new slight aside
which puts aside whole applications in a
stack for later usage too many iOS is an
interface that just works but to plenty
of others it might be too simplistic it
certainly looks much better this time
around however otherwise the Optimus
uija maybe a little overwhelming but it
potentially comes with any and all tools
that you might need and so there you
have it size might be the main battle
that the iPhone will always have to
contend with
especially if Apple keeps to the four
inch form factor in this case it's up
against one hell of a beast and the LG
g2 the updated iOS might bring a
refreshing change to what the iPhone
fans have always used but if you need
more perhaps much more the LG g2 has in
almost every other aspect keep it on
