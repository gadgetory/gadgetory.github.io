authority and the phone that we came to
know as the BlackBerry Mercury now has
an official name this is the BlackBerry
key one but that isn't all we know about
this phone we finally know all the
hardware specs like the processor
battery display camera and most
importantly we know how much is going to
cost and when it will be available
inside the specs are admittedly on the
mid-range side with a Snapdragon 625 and
three gigabytes of RAM so it's not the
most powerful processor but it is very
battery efficient and when you pair that
with a pretty large 3505 milliamp hour
battery you should have a recipe for
some really impressive battery life
blackberry says it's the biggest battery
to ever be in a BlackBerry device and
with Qualcomm quick charge 3.0 it is
supposedly able to charge up to 50
percent in just 36 minutes the rear
camera comes in at 12 megapixels with f
2.0 aperture and a 1.5 5 micron pixel
size so it should be decent in low-light
and on the front you have an 8 megapixel
shooter right below that is the
four-and-a-half inch 1080p LCD with a
three by two aspect ratio and it is a
touchscreen as you would expect but you
can also do your navigation with the
physical keyboard that we all know and
love from blackberry and this is truly
one of the main highlights of the
BlackBerry key one it's a capacitive
keyboard that works a lot like a
trackpad so you can swipe left or right
or up and down to navigate through the
interface scroll through web pages and
read emails and Blackberry says you can
assign up to 52 shortcuts on this
keyboard which is pretty ridiculous so a
couple examples will be too long press
on I to open up Instagram or hold down F
to go right to Facebook but there are a
variety of other shortcuts against that
here as well and if you're wondering
where the fingerprint sensor is it's
actually pretty cleverly embedded into
the spacebar of the keyboard of course
with this being a blackberry you also
have BlackBerry's state-of-the-art
security with its D tech software and
you also have other blackberry
applications pre-installed like the
BlackBerry hub for consolidating all
your emails text messages and social
media accounts all into one place as far
as the physical design it's exactly the
same as it was when you first got a
sneak peek at it back at sea
you've got a sturdy aluminum frame and a
soft touch leather like backing that
feels really comfortable and gives the
phone a lot of grip it is a little on
the big side but that gives plenty of
space for a headphone jack which you can
find up top and you've got the other
usual buttons and ports like a USB
type-c on the bottom power buttons on
the Left volume rocker on the right side
and right below that is a user
programmable button called the
convenience key that can be assigned to
any application or shortcut that you
want it will be shipping with the latest
7.1 update at launch it's going to cost
five hundred and forty nine dollars
unlocked in the US and will be available
through select channels and also
directly from carriers and you'll be
able to pick one up starting this April
this has been a quick look of the
BlackBerry key one let us know your
