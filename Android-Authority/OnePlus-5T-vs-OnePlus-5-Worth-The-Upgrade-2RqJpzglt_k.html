does it provide enough as an upgrade to
the original it's Joshua Vergara what's
going on everybody and this is a quick
look at the one plus five T versus the
one plus five users of the original 5
will find that the T variant has changed
things up in a few small but very
significant ways given that the 5 T has
a sprawling 18 by 9 aspect ratio screen
the fingerprint reader has been moved
from the front and over to the back in
the area that most people are pretty
happy to have it at and this ceramic
fingerprint reader is one of the fastest
on the market as oneplus claims and you
will be able to unlock the device in
fractions of a second just by tapping
the area this particular fingerprint
reader also lends the 5 T a couple of
other functions like swiping down on it
in order to bring down the notification
drop down or to hold it in order to
trigger the shutter while taking a
selfie
speaking of selfies kind of the 16
megapixel front facing shooter is also
used for their own brand of facial
recognition setting up the face
recognition is pretty simple enough as
it basically just has you put your face
inside of the area in order to scan it
and it uses over a hundred different
points in order to make sure that it is
your face in the frame so far it has
been a really fast way of unlocking the
phone you just have to be looking at the
device and then when you hit the power
button if it recognizes your face it
will go straight into the home screens
it is comparable in speed to the
fingerprint reader but even oneplus says
that this facial recognition is not
quite as safe as other methods of
security but it is a feature that makes
it onto the 5 T over the original 5 and
you might always be looking at that
screen anyway to enjoy the new display
experience this AMOLED panel comes in an
18 by 9 aspect ratio although oneplus
does keep it at 1080p resolution but
there is plenty of room for work or play
as the 6 inch screen simply takes up
more of the phone's face making it
better for a display forward experience
without making the phone itself any
bigger however the phone is still a
little bit tough to use in one hand with
all of that screen real estate and also
the metal finish can slip out a bit
easily credit where credit is due
however oxygen OS makes the best
possible use of the space allowing you
to scale not only the 1 plus slate font
but also other elements of the operating
system in order to best take advantage
of the 18 by 9 aspect ratio
the result is an experience that might
not be as pixel dense as quad HD
competitors but
certainly doesn't feel like you're
missing too much and of course other
features return as well including a
personal favorite like the reading mode
that was introduced in the 1 plus 5 that
brings a black and white look like an
ePaper slate to the 1 plus 5 T as well
but oxygen OS does get some enhancements
that make it feel like it's coming of
age even after the original 1 plus 5 the
design elements of the home screens the
dark mode the widget safekeeping shelf
use of programmable accent colors and
even the app drawers have a distinct
look to them that is very one plus and
they're even better now on the 5 T and
these are all powered by the same
general spec readout that made the
oneplus 5 such a well-rounded performer
the Snapdragon 835 backed by either six
or eight gigabytes of RAM that also has
64 or 128 gigabytes of on-board storage
there's also a dual SIM tray the
headphone jack hasn't gone away yet and
the dash charging gets the 3300 milliamp
hour battery back to work in no time at
all but there is one last place of
contention the camera instead of
bringing back the dedicated zoom lens
oneplus has instead tacked on a 20
megapixel F 1.7 camera alongside the
original 16 megapixel shooter the usage
is a bit interesting as in low-light
situations the 20 megapixel shooter is
triggered and it uses batches of four
pixels in order to get in the most
amount of data or light in that
low-light setting now we haven't had too
much time to test this out yet but if
this intelligent pixel technology
actually works it might be a significant
trade-off compared to the originally
included zoom lens granted zoom and
portrait motor is still part of the
camera experience in the 5 t but of
course they're going to be achieved
digitally without the use of a dedicated
zoom lens this time around so as it
stands one plus continues to provide
flagship level experiences in their own
distinct style and flavor of Android but
the T variant was a little bit
controversial last year because of the
price hike oneplus asked for a little
bit more money in regards to the t
variant compared to the original which
made buying a whole new device that is
not entirely new a bit tough for users
who bought the original
but for anyone that held out for the 5 t
you'll be happy to know that you won't
be paying a huge premium to enjoy the
latest enhancements as the 1 + 5 t will
be priced at 499 dollars for the base
model that's only 20 dollars more than
the original and given all that oneplus
has
added into the 5t 20 extra bucks sounds
fairly reasonable but it matters what
you guys think let us know how you feel

announcement and let us know how you
