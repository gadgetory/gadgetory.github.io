authority now that's gonna take some
time getting used to but anyway hi I'm
the latest team member here with Android
authority some of you folks probably
know who I am seeing my work YouTube
online something but a little bit more
about me if you don't know who I am
I've been covering mobile technology for
the last seven half years I pretty much
seen it all
I reviewed old things like Windows
mobile phones when I first started and
even newer devices like the Galaxy s7
and it's something I'm very passionate
about but I'm really excited about
starting this thing here with the
Android authority now I'm gonna be doing
this a little bit on a part-time basis
I'm gonna collaborating with many of the
writers and even video folks on
different projects but there's actually
I'm actually focusing a lot of my
attention on a special project that I'm
working on I wish I could tell you what
it is but I can't you'll have to wait
and find out what it is but exciting
stuff I'll probably see behind me I'm
actually working on getting up my office
set up here in preparation for the
special project but it is some really
cool stuff so stay tuned anyway I don't
want to do a long video one for shorter
videos actually and I'm just gonna jump
jump straight to the point and just talk
about a little bit about myself so well
in standard Android Authority tradition
there are five facts you didn't know
about me okay so fact number one I get
this question a lot in my youtube videos
in the comments and even on some pieces
I write but it was asked me am i
Filipino and the answer is yes I am
Filipino not just hope you know but 100%
Filipino they're not the only one in
more Josh but anyway yeah I'm Filipino I
was born in the Philippines as raised
here in the United States and it's kind
of funny because I wasn't saying nope
first for me I could understand the
Philippine language Tagalog I could 100%
understand it but when it comes to
speaking it or you know writing it
reading it my mind just shuts down I'm
unable to do that but I could translate
pretty well
fact number two I've actually lived
pretty much all my life in great state
of New Jersey yes the garden stayed and
it's been great here I can't complain
I'm relatively close to New York City
and Philadelphia a little bit pretty
much every part of state from northern
and southern Central and even in Jersey
Shore you know you know it gets a bad
rap but anyway the nice thing about New
Jersey is that it's such a small state
and you could pretty much find
everything you know from from bigger
cities smaller towns you could go to the
mountains you could go to the shore
there's ski places there's even Six
Flags Great Adventure so it's a place
I've been living at and I'll probably
continue to be here as well fact number
three is pretty interesting because
before my career in mobile technology
I'm talking about ten years ago a little
bit longer than that maybe even now but
I was once the head geek of a geek squad
I know what you're thinking was that guy
so I basically wore those white shirts
the black clip-on ties I drove the geek
mobile aka any of the beetle and I went
around different places different homes
fixing computers repairs services but I
was once the head geek I still have my
badge to prove that too but it was
interesting because you know that's how
you know I first really set my passion
into technology and of course it's so
something that continues today back
number four I'm a big movie person in
particular sci-fi movies it's just
something I love and I'm not afraid to
admit it but I've gone to movies by
myself to watch them I'm a big fan of
pretty much anything
sci-fi you could probably see you
Kyllo in the back light their big star
Wars fan even Star Trek fan I love
pretty much all things sci-fi especially
Christopher Nolan he has some pretty
interesting stuff but you know there's a
lot of things like to talk about with
sci-fi movies but I'm a big fan and last
thing that you probably didn't know
about me is that I'm a big fitness
person now you probably don't notice it
but five years ago I was a totally
different looking person if you ever see
see some of my older videos you'll
probably notice a change in the way I
look but anyway just one year I just
started working out and I went through
his transformation a lost a lot of
weight and you know I did stuff that I
thought was never important who was ever
possible I managed to run a half
marathon by myself I was growing up I
was never able to actually do one single
real pull-up but now I could easily do
15 20 so it's pretty amazing and I take
pride in your my health because you know
without your health it really is tough
doing anything else so I really employ
the wall to you know live a healthy
lifestyle and that is it if you have any
other questions feel free to put them in
the comment section below I'll do my
best try and answer them but like I said
I'm very excited about being part of the
Android Authority family you'll see time
time after time in some videos some
posts I'll write some editorial pieces
but I am most excited about this special
project I'm working on right now
I can't spill the beans just yet as much
as I would love to but it's something
cool and refreshing different so stay
tuned but if you guys want to follow me
