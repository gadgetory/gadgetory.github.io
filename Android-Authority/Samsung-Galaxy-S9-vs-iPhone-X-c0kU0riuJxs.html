everybody and we're talking about the
galaxy s 9 plus once again but we're
also gonna bring back the iPhone 10 now
I do remember that we did a short
comparison kind of a quick look before
the full review of the s 9 came out but
we're revisiting it because I did use
the iPhone 10 just a little bit more
since then and we also did some camera
tests which we are providing in a
separate piece here at the YouTube
channel and also at Android RDECOM so
you can see all of the camera samples
and everything from there also if you
want to get even more information about
these phones I did do a full write-up at
Android or decom but in this video I'm
just gonna share some of my main
thoughts the iPhone 10 has some really
obvious omissions including no more home
button that iconic home buttons not even
there anymore now you have a full screen
on the front which in and of itself is
pretty nice but it's included with that
notch at the top now the reason why the
notch is so interesting is because in
Android we're gonna start seeing it more
often so I kept wanting to use the
iPhone 10 to see if I could get past the
knotch
and yes I got used to it after a while
but there are some instances especially
with video games full screen apps and
YouTube videos in particular where that
not actually occluded a small part of
the left side of the video when viewing
in landscape but without that home
button and without anything like let's
say the soft keys that are on the bottom
of the galaxy s 9 and pretty much any
other Android device all you have to do
is swipe up from the bottom and you hold
it there to go to the recent map screen
or if you're inside of an app you swipe
up to go back to home that notch also
rears its ugly head again because to the
right of the notch you can swipe
downward to get to the control center so
that is where you get your quick
settings like similarly to the Android
version and then if you want to get to
your notifications which is a fairly
recent development you can go to the
left of the notch so it matters where
you swipe down thank goodness the iPhone
10 is a smaller device overall because
while maneuvering around that notch is a
bit of a pain and it would be worse if
the phone was any larger now about that
home button that also means you no
longer have a fingerprint reader and
that might be something that is
contentious to some people but you do
have face ID which is the main security
measure for biometrics on the iPhone 10
you just scan your face and no matter
what angle its add the phone will try to
recognize
your face and unlock the device
immediately after you wake it up you do
have something like that in the s9 as
well with face unlock and iris scanning
which have been put together into the
intelligent scan but thankfully the
fingerprint reader on the back has been
put in a much better place then you can
actually stack the fingerprint reader on
top of the intelligent scan so you have
even more biometric meters for security
and in the case of iOS even if it
doesn't have the personalization that
the Galaxy S nine has for example I even
have a lock screen that allows for a 15
second video well that's always really
nice and you can make that very personal
and then there's also the always-on
display which is not something that you
find on the iPhone 10 but it does light
up immediately when you raise the phone
so that face ID is looking for your face
and it will go straight into the
operating system no matter what daily
usage has also been really reliable on
both of these after all these are the
top phones in their respective
ecosystems you have the snapdragon 85 in
this s 9 plus with 6 gigabytes of RAM
which is different from the four you get
in the smaller version and then it's
kind of hard to compare that to the
performance of the iPhone 10 which has
the Apple a 11 Bionic and 3 gigabytes of
RAM which is perfect for what iOS needs
after all sometimes it feels like
Android requires a bit too much out of
its processing packages but that makes a
little bit of sense because iOS is cater
to one particular device and they can
optimize it properly
the s9 plus provides so many different
ways of doing things like multitasking
like with Android or EO there is the
picture-in-picture and on top of that
you have the edge UX which just gives
which just gives you a more convenient
way of accessing your contacts and your
shortcuts and maybe even some extra
feeds now bringing back the iPhone 10
both Bixby and Google assistant you can
pick either one and in my opinion
they're going to be way better than Siri
ever has been because Siri they haven't
really put a whole lot of new features
into Siri it's still just basically a
voice command assistant and it doesn't
do much more like live translations or
food recognition and bigsby or even
everything that Google assistant might
have that you probably enjoy already if
you're an Android purist
now battery life has also been different
between these two if there's one thing
that I've noticed with the iPhones hand
that I have
notice with previous iPhone devices the
standby time is pretty great if you're
not using your phone and it's just kind
of sitting around it keeps its charge
pretty well and if you're not that heavy
of a user you should be able to get
quite a bit of time out of these devices
fast charging is a thing here with the
included charger of the galaxy s 9 plus
you're able to get a 50% of the battery
pretty quickly but the included charger
with the iPhone 10 doesn't have that
same capability there is fast charging
involved with the iPhone 10 but you have
to use specific chargers and cables to
make that happen
so now we could talk about the cameras
and you have similar cameras on here
with two lens setups including a
telephoto lens but Samsung really tried
to put its best foot forward with the
main lens and it's something that we
talked about a lot because it's honestly
pretty exciting that main lens has F 1.5
aperture and then actual blades inside
that stop it down to F 2.4 now that's
really awesome and there are benefits to
it if as a photographer you know how to
take advantage of it but the key
takeaway is that in the automatic mode
you could just let it change itself
accordingly and you won't really notice
the difference on the other hand the
iPhone 10 has an F 1.8 aperture in the
main lens and the secondary lens has F
2.4 aperture which is the same case with
the telephoto lens on the s 9 plus but
when you take into account daylight
shots with these rear cameras you're
going to get good results no matter what
both of these cameras do a really good
job as long as the lighting is good but
we have to put a feather in the cap of
the galaxy s 9 plus because it's low
light capabilities or really top-notch
that F 1.5 aperture really floods in a
great amount of light and then there's
multi frame processing on top of that
because there is Ram built into the
actual camera module dozens of photos
are taken at the same time and all of
that data is processed into such a way
that provides the best possible final
result of course one of the main points
to the iPhone 10 is the portrait mode
and if we go to the portrait mode here
there are a number of different modes
that allow for different lighting
effects to be applied to the cutout as
long as it's able to get the cut out
properly that's a bit of a hit-or-miss
situation you may not get the best cut
out from the background whether you're
using the rear camera or you can
actually use the portrait mode on the
front-facing camera so you would be able
to change what type of lighting you get
even a stage light or just us a mono
stage life for a black-and-white photo
and it's something that you are able to
use to get something stylized even if
it's pretty obvious that it is software
based compared to normal photography
methods but then again the same can be
said for the beauty modes when you use
the front-facing camera of the galaxy s
9 plus obviously they're doctored and
they might be too heavily doctored that
it kind of takes you out of that picture
overall the camera does provide even
more options on top of everything we've
just talked about including modes that
are all at the top here super slow mode
and AR emoji are the two big marquee
features and we've documented them quite
extensively already on pieces here at
Android or decom you also have a lot of
manual controls in the pro mode which
gives you control over the shots which
is just something you don't get on the
iPhone 10 so let us know what you think
about this comparison in the comments
down below and if you have opinions on
either of these devices let us know
those as well one really great thing
would be if you're looking to jump from
one ecosystem to the other it doesn't
matter in which direction we would love
to hear about that and let us know what
is making your decision what is
informing that decision and we might
comment on them down in the comment
section down below or we might take some
of the top comments and respond to them
in a future piece of content which you
can look forward to here at the YouTube
channel keep it tuned to Android
authority hit that subscribe button but
also hit the bell next to it and then
stick around and go to android authority
dot-com for even more because we are of
