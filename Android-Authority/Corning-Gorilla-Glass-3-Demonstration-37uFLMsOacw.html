with Corning and they're obviously the
makers of the famous Gorilla Glass
they're going to be showing us a great
demo of Gorilla Glass 3 and I'm here
with Marcus Haines he's an application
engineer for Corning and he's going to
take us through it so just let us know
what you up to man all right so we're
introducing real Glass 3 which this new
introduced to CES and we're just coming
here at Mobile World Congress to talk
about a little bit more and actually so
demonstrations so right right what we
have here is that competitors a limited
silicate glass it is 0.7 millimeters
thick has a scratch of 7 Newtons so it
has like a common scratch if you see in
any smartphone okay so I'll open this
testing this tester is an inclined
tester that is set at 10 degrees will be
hundred and thirty five grams steel ball
you're loading on the tester we'll see
what happens ooh
say see they're a competitor glass is
broken no good
that's the competitor glass with the 17
scratch which competitor my Dappy Marcus
I can't say I don't really know okay so
this is really three okay the same 17
scratch all right i same thickness and
everything nice note in the tester even
pool I like it
you see gorilla three ops still is
intact no problem to be able to get
pretty good so far we all try to push
the cells even further
and so I'm wrapping it up to 30 degrees
I like it Wow we're getting extreme here
try to it's only good I don't need to
sign a waiver or anything no not right
now all right so what we do this to show
how much impact energy this is three
times greater a piece of aluminum here
okay this is a zero plus emulator
millimeter piece of aluminum lovely
tester
we'll jump that same steel ball let's
see a nice satyr who did that right
right don't stick your finger in there
right okay I want you so now we would do
the same thing with really three with
the same 17 scratch as we have before
mm-hmm
same thickness
you see two impacts there on the bus
still in that break so I'd even take
that a little bit further we're actually
going to put this in this mini press
here what take this nice and glass a
little bit over for you guys and we'll
wrap it up to a hundred pounds of force
so
fly that load all the way to 100 pounds
even Wow higher than that
you see an imprint yet the tester but
the glass is still not broken that's a
strong glass yeah oh yeah like really
really strong so is this pretty much the
strongest display glass you guys have
ever graded maybe the strongest on the
market well for us it's our best
guerrilla glass to date I can't comment
on what's on the market
but for us the gorilla glass is still
the industry standard missile industry
leader okay maybe a CNN of our drop test
videos there Marcus I have not but I
know people do like love to do their job
to the last review a drop test yes we
recently dropped the s3 versus the
iPhone 5 the iPhone 5 it was impossible
to break we had to flip it upside down
put rocks under it and driver with the
car two times then we crack the last
with the s3 it cracked after the second
drop oh wow
for a half feet high but but what we're
wondering is really what is the secret
behind Gorilla Glass like I know you
guys use a lot of really very advanced
engineering and you're going to keep
pushing the envelope what are we going
to be able to arrive at a position in
the future where phones virtually are
unbreakable its subset yeah glass still
the crystalline structure for so glass
no matter from what I've been told no
matter what happens with it it still has
a point where it can break we're always
trying to push the limit on what we can
do with our glass it's still a thin
glass still display glass so it's you
know it's up to a point that we're
trying to get you but continuously we
have thousands of engineers scientists a
Corning working on that very problem to
trying to improve the glass
year-over-year that's awesome
can you talk about a couple of partners
or maybe some phone makers that are
going to be incorporating velocity in
the future well as you know we run over
30 major brands I can't talk to her
significant oh you know this really
means a little bit gifts of love to
Android thority
I really can't be a civics right now I
just let up over 30 major brands yeah
975 different models over a billion
devices sold in the market so that's a
lot of devices along we're really
pushing hard on notebooks as well
because Windows 8 and everything else is
out there we're really pushing hard on
that too to make sure our brand just is
there as well very very cool
well I really want to say thank you very
much for your time you know again this
is cool demonstration my pleasure you
know thank you alrights Android over
here we're live more World Congress
thanks to Corning Gorilla Glass 4 agree
with us that Austin demonstration thank
you thank you too sir</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
