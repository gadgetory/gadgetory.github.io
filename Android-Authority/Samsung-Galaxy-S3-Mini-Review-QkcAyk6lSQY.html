best-selling phone and it's a constant
thorn in the iPhone side so what do you
do when you're on that kind of roll
well apparently you experiment a little
and you think a little bit smaller a
Joshua Vergara from Android authority
what's going on everybody and this is
the Samsung Galaxy s3 mini the Galaxy s3
mini is the trunk and down version of
one of the best-selling Android phones
ever when you first get a hold of this
device you might say the same thing I
did why well
Samsung has a device for pretty much any
size you can imagine so maybe the
question at that point would be why not
but don't be fooled by the s3 in its
name the Mini is definitely a device
full of compromises compared to its Big
Brother to start out let's get the
obvious out of the way
this phone is small coming in at just
under five inches long this phone
basically takes up the size of the
original s3 screen it might be a stretch
to say that it fits in the hand when
we've already been used to such larger
smartphones these days and that's an
important point there was once a time
when phones of this size were the norm
now were programmed to work with much
larger screens and the way we handle our
phones is a little bit different now at
first usage I certainly found that this
phone came with a little bit of a
learning curve or as you would need to
do some hand gymnastics with the larger
smartphones everything on the s3 mini is
accessible from a neutral grip this
phone retains the general look that the
original s3 had with a plastic body and
a rounded look all the buttons are in
the same places and the home button on
the bottom front of the device has been
kept flanked by two soft keys for back
and menu around the back the cover is
removable and allows access to the
battery mini sim and micro SIM slots the
screen is small at four inches at least
by current standards capable of 480 by
800 resolution the Super AMOLED screen
also has a pixel density of 233 PPI it
isn't the sharpest display out there but
it is impressive how bright and vibrant
it is the colorful look of Samsung's
TouchWiz pops out quite well and viewing
angles are all very good
even in broad daylight it's not the best
screen out there but you'll definitely
raise an eyebrow when it fires up
behind that screen is a 1 gigahertz
dual-core cortex a9 processor an obvious
downgrade from the powerful package
found in the galaxy s3 there is also
only one gigabyte of ram within scores
and benchmark tests are definitely
nothing to get excited about but we
probably expected that anyway that being
said the performance in practice on the
mini is actually quite impressive
most of the lag that you will experience
comes from the actual loading of apps
even if from the recent apps screen once
everything is loaded however the phone
continues on quite smoothly even this 3d
game had little to no problems during
the actual missions what lies underneath
the back cover however is important as
well by recent reviews of top-tier
phones often have one or two problems
that many users are critical on
expandable memory and replaceable
batteries these features return in the
s3 mini these are at least for some
people major selling points speaking of
the battery it might be smaller but it
does its job very well
coupled with the downgraded processor
and smaller screen the battery life in
the s3 mini is actually very good I got
the real whole day without getting below
25% life and this didn't even involve
the power saving options available in
the settings longevity should be
expected from a device that doesn't have
to power intensive graphics through a
massive screen
but now we're back to the theme of
shrinking things down however as the
camera on the Mini has been brought down
from the original well received 8
megapixel performer of the s3 at 5
megapixels you aren't getting the
standard large pictures and
unfortunately the same goes for the
quality while definitely not a slouch
this camera unsurprisingly produces
pictures with a fair amount of grain and
it only gets worse when you remove more
lighting the app itself performs quite
well though so having a phone as
pocketable and portable as this will
help you get your shot down in time and
finally we have the software TouchWiz is
not my favorite looking interface as
it's uber colorful motif and theme are
usually a little over the top for my
tastes however its functionality is not
in question and even once scaled down
for the mini size it performs quite well
even if the screen is a little cramped
Samsung ensured that you should be able
to see everything that is needed no
matter what I liked how even at the
tiniest text size everything is still
legible and easy to read power widgets
are available in the notification
drop-down and the inclusion of Samsung
develop software is here too like s
voice all inclusions work quite well in
this TouchWiz out jellybean 4.1.1 for
the most part you're going to be getting
the same functionality in this little
phone as you did in Antep bigger brother
so since this is a little bit like a
comparison between the mini and the
original s3 I'll end this on usage now
this is a very important part because
after having this phone for the holiday
season
I found myself coming back to it over
and over why because it is just that
intriguing remember when phones used to
be colourful bar flip and slider devices
remember when every phone was about this
size technology changes so quickly that
sometimes it is nice to get a reminder
of what used to be a couple years ago
this phone would have probably been in
the top tier 4-inch market and now its
size just automatically dubs it mid tier
but there is definitely a market of
people out there who want a smaller
phone something that is so easy to take
with them and just works great we get so
spoiled sometimes looking at the latest
and greatest devices that we sometimes
look for features we don't need
and that's where the Galaxy s3 mini
comes in long battery life easy handling
once you get used to it and
more-than-capable performance make this
a phone for the every man and every
woman the Samsung Galaxy s3 mini sits
squarely in the middle in a time and
place where we didn't need the highest
pixel density or the fastest processor
or even the biggest screen we just
needed a phone that was different fun
and most of all worked it is for the
user in all of us who remembers a time
when what we wanted from phones and
Technology used to be a little bit
smaller and a little bit simpler for my
