handy the Android authority app guy and
I have been playing with the Nvidia
shield console for quite some time now
let's take a look at the best games for
it first on our list is anomaly 2 the
game was one of the first to feature
extra features for the NVIDIA Tegra k1
chipset which include a number of
graphical enhancements that are made to
impress and heads-up it worked
this game is graphically impressive and
fun to boot anomaly 2 is a tower defense
game that features tower defense tower
offense a single-player campaign and of
course online play it also has full
controller support and a fairly
reasonable price tag badland was a
critically acclaimed game when it first
came out for it's simple but challenging
gameplay slick looking graphics and
old-school feel I may not have the
pizzazz or depth of many of these other
games but it's a great free option
that's also kid friendly and it won't
take up too much of your storage it
features a single-player campaign that's
decently long a co-op mode and it's easy
to play on touch screens if you're on a
shield tablets the Bard's Tale has been
out for a few years now but when it
comes to the best bang for your buck
you'd be hard-pressed to beat the bard's
tale it features a 20-hour story line
filled with comedy and quirkiness
old-school RPG style gameplay and
complete controller support for only a
dollar ninety-nine over the years the
game has also been updated to include
new content cloud saves Google Play
games achievements and in-app purchases
to buff yourself up if you don't feel
like level grinding but you don't need
it to succeed dead trigger 2 is a
first-person shooter where you must mow
down tons of zombies it was among the
first games to get controller support
and remains one of the better-looking
shooters available for Android it has
been continuously updated to add new
content and it also has great graphics
easy controls and challenging gameplay
it puts most other zombie games to shame
and it's another one of the rare options
that is both really good and also free
to download grand theft auto has long
been a cornerstone on a lot of platforms
and Android is no different you have
your choice between three classic grand
theft auto titles but frankly the
longest and most stable is grand theft
auto san andreas all three games come
with complete controller support decent
graphics and tons upon tons of gameplay
and shenanigans to get yourself into
also none of these games have in-app
purchases half-life 2 was one of the
games developed specifically for the
Nvidia shield series of devices and it
is probably the best first-person
shooter available for the platform
period along with the core game NVIDIA
has also released episode
and Episode two to expand the core game
even further they're a bit expensive but
the campaign is fantastic the graphics
are great and it's an amazing option for
a nostalgic value or first-time players
alike for those looking for something a
little more old-school chem code games
has a number of games available for the
shield console these games all either
have an SNES or PlayStation JRPG feel to
them which is great for those looking
for some nostalgia they're relatively
inexpensive include a ton of gameplay
and have all received generally high
reviews there should be around five or
six total games available so you'll have
to search for chem co in the shield hub
in order to find them all Leo's fortune
was released to exceptional reviews and
is currently among the highest-rated
paid games out there it's a
side-scrolling platformer adventure game
where you play as a little green
fuzzball looking to reclaim his lost
fortune the game uses classic platformer
puzzles along with a three star system
for a bit of replayability the graphics
are surprisingly good the gameplay is
simple to learn and it's a really strong
offering overall limbo is a
side-scrolling atmospheric puzzle game
that was released earlier in 2015 it
features a unique silhouetted design
with some really creepy monsters and
challenging obstacles to keep you
guessing it's not that long of a game
but it does feature auto saving and
Google Play games achievements the
mechanics are solid and it's not usually
hard to figure out what you're supposed
to do $4.99 is a bit expensive for how
short the game is but it is a really
good game maka narium is another Android
game that's been around for years but
can still be fun for fans of puzzle
games you play as a robot as you find
your way through a mess of obstacles in
order to find your lost love the puzzles
are fun the game can be challenging and
the graphics are pretty decent the game
has also been continuously updated over
the years to include Google Play game
support better graphics and cloud saving
there are worse ways to spend five
dollars with mobile has always been a
challenge for sports games and there are
only a few out there worth playing an
NBA Jam is one of them this throwback
classic was one of the first to embrace
the Android TV and NVIDIA shield
platforms and remains one of the best
sports games for those platforms in this
title you played two-on-two basketball
with a very relaxed set of rules and
some fun game mechanics it's $4.99 but
includes offline multiplayer and plenty
of nostalgic value never alone is one of
the more expensive games on the list but
it's also one of the best in this
ridiculously good-looking side school
you play as a little girl named nuna and
her pet box as you traverse the Arctic
while avoiding obstacles and dangers you
can play as both the girl or the Fox by
switching between the two
you can grab a second controller and
play offline co-op with both characters
at once this game is really good
overkill 3 is a third-person shooter
with a whole ton of features there is a
campaign mode which can be played online
with other people along with that there
are boss fights gun customization
endless mode and a whole lot more when
you pair that with decent graphics you
get a pretty solid game it is free with
in-app purchases but those looking for
some cheaper games with a lot of content
should get quite a bit of enjoyment out
of this one
pac-man 256 isn't the most impressive
game on the list but that doesn't mean
it isn't a lot of fun despite turning
pac-man into an infinite runner the
developers managed to keep the spirit of
pac-man alive and even added a few new
features combine that with the kid
friendly atmosphere the small storage
footprint comparatively speaking of
course and the cheap price tagging this
is definitely one of those games that
everyone's just going to have to have
like half-life 2 portal is an Nvidia
shield exclusive and it's a really good
one for those who may not have played
this iconic puzzle game you play as a
test subject for a crazy artificial
intelligence and you must use a tandem
of portal guns to make your way through
various tests the game is dark comical
challenging and unique in a way that few
other games console or mobile have been
able to match ever since it's a really
really good game Riptide gp2 is a
waverunner racing game and a favorite of
ours here at Android Authority
the game features good graphics easy
controls tricks and stunts and Google
Play games achievements and cloud saving
there are multiple race events including
freestyle hot laps elimination and
standard races and there is also a
complete online support if you want to
race against other people it's about a
solid of a racing game as you'll find
Soulcalibur is a classic fighting game
that first came out in the late 1990s it
features a total of 19 playable
characters and you can play them through
a variety of fighting modes including
Arcade Mode at Time Attack Survival
extra survival and practice mode it also
comes with Google Play games
achievements and leaderboard so you can
compare your scores to your friends it's
expensive but there are no in-app
purchases and it remains faithful to the
original game Square Enix has been
slowly upgrading their collection to
work with controllers Android TV and the
Nvidia shield devices for now they have
Final Fantasy 3 Final Fantasy 4 and
Secret of Mana list is having full
controller support and we imagine more
will appear over time these games are
expensive but they have no in-app
purchases and they contain long
narrative driven storylines and tons
content telltale games is one of the
best mobile developers out there period
their games include Game of Thrones -
Walking Dead games the wolf among us and
tales from the borderlands all of these
have good storylines that hold true to
the respective franchises decent
graphics and mechanics unique to their
series they can get a little expensive
thanks to their episodic nature but
these are among the best games available
on mobile period last day and certainly
not least on our list is valiant hearts
this scrolling adventure game is a
narrative driven four part episode
adventure based on the real-life stories
of four soldiers from World War one it
features a blend of exploration
adventure and puzzles as you work from
level to level trying to help others and
avoid being killed it's exceptionally
well done with unique comic-book style
artwork and the price tag comes with all
four episodes in art book and an
interactive comic book we did have a
couple of honorable mentions and they
are Nvidia grid and of course emulators
and Vidya has been working on grid for
quite some time and it's almost ready
for the mainstream you can access it for
free for the time being although that's
going to change very shortly for those
who don't know NVIDIA grid is going to
be like the Netflix of video games if
you're willing to try it out you'll find
a plethora of big-name titles including
homefront Devil May Cry 4 dead rising 2
batman arkham origins and arkham asylum
borderlands saints row the third and
many many more there is no doubt that
these games will help round out an
already very strong offering of games
from Nvidia emulators have been a
longtime favorite way to play mobile
games for many people for many years
with emulators currently available you
can play NES SNES Sega and PlayStation
games with very few problems and a few
other consoles such as the n64 and the
Gamecube are in development as we speak
having these options adds an
insurmountable number of games to the
Nvidia shield console lineup and
literally all of the games and most of
the emulators our controller friendly
now it is an ethically gray area and we
do hope that you're only emulating games
that you actually own but nevertheless
playing old-school video games on a TV
with a controller just feels right if
you want to check out our list of the
best emulators we'll have that along
with the links for all of these
applications in the video description
below
