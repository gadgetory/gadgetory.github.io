face this is my frustrated face now I'm
pretty frustrated there's so much
misinformation going on about the
internet about the Galaxy s8 about its
dual audio feature and about Bluetooth 5
but I'm compelled to make a video about
it now if you were know why I'm so
frustrated
please or let me explain ok maybe I'm
being a bit dramatic but let me just
clear a few things there's going to be a
short we don't want to kick up a few
things for you let me tell you in no
uncertain terms that the dual audio
feature of the galaxy s 8 has nothing to
do with Bluetooth 5 let me repeat the
dual audio feature on the Galaxy s8 has
nothing to do with Bluetooth 5 now let
me explain why that is way way back
let's when bluetooth first came out we
have Bluetooth version 1 then Bluetooth
version 2 and Bluetooth version 3 now in
kind of version 2 and version 3 we've
got this idea of streaming audio to
either a Bluetooth headset that maybe
you were using to hands-free while
you're driving or to a speaker and it
uses a special codec called the SBC and
basically the mandatory part of
Bluetooth and all the speakers that
we've seen most of the speakers 99.9 at
the speakers you today are using that
technology from Bluetooth to and from
Bluetooth 3
now when Bluetooth 4 came out it had a
new kind of Bluetooth in it which called
Bluetooth Low Energy
at the time they also played around with
this idea of being called Bluetooth
smart but today it's basically called
Bluetooth Low Energy
and the older system which was Bluetooth
2 and Bluetooth 3 with all the streaming
is nowadays called Bluetooth classic now
Bluetooth Low Energy was designed for
things like the Fitbit okay things that
only send a little bit of information
and an irregular basis heart monitors
health monitors
Fitness monitors sensors all this kind
of stuff that only require and will need
to run off small batteries maybe in
those coin size packages may need to run
for months at a time
now Bluetooth Low Energy uses about at
least half of the energy that Bluetooth
classic does now when we take up our
smart phone today we have a smart phone
is there any connection to a Bluetooth
device if it connect to a speaker it
connects using Bluetooth classic if it
connects to my Fitbit or to a similar
device it uses Bluetooth Low Energy and
these are called dual mode dual mode
bluetooth devices because they can cope
with Bluetooth classic and Bluetooth Low
Energy
now Bluetooth five only extends and
works on the boot Bluetooth Low Energy
specification Bluetooth classic remains
exactly the same nothing has changed
since way back in the day when we had
kind of Bluetooth two blue two three
okay so Bluetooth classic has remained
the same Bluetooth Low Energy is what's
changed in Bluetooth five so when we're
talking about this thing about double
the speed and four times the range and
all that kind of stuff which I've
covered in other videos they apply to
Bluetooth Low Energy now why is it
important it's important to understand
because Bluetooth classic actually had a
bit speed of up to three megabits a
second and Bluetooth Low Energy didn't
only had one megabit per second recently
before that it was even less than that
and now with Bluetooth 5 it has 2
megabits a second so Bluetooth classic
is faster and is still faster than
Bluetooth Low Energy but Bluetooth Low
Energy uses less power now at the moment
there are not very many or certainly not
very really popular but audio over
Bluetooth Low Energy Solutions that
means how you can connect a headset or a
speaker to a phone using bluetooth low
energy still uses Bluetooth classic now
that's going to change I'm sure there's
going to be now that we've got this 2
megabits a second throughput for
Bluetooth Low Energy that's going to
change this gonna be but all your over
ble audio over blue
low energy coming out and that's
definitely going to happen but today
when you buy your Sony speaker or your
JBL speaker or your anchor speaker and
you connect it to your smartphones using
Bluetooth classic now the Samsung Galaxy
f8 have got Bluetooth five and it has
got Bluetooth classic and it has got
that dual audio feature now the dual
audio feature is just something that
Samsung have done in Bluetooth classic I
don't know how they don't they put in
maybe two Bluetooth chips all I know
doesn't matter how they've done it at
the moment it just matters to understand
that it's actually just an extension a
special way of using Bluetooth classic
and so anybody that says but the Galaxy
s8 has got bluetooth slide because it
can connect to two speakers that's not
right I'll say it again Bluetooth Low
Energy is not used when you're
connecting to those two speakers now
while we're talking about the Galaxy s8
and we'll talk about Bluetooth I want to
tell you something I've actually managed
to get Bluetooth 5 working on the Galaxy
s8 ok ignore signal and that was me just
being but I have actually managed to yet
now I want to give a huge shout out to
the folks over at Nordic semiconductors
now Nordic semiconductors make these
Bluetooth 5 development boards and
that's what I use during my initial
Bluetooth 5 testing which is the speed
in the range of Bluetooth 5 I have 2 of
these boards and Nordic semiconductor
have been really really helpful and they
contacted me after they saw my last
video and Gary we can tell you how to
get Bluetooth 5 working on the Galaxy s8
now I'm going to do a full video about
that whole thing but let me tell you one
thing it's not what you're expecting
everything I said in my last video is
absolutely true but there's a trick to
this I'll explain why life is so stay
tuned I'll try and get that video out
maybe in the next week or so well I'm
going to in from under Authority and I
hope you enjoyed this video please do
give it a thumbs up if you did please do
subscribe to you'll find out when I've
make my next video available if you hit
that Bell icon you'll get notification
when I release my next video and last
but not least plea - over to Andrew
