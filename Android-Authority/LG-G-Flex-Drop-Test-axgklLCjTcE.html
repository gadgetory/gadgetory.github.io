what's going on everybody and you
already know what it is this is your
drop test for the LG G flex it does have
a curve to it which somewhat protects
the screen but also we have a
self-healing back here so we're going to
see what happens to this phone if it'll
stand up to our drop test a little bit
better than ones we've done before you
already know how it goes we're gonna
drop the LG G flex on its back onto its
bottom onto its front which because that
curve might be a little bit more
protected than most and before we even
get started here's the LG G flex in the
before shot you're just seeing how this
is a fully operational phone before I
even get started with this drop test
alright and here we go we're going to
drop the LG G flex right on to its back
so let's see what happens in three two
one
and for the most part if there were any
scratches that were on this healing back
it must have gone away already but the
ones that dig a lote that dug a little
bit deeper are definitely showing there
and I'm not too sure if those are gonna
come off
however we will give it a little bit of
time and see if that will be the case a
nice nimble grip on there all the
cameras should be rolling right now and
we're going in three two
the phone bounced when it fell onto its
bottom and I didn't know what to expect
when I picked it up however as you can
see here there was a crack on the bottom
there was enough impact to create a
fissure right here and we have a small
number of very long cracks that go all
the way to other sides of the phone even
reaching the top right corner in one
case so unfortunately we do have a crack
screen already after the second test
which was dropping it on its bottom the
phone does still work however after all
we're gonna be done here and it looks
like even in that little crack the Menu
button still works about as well as it
should
here we go we'll see how the curve right
here makes the screen maybe hopefully a
little bit protective but obviously we
already approved that wrong by cracking
here but here we go with the final test
making sure all my cameras are good
getting a nice angle right here and here
we go in three two one nice square hit
there
we did already provide some damage using
the bottom test that came down over here
oh I did the knock-knock and it still
worked that's a good sign and then of
course we had the top left cracking as
well and I suppose when the cracks met
in the middle it created a bit of a
fissure right over there
so as I did the knock-knock it came up
it looks like the phone is still
operational many buns still works down
here let's see if I can bring down the
notification drop down from the top left
yes that seems to be the case I do feel
I think I got nicked by a piece of glass
so I'm probably going to put a band-aid
hung later anyway that is the danger you
have with a cracked screen so that is
the end of our drop test right there and
so there you have it for this drop test
on the LG G flex despite the positivity
that I had going into this that the
screen would be protected due to the
curve that is somewhat protecting it
unfortunately you are still able to get
impact on the very corners and sides of
the screen and that is enough to create
a shatter that's something that is
pretty much expected however I had some
positivity coming into this I had some
hopes for it that is so all in all we do
see however that the back of the LG G
flex is still pretty much intact I'm not
too sure if the self-healing material
has done its job but I will say that
there are some cracks on here that
really dug into the material on the back
and those I'm pretty sure are not going
to go away after a couple hours which is
what we're going to wait is how long
we're going to wait to see if those go
away with the phone still being
operational it is possible to still use
this phone which is a bit of a pass on
the drop test however like I kind of did
thankfully I'm not bleeding I did get a
little nicked by the glass for the first
time in these drop tests so just
remember that sort of danger that coming
in to a phone that's has a cracked
screen like this so as always thank you
very much for watching this drop test of
the LG G flex don't forget to drop us
likes on our videos to subscribe to our
channel if you haven't already and to
share our videos with anybody you like
on social media and you can follow us on
social media including myself if you
want to follow me from time to time
using the links that are below that
subscribe button
down below well that's it for the LG G
flex but that is not it for our coverage
of it because we are Android Authority
your source for all things Android ouch
that hurt so it's been something like
two and a half hours after I've done the
drop test on the LG G flex I just wanted
to show you real quick you'll see a
close-up and maybe a picture too because
why not of the scuffs that were
originally there on the LG G flex and I
would say originally they're not because
they went away but because well they
look a little bit better now I will say
and we waited for a while I even did a
couple of things to try to facilitate
the healing process on the back however
those scuffs are always going to be
there I knew that that was going to be
the case because it really dug into the
material and it's kind of like polishing
a crater you can't really do anything
when the crater is there so that is what
we're working with here that was your
drop test for the LG G flex and
ostensibly your self-healing back test
as well so two birds one stone there you
go so keep it tuned to Android authority
we're your source for all things Android
and stay tuned for more on the LG G flex</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
