looks familiar in fact it looks a lot
like a lot of other Android phones on
the market today but that's not
necessarily a bad thing with a little
glass body and optically stabilized
lenses this phone feels just as good if
not better than the top Android phones
on the market today what matters most
here is the value that Xiaomi is
offering with this phone and my briefing
they told me that their entire value
proposition is to offer better or the
same specs as the highest competition on
the market and at just about 421 dollars
that is exactly what they're doing here
MEA is running a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845
six gigabytes of ram up to 256 gigabytes
of storage in a three thousand four
hundred million power battery that seems
to be the new standard for these
flagship killer phones and it's nice to
see Xiaomi catching up with Samsung and
the other Giants in the industry this
phone comes standard in a variety of
color ways but the model that you're
going to want is definitely the Explorer
edition this model has a transparent
back similar to the translucent back on
the HTC u12 plus and it has a decorative
overlay to show the components inside
this model has some extra RAM at 8
gigabytes and just a little bit less
battery at 3,000 million hours instead
of 3400 we're just hoping it doesn't
significantly impact the battery life on
that six point two one inch AMOLED
screen the most important aspects of the
Explorer edition though are the in
screen fingerprint reader and the 3d
face unlock now we've only seen that
fingerprint reader in phones like the
vivo X 21 and we think that show me can
probably do just as well this reader is
pressure sensitive - meaning it'll only
ping the display when you're pressing
down on it which should significantly
save battery life the rear cameras are
both 12 megapixels and the primary
camera is actually optically stabilized
the front-facing camera is 20 megapixels
- so your selfies should look great on
this phone the face unlock on the
Explorer edition is actually pretty
similar to the iPhone 10s creating a 3d
map of your face using infrared light
this should only work with your face -
and because it uses a 3d scanning
technology it shouldn't be fooled by
pictures this technology also led ShowMe
to create a studio lighting feature and
a features very similar to an emoji
which is coming later in a future update
another quick thing to know here but the
chummy me8 is one of the first phones to
use dual frequency cheap
yes this should make their GPS much more
accurate and it is a lifesaver for me
because I hate using walking GPS in San
Francisco it is always an accurate the
regular model will cost between 421 and
515 dollars depending on the model you
get and the Explorer edition is going to
come in at five hundred and seventy
seven dollars with only one model
available eight gigabytes of RAM and 128
gigabytes of storage what are your
thoughts on this phone the Explorer
edition is definitely the model to look
out for because it utilizes two
technologies that are only available in
a handful of phones today as usual leave
your thoughts in the comment section
below hit that Bell and stay tuned to
our socials because of course we are
your source for all things Android hey
guys so I just got back from that event
and I just wanted to address a couple
things that I couldn't really say there
first of all yeah this phone looks
exactly like it iPhone I mean even down
to the camera placement iPhone like
someone would probably think this was an
iPhone if you pull it out of your pocket
but I really actually just want to know
if you care about that cuz like I mean
it's still a really good design still so
it feels really great in your hand if
it's gonna have the face unlock and use
the an emoji like it doesn't in the same
way but like do you care like I I don't
really care but you know it's up to you
I actually want to know like do you guys
think that they need to be making a
completely different design let me know
in the comments section obviously the
other thing is there was a lot of
controversy around this phone
specifically the Explorer edition I
don't know if you've heard about it but
the transparent back that shows the
components the story is those are not
real like components I try to have
Xiaomi and they were giving me some
vague answers what I've read online that
they are real parts but they are just
there for an artistic touch so you could
theoretically take those off and it
wouldn't change the function of the
phone they're really just there to like
show the art of Technology that's what
Xiaomi told me I still think it looks
really cool so I don't really care it's
it's definitely up to the marketing like
whether or not you think they need to be
I think they should be totally honest
with it they're just being very big so
I'm not really sure what is the case but
that is what I read online when I got
home because I was like really curious
about that I heard a lot of controversy
about it
so I'm hear from you guys like do you
think that it's okay for manufacturers
to do something like that you know make
a transparent back glass that is not
necessarily representative of what the
actual components look like but is kind
of like artistically placed I mean in a
way it's just like a color right so but
you know it's up to you I do want to
know that I really actually want to know
so leave the thoughts about both those
things in the comment section below I
just wanted to make sure you guys were
aware of these things so I wasn't just
like spouting off specs and stuff so let
me know your thoughts and I'll talk to
you later all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
