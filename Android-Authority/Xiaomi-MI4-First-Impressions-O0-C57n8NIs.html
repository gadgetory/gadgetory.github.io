authority or pretty big fans of what we
see out of the Chinese market especially
in the last year or so and you guys have
been requesting this particular phone
and I finally got on my doorstep so it's
joshua guard from android authority
what's going on everybody and it's time
to give a quick unboxing but also give
my first impressions on these yummy me
for getting your hands on the actual box
where the me for really shows its kind
of utilitarian I mean the box itself is
not very flashy at all you just have the
me logo on the top right and then you
have the box itself which once you open
it up you get the phone in all its glory
of course you're going to see that
5-inch screen right up front but get
that out of the way and you can get
under the next flap which will give you
just the plug adapter for the micro USB
charging cable which is right next to it
some documentation and of course the
tool to be able to put in your sim card
now one thing that we should mention
about this phone is that it will not
work on all LTE networks if any adult
here in the United States I certainly
can't get it to work with my AT&amp;amp;T 4G LTE
so that's something you have to keep in
mind when using this phone but once you
get the phone out and get past the
plastic on the front you'll see a phone
that well take some inspiration from
another particular ecosystem but it's
not really something we're going to
fault it too much for because it does
rock that metal chassis that metal frame
pretty well from the front to the back
with that full white background and it
has the camera up top with the me logo
on the bottom but the screen up front is
pretty nice with a nice bezel that's
really not all that big that at all on
the sides and a little bit of girth on
the top and bottom but of course that is
to make room for the front-facing camera
and the button layout on the bottom
handling the actual device itself is
really kind of a breeze because it has
the flat sides and it's really easy to
just sort of grip in one hand after all
this is a 5-inch phone not quite 5.5
inches compared to a lot of the bigger
phones out there and thus it is really
easy to keep a grip on this phone the
buttons on the right side take on a sort
of a mirrored look because you have the
volume rockers at the top with the power
button right underneath it which is a
little bit different from other phones
out there but it does make the power
button very easy to trigger as you can
see right there now like I already
mentioned I threw in my sim card from
AT&amp;amp;T and I've only been able to get
hsdpa
connectivity on here but that should
work for most tasks that I'm going to be
using this phone for but getting it to
the actual you I itself we're going to
see the miui or the me UI which some of
you may be familiar with out there as
you may have that rom installed on some
of your phones but it is the official
operating system for these yummy line of
phones and from there anyone out there
who knows about the me you I will know
that this doesn't come with an app
drawer it's something that might kind of
put a few of you users off but to be
honest even if it doesn't have that app
drawer it does have a very clean look to
it you have sort of a boxy feel to all
of the icons and the outcome on a very
clean grid and even the fonts all the
way down to even though wallpaper that's
in the background really make this look
like an attractive inter interface that
allows everything to sort of just sort
of pie a lot because you're going to get
just rows and rows and pages and pages
of icons if you install a lot of
applications onto the Xiaomi me for but
like I said it is pretty nice it's quite
utilitarian in the sense that you get
everything that you need in front of you
you're looking at the notification drop
down right here that has all of the talk
was that you need and it's easy to get
to the notifications on the side the
interface does look a little bubbly but
not overly so like I said the me you I
uses more of a boxy look to it with
rounded corners on all of the icons and
in all of the corners and edges of the
actual interface and in the end it is a
good looking interface that otherwise
has the same type of functionality that
you would expect quite honestly I don't
really have any problems with the way
that this phone is constructed to be
honest it feels really nice especially
with a 5-inch screen it makes it pretty
easy to use with one hand especially
compared to some of the other larger
Chinese phones that we've already had
our hands on but even if it does look
like apples phone in a way because of
that metal frame for the most part
that's okay because this is giving us a
look into what a larger iPhone might
look like and that's the reason why if
you look on the internet all over the
place you'll see this one being compared
to the 5s already but also being
compared to the upcoming iPhone 6 but
underneath the surface we have a lot of
power that you would expect from a
flagship Android device the Snapdragon
801 the audrina 330 a 1080p display with
441 pixels-per-inch and just a lot of
power underneath that will allow you to
really get a lot out of what is
available in the Xiaomi me for so keep
it tuned to Android or new for all of
the best coverage including my full
review of
this and a comparison between it and a
couple of the other flagships if you so
happen to want the me for over some of
the ones that are available right now of
course we do have Eva coming up in a
couple weeks and i am going to be there
so you can stay tuned for all of that
coverage as well and stay tuned for all
of the upcoming flagships from Eva the
announcements of let's say some other
smartwatches and also don't forget to
check out the content from my colleagues
in Android to job with some likes and to
subscribe to our channel if you haven't
already and once you're done with all of
that don't forget to head on over to
android authority calm because we are
