heard about the leaked supposed Samsung
Galaxy S 9 release date but have you
heard that feature Samsung devices may
have an under the screen selfie camera
according to Evan glass aka evey leaks
citing a c-level executive at a major
case maker the galaxy s 9 and s 9 plus
may be unveiled at Mobile World Congress
rolled out for pre-order on March 1st
before being officially released on
March 16th now this seems roughly right
because it matches up with the Galaxy S
series previous release dates but the
little red flag is the fact that
February 26th is a Monday and normally
these launches or releases happen on the
Sunday before the grounds open up at the
Mobile World Congress but maybe this
information that the c-level executive
at a case maker received just is
suggesting that it's gonna happen at the
beginning of Mobile World Congress
that's the way I tend to swing now let's
talk about rumors surrounding Samsung's
possible future under the screen selfie
cameras a recently published patent
shows a Samsung device with a near 100%
screen to body ratio to achieve this the
patent shows the selfie camera and other
front-facing sensors placed under the
glass images and videos along with text
look wrapped around the holes that will
accommodate the sensors first spotted by
let's go digital the patent shows holes
in a flexible OLED screen for not only
the selfie camera but the earpiece and
other sensors this allows the display to
almost take over the top of the phone
with text wrapping around the holes
how's that going to work well it appears
that people will have the choice of
using the full display area or a smaller
area to view images and video and
finally it looks like twitch means to
take on YouTube with new producer tools
go twitch twitch announced in a blog
post this week that it's debuting new
tools for content creators the new tools
called video producer let creators make
landing pages for new videos and rerun
their previous content the biggest
change is that streamers can now upload
pre-made videos
to them at a specific time the premieres
must have a landing page where creators
can add a countdown timer to increase
the anticipation twitch is also allowing
content creators to set reruns as the
name suggests these videos have already
aired and can be played yet again the
thought here is that just because it was
aired once doesn't mean that everyone
was able to see it subscriber counts can
vary widely as streamers become more
popular so it's beneficial for them to
be able to replay content several times
after content creators on Twitch live
stream their games they will often
upload them later to YouTube twitch
wants to keep their users on twitch not
jump over to YouTube so they're allowing
this feature to help create a better
ecosystem what do you gamers think about
it how many of you use twitch is this
gonna matter to you because people
YouTube needs more competition believe
