of options when it comes to their
handheld devices manufacturers like
Samsung HTC and LG dominate our
landscape but with the oneplus one the
consumer has now seen that there are
viable high-end alternatives to their
brand-name counterparts that have the
hardware to compete with their more
expensive brethren one such device is
the meizu mx4 this is the successor to
last year's mx3 and it features a host
of hardware and software upgrades to
satisfy users increasing tastes for
better mobile devices can the meizu mx4
measure up to the competition we're
going to find out in today's review hi
everybody this is brian fury for android
authority and this is the meizu mx4
immediate impressions of the phone are
that it is very Apple like overall the
design is very clean and aesthetic and
it is extremely close to Apple's design
language the build is overall sturdy and
the phone will be available in grey
silver and gold the device is slightly
weighted which gives it a much more
quality feel but the plastic bag keeps
it from feeling very premium the device
is slippery to the touch and more than
once I had a drop scare with it coming
out of my pocket the phone is crafted
from aircraft grade aluminum featuring
it around the edges and in the frame the
buttons are also made of aluminum and
the clicks feel very solid especially
with the volume rocker however the power
button sits a little low and can get
lost in top of the frame the power
button on top feels very awkward for a
phone of the size where the standard is
a side mounted button the plastic back
is rounded and has a nice satin feel
which holds well in the hand however on
this review unit it doesn't sit very
flush with the sides and there are
slight gaps around the edges it also
tends to creak under pressure a little
bit and the gaps in the corners feel
kind of awkward when you're holding it
the company logo on the back plastic is
unobtrusive and understated the camera
position on the back is a prominent
feature with a large glass element
occupying the top of the rear case
beneath the back cover it lies its non
removable 3100 milliamp battery and a
micro SIM slot there is no micro SD card
slot and the review unit is available in
the 32 gig size the
front does feature Corning Gorilla Glass
3 which is durable and responsive
speaking of the Gorilla Glass 3 it comes
to us in a 5.3 6-inch display which
technically shows at 1080p however the
actual resolution is 1920 by 1152 this
yields us a wonderful pixel per inch of
418
this causes images to look really really
sharp the display is almost bezu list
with 0.2 millimeters on the side and it
features a capacitive touch home button
on the very bottom of the phone the
device does give us on-screen buttons
for the rest overall the size feels
really comfortable in the hand and it's
very useful for entertainment and
productivity YouTube videos are very
clean and crisp and they string really
easily the aspect ratio is a little bit
odd and some applications do have
problems displaying on it
text is crisp and extremely sharp on the
colors that are reproduced on-screen are
very clean and don't appear to be
oversaturated at all there is a little
problem with some games and applications
being displayed with different color
sets on this unit than I've seen on
other devices viewing in direct sunlight
is pretty good when the auto just works
properly otherwise if you set the
brightness manually that is the best way
to overcome ambient light overall the
performance of this unit is very good a
start-up of devices very fast and
there's no noticeable lag moving between
the screens the device does have some
cool gestures which are quick wake up
you do get to double tap on the screen
and it'll light up the lockscreen if you
swipe down it'll show notifications if
you swipe up it will unlock the phone
and if you swipe left you'll open the
camera swipe to the right is
programmable to the application of your
choice notifications are fullscreen and
it is easy to access additional controls
on the notification panel by swiping
down and that when the notification
screen is open notifications do show up
with simple icons in the top left but
anything other than a text message is a
mystery until you swipe down on the home
screens you do get big clear icons that
are clean with sharp edges the 1080p
provides an excellent viewing experience
and the external speaker is actually
really good for a handheld device you do
get a loud sound which is pretty clear
and cool
but the bottom firing speaker does leak
some audio when he don't really want it
to while the external speaker is loud
the earpiece speaker does deliver low
volume even when you're at the maximum
settings while quality is good and
people I called had no problem hearing
me with the device I was able to get
about a full day of usage with moderate
to slightly heavy activity but this is
slightly disappointing for a 3100
milliamp battery I feel like it should
have been able to handle at least a day
and a half or a day and a quarter
without me having to go ahead and
recharge it there is no app drawer and
multitasking is handled by swiping up
from the bottom however you can only see
eight applications at a time
there is also only one capacitive touch
button and for this size of phone I
might have liked the few more
additionally the keyboard does not
autocorrect or autofill this greatly
slows down typing for me at least
because I have to keep going back and
correcting my errors it is also pretty
hard to type single handedly on a screen
this large however this could be
remedied by installing a different
keyboard the fly me keyboard is okay but
it doesn't have swipe and it is not easy
to switch between letters and numbers
the hardware available on the phone is
actually really decent for a phone this
price the hardware package on this phone
is actually pretty robust you do get a
mediatek octa-core chipset featuring two
quad-core processors a 2.2 gigahertz
cortex a 17 and a 1.7 gigahertz cortex
a7 the GPU is a power vrg 6200 and you
do get a 3100 milliamp battery wireless
duties are handled by an 802 11 AC card
and the phone is available with 16 32 or
64 gigabytes of onboard memory there is
a single sim card slot on it and there
are LTE antennas however they're only
for China a noticeable exclusion is the
micro SD card slot this does seem
standard for high performance low cost
phones one noticeable example is the
oneplus one during gaming there are some
interesting things that show up I
noticed some slowdowns while I was
playing spider-man unlimited and it also
displayed a lot darker graphics than I
have seen on other devices cars faster
than lightning has great performance but
I saw some mister on
and first wiping games it eats really
easy to hit the home hallo button the
top half of the phone does get pretty
hot to the touch when doing processor
intensive activities like gaming or
heavy internet usage overall the
increased number of cores does not
necessarily create a faster device and
it doesn't really feel any different
than any of the phones that feature
Qualcomm top-tier chips camera duties
are handled by a twenty point seven
megapixel Sony Exmor unit with a dual
LED flash the camera aperture maximum is
F 2.2 and the dual LED is to help with
accurate colors during flash situations
the camera software is easy to use and
has tons of options
you only need to swipe left and right to
access all the different shooting
settings you do get a 2 megapixel
front-facing camera for pretty good
selfies this 2 megapixel shooter is of
good quality but it struggles in
low-light image quality from the main
camera is sharp with a lot of light
however the image is lack the vibrant
pop and saturation of some of the other
cameras on the market the autofocus
motor is a little bit noisy and does
take a second to focus properly
additionally it also refocuses after
every shot so when you're taking
pictures you do want to make sure and
take a second before every single shot
that you take also of note is that in
low-light conditions the camera does
struggle a little bit and it hunts for
focus quite a bit noticeable features of
the phone camera are the panorama
feature there's 4k video 120 frames per
second slow-motion face beauty mode
night mode macro mode HDR functionality
and a plethora of manual controls there
are also a bunch of filters and
hold-your-breath there's actually a
barcode reader built into the camera
software overall the camera's best
during daylight and if you're using it
willing it out and about it is actually
a really great camera but if you're
indoors or in low-light situations you
may want to make sure people are under
good light sources
finally the operating system came in the
flavor of fly me 4.0 this operating
system is specific to meizu and it is
simple and colorful it is arguable that
it is very Apple esque it seems that
they were going for a less is more
concept however it did feel like the
Android user experience was slightly
crippled by trying to simplify an
already simple operating system often
times it was frustrating to see that
things were not normally where they were
and it didn't feel necessarily intuitive
to navigate the settings a glaring flaw
for customizers would be the inability
to install different launchers so the
users are stuck with the experience of
the fly me operating system while it is
clean and pleasant the lockdown OS
brought a few problems to the table it
appeared that there was buggy software
my sample unit any of the Google apps
were not initially installed in fly me
4.0 and you were stuck was trying to
deal with the fly me App Store there was
supposed to be an update that greatly
overhauls this user experience and
pre-installed google play services
certain apps like the weather
application app center and voice
assistant are optimized for the Chinese
market and if you don't speak Chinese
you're going to have a really hard time
navigating any of that stuff most
applications including the operating
system are not necessarily optimized for
the 5 to 3 aspect ratio additionally the
unit would not automatically adjust its
time based on my carrier data after some
light usage initially all my apps
stopped working and then randomly
overnight the Google Play Store app
started working and all the rest of my
apps were ok I wish I could give you a
better idea of what happened there but
it was as if they magically started
working overnight it felt like a lot of
the settings were not where they should
be expected and the layout felt a little
awkward when I was navigating it English
translations of certain phrases were
entertaining most notable being the
don't cover top of phone when unlocked
bug which materialized every once in a
while when trying to unlock my phone
setting up my Google account on the
phone required an installation of the
Google Play services through the fly me
app center in addition setting up all of
my google apps was not a smooth
experience and required a lot of
patience and me reinstalling the apps
multiple times even after setting things
up properly the apps were often saying
that my Google account could not be
immediately accessed also slightly
annoying was the fact that the volume
buttons did not change the ringer volume
they only changed the music volume so if
I wanted to mute the sound I would have
to go through and go into the
notifications menu to meet my phone app
handling and multi app use was slightly
cumbersome as well and there were
multiple occasions when apps would get
stuck after pausing to go to another
application and I would have to manually
close the app in the app manager the
majority of the time this happened with
games and finally many applications
would quit during loading sequences most
notably Instagram during videos to wrap
it all up at a low price point of four
hundred and thirty four dollars on
Amazon for the 32 gigabyte model the
meizu mx4 offers a lot for your money
it's combination of an octa-core
processor with a large and beautiful
screen make it especially appealing for
immediate consumption productivity would
be aided by a new keyboard and outside
of the oddities that popped up during
testing with the OS fly me is pretty
livable and especially if it was
improved with their latest rom if the
routing and modding community expands
for this device there would also be a
lot of potential for power users to get
even more out of the phone overall the
phone is an excellent package and a
great alternative to many of the other
phones that are out there the fact that
this is a Chinese market phone means
that very very few people in the US will
have it and that means it would be
pretty exclusive if you did if you're
willing to look past the blemishes of
this device it is a unique and powerful
handheld that is excellent for media
consumption and entertainment as well as
the international traveler if you liked
