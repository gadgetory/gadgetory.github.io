on the ground from Mobile World Congress
and man you guys will not believe who
I'm with I'm with none of and kevin
bacon from Liquipel he has some really
really cool things to say sure I hope
you don't mind if I just show our
audience ought to build it just don't
ask for my ID please truly Kevin Bacon
it don't will reveal his personal email
to the highest subscribe comment no but
seriously Liquipel produces some pretty
crazy stuff solutely so we have a demo
here can you just run us through it yeah
surely absolutely yeah so basically what
Liquipel is it's a liquid repellent
nanotechnology so we're able to do is
take your device put it inside one of
our specialized piece of machinery pumps
down to create a vacuum we then inject
the liquid repellent formulation which
turns from the liquid to a gas that
comes into the chamber I permites all
through the device and just about 30
minutes or so comes back up diamonds
Berg pressure pull the device out you're
ready to rock and roll so consumers they
have to send the device you guys yes
either come either send it in or they
can come down to our location but this
year we've actually released the liquid
pod which is our new retail friendly
machine that will be deployed and that
is massive ugly so exactly it's time you
know it's something we all want yeah
just give you an idea here this is a
tissue that's been treated with the
Liquipel technology yeah Phil's impacts
looks just like forgot to shoe a racket
till you start to put some water on this
okay
no way man see wow it just speeds up and
rolls right off the same thing we can
take this and go home
I need some liquor / underwear man hey
grandma you're exactly right exactly
right so there you go you validate yeah
no don't for everybody right so same
type of thing going on there as what's
going on with the devices so we have the
new Samsung Galaxy Note 2 it's been
treated with the Liquipel process and
would you care to have an accident today
honestly I've dropped my phone in the
toilet like every weekend alright cool
i'll get you on this one then okay so as
you can see everything here is still
fully functional just like a regular
phone would be all the ports are all
open Oh straight up three to five
millimeters open everything's open yep
okay yep everything just as it would be
and then if you drop it in the water
sometimes the water think it's touching
the screen yeah yeah I mean that's just
you know what happens when you can still
function but it you know it's all like
yeah the time yeah the capacitive
touchscreens don't really work
underwater but yeah but the pony adobo
about water isn't breaking the membrane
it's not getting into the device you're
exactly right yeah and once you pull
this out I mean your PCB is still going
to be intact your speaker is going to be
intact you know and usually your device
would be junked and obviously like
repels now prevented that from happening
so if we dry it up a little bit sorry
for abusing you that's all right they're
gonna have a long week it's that long
I'd already I mean the bottom line is
still functioning yes and it's not going
to actually cause any damage to the
inside of it whatsoever nope nope we're
actually able to draw that formulation
all through it with our process how many
devices have you done Liquipel if I'd
already owe tens if not hundreds of
thousands so I mean we have multiple
licensees out there in the world we have
licensees in Australia Hong Kong
Malaysia we've deployed now in the
Middle East you know we have a Saudi
Arabia Qatar dubai i'll be coming up
pretty soon turkey Russia South Africa
Azerbaijan I mean we are we're getting
I'm getting out there is a pod like a
little robotic liquification Liquipel
machine bro and so it because it's
nano-based uh-huh it's able to like get
into the three nine millimeter audio
port yes yeah I totally protect
everything yeah
so small right so basically what's
happening is we're drawing it into a gas
and so pretty much where you can imagine
air can get inside of that device we can
get our coding in there as well and that
is too cool and they bring them back to
you I just tucked it back in again no
worries can I use the liquid pill tissue
that's not gonna do you a lot of good
because it's Liquipel if I said I can't
believe this nigga's name get wet can I
put the nice to wear please good it just
doesn't want to get wet yeah you should
take that one with you makes a great bar
trick oh my god so that's how the
magicians do it twice as many yeah yes
all right we're expanding its for sure
totally dry uh-huh that's amazing and
obviously this is gonna work
I need Liquipel in my life yeah we could
do that for you absolutely I can we give
away ten little pulses to some android
authority readers there did we do
something like we could work something
out if you could send me one of those
pods I gave him my craw yeah I don't
know that's going to happen then you're
gonna be slinging Liquipel out here rod
like I got a brand image to me but I my
daddy Kevin Bacon little town thanks so
much for your time at it absolutely
thank you android authority Mobile World
