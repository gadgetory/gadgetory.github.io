popular streaming devices on the market
right now it not only lets you watch
Amazon's own growing list of originals
but also lets you watch things from the
likes of Netflix and HBO GO but if you
live outside of the US then you might
render some difficulties if you visit
Netflix from certain regions for
instance then you might get a screen
like this one and likewise if you do
manage to connect you might find that
the content available is very different
depending on where you're based in the
world fortunately there is a way around
this and that's to use a VPN a VPN is a
Virtual Private Network and it's an
incredibly flexible and increasingly
important tool I say important because
VPNs have a ton of security benefits
which can read about over Andrew RT calm
at the same time though the VPN can also
be used to fake your location you do
this by routing your traffic through
different servers located all around the
world when you do this you open up a ton
of possibilities including of course
accessing that extra content from your
amazon firetv so how do you go about
doing this well fortunately it's very
simple and I'm gonna show you in this
video and for the sake of example I'm
gonna be using our top recommended VPN
service expressvpn however the same
trick would work with any VPN software
so to get started first you're going to
need to download the Express VPN app for
the amazon firetv
to find it just go to the magnifying
glass in the top left of the screen and
search for expressvpn select it click
download and then it'll install then
click open the app will take you to an
interest screen where you can choose to
sign in or start a free trial the free
trial lasts a week and only lets you
access the service on your amazon firetv
but with a full subscription you can
actually use Express VPN on other
devices like your smartphone or computer
as well if you visit expressvpn com
forward slash standard authority you can
get three months free with a 12 month
subscription you can also find that link
in the video description down below once
you have your account go ahead and sign
in with your account email and password
you'll have to go through a couple of
configuration windows just click OK then
you'll get a request to share analytics
with the VPN service it's up to you if
you want to do that or not
once you reach the app screen normally
you'd connect automatically to the smart
location and that's just a server that's
located near to you however if we want
to change our location then we need to
go to choose location
and pick a server that works for us once
the button goes green that's when we
know we're connected now it's time for
the moment of truth
exit expressvpn head over to your
favorite streaming app and then try and
access content or see if you can get
content this normally restricted in your
location if you manage it well then
you're golden keep in mind that the best
location for accessing content will
change from time to time but if you're
having any problems and you can access a
member of expressvpn support team 24/7
they're very helpful and very charming
and there you go guys that's how you
access locked content using a VPN and if
you like the looks of expressvpn then
remember you can head over to the link
in the description down below
that's expressvpn com4 slash andrew
authority in order to get access to a
special deal so I hope you found this
video useful interesting guys if you did
then please leave a like please share it
around please comment down below and let
us know what content you're going to be
watching now that you can access it
