Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 183 so let's get it
started YouTube and daydream are teaming
up to make some better be our videos
right now most of you our videos use
something called equal rectangular
projection it works for now but the
quality could be better the idea these
two companies are going with is called
equiangular tube map projection it's a
similar concept that's used in video
games but for VR video instead we'll
learn more about it as they release more
information there is a new humble mobile
bundle ready for download it has a total
of nine games for right now including
anomaly to Kingdom rush frontiers worms
for and others you can pay one dollar
and get four of the games pay three
dollars and get four more games or pay
five dollars and you'll get every game
in the bundle this is actually a pretty
nice bundle with some very good games in
it it's worth checking out and you'll be
helping charity as well google has a new
app incoming called family link and it's
close to release this new application
gives parents more control over the
smartphones of their kids the
application will let parents do things
like lock kids out of their devices and
monitor what they download from Google
Play that should help with things like
accidental purchases or kids losing
their phone parents can request an early
invite if they'd want to try it out for
now however most will have to wait for
the official release we have learned
some new information about Pandora
premium as expected the aim will be to
do battle with the likes of Apple music
Spotify and other music streaming
services it'll also cost nine dollars
and ninety-nine cents just like all the
competition what we know right now is
that Pandora will start by sending out
invites to people who want to test out
the service the whole thing should be
rolling out in the near future as it
turns out google assistant is not coming
to android tablets by now you've likely
heard that it is coming to every
smartphone running android marshmallow
and above google announced this week
that they are definitely not doing
tablets at least not right now that's
not to say that it won't come eventually
simply that there are no plans to do so
right now adjust your expectations
accordingly subspace is a free shooting
game you play as a dude who floats
around in space and you have to shoot
bad guys that show up avoid obstacles
and move around as best as you can you
shoot to move and sometimes you have to
wait to reload a little bit it also
features some pretty decent dubstep
music so we recommend you
check it out with headphones the game is
completely free to play with no in-app
purchases and that makes it a good
choice for those on a budget supersonic
is a new messaging application that uses
your voice it will listen to what you
say and then convert it into text the
text is then sent to the recipient it's
a fun little application that will do
some quirky things like change words to
emoji when the situation calls for it or
people can also just listen to the
message if they want to it's a new
application so there are some bugs here
and there and we've seen some people
complaining about the contact management
features as well however it's worth a
shot if this sounds like you are kind of
thing ghosts and goblins is a port of
the classic 1985 arcade game of the same
name it's made by Capcom and unlike the
broken Mega Man ports this one works
pretty well it's a side-scrolling
platformer where you'll have to run jump
and fight your way past obstacles and
bad guys you'll also have a casual game
mode in case you want to play on an
easier setting there is support for
Google Play game services as well if
that matters to you it's a tough old
arcade game but we had a lot of fun with
it it's 99 cents with no in-app
purchases hangouts meet is one of two
new Google applications to augment
google hangouts this one is a
conferencing application where you can
create and join meetings with coworkers
it supports up to 30 participants it's
fairly easy to use and you can turn off
video and just use your voice if you
want to the basic functionality is
available for free although you will
need AG sweet enabled account to use all
the features it's simple it may be a bit
too simple but it is there if you want
to try it out it's free to download in
the Google Play Store clue is the
classic board game that many of us
remember from our childhood for those
who somehow don't know clue is a game
where you have to figure out who
committed the murder which room of the
house it was in and which weapon they
use this is a pretty faithful recreation
and most people haven't had a problem
with it so far there are a few
improvements that could be made but
overall it's a very solid experience you
can pick it up for three dollars and
ninety-nine cents with no in-app
purchases okay folks I have a minor
announcement before we close out this
