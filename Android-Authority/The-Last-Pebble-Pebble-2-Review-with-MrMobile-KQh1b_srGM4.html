smart wearables maybe not the first but
definitely one of the earliest has made
its final mark on tech history
unfortunately it wasn't the most
positive of exits for pebble to remember
a crowdfunding giant and one of the
respected names in the business we look
at the last product that they were able
to put out before their eventual demise
this is the pebble - quite literally the
last of its kind age - regard from
Andrew authority what's going on
everybody and I'm here to bring you a
review of this the pebble - now this is
the very last one that they're going to
make because much of what made pebble
while pebble got acquired by Fitbit but
after the review I'm also going to bring
you my retrospective on the company and
the product itself however for those
last couple of parts I did call upon an
old friend to give me a little bit of
help and he has some opinions of his own
that he would like to share with you
it's mr. Mobil himself Michael Fisher
this is the disembodied voice of mr.
Mobil thanks for having me Josh but
first let's get into the review the
pebble - one of three different products
that were part of the last Kickstarter
campaign was the base model watch but
served as the example of pebbles
movements forward in software and
hardware the watch body bears quite a
bit of resemblance to the original
pebble but sports a larger screen which
is of course a welcome addition all the
buttons do pretty much all the same
things as they did before and still have
that satisfying click the main addition
to the pebble - is a heart rate sensor a
move into the health segment that
started with pebble health in previous
watches pebble software underwent a
number of positive changes over the last
year and it all looked great on the
larger display despite its lack of color
that was reserved for the pebble time
series honestly that might be the one
part that was a little bit depressing is
that for me I really wanted the pebble
time to it's the follow-up to what has
been one of my favorite smartwatches of
all time but that's all a thing of the
past now with Fitbit acquiring much of
the company the future of existing
pebble devices will run into 2017 with
no word on what will occur after if you
do have a pebble to cherish it it is
quite literally the very last of its
kind now and that's kind of sad because
pebble was one of those products that
you actually wanted to see succeed a lot
can be said about the company itself and
how everything was handled but for a
product like this SmartWatch it thought
differently from the other one
and it was still incredibly effective
swipes and taps on Android wear tend to
have a small margin of error and you
could get into some trouble there
meanwhile the buttons on the pebble in
particular we're always so reliable and
got you exactly where you needed to go
not to mention the community that pebble
garnered over its tenure so many loyal
developers came to pebble because they
felt like a group separate from those
who flocked to the giant companies and
their existing fan bases pebble stood
alone and it supported users and
developers with a fervor that was
palpable in the pebble app store and in
the subreddit and it wasn't as a pebble
as a walled garden either it even
leveraged the open nature of Android
wear and used its back-end to provide
voice and canned actions used in
notifications and all of this one was
set to continue with an all-new piece of
pebble tech called the core the pebble
time to and this the pebble to mr.
Mobile here I never got to spend time
with the core or the pebble time to but
I was delighted enough by my experience
with the standard pebble to that I don't
think I missed out on much Josh already
covered most of the pebble twos bits and
pieces so I won't retread them instead
I'll tell you what I loved most about
this upgrade pebble didn't sacrifice its
fundamental simplicity part of that is
the after mentioned preference for
tactile buttons over touchscreens and
part of it is the use of well-designed
software some may find the animations a
little cutesy I get it but to me they
gave pebble a personality that's missing
from other wearables that plus the small
footprint and rock-solid notification
reliability is something I'm really
gonna miss Plus and this is a little
more subjective
I feel like pebble gave itself a license
to be geeky in a way that most of its
competitors are a little too shy to do
so pebble is no more and we're just
gonna have to deal with that at least
fit bid has said that existing pebble
devices are going to work through 2017
and I plan on wearing this proudly
throughout the year but especially after
2017 where does that leave us with other
smartwatches well there are a lot of
choices out there but I do find myself
because I was a pebble fan looking for
alternatives that have out-of-the-box
thinking especially when it comes to
navigation fully touchscreen watches
aside there is
main player I actually really enjoy the
Samsung gear s2 and s3 it's rotating
clicky bezel is one of the most unique
and still funnest ways of getting around
a SmartWatch today it's third-party app
support is a bit anemic compared to
Android wear but there's plenty more
that you can do with it even take calls
the problem price at $349 it is not a
direct alternative to pebble but instead
a highly premium option more
cost-effective choices could come from
lesser-known companies and one that we
are currently testing is the tick watch
- it isn't heavy on physical controls
but it does bring a different form of
navigation there's a touch-sensitive
panel on the side that users can tickle
in order to scroll up and down on the
interface and it is powered by a full
version of Android our full review of
the tick watch 2 is coming soon but to
check that price $179 for a display
forward SmartWatch that packs all the
features you'd expect
now I haven't played with the tick watch
- so I'm gonna fall back on an old
standby vector first caught my eye over
a year ago in fact Josh and I were at
the same bar when we saw it and it
interested me mainly because it was one
of the only smartwatches to work with
Windows Phone I know I'm a weirdo when I
found out that vector rated its watches
battery life in weeks rather than days
and that they came in such attractive
trims I resolved to follow up with the
review but with pebble in the picture it
was always an afterthought well after a
week with the vector luna i'll say that
it hits a lot of high notes the
always-on display is familiar the build
is better than any pebble since the
steal and the battery life is indeed
outrageous vector promises 30 days and
my colleagues at windows central
actually got more than that now it is on
the pricey side and its capabilities
basically boil down to notifications and
minor health tracking but it executes on
those fundamentals pretty well sound
familiar
the only things giving me pause are the
fact that one of the band loops broke on
my retail device after the first day and
the price is a little high for what it
is but the former I'm willing to write
off as a one-time flaw and the letter
well the price always comes down
eventually it's not at all a 100 percent
pebble replacement the ecosystem in
particular is pretty lacking but until
we get whatever we're going to get from
the new and improved Fitbit it's the
best I've found thus far but who knows
maybe this saga between pebble and
fitbit's fit bull peb fit will still
keep in mind the loyal fans of pebble
even though pebble no longer exists we
are of course sad about the end of
pebble but we do have some fond memories
that we're going to take with us and one
in particular is actually kind of funny
and involves both Michael and myself
being in the same place at a conference
having to take notes and listen to the
people who are speaking to us and then
we got an email that said that the
pebble time was on Kickstarter we clamor
to get to that pledge button and no
notes were going to be taken until we
were able to put in our pledges for that
SmartWatch at the time some good times
there and we only have pebble to thank
for memories like that and hopefully
we're going to see pebble users still be
able to proudly wear and still remember
one of the first SmartWatch creators
that really did it right as always thank
you guys very much for watching I hope
you enjoyed this collaboration between
myself and Michael Fisher there's a
version over on his channel the mr.
mobile that has me in it as well so this
collaboration is kind of twofold you can
find him on YouTube if you're searching
for him look for the mister mobile but
there's also a card up on the corner
that you can click on if you didn't
notice already that will link you to his
channel he's got his take on mobile tech
robotics cars and also Star Trek related
gadgets of that floats your boat and
once again a good shout-out to you man
it's always great to have a good friend
to collaborate with and you definitely
fit that bill so thank you again to
Michael Fisher the mister mobile CES is
right around the corner and the both of
us are actually going to be at the show
we might collaborate again there so you
can stay tuned to both our channels for
all the best coverage in mobile tech and
beyond because of course we are your
source for all things
