ordem his embassy 2017 checking out the
Kodak extra now this phone was announced
back in the fall my croissant checking
it out and this one I believe currently
available it sells for $550 and being
kodak of course you know the folks here
is the camera so real quick the thing
that stands out most is on the back you
have a 21 megapixel camera you have an F
2.0 after once in there that's 4k
built-in sixaxis optical image
stabilization so it's really meant for
those who want to take a lot of photos
and you can tell definitely tell that
with the interface interface for the
most part is similar to any any digital
camera you have all sorts of modes HDR
you had spoken mode and a top that to
have a full manual full male control but
with older photos so you can adjust
things like the focus the ISO the
shutter speed all access to those
parameters which is nice unfortunately
you can't adjust the aperture scene
socket at 2.0 now when you go to video
however it would have been really nice
it does all for a 4k all all different
types of resolutions to shoot at but no
control for the shutter speed the after
or even the focus if these like
everything is on automatic which is a
shame because you want her phone like
this with camera sensors features one
axis controls at any given time as far
as design it's very typical of a camera
they try to put in some elements you're
familiar with you have a grip here on
the side you have this extra
leather-like material you do have a Hopf
with the camera but that is expected
from the other specs with the phone
include a 5-inch display full 1080p
resolution decent gorilla glass on top
on both the display stuff and even on
the lens in the back 3000 milliamp hour
battery is powered by and Helio X 20
Decker core processor driven by Saran 3
gigabytes of internal storage we have a
micro SD card slot Android 6.0
marshmallow onboard 554 this device
which for the specs kind of tough but if
you're really into photography you want
that those manual controls you might
like it not sure what the quality is
like but that's going to come down to
your ultimate time with the phone so if
you guys want more about the codec
actually check it out website and resort
calm John be signing off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
