Samsung flagships a charge of a guard
from Android thority what's going on
everybody and this is the Samsung Galaxy
Note 3 versus the galaxy s4 the galaxy
s4 was able to update the look of the
Galaxy S line even if only slightly but
these design cues were taken in the note
3 while making some very new and very
welcome changes perhaps the best part of
the galaxy s4 was its ability to bump up
to a 5-inch screen without making its
footprint at all bigger than the galaxy
s3 the rounded look was somewhat done
away with for flatter sides and overall
more decisive profile the button layout
is still very much classic Samsung with
no real changes here glossy plastic was
still a thing during the S Force time
however but that did mean the back cover
was removable giving access to the
removable battery and the microSD card
slots overall this is one of the best
handling 5 inch screens available today
so anyone looking for an accessible feel
can look to the galaxy s4 for just that
the note 3 on the other hand took a few
of the design philosophies a flatter
overall profile mostly while marking a
new start for Samsung that we were all
frankly waiting for if you were unhappy
with the glossy plastic of recent
Samsung offerings this is definitely a
phone you want to look out for with its
textured plastic bag that mimics leather
pretty much everything else is the same
especially the button layout though the
s-pen is definitely waiting in its a
little slot in the lower corner the
larger 5.7 inch screen does make for a
much larger device all around making
this a phone that you shouldn't expect
to use one hand all that often with that
doesn't mean Samsung didn't try to make
life easier on 4 Note 3 users however
ultimately it comes down to what you
want in size or let's say material there
aren't too many fans of glossy plastic
on Samsung phones anymore and if that is
a strong point for you then perhaps the
Note 3 is already worth it in terms of
size you have to know whether or not
using two hands is that much of a
problem for you the galaxy s4 definitely
is easier to manipulate with its smaller
form factor after using the note 3 for a
while however it's a pretty jarring
change to come back to the nimble s4
again I'll tell you that much of course
it is because of the sizes of those
screens that we questioned the handling
despite one being over half an inch
bigger than the other the quality you
can expect from either of these displays
is what is without question the galaxy
s4 being
foray into the 5-inch screen game had to
come with a good screen and this 1080p
screen capable of 441 PPI does not
disappoint
yes Super AMOLED displays tend to mean
quite a lot of saturation in the colors
but in this new version of TouchWiz all
of this is actually customisable
nonetheless the high pixel density makes
for great reading experiences and
definitely enjoyable media viewing blow
up that nice display and you get what
the note 3 is packing though at 5.7
inches this is still a 1080p resolution
display and the quality very much
translates over the pixel density here
does come down to 386 PPI but that is
still okay considering this larger
screen will typically end up farther
away from your face anyway pentile has
returned with the note 3 but that
doesn't mean too much to anyone but
maybe the super sticklers because
everything is still rendered beautifully
it's hard not to enjoy the larger
version of basically anything that you
do on this phone obviously it comes down
to what size you want just like it did
in the design section you'll get a great
experience either way and it only
matters how large of a screen you need
to enjoy whatever it is that you do in
performance the later released phone
obviously gets a little bit of an
advantage but that isn't buy too much in
this comparison as the Snapdragon
processors started gaining steam earlier
this year the Galaxy s4 was sure to come
with the then cutting-edge Snapdragon
600 clocked in at 1.9 gigahertz this
meant smooth and snap your performance
backed by the tried and true graphics
processor in the audrina 322 gigabytes
of ram helped to make multitasking a
breeze even months and months after it's
released the galaxy s4 is still just
about as reliable as when I first got it
I'm able to get everything I need done
on it without really any slowdown so
it's no surprise that the new Galaxy
Note 3 continues that tradition but this
time around gets the Snapdragon 800 that
gets a speed boost up to 2.3 gigahertz
that's a mammoth amount of power backed
by the updated adrenal 330 and perhaps
the most drawing change is the three
gigabytes of RAM this is a phone made
for multitasking and with the new
enhancements made to the s-pen of course
there had to be some breathing room all
this power is put to good use and as I
keep saying the only times I see
slowdown are one initiated apps try to
process everything before they're loaded
up multitasking is definitely a defining
feature of the note 3 and without all of
this power it wouldn't really go
anywhere thankfully it does
and this is as true for the spen list s4
as well I won't go into too much detail
with the hardware here as much of the
core experience as the same between the
two the base 16 gigabytes of storage in
the galaxy s4 and 32 gigabytes for the
Noor 3 is expandable the removable
batteries allow for spares which is
always nice though the larger 3200
milliamp hour unit in the note 3 makes
for very impressive longevity getting
over a day's worth on the note 3 is very
much possible even with pretty much
everything about it being bigger the
galaxy s4 is capable of long battery
life too but in my experience it didn't
get over a day as reliably everything
that set the galaxy s4 apart with its
sensors and different new tools for
navigation made it onto the note 3
further evening the playing field air
gestures air views and controlling your
TV and more are possible with either
device so what differentiates the note 3
then is its s-pen obviously it's the
more symmetrical version and nimbler
version of the s-pen and all of its
capabilities have been enhanced it made
easier for the general user but we'll
get to all of that in the software bit
again the two flagship phones tend to
have very similar capabilities and that
trend continues into the cameras
essentially the same 13 megapixel
shooter of the s4 has been brought over
to the note 3 and brings basically the
same gray quality as far as the app goes
all of the new enhancements originally
introduced in the s4 also come over like
the drama in eraser modes though the
note 3 does add in a golf mode maybe
Samsung knows its demographic a little
better than we thought
the main addition in the note 3 camera
is the inclusion of a smart
stabilization mode this is supposed to
make low-light pictures better it's
essentially a beefed up night mode but
it doesn't show up in the mode selection
and is instead in the settings full-day
LED shots look great without much doubt
in either of these cameras so here is a
look at its main differentiator
stabilization is shown in comparison to
the night mode found on the galaxy s4
and you can see that it gets the job
done quite well ultimately you'll get
the same great camera experience either
way so pictures should still turn out
pretty well no matter which device you
pick TouchWiz TouchWiz TouchWiz the
operating system we either love or hate
does get a few new enhancements but
ultimately it has retained its look
throughout either of these newer
releases and the s4 we got a lot of new
navigation features and they all made it
to the note 3
so obviously its biggest differentiator
is everything the s-pen is capable of
multi-window however did get a bit of an
update as it is able to run two of the
same app at once now and it is able to
easily transfer data between the two
that are running as for the s-pen it got
a new Air Command pop up that gives you
access to five of it's easy to access
and most use features
action memo is especially good
considering you can contextually plug
anything that you write in it into one
of the many different applications
scrapbooking and general clipping helps
you capture whatever you need for
safekeeping and later viewing for a much
better look at everything that the s-pen
can do check out my future focus video
on it now I know that plenty of people
out there don't even touch the s-pen if
you do get a note three and you don't do
that which is perfectly fine at the end
result is you get a smartphone
experience that is much like the galaxy
s4 only it's much bigger the galaxy s4
comes in at six hundred dollars unlocked
currently which is a little lower than
it was when it was first released in the
u.s. two-year contracts will make you
pay 199 upfront the much bigger and more
feature pack 2 Galaxy Note 3 will run
you $800 unlocked and $2.99 on a
contract and so there you have it the
point made in the software section is
probably the best way to put it when you
put away the s-pen you get an experience
that is incredibly similar to the galaxy
s4 but that's a good thing the s4
introduced so much in its inception that
the note line was just dying to get all
of those new enhancements it comes down
to size and feature set for you because
if you don't want the larger screen
experience or you don't need the s-pen
the galaxy s4 won't make you feel like
you're really missing out on too much
that s-pen though is definitely one of
the best defining features of the note 3
and with its different design elements
it might still be worth the admission
price for you as always thank you very
much for watching and I hope you got a
lot out of this edition of vs. like I
said before you can see my future focus
