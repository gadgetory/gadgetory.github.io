Hindy the android 30 appt guy and
welcome back to android apps weekly this
is episode number 134 so let's get right
into it Google is continuing their big
changes with Google Wallet but this one
isn't so great as of jun 30th the Google
Wallet debit cards that were issued to
people will cease to function well it
was a cool idea that some people used it
just never took off really and Google
likely wants more people to focus on
Android pay hence the card will go the
way of google helpouts one of the
funnier april fools jokes was Gmail's
mic drop it added a chip of a minion and
then permanently archived and muted the
email thread ones it was sent never to
be seen again unfortunately some people
weren't paying attention and ended up
sending it to inappropriate people like
their bosses and it ended up getting
them fired that's like forty five
percent funny and like fifty five
percent horrible a new study by
statistics showed us which applications
received the largest amount of growth
between december of 2014 and december of
2015 the list isn't what you'd expect
with applications like lowes shift
keyboard sirius XM and others showing
incredible growth there were some
familiar faces though including air B&amp;amp;B
and microsoft's onedrive it was
announced this week that Cortana will
soon be able to show you notifications
from your android phone on your windows
pc this is an often sought after feature
that would be a welcome addition for
many and we hope that one day we'll even
be able to respond to notifications
using Windows 10 it's no secret that
Riptide gp2 was one of my favorite
racing games ever so it should surprise
you little then I'm wicked stoked about
Riptide GP renegades which is arriving
this spring the trailer was released and
the game looks really good it should
have a decent campaign mode multiplayer
and plenty of stuff to do for even more
Android apps and games news don't forget
to check out the latest Android apps
weekly newsletter which is in the video
description below we have a particularly
big week in news and there's a ton of
stuff there that we didn't have space
for here if you'd like you can subscribe
using the form which is in the written
companion which is also linked in the
video description below and we'll send
the newsletter directly to your email
every Sunday okay folks let's take a
look at the apps and games that made a
big splash this week as usual if you
want to check any of these apps
or games out you can find those links in
the video description below and code
learn to code is a free application that
gets you started with the basics of
computer programming it does this by
giving you bite-sized lessons that
quickly teach you the very basic
concepts of computer programming
including how to use numbers strings
variables boolean and a whole lot more
it leads toward JavaScript although most
of the information is fairly Universal
it's entirely free to download and use
with no in-app purchases the official
google calculator has hit the google
play store and is ready for download
whenever you want it it's a fairly solid
calculator that will do most of the
basic stuff without breaking a sweat but
it's no replacement for something
complex like a graphing calculator it's
entirely free but it's not available for
all or even most devices if it's
available for you it's a flashy and good
looking basic calculator that's entirely
free to use Lego Jurassic world is a new
game out of Warner Bros that lets you
replay the memories of all of the
Jurassic Park movies wonderfully
recreated in Lego formats it features a
ton of scenes and content from the
movies including all of the various
chases dinosaurs and intense moments
that we all remember the game mechanics
are interesting although the controls
could use a little bit of optimization
it's four dollars and ninety-nine cents
with no in-app purchases and it looks
really good mailtime is a new email
application that organizes your emails
into conversations like you would see in
a text messaging app it allows you to
view the email thread as a conversation
and respond in kind which is way faster
than the way it usually is this is a
unique premise since everyone uses email
but the mechanics of email have remained
largely untouched in its entire history
it supports group emails voice email and
a whole lot more it's a bit buggy since
it's new but the idea is definitely
solid me tomo has finally received
something akin to a worldwide launch
it's available in more than just Japan
although there are still a ton of
countries that can't get it just yet for
those who have been living under a rock
me tomo lets you create a me character
and then customize it with clothing
items and interesting tidbits about
yourself you can make friends answer
questions and get points you can even
use the platinum points for 3ds content
if you link your Nintendo accounts it's
kind of fun it's kind of creepy and it's
definitely Nintendo
