authorities so I'm checking out do my
first hands almost at the Verizon where
24 this is the Android wear 2.0 watch
announced by the carrier it's available
today
it's LTE connected and you can pick it
up forward to your contract of $300 or
if you want to go full price and not
worry about a contract it's 350 now
check it out for the first time it
really reminds me of the original Huawei
watch but slightly chunkier it's very
similar in terms of design because it
has that neutral premium look it has an
all metal chassis of round-faced style
and like I said it has a lot of
similarities with the design language of
the original water watch however with
the wear 24 it doesn't offer swamp full
band because the LTE layers are actually
incorporated into the band itself so
instead you have three different color
options you have stainless steel
gunmetal and rose gold so for the most
part I kind of like the design its
variable even with its thickness and all
it also has chokes the balance between
casual and formal attire so you could
wear with pretty much anything it also
features an ip67 weighting so in the
event you forget to take it off in the
shower you don't have to worry because
it's going to be protected the one thing
that's missing here is a heart rate
sensor so if you're big into workouts or
exercising that might be a deal-breaker
for you even checking out to the we're
24 outdoors here with a lot of Sun the
display itself is pretty readable the
1.3 9 inch 400 by 400 my display looks
nice and sharp you get good colors and
like I said it's impressive for its
clarity and outdoor visibility now the
only concern I have with the displays
that it's it's almost flushed to the
bezel unlike some other smart watches
that have the display a little bit
recessed just protected from scratching
against surfaces in terms of the
experience it really doesn't differ from
any other Android wear 2.0 watch out
there like the while we watch 2 or the
LG watch board it has a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 2100 processor it seems to do
nice very smooth and responsive it does
offer a GPS
only difference with the software though
is that it comes preloaded with certain
watch bases that are GPS based so for
example you have one watch base you
could set so if you're at home you'll
have some shortcuts on the watch face
for things like social networking and
text messaging and conversely if you're
at work you'll have shortcuts for things
like email ultimately though if the
price is right for you it's going to
mortally hinge on a person's design
preference to be a deciding factor so if
you guys one learn more about the
Verizon wear 24 you could check out our
