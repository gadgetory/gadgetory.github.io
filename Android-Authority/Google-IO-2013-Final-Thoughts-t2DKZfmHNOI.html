glasses I'm indoors why what our glasses
unless it was google glass what's up
everybody this is nate with android
authority here at Google i/o 2013 just
kind of want to give you a quick recap
of the three days we were here saw a lot
of really cool things it's a lot of fun
here but we also have to keep in mind
this is a developer's conference the chi
note was really really cool Larry Page
at the end giving all his Q&amp;amp;A answers
was unprecedented and we were all kind
of sitting there with our mouths open in
complete disbelief of what was going on
you might be able to see behind me the
Google+ blimp that's part of the fun
here well it is joshua regard from
android authority what's going on
everybody and i am just so very
delighted to bring you our final recap
of google i/o 2013 it's the final day
i'm actually going to be leaving in
about half an hour to catch a flight
back to Los Angeles but it's a bit of a
bittersweet exit you know because while
San Francisco was so new to me and I had
a few harrowing experiences while I was
here inside of this Moscone Center with
google i/o going on it was really some
of the best one I've had at a conference
we did say in our sessions recap that
Google i/o is mostly for developers it's
not necessarily for everybody but that's
not a bad thing it's not bad thing at
all people who come here primarily
because they want to see new products
new devices or maybe they want to have
just the fun that's here it will work
for you however to me it just feels like
it may not be completely worth it
because you pay a lot to be here and
obviously the spaces are reserved for
people who are going to learn about
google and their services and learn how
to put them together and to develop for
them so you kind of have to weigh out
the pros and cons there but it should be
fun experience for everybody no matter
who you are
so keep that in mind when you think next
year you might want to buy a ticket this
is really developer centric overall
Google i/o is a lot of fun there's a lot
of really cool stuff to see but let's
get to the fun part so today was the
last day of the conference and obviously
we had to get out and just get a lot of
really fun things done we have a little
short real at the end of this video to
show you all of the fun things that we
did how much how much of a blast we had
there were a lot of really cool chrome
experiments on display racer which you
probably saw in the keynote was on
display we got to play with that a
little bit it was also a skee-ball
function which I absolutely destroyed
josh at that's some bull that's some
bull son that's some bull a few of the
things that we can tell you about yeah
mate kicked my ass and skeeball I will
admit I was kind of trash talking a
little bit too but he kind of he kind of
figured out how to how to work it right
and then he started racking up the
points oh whatever we're will bed
there's lots of junk food for Josh lying
around we had a lot of fun trekking
across the Grand Canyon with the huge
backpack that they use for street view
and man that thing is just is so it's
not it's not necessarily heavy but it's
not balanced and while they did see the
balancing gets better with some extra
parts it was teetering over and over
like this the things I do for google
at the end of the at the end of three
days I think what I take away from this
is this is excellent for what's next and
that's what Google's always focused on
is what's coming up what's next where
are we going from here for arguably the
biggest tech company on earth to
continually say we're working on it
we're doing we're at about 1% of what we
know we can do that's pretty humbling
for them and really cool for us to hear
no you shouldn't really be appreciative
of that and the people who make those
things happen are all behind me right
now all these developers who get
together and create the experiences that
you enjoy on your smartphone on your
tablet on your Chromebooks or your
laptops or desktops and in the future
stuff like Google glass it's it's all
there for you and the fact that we even
have the ability to report on it and to
tell you about the future the fact that
we're not even slowing down that should
be amazing and at least for me that's
absolutely incredibly it's great but
it's also kind of scary what else are we
going to see so from google i/o this is
nate swanner signing off good night
YouTube so coming to you from google i/o
2013 has been more than enough pleasure
from me I hope you enjoyed all of our
coverage and we will see you next time
