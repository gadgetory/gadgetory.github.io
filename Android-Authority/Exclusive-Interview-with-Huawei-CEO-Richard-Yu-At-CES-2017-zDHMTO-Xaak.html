introducing mr. Richard Youth the CEO of
Huawei consumer business group thank you
very much for spending the time with me
today there's a great honor
yeah hey I think I thank you so much sir
every year we conduct a best of Android
work and we've actually decided to award
hallway as the OEM of the air because we
feel it the performance of the company
and the quality of products and the pace
of innovation surpass that of any other
manufacturer in the world so I just want
to say congratulations thank you oh no I
know let you know in the future you all
know for Holly yet thank you I wonder
talked with you today sir 2016 was well
it was an immense fear for voix way can
you talk about some of the growth of
Huawei experienced in 2016 yeah you know
in 2016 we continue to increase our
business and our superman' our
smartphone we increased from 108 meeting
to 139 meaning in quantity deployment
and our revenue increase the war 42% so
you so an hour max here nowadays roughly
two-digit roughly 10% max here in
globally always do top three smartphones
higher in world but we are quickly
shipping gap reason number one and
number two some very impressive numbers
okay I mean 2016 was a very challenging
year yeah look at what happened with
Samsung or Motorola a lot of these
companies really struggled to gain
market share so I applaud you for that
then Huawei a lot of people don't know
this but you're the CEO hallway consumer
business group
well Huawei has a lot of legacy
infrastructure business it is the
largest ICT company in the world
information communication technology now
how much do you think that legacy
engineering expertise how much do you
think it benefits the consumer side of
the business
yeah you know I do video that's a
feeling that's the
the our infrastructure Denise either we
benefits a lot from how you finish
because you know that we happen
worldwide er
we build most of the mobile network
weighs more and you know smartphone
working with mobile network we know the
network and we have more knowledge and
know-how on mobile communication on
telecommunication network so we can help
our smartphone working with the Nano car
with better performance fast speed I
think music appears like that in the
race towards 5g you know fifth
generation networks are gonna be very
very fast
what do you think while we sits on the
competitive landscape relative to ZTE
and Siemens and other other area
industry leaders that are you know you
know around the five t-that's I actually
we are the wow the leader in the world
to on standardization although 5g
technology innovation and we put a much
more resource on the resource the
holoband us so that's why what what on
worldwide the 5g standardizing
technology innovating and we had to
figure the leader leadership role in
worldwide 2016 you talked about some
really big numbers double-digit growth
right number one smart frontier in China
number three globally yeah double-digit
growth right expansion of the honor
brand as well but what do you think is
going to be different about 2017
compared with 2016 and I think that was
on 17 you know you know the host mother
industry is still continually
consolidating hmm so I do video that's
with some flying monomer Wanda really
disappear yeah so the 2017 I think there
will be more consolidation of the
industry yeah yeah so many wonders we

quickly going oh we're consolidating
yeah we got something opposition I can
see all trilogy cost an investment right
and go to market share these are all
very you know we we put a huge in
resource and research and Europe now

are building our brand of our brand
Oliver and and we are investment on
marketing branding retail channel retail

year of partnership in revoir we yeah

talk about some of the partnerships and
who's behind driving those initiatives
to help grow the brand and create better
products you know me and my team kind of
