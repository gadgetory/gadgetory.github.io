authority now every year when Apple
release a new iPhone they generally
release a new process at a new system on
a chip to go with it and this year has
been very much the same we had the
release of the iPhone 8 the iPhone 8
plus and the iPhone 10 and all three
models are using a new processor from
Apple called the Apple a 11 Bionic now
some initial testing on Geekbench and
other benchmarks has shown that this is
a really fast processor and seems to be
remarkably fast compared to the process
as we have in Android and that raises
the question is it really that fast are
the benchmarks a good way to measure it
is it a fair comparison well let me
explain so first of all a bit about the
11 Bionic
it's a hexa-core processor musical 6
cores it's based on the arm 64-bit
architecture it's been designed by Apple
in-house as has the CPU and the GPU that
go inside of the SOC it's got two
high-performance cores and for power
efficiency calls now there are some big
changes compared to the a10 fusion the
chip that came before it from Apple most
significantly the high performance cores
are up to 25% faster which is a
significant increase but more
importantly the low energy cause of
power efficiency calls are 70% faster
than the same calls that you find in the
Apple a10 but most significantly this
particular processor can use all six
cores at the same time there's something
we've been used to on Android for
several years now but apples last post
of the a-10 could was effectively a dual
core processor or either used the two
high-performance cause all the two power
efficiency calls but now all six cores
can run at the same time in the a 11
which is one of the reasons why we're
seeing such a big boost in the
multi-core scores that we'll talk about
in a moment now if we compare the a11
Bionic with the a-10 and with a leading
Android SOC like the Snapdragon 835 this
is what we get the a11 is now built on
the same process technology as the
Snapdragon 83 5 has 10 nanometers the 18
fusion was built on 60 nanometers
we've gone from a quad-core process
which could really only use two cause of
the time to a hexa-core processor of
which you can use all six calls at the
same time compared to the Snapdragon 835
which of course is an octa-core
processor using for high-performance
calls and for power efficiency calls and
we can see the core scheduling there has
changed its now per call which is also
what we get on the Snapdragon 835 we've
got a three chord G PU which Apple
aren't telling us very much at all about
from in the a11 Bionic and of course got
the Adreno 540 in the Snapdragon 835 all
three chips use the LDP less low-power
ddr4 ram but of course when it comes to
the benchmarks this is where we see the
major differences the Snapdragon 835 has
a single core score of just under 2,000
that was already been beaten by the a-10
fusion with its 3339 and now the single
core score of the alien Evonik has
jumped up to over 4,000 but the real
jump we see here is in the multi-core
test because of course the Snapdragon
835 was beating the a10 fusion with its
score of six thousand seven hundred
sixty-five because it had eight cores
which you could form use at the same
time the a-10 fusion was basically a
dual core setup and therefore it was
still performing remarkably well but
5380 but look at this now a doubling
from the a10 fusion to the a11 Bionic
we've gone from 5,000 to 10,000 and
that's absolutely 10,000 compared to the
6,000 of the Snapdragon 835 so an
absolutely massive increase there so the
first question is why is the Apple 1811
by onek and in fact the a10 fusion in
each generation why were they so fast
what is Apple secret well first of all
let's start with a bit of history up
until 2013
everyone was shipping 32-bit ARM based
cores and in fact Qualcomm were the
leader in that area with their crate
calls and they weren't really were fast
for their time but in 2013 Apple
basically took everybody by surprise by
launching a 64-bit processor in the
iPhone 5s now that was even before
really that even arm itself of course
defined the architecture had products
with their 64-bit calls it in fact they
were expected and
2014 so here we are in late 2013 an
apple have already got a 64-bit
processor in their smartphone and this
we needed to take everybody by surprise
and then over the years that come
Qualcomm tried to battle that first of
all they release the the chip with the
Quartus 8:57 it then they had their own
proprietary one which is the cryo
and then the Snapdragon 835 we've got
this kind of built on cortex technology
which is basically it's understood it's
a cortex a7 t3 but Qualcomm have been
allowed to tweak certain things about it
to make it a semi custom CPU but every
time this has been happening Qualcomm
have been first of all trying to play
catch-up and then they've been going
from the arm 1 to their own worm to the
semi-custom one apple of year-in
year-out been releasing a
next-generation 64-bit CPU next
generation 64-bit CPU and now the a11
Bionic is the fifth generation CPU that
Apple have made so basically
historically Apple are two generations
ahead of everybody else and that's a
significant lead when it comes to
process of manufacturing so they really
have got a head start and they are ahead
of the field because of that early head
start they had and everybody else has
been trying to play catch-up and they
haven't yet caught up with what Apple
have been doing now that's one part of
the story that have this leave but
there's also other parts of the story
for example Apple their entire process
is integrated what I mean by that is the
people that are working for Apple
designed the processors the people that
are building the iPhones work with the
people that build the processors it's a
tightly coupled scenario and everything
from the next specifications for the
next iPhone and its next poses that are
discussed all in-house and they're all
done together now it's slightly
different to weight the way the rest of
the world works because you've got core
designs that are coming from arm they're
maybe being implemented by Qualcomm or
by Huawei or by mediatek and then those
themselves have to come out and then I
are shipped in phones so although these
are good cause and they're
high-performance that there is that lack
of tight coupled integration that means
that most Apple can shave some weeks off
the development cycle but also it means
maybe they can
their CPUs to be specifically for what
they need in those phones and that gives
them an edge which we'll talk about more
in a second because it doesn't it means
they're not trying to sell to a general
population and so this is a problem that
people like arm and Qualcomm have they
tried to sell their chips to a general
audience and that general audience might
be a router or a switch maker and in
networking sonar it might be some
rebuilding something for a television
set or it might be someone's building
something for a a smartphone now arm
therefore and chip makers like Qualcomm
media to produce many variations of
their chips with more cores and less
cores and more cash and less cash and
higher clock frequencies and better GPUs
and worse GPUs leave you just look at
the Snapdragon range itself there are a
whole range of processes that call core
mate you know the 800 series in the 600
series in the 407 even the 200 series
they've even got chips that they put
inside of wearables now Apple will
basically make one chip for one product
so that's a very different focus when it
comes to what they're doing but it also
allows them to do something that other
people like call comment and meet it
can't do Apple's chips are basically I
mean this is rough talk about twice the
size in terms of silicon then everybody
else's chips now why is that important
well silicon is expensive so some
low-end chip manufacturers would argue
that their profit or loss is can be
found in one millimeter squared of
silicon the actual process that's where
their margin is that's the profit
they're going to make on that chip is
whether they can shave off one square
millimeter from that design apples chips
are just double the size of everybody
else's and that means that clearly Apple
are putting in a lot of investment into
the chip and they're cutting their cut
making cut back to a design decisions
elsewhere in the phone to compensate for
that expensive CPU now they cause price
it as a single unit they have the design
and they have the CPU and that's the
screens and the memories and everything
else they going to do and at the end of
it they come up with a price for that
screen now maybe they are they can take
away bits of profit and loss from other
parts of the phone too
compensate for such a big CPU now arm
and call common and and Samsung the meet
it can't do that because arm need to
make a profit so they make their phone
they make they designed and they send
them off to be like Qualcomm Qualcomm
need to make a profit because they sell
those chips to people like Sony and LG
and Samsung and of course in the
smartphone maker needs to make a profit
so they have to make money what they're
doing so every stage here you've got
people making money on what they're
doing and they've got employees and
their pension schemes and they've got
you know shareholder and they've got all
these things that need to do and each
one of those is adding on there little
bit on top and so that's a different
business model a different motor
networks because obviously Android is
the most popular operating mobile
operating system in the world there are
some fantastic handsets out there but
it's a different model to what Apple are
using there's one more thing worth
mentioning all that extra silicon space
is actually in Apple's chips is being
given over a lot of it to cash size so
for example up until the a10 fusion
Apple were using level 3 cache and if
you don't know what cache memory is I've
got a whole video on about it that I
will link here in the description below
but basically s main memory on the board
lpddr4 is slow compared to the speed of
the chip is running at so it has this
cache miss intermediate memory where it
can stick values so you can get them
quickly without having to go back to
main memory and that speed up
performance and the more cache memory
you've got that's high speed memory the
faster your processor can go there are
some rules of thumb about you know
returning diminishing returns but
basically if you can invest memory there
you're gonna get the returns in the on
the performance now applet chips have
been using up until now even level 3
caches of up to 4 megabytes now armed
and even support level 3 caches on the
cortex a57 the cord is a t-72 in the
call it 873 is only now being supported
on the cortex a 75 which we haven't yet
seen any chips for and not only were
they using big level 3 cache those are
using big level 2 caches so you find
maybe 2 or 3 megabytes of level 2
caching whereas on some Android chips
you might find
down to maybe one megabyte or something
like that and then no level three of
course each silicon maker Qualcomm or
meets it can decide what they want to do
but the maximums of level two cache was
only four megabytes and you couldn't get
level three now
funnily enough on the a11 Bionic Apple
of shift to shifted away from a level
three cache and they've only got a level
two cache of cores and a small level one
cache and the level two cache is eight
megabytes so that's a huge amount of
level two cache that's built in there on
the chip and I'm sure that gives them a
bunch but that's expensive it's really
expensive to make a chip that big and
maybe these chip makers don't have a
business model where they can try to
sell an OEM like Sony or LG such an
expensive processor
whereas Apple can incorporate that in
their overall pricing so if we look at
that there's there's a history Apple
have got a head start they they really
are two generations ahead of everybody
because they went to 64 bit earlier than
anybody else
there's also because the chips are big
okay and they've got big amounts of
silicon on them which also includes big
amounts of cash and also because they
are the designer and the designer of the
chip and the design of the phone there
is a kind of tight coupling in their
process which may be able to help them
shave off time of a development cycle
which of course in the end means that
they're a heavy of the game again now
does this mean that Android chip makers
you know Qualcomm and media taken and
others are never gonna catch up well I
don't know I think there is a
possibility of course that one year
maybe Apple will release a bad chip it
didn't go according to plan the
performance increases aren't as good and
that lead that they've got could be
reduced that could happen it doesn't
look like it's going to happen but that
could happen second of course a chip
manufacturer like Qualcomm or or
mediatek or Samsung can actually produce
a chip that is way advanced compared to
what they've had a generational leak
that would also reduce the catch-up that
they've got and also probably this is
where I'm think is really going to
happen we are moving into a kind of a
new era of where CPU performance isn't
going to be as
as it was before we've already caught
seen that with GPUs you'll have a fast
GPU doesn't matter how fast your CPU a
GPU you're not going to be getting the
graphics performance but now we're
talking into the area of digital
assistance of voice recognition face
recognition and even Apple have got a
neural engine the ki-rin 970 has got
this new processing unit and maybe in
the future we're going to see different
parts of the the SOC function to be
taken up by different parts of neural
network simulations are going to happen
inside the SOC and if Qualcomm and our
almond and mediatek and Samsung and
while we can produce processes that lead
in that area that will maybe reduce the
lead that Apple have but kudos to Apple
it is a fast processor and that's just a
fact so no point crying about it there's
no point getting upset about it we
should congratulate them for making such
a good processor and then it should be a
wake-up call to the people in the
Android side to step up their game
because competition is always good
competition pushes people on to innovate
more and to produce better but having
said that don't think that the
Snapdragon 835 will be equivalents from
X and also the ki-rin 970 are somehow
sluggers they're higher performance
processors and they do an excellent job
and when you use your smartphone the
user experience will not be diminished
by that but when it comes to raw numbers
on paper the 11 Bionic is faster just a
fact
well my name's Gary central authority I
hope you enjoyed this video let's have a
good discussion in the comments below we
don't want any Wars we don't want any
nasty neurs let's just talk about the
technology and let's talk about how
things are progressing and let's talk
about the benefits to the consumer let's
talk about why we should applaud any
innovation if you do like this video
