android authority podcast discussing
topics in android every single week I'm
in-house Joshua Vergara and you have
been hopefully enjoying the CES episodes
that we've been doing of the podcast
here two of them of which have already
been released but this third one is
actually really special in your dear to
my heart I get to interview in this
podcast Patrick Norton one of the
original more OG pioneers of the tech
world being on a network called tech TV
on the show called the screen savers is
probably where you remember him from
back in the day and nowadays he's on
tech thing calm with Shannon Morse so it
was really an honor for me to be able to
interview him for this podcast but
unfortunately the camera cut out in just
a few minutes after we started the
podcast so you're going to see the
android authority podcast logo when that
happens and then you can just listen to
the rest of our wonderful conversation
that centers around audio for a good
portion of it and also dives into
android for a little bit as he had quite
a few questions attack to ask me so keep
it tuned to the android 30 podcast for
you more and we have one or two more
podcasts here at CES that we're going to
bring you before it's all over here at
the Consumer Electronics Show of 27
this is just about the coolest thing
that I think I've ever done at CES cuz
you and I met like two years ago no no
you we met my foot oh that's the story I
gave you last night we were eating tacos
where I came up to you and Veronica
Belmont and I'm so close to my god
forgot veronica belmont that's awesome
and I said hi to her and then she was
like have you seen Patrick and now and
then for some reason it didn't register
my head that she said Patrick because I
still came up to and said oh my god
Edward Norton oh it's so great to meet
you I've been called much worse and in
traffic I've been called things that
would make you know most people either
blush or pass out unconscious with fears
so Edward Norton's kind of a compliment
man can act well a 25th hour great film
sorry well you know what Edward doesn't
have the like you almost like a legend
to me is the thing because like the tech
did not become a thing in my life until
we finally got what was it at the time
directv and we found this cute channel
called tech TV and it was just about the
coolest thing that I had ever watched
because I was slowly getting into tech
at the time and you were like a pioneer
I always I feel like one of those punk
rock bands at to word for years and
years like they used to say about the
velvet underground like velvet
underground sold a thousand albums but
those thousand albums like the thousand
people that bought them each started a
band and they were all amazing and it
was like I'm always I'm actually I mean
I'm blown away because I run into people
all the time and I mean one of those
powerful things that leave and I ever
ran into is somebody came up to his like
you know I was a I was a conductor you
know on Jersey Transit I hated my job
you know I would come home your show is
on nothing else is on at that time of
day and I started really like getting
into the idea and you guys weren't
talking down to me and yeah and the dude
you know God certifications got a job
moved in the IT and was incredibly happy
and party I was like oh man I hope he
wasn't you know replaced by a you know
Indian import you know hp1 vit worker
because that's really popular these days
but it was also it was kind of like oh
my god there really is somebody at the
other the camera and I actually care
yeah it was mind-blowing is there wasn't
you know the the the web was still
relatively new nobody was doing video on
the web there was no YouTube people were
barely offering you know like 'ok yusuf
stream of somebody like jumping a rock
was like really amazing video back then
yeah definitely it was it was you know
it was this center for enthusiasm and we
also we weren't talking we know we
didn't talk crap about geeks we were
celebrating the culturally that was part
about it it was mind-blowing you realize
how much impact that had for a lot of
people well you know it's uh and you
know maybe we can start off our
discussion here with this this notion
that I kind of came up with the day or
two ago that one of the biggest problems
with the tech world right now is that we
only use the mediums that we use right
to educate the masses that's the reason
why something like tech TV or afterwards
became g4 or anything like that was so
important because it actually reached
people who wouldn't normally be on an
iPad or on a phone you know because
television as we learned we're not
getting political I'm just using this
I'm just using this detail one thing we
learned in this last election is that
the majority of people in America still
get their news literally from television
but a lot of people in America are
profoundly influenced by Facebook back
to ya I got a buddy who who runs a very
very very very very very very very large
tech website and ed you know they make
money death they make bank and you know
talking to him he was basically like
yeah websites are dead it's Facebook
because Facebook is 1.8 billion people
it's this huge attractor they're kind of
taking it's kind of amazing these
watches media vols right because you've
got YouTube you got facebook you know I
love Twitter but Twitter's not you know
really good way to communicate you can
kind of you know is very limited yeah i
mean is 140 characters is very
intentionally limited and and that's a
you know when you're getting your little
haiku on they can be you know they're
obviously you know again referring the
election like tweets apparently are much
more powerful than we thought
yeah from you know in the hole I did how
people communicate where the information
and what information they trust I mean
part of its like okay I'm 3,000 years
old I started working in magazines right
i did my you know i was sitting with you
know briefing with AMD this morning i'm
really excited about rising because
competition for intel and they're really
about desktop enthusiasts and serious
gaming performance for sure they've made
a bunch of decisions that are around
that in a way that that Intel just isn't
doing any more or at least not this year
and I was sitting there as like oh man
or delete exploit I don't know if you
curse on this podcast so I'll stay clean
we do just not too much to access
exactly the the you know but like I
reviewed my first desktop processor in
nineteen like my first amv desktop
processor in like nineteen ninety-five
you know so I've been watching this for
so long and it's always been there's
always been so many things like oh it's
going to replace it's going to replace
brick and mortar is dead well obviously
brick and mortar isn't dead right
everybody's still shopping okay amazon
may have finally killed brick and mortar
but they did it by delivering a better
product I I guess I'm taking a thousand
words too many to say it's always
evolving there's always people to hold
on to the old ways and it always gets
really really confusing until everybody
just kind of settles around it which is
true but I feel like we've lost that in
a way especially in terms of the colon
call older media obviously newspapers
and magazines are kind of their their
waning for sure absolutely television is
still so powerful and I think I think
that we we don't have any tech on
television broadcast or cable well they
don't want a cable you know cable
especially to a lesser degree broadcast
like the reason so much reality TV
became such a huge part of cable
television is because it's cheap true it
is you know unbelievably cheap you know
if you know the the reason like so many
great things come up like you know
Brody's really like that show on
Showtime that the television series on
showtime yeah you know that cost a lot
of money to make and so they have to
have they have to make a lot of eyeballs
off of that for them to justify that
expenditure and it's even worse in like
you know if you're you know ABC CBS NBC
still have a huge amount of revenue and
a huge audience but if you're like in
the if you're a cable channel in the
digital tears man
you're running infomercials at 1am
registry with advertising you're
figuring out what the cheapest content
you can put up there and that was
already starting when we were at at tech
TV and this is like you know 16 17 years
ago we're looking around it's like okay
the arts and entertainment channel a
sophisticated venue for advancing the
culture of whatever you know even nose
in the air kind of you know thing they
were trying to at you it was like them
or one of the other like you know we're
a cultural channel for sophisticated
people and like I looked around one day
and I'm like wait a minute you got a
show about I do twenty somethings that
are running tuners on import cars and
it's like their lifestyle and great
entertainment but I didn't really
understand how it fit into the brand's
yeah exactly channel and the this is you
know that's been going on it's like at
one point it went from like you know
we're a cable channel that does this to
we're a cable channel that does whatever
the delete expletive makes money and
we're cable channel it's going to do the
cheapest way to make money you know
there's still a tremendous amount of
advertising revenue in cable and
broadcast television card to online and
it's also in some way still easier to
find but like even to you know be most
people like they may skim 20 channels
but almost the vast majority of cable
users they have like five channels yeah
yeah they go to those four or five
channels maybe they skim 20 on an
irregular basis but like if you have 470
channels man you spend effectively no
time on 460 of them that's one of the
problems is we get more options right
because cable is now competing not only
with you know consoles and the internet
and video games and oh yeah going out
getting drunk and dancing and chasing
bands or whatever else out there right
but it's also got a deal with the
internet and the Internet has such a low
barrier for entry for people to create
websites or video exactly how you have
you know i mean there's a giant audience
on YouTube there's a you know third of
the closing it on a quarter or a third
of the planet has access to facebook i
mean now definitely mind-boggling yeah
so of course we have to go where we have
to go where the is and what the eyeballs
are basically yeah but do you think that
your coverage and we'll get to our
coverage of CES in a second but do you
think that your coverage will be vastly
different if you're
medium was still what you had before um
if we were like you know if we're going
back to like doing cable television yeah
like it would have to be vastly
different because there's not enough
there wasn't enough money in the
advertising like there isn't enough
money in the advertising today like you
know it's a real what if game okay
because you know that that show started
in 98 so it would be like 19 years old
that guy right so that would be a pretty
mature show probably the pretty big
audience um you know the when you look
around what's going on like youtubers
don't make any money for the most part
you know websites with banner ads are
struggling to find revenue and so much
about CES is covered is completely
defined by what the you know what the
you know the website or the video show
or the television program enemy like you
know WXYZ from Paducah Wyoming bombs in
here and you know the tech reporter for
you know he goes and he gets the b-roll
the shiny television the b-roll of the
cars and he does like a 90 second
package and maybe he meets a couple
things and get some headphones from
somebody any ties back you know somebody
who's you know i'm from android
authority i cover this beat i'm looking
for these things exactly uh you know my
buddy robert comes in here he avoids the
press days and then he he comes in here
for uh you know some meetings with
samsung and LG get photos of the
television to write up for his website
and you know he may or may not be
getting some backroom briefings on
what's going on or more information on
release dates and stuff right but that's
all he does is like home theater and he
is one of the best they always have a
focus on the new media because yeah you
can just be a jack of all trades yeah
well I'm a jack of all trades but I'm
stupid that way we have so much do you
have decades of experience basically and
also for us I mean for our audience like
look I'm never going to be better
android than you are I'm they were going
to be better at processors than Ryan
shroud is I'm never going to be better
at HD TVs then the
you know Robert Herron is by the way a V
Excel awesome podcast you know I mean
I'm never going to be better at me like
I know that but I can also come in here
and think like okay my audience they
give me 30-40 minutes a week to show
them a whole bunch of useful stuff yeah
and what do they care about it CES you
know okay cars are going to be unhinged
in two to five years you know if you're
a millennial you're being targeted by
everything yeah 4k monitors are doing us
with phones did which is getting too
thin which is you know a weird mixture
of like that looks amazing and holy crap
it falls apart or oh wait let's look at
the LG wallpaper TV which looks
magnificent at 2.3 millimeters thin yeah
they're talking about how like you know
for Total Immersion that it had to be
less than four millimeters to make it a
window like experience into the soul
it's amazing it's awesome and look at
how incredible this is and you know it
so LED and and we got the guy that did
kylo Ren's helmet to design the sound
bar which is real big and sticks way out
and there's a ribbon cable and we spent
a whole bunch of money on creating
gradients on every piece of glass I mean
I'm just like really you couldn't just
on a small break out Bob does it does it
require all of that the whole delete
expletive sound bar has there in order
for you to get hdmi and picture to the
hdmi and power to the screen so there's
that big thing pop-ups for the dolby
atmos yeah and then when you look at all
the pictures of right there's this big
huge beautiful flat panel this 2.3
millimeter stayed magnetically mounted
to your wall it's badass and and then
there's just like gradient of like a
stripe and then thinner thinner hitter
stripes behind that is the ribbon cable
that goes from the monitor down to the
bars and the same thing with the Q LEDs
the big beautiful q LEDs from Samsung we
just say that a little fiber optic you
know cable or a little power cable that
runs down to the breakout box for that
Sony would a different path they put all
of it if they basically created a stand
and I find it fascinating because of one
hand like the the i'm not sure i want
you know a you know double digit 0 LED
television that seven th is big on the
floor of my house because you know I
have a small child of a four-year-old
nine-year-old they 10 over just like
that I feel like it's so fragile like it
you almost to put it behind glass yeah I
am and that's why I mean I remember
thinking like man I live in an old house
and the walls are kind of wavy what's
going to happen when that LG tries to
clamp itself down to the plaster and
lath crack who turns out there's some
flexibility in it but when we're in
California so even a small earthquake
could probably do something terrible to
those super thin TVs yeah I mean you
know but it's so odd to watch some of
this right cuz you know they they're
like you know they were spending all
this money all this engineering effort
to make these incredibly thin flat
panels and then they do really stupid
stuff like make you put a giant ribbon
care ribbon cable like oh I feel like a
cable really I really do feel like we we
try to move way too fast sometimes when
it comes to tech that the actual
physical tech that we have I mean just
think about I mean I have to mention it
but just think about everything that
they were trying to do in the galaxy
note 7 right that was such a thin
beautifully designed phone but we
realized that the problem in that phone
was out there was no room for the
battery to actually do what it had to do
which was expanding the track and not
even me I should be a smart ass white
but you know the irony of Samsung's had
one of its best financial years ever
because memory sales are off hook
exactly what I mean what they take a
four billion dollar hit on that they
didn't know you know I mean it's like
you know that was just projected it
could be way more than that you know I
mean I was talking about the you know
the iphone 6 I bought you know I bent
that I bet the iphone 6 in the first six
days I had it my in my hands or my
pocket in this case and I'm just like I
am I am profoundly over everything being
thinner yeah because you know more often
than not they you know I want things
that aren't gonna fall apart but on the
flip side like I look around at CEA and
I Ciara CES and I see so many products
that are you know they're transitional
they're leading edge the early adopter
there you know future land fill material
in a lot of cases and it gets kind of
depressing when you're like wow I bet
all of that I but none of that still
ain't nobody nobody's using this in like
two years it's a gondola likes X yeah
he's great now there's not even anybody
has gone to light he's doing a great job
he's advertising yeah yeah definitely
he's working the available medium to
maximize revenue and keep himself in a
job is just like he's on the web except
he's on a water a water web yes liquid
network as it were a liquid network i
love that this is just like the coolest
thing ever but the okay so so you
obviously deal with a lot of different
I've detecting and all that you deal
with a lot of forms of tech so how much
of Android like to kind of bring it back
to our podcast like how much of Android
are you really familiar with I mean
being an iphone user and you know oh by
the way we don't pariah iphone users I
30 minutes and I know really well people
think that just because I'm the head of
production at android authority that I
ate iphones no that's so not the case
like I love all tech all the phones yeah
I'm equal opportunity tech know I know
that feeling the I mean we're talked
about the other day you know if the
camera was better on the the moto g 4g
yeah I'd still be running it ok but the
camera on that was atrocious and I'm you
know and I decided that so really what
we would call the mid-tier like yes
really what it is because an iphone land
it's all the same thing yeah pretty much
and it's it's you know I've this this
one wasn't exactly a treat but I was in
the situation where i was using it
constantly so i got 128 gigabyte phone
hmm and because i've been used in iOS
since version 1 and i bought some really
weird mapping apps and stuff I got a few
hundred dollars in software tied up in
the phone um you know but there was i
three issues with Android one is is is
you know feel free to be irritated with
me at patrick norton calm you know at
patrick norton the calm doesn't belong
there be yeah you know the update
situation especially because i work
really closely with the crew from hak5
and a lot of people who do security the
update situation in android really
freaks me out yeah and also you know I
remember like I had the the one thing
that drove me nuts about the moto g 4g
is like yeah you can use you know class
1030 do gigabyte SD cards with our micro
SD cards with it but there's a glitch so
it's gonna you know me and and the
software had been repaired but i
couldn't download it hideaway for
eighteen t to download it exactly i was
about it the next week i figured out it
couldn't run microsd cards on it at
least under the micro SD cards that i
already own and i was going to buy a
slower micro SD card so i could run it
in my
what the hell yeah you know and then it
was like 10 or 15 weeks before the
update was finally available yeah you
know I mean it that's a big big issue
yeah it's a big issue fragmentation is a
big big issue for developers what's
funny we mentioned this on I did a I did
a live Q&amp;amp;A using Instagram live on a
podcast right before the end of the year
right and someone said like how do you
feel about fragmentation and I realized
it's what Google wanted and then realize
they did in because they created an
open-source platform that all these OEMs
were able to sort of take and create and
Google was always going to get a cut of
that but then they realize we can do it
just as well as they can and we want to
write so now they're feeding into the
same system that they kind of wanted in
the first place so I don't know it's a
weird catch-22 when it comes to the way
Google did things I mean it's it's it's
frustrating because there's there's not
and it's the same problem with routers
right you know I sold you a router I get
an update so now it turns on thanks for
the money you should buy oh there's a
security problem with that you should
buy a new router oh there's a video
games are having a bit of the problem
too because you get a day one edition of
the game and then there's already a
bunch of updates they have to wait five
hours for so you when you buy the game
you expect to be able to go with it what
are the funniest series of text messages
have ever gotten my life was a really
close friend of mine he would i cant
rember what game he was waiting for you
know but he was like you know he loaded
up the game he's excited he's guys you
know you got a six-pack of beer and he's
giving head on and he's like and like I
got this series of text messages over
six hours while the game like you know
took these horrible downloads and
restarts and downloads and restarts and
and like I mean that's like the gaming
industry at this point and we'll fix it
after put it in the box will fix it
after a chips bleeding edge is is one
hundred percent the reason why I say
we're moving way too fast in tech yeah
cuz even just today I'm not gonna I'm
not going to talk about the product
because i'm under NDA but i will say
that there are certain things I couldn't
do right in order to capture the device
because the software wasn't ready and
I'm like well how do you expect us to as
reporters right how do you expect us to
properly give a good look at this phone
when you
haven't even finished yet yeah you know
so it's worse when they ship it to you
and they're like oh yeah we know this is
the problem this is a problem this is a
problem but will be fixing that before
it launches exactly it's like but the
India is up tomorrow when we prefer if
you didn't mention that yeah the the
software update is to technology what
the training exercise is to the military
if something bad happens like oh you
have been doing a training exercises I
yeah I mean it's I mean it's interesting
right because there's a you know
long-term supports in endemic issue with
so many products i mean like soon
ologies interesting company they make
nasty ox's they started doing routers
and their routers are typically getting
security updates every six weeks yeah
and there's there's one way like the
Apple version of that is like you don't
need software updates because you're on
OS 10 you're not going to get hacked you
know and the the flip side of that is
like you know I'm not even gonna mention
Adobe but Microsoft you know neither we
closed 18 critical vulnerabilities in
this patch tuesday and you know it's
just did you get caught by that Windows
10 update that like all sony turned it
on it as almost as if you just bought
the ad the laptop though definitely
freaked me the hell out yeah cuz a-you I
blend up my computer and it said hello
and I'm like what happened on my data no
it was just updated thank God one of the
worst windows in updates i had was you
know we're supposed to be in studio and
i had left and come back and it had
restarted and applied the updates and it
was 22 minutes before it finished doing
this crazy series of modifications to
the night no and I'm sitting there and
Shannon's like are you done yet oh are
you kidding me no um you know so maybe I
should turn off the automatic updates
but then i will get the automatic
updates and i got to remember to go on
patch tuesday get all those i don't mean
i don't know i mean is it frustrating i
mean when you look at it it's like how
many phones have nougat how many phones
have marshmallow county phones have
it's frustrating because I want to be
able to get the latest operating system
with the coolest stuff but I also feel
like so many of the Android vendors are
dragging their feet well I don't know
it's hard to tell i mean maybe that's
one of the things it's it maybe i'll ask
you is that a criteria when you're
recommending a phone you know does this
vendor have a track record for
maintaining update one hundred percent
it's not something that i mentioned all
the time because i've been told this
before i'm not them okay i'm gonna i'm
gonna self deprecating reviewer okay my
what i want to do is present a phone the
real user experience of a phone based
upon what is in it and 2 i'm a content
creator like we were just about to get
into this conversation earlier that i'm
less about the products and just the
sheer amount of technology that's out
there i'm more about showing it in a fun
way more about content creating I'm a
youtuber before I'm a journalist that's
why I tell people so my case even though
it is a factor like whether or not if if
something's on Android 5 yes I'm gonna
say this sucks but because we're on
seven now right but at the same time if
it still provides you the experience
that you would need on the daily right
there's no reason to detriment it for
that my boy still routinely use an iPad
1 and eventually Netflix will break
compatibility with the iPad had some of
their favorite games the locomotive
games will start working but until then
damn thing works yeah I will save it to
our tour point earlier Google adding to
the fragmentation that they sort of
wanted in the first place yeah yeah if
you want the best software you would be
going for a Google pixel right cuz it
comes straight from google so i don't
know that could be your way out right
i'll use the work term way out from the
update hell that is out there because
google will send an OTA via the Wi-Fi
one it won't have to go through verizon
unless it's a verizon activated phone
right um but yeah I mean that would be
probably the main way to do it so Oh
David is actually asking if we have a
time in place for the podcast tonight
yes please oh yeah go for it yeah thanks
man David's checking on the podcast for
tonight I'm like I gotta I'm doing it
right now I'll tell him after we're done
um well yeah I think that I don't know
it's a it's a it's a double-edged sword
for me that I love what Samsung does
with Android i love what LG does with
android i love what a lot of chinese
companies do with android but if I
really want to just have a good
experience every day that's reliable I
have to go straight to google and that
destroys what the original purpose of
Android walk right well I mean was it
was that the original purpose or they
trying to be it seems like what really
attractive USP that is yeah I mean they
were there trying to be incredibly
attracted to hardware manufacturers that
we pick it up yeah it's free do whatever
you want to it it's open source yeah you
know and you know they are they needed
to get in on the cash I feel like the
whole update thing through the carriers
with something the carrier's extracted
it's just you know for allowing Android
to work with the carrier's more than
likely for sure which is frustrating
because it just takes so long for the
carrier's to get through what's up I
mean from a you know self-deprecating
content creator / you know technical
resource arree I mean what's the thing
it's got you most excited about android
right now right now Google assistant
yeah one hundred percent everyone's
going AI and I'm not gonna say that I
like AI per se um but I like this idea
doing it Skynet yes kinda basically I do
like this idea though that the way to
get things done on a device it's sort of
shifting so i could say i don't have it
on right now but I could be like ok
Google and something will happen on the
phone and I just ask it something it's
just this voice command type of
navigation and communication with the
device and I i use google assistant way
more than i thought i would really way
more i was making a coconut low carb oh
he's gotta be going I was using I was
trying to make for Christmas right
coconut low-carb eggnog and I didn't
know how to convert tablespoons two
ounces or something like that I know the
feelings I was early layer like mixing
it up in the pot and then I'm like okay
Google how many ounces is in
five tablespoons or something like that
and it just gave it to me right away I
like the assistant part of a guy I don't
really like the intelligent part of a I
because of its learning things about me
that's a little bit scary it's gonna
Wednesday and you're usually near
mcdonalds at this time not a mcdonalds
now have you considered trying a whopper
from Burger King and tasty alternative
it'll look alert my closest friends and
family that I'm somewhere at 2am when
really I'm actually out on a date or
something I don't want anybody to know
that like that's where this the fears
can come in but the assistant part of
Google a sister i think is it's it's
amazing to me it's been fascinating to
watch my my co-host on tech thing
Shannon bought in Amazon Alexa media
leak she wanted to review it and it just
it's become this staple in her house and
it's really funny to me in part because
she comes out of hacker culture first
and she's extremely aware of information
privacy and security and to have her
like this have this always on thing that
records snippets of conversation and
sends them up to amazon's cloud or you
know i mean it's like it's always so
funny to me obliged you got a microphone
in your house that the NSA can decide to
make amazon give them available to the
recordings on and give them a gag order
she's like that's a little tin foil hat
I'm like oh I'm the one with the tin
foil hat today but yeah right it's like
a game we play back and forth because we
know so many people in security and then
you hear something and you're like wow
just when i thought my tin foil hat
wasn't thick enough it turns out there's
even more horrible stuff going on you
know online somewhere in the world but
the it's been amazing to watch how
Amazon thank you you know how Amazon
Aleksei like Amazon Alexa was everywhere
here and one things like oh Amazon's
winning and Google home is lost my
google home started three months ago
twenty bucks says Google homes going to
be here with a vengeance it's es 2018
well they kind of shot themselves in the
foot because to make a amazon app to
make an Amazon Alexa uh that's a
competitor right they didn't make it do
all the same things as Amazon Alexa you
know then what's the running joke we
always have about Google is that all of
its users are beta testers so we were
were the ones that are testing out the
new features as they come
along we never get a fully finished
product when I comes or Microsoft got
that for Windows 10 exactly um well yeah
how do you feel about that God you feel
about this whole AI movement because
you're right Alexa is starting to be put
into things I mean on one hand and
Google system but I was reading entirely
too much science fiction is a very small
child or a young man or still today so
there's some part of me that it it I you
know I think it's going to be a tool for
good or a tool for you know my personal
nightmare is the scene in Minority
Report we're like Tom Cruise is chuck it
down this hallway and all of these you
know advertisements are scanning his
iris all I don't know you know you'd
look great in a pair of jeans the gap is
around the community like he's trying to
like evade a murder charge and even
without black mirrors your biggest fear
is oh yeah pretty much yeah you know
someday I'll finish getting through
episode 1 of that show it's tough it's
tough right but it's like you know you
you look at the you know on one hand I
you know use theirs you know just the
the revelations from the Snowden report
the the giant data warehouses in Utah
and all this crazy stuff you're like wow
man the Soviets would love this back in
the sixties and seventies and eighties
right you know it's funny this is a very
different conversation than when we had
when I first met you because I remember
we went to a we're at a Philip DeFranco
meet up and I was talking to you there
because I didn't owe anybody else right
um and you were telling me about how
there's so much technology out there
that's going to make the lives of like
your kids better all this stuff and
that's what gets you jazz you must not
be one of the hopeful days I mean
exactly it also it swings back and forth
reassure the pendulum for sure I mean it
is like you know this thing that fate
this is mind-blowing I said there's a
few years ago when somebody's you know
to me it's like you know what what are
your predictions one of the future your
years and I'm just like you know is just
like screw jetpacks you know I was I was
dry it you know I was using my you know
eight ounce you know screen with a crumb
it was just like I was I was I was
bombed the Sacramento's I had to pick up
like a truck
part or something and I heard that you
know this this the the singer this punk
rock band had passed you know and like I
hit two buttons i was downloading my
favorite song from the band and I'm
singing it along while I'm being guided
to my destination by a global you know a
global satellite positioning system yeah
you know while receiving you know
messages from my friends and have the
ability to search what basically amounts
to most of the world's total some
knowledge of information and a lot of
really cranky YouTube comments to be
like these things are amazing they are
you know but I also got to teach my kids
that you know you get you actually do
have to learn how to make your bed you
can't just wake up and grab the iPad and
spend three hours watching video you
have to do your homework exactly you
know maybe part of it also is like
watching you know the four-year-old and
the 9 year olds relationship to the to
the two tablets especially is a little
trippy to watch because like you know
they get down there those games and they
want to stay there for six or twelve
hours have to explain to my wife like no
no many of our closest friends of this
family grew up playing video games for
hours and you like them and they're
perfectly well-adjusted adults but she
also came out of a family with no video
games and had like the ex-boyfriend who
you know would it had a tight
relationship to bonds and first-person
shooters and just wasted a lot of time
so yeah I was the final fantasy kid I
just played final fantasy all the time
that took up all my time but you know it
would hope at least that growing up
makes you a more well-rounded person
because you learn more things and one of
the things that helps you experience and
want to try new things is the Internet
yeah you know you're saying like you
know good Google how many ounces are in
a cop yeah like my son's like he wants
to make a bow because he he's been going
to this like camp and one of the things
they do is they do archery and you know
he wanted to make a bow and we got a
boat kid and it's amazing kid but he's
not ready to take like a 72-inch hickory
stave and use a spokeshave to bring it
down to the right size and volume ii
like Willy get to that point absolutely
might you know we can do we get to PVC
from home depot
and paracord or I got some like you know
300-pound string and we can make you a
bow yeah out of stuff we can buy a home
depot in like 25 minutes and they're
actually really effective most of course
was like nine YouTube videos 30 websites
like so I'm I'm blown away like I
learned how to iron a shirt on YouTube
you know are you wondering what
temperature your meat should be at
exactly i mean like all it's it's I mean
I'm still yeah I'm still blow the
Gutenberg Project hot tip Australian
copyright laws like in the United States
basically Disney decided they had to
protect the mouse at all costs so they
basically screwed up public domain for
everybody for approximately forever and
then some anyway you know you could have
just trademarked the mouse and then
nobody could use it you wouldn't have
had to a screw-up copyright they went oh
okay well comrades already screwed up so
we'll take the trademark and but
copyright law is different basically
like no book after eight 1987
fundamentally is going to enter public
domain in any reasonable amount of time
but it turns out project gutenberg which
the online depository of books mm-hmm I
like in Australia if go to like Project
Gutenberg in Australia it has all the
books because they're copyright laws are
completely different Wow and it's you
know not like BitTorrent Cody in that
case so what was the sort of shifting
back to CES I got what was the but what
was what did get you jazz here i'm using
a phrase a lot actually what was your
favorite thing that you saw so far um
we're not even done yet yeah I mean I've
I man um Sony's o le T bravia LED TVs oh
sure all right and and then frustrates
so weird on those well you know it's
always I know if the refresh rate is so
weird or what we do with the extreme HD
are processing but what kind of blew my
mind about that is there they've
engineered the speaker so that the panel
is essentially radiating the sound oh
wow yeah and I mean I still want like
5.1 surround sound cuz of an audio geek
but it was really effective and really
cool you know as dumb as I think the
sound bar is that the the LG the LG
super you HD televisions that
wallpaper TV is kind of trippy to look
at so I mean you know I do a podcast
about home theater with Robert Herron
like maybe excel so obviously I'm come
on look at the shiny screens they're so
pretty you know there's still no
affordable 4k projectors you know the
the the new two terabyte kingston USB
Drive I'm really down I'm sure like i
have two hard drives in my bag so the
idea of having like a two terabyte drive
that's my third of the size of one of
those and it looks like it came out of
hand solos toolbox of the Millennium
Falcon it's not the most elegant design
um you know looking all the Alexa stuff
and being like curry like Shannon was
all over the curry robot which is
essentially Alexa built into a robot
that can run around your house and has a
face to react to what you're saying oh
yeah sorry clip on that yeah you know I
don't get excited about autonomous
lawnmowers you know like you know
there's like six command there's six
Alexa commands you can use with LG's new
refrigerator with a 29 inch tablet in
the front which I'm just like no you
know buy an android tablet glue it to
the front by by a you know buy an ipad
and glue it to you know get a magnetic
mount for the front of your fridge think
of the cameras on the inside that show
you what you have or don't have I know I
keep like I got two kids that are eating
me out of house and home and their
combined weight is still under 150
pounds and I still don't particularly
need the ability to access the interior
contents of my refrigerator at all times
24 hours a day like don't get me wrong
i'm sure it's wonderful to have your
refrigerator take a snapshot of the
interior so you know the contents at all
times or like you know you if you touch
the flat panel on the right way on the
LG it basically goes transparent so you
can see the stuff behind it which is so
you know hiding amplifiers and my
friends BMW in 1989 but i just like some
of this stuff i giggle a lot about I
mean the speakers get me really excited
oh sure there's more amazing headphones
right now you know it's an interesting
that you bring that up I gotta ask this
and this probably be one of the last
things we'll talk about as an audio geek
as you said your words how do you feel
about the trend of losing headphone
jacks on phones
this is this phrase a friend of mine who
grew up in Boston uses that i will not
do because it's profoundly offensive and
he doesn't miss out the accent so it's
particularly amusing about my defensive
i hate it i mean on one hand i'll be
honest with you like Bluetooth Bluetooth
was atrocious Bluetooth is fantastic for
the vast majority of people that are
listening to audio including myself
there's a bunch of stuff I do over
Bluetooth and I don't think I could a be
tell the difference between like the
Bluetooth song or the song hardwired my
issue with bluetooth is is is I get
really frustrated by having to have
batteries or to recharge my headphones
true right I get frustrated by not being
able to plug anything I want to in to
the phone I also own like nine pair of
headphones because I'm a freak so
obviously I'm sort of at the far end of
the spectrum on that what's your top
headphone what's your favorite one I'm
really really in love with audioquest
Nighthawks Wow okay they started the
carbon Nighthawk it's it's not the
tuning on it will not appeal to all
people okay but it is profoundly natural
sounding it is the most comfortable
headphone of war okay the the original
Nighthawks they're closing us out for
350 and they've got a new one that came
out it's like seven hundred dollars
expensive headphone see right now Adam
oh you know who's our sound guy is
person species listen to this as heads
exploding oh my god is the coolest thing
I've ever heard oh man I was like it's
amazing to hear because there's been
this battle between what you call
dynamic headphones like speakers next
year and played our magnetic switch you
take this incredibly thin piece of
plastic you put you know electro like
traces on it you run you put a magnet a
big powerful neodymium magnet on other
side of it you run the audio signal
through the traces on the surface of the
plastic and allow big giant piece of
plastic was a great giant amount of air
you know and I heard I had this this
company called JDS labs I was testing
the element and it's a it's a DAC and a
power amp for headphones and it's
gorgeous it's a big giant knob floats
there above the the base unit and it it
goes like 1 watt of power which is like
eight times more power than you need for
the vast majority of headphones on the
planet so I was like oh wow I want to
really test the seine and drive it and i
picked up a set of planar magnetic
fostex japanese company been around
forever
because people like monoprice is a pair
of you know hundred on you dollar played
our magnetics like go by the Foss texts
like the fostex trt 50 RP mark three
yeah and they're really really in
headphone community like people of the
bottom they've been playing around them
for a while but you know you listen to
it and you're like this is what a cymbal
sounds like this is what you know it
doesn't go down like a lot of played on
magnetics they go down to like 20 or 10
hertz which is an unbelievable
experience if you have had you know not
just EDM but classical music or like I
was in the like Preservation Hall Jazz
Band where they have a couple tubas
tubas go down like 31 hurts man Wow and
these the really good headphones you
feel it it's not like feeling it in your
chest because you're inside the club but
it's a pretty good approximation but
like these Foss texts and I'm like ok
these fostex is these trp trp 5050 RPS
he's down amazing and they're like 140
bucks like and then I like found I went
on ebay and I found the poor like used
on amazon from audio authority or
somebody i found a pair of what was then
like the next big step up and a high
five man 'he 480 400s which two
different models like the wire cutters
pick for the best over your headphone
and emotional those sell for like I
think they sell for three hundred
dollars that's a price point that just
can't really fathom babe I get it I
totally get it like dude like sony MDR
7506 ssl for 75 bucks you probably can't
find anything better for less than 150
bucks or you know for less than 200
bucks probably the I love one more's
triple driver they just came out with a
quad driver the triple driver normally
sells for ninety-nine dollars got a
microphone built in they sound amazing I
mean really really good they you know
they don't have they did or not boo me
in the low end there's not just ridin
door hissy in the high-end you actually
get some sound stage you can feel
somebody they sound fantastic pretty
much any type of music and you got to
spend a lot more money before you get
something it sounds appreciably better
than hundred dollar set of earbuds which
is funny because all of that they are
talking about it just doesn't translate
from a smartphone and now we're actually
losing what the headphone jacks yeah I
mean it's great but part of that right
is is uh uh you know when you when you
look at something like a
four-hundred-dollar set of headphones or
this really intense stuff like you know
mr. speakers which they sell like
they're a Southern California
company they make you know planar
magnetics in-house down in socal you
know they're like they started like 13
15 18 hundred dollars right you know
vocals utopia that's a four thousand
dollar headphone they they basically
like I was talking to the one of the
marketing directors at rockin on audio
fest earlier this year you know they
make the they make the speaker out of
beryllium like you got to wear hazmat
suits and respirators or like Graham
it's incredibly toxic but it's also the
stiffest lightest thing they can they
found that they can make a driver out of
so remember this stuff Adam we got do it
for some guys either and then you get
this you the performance on this driver
is insane and you put in there four
thousand dollars that it's ridiculous
yeah like you know half the cars alone
in my life cost less than four thousand
dollars and but you put these on and if
you have a quality you know if you've
got like lossless audio and a decent
headphone amplifier you're there i'm
hearing everything that's in the music
right but the flip side is like you know
the the Sennheiser Momentum's came out a
few years ago at the same time the
Sennheiser momentum came out at CES they
brought the first like Orpheus Orpheus
was this crazy moon shot from sennheiser
it's like $20,000 blah blah blah umpteen
tubes crazy you know and i'm listening
to this what you know the the momentum
sell for like 150 bucks now they
launched it like 300 bucks and I'm
listen to this three hundred dollar
headphone and I'm listening like this
headphone you know amp combination i
just seen sell on ebay for like 20 grand
and and I'm like because he didn't make
it any more and Mike you know the 300
are headphones got me like ninety-four
percent of the way to the 28 thousand
dollar headphone that's good to know no
but I when you start listening this
stuff and you start learning what it
sounds like or you go from like you know
best thing you can do for audio is like
pay for premium Spotify you know if you
got if you're in a Spotify pay for
premium Spotify because there is it
deflect right isn't flat files there's
there's an audible difference between
the higher resolution stuff the lowers
naw not like high resolution audio like
we have a hundred ninety-two 24-bit
audio that's going to really blow your
mind because as all the like I I hear
some people and I I want to believe that
they're hearing you know airier symbols
in more of the yada yada
huh but I don't know anybody who can a
be me the difference between like a high
resolution audio track and a CD audio
track or maybe I just haven't found the
right person but I feel like it might be
a little rare yeah yeah but when you
when you're looking at Spotify or title
it's worth paying for the premium
version because you're losing a lot of
them like like Pandora like don't get me
wrong man Bob Marley on an AM radio in a
pickup truck with one janked out speaker
it's still Bob Morley man it's awesome
but you know i would rather you know
pandora on like even a sonos box at home
drives me nuts because you know it's a
little trashy that you know so you have
that intonation you're not into nation
you have the I guess I'll uses palette
the palette for the year you know how to
find I probably saw two hundred bands a
year I was like you know I was in
colleges in New York
and we're back a little bit the battery
on here I have to remember to always
have the power bank on hand because it's
nice to be a power it that way batteries
just aren't doing it like like a double
a's gigafactory came online Tesla's
gigafactory came online I did yeah this
week like the you know they just happen
to flip the switch on the Panasonic
Tesla battery production facility
outside of Reno oddly enough this week
how amazing there you go but it's like
it's a tiny footprint of what it's going
to be so I keep dreaming at like lithium
ion battery prices are gonna drop going
with everything because especially the
the solar panels on the roof that the
right that they're planning on like I
can't wait to put get my own house to do
that I gotta make enough money for that
first but I know that feeling the UH but
we were talking for like it is that's
what's I don't have special years or
particular palette but at one point of
my life you know I was in I was in
school in New York City it was it was
when you you could still actually go
there were a lot of music venues like
you could have two slices of pizza or go
to CBGB's and see six bands or the
continental or a bunch of other places
so we went to you know I probably saw
two hundred bands a year at that point
much that's awesome you know and and
that was like the stages were like three
feet high if they weren't like eight
inches high and I'm standing like you
know six feet from somebody's ride
cymbal I get a really good idea what a
ride cymbal sounds like her mic wats
base coming out of a gallien-krueger
cabinet man you know I was four feet
from that thing I know exactly what it
sounds like and when you start when you
start like really really listening you
know you go with like hey you know it's
bob marley singing it's like hey it's
it's bob marley singing it wow man i
really like the way that and then you
start hearing more and more of the music
and at some level when you have a good
recording you're not really hearing the
music you're hearing the music in the
place it was recorded and how it was
engineered and that's really crazy cuz
like really good stereo speakers you're
sitting there and like you're staring at
a wall or a picture of your mom or the
fireplace or whatever is between those
two speakers you know but but you know
wow man that's Adele sitting there the
bass player and whoever is over you mean
like you get this this idea of a sound
stage yeah exactly it's crazy because
like you know two tracks can basically
give you a vivid you know image of
everything that was going on and it's
crazy right there's so many good
headphones out right now that are cheap
like what what eel axe do
and designer named Andrew Jones is now
we're going to elac and the dude has
been making speakers forever he started
out in measurements in one point he was
making like fifty thousand dollar pair
of bookshelf speakers and he turned
around and went to pioneer and made
these incredibly inexpensive speakers
that sound amazing and then when he left
pioneer you went to elac like the elac
debuts or 279 a pair you're not finding
anything better for the money wow you
know the unifies are like five hundred
dollar pair i can't find like the next
jump up for me is like $1,500 for a set
of calf LS 50s wow so that's crazy cause
like I've always I've always used and
heard the term audio file I've never
truly experienced what that meant like
audio until right here well I don't get
as good to you because file so kind of a
weird and the board well I'll you
looking for sure but yeah you clearly
personify that and like but that's
really awesome yeah I can bring it back
to Android before we go if you want to
so I want to say pioneer and onkyo or
pioneer the home audio stuff reminder
Thomas yeah and they came out with
Android powered audiophile music players
right like they do balanced audio out to
headphones they do all of the Lost
solicitude DSD they're like seven
hundred dollars so they're coming out
with an inexpensive one that is not
Android but they're also instead of like
doing the v 20 thing and adding in
better audio circuitry into an android
phone you're taking an Android a
high-end Android audio player and adding
a modem into it and turning it into a
cell phone you know I mean so that's
like I'm like yeah by starting where you
guys been how much yeah for real audio
starting in the right place and then
doing the rest I mean of each one is is
pretty smart the reality is it's like
you know what most of these are pretty
good HTC 10 gave me a slightly better
audio experience to be honest the v 20
is awesome don't get me wrong but the
HTC 10 was the most fun I had listening
to just about anything yeah you know so
well yeah definitely um I know you got
to go pretty much yeah we're pretty much
both have to go at this point but yeah I
just want to thank you again Patrick
thank you so much for coming around me
and I can't wait honestly like you
Europe in doing tech thing up in a
norcal right so what would you be
California in Richmond okay you know
what I can come up there I've been on
yeah I would love to of course if you
wanna skype in from Mobile World
Congress we should get you guys to skype
in
you that would be awesome hi well I
would love to like the collaborations
like this I want we talked about this to
the last time we touch our that
collaboration was once a year it has
been yeah collaboration has been not
really waning in the tech space but I
feel like there's a resurgence of it and
I want to be really competitive between
a lot of people exactly they got the
whole sort of YouTube Insider E
backstabbing thing and then everybody
started to chill out be friends again
exactly you know which is what I hope
this podcast is illustrating on because
we we had we had pocket now yesterday we
had pretty much everybody the day before
and then I have you here and I'm just so
humbled you know by having one dude so
okay one last question should then I
scroll stop yeah mid-range phone yeah
Motorola's pretty much their stuffs been
out for a while you had honor 6x you've
got ZTE v8 which one looks like the best
one wow that's a good question um as of
right now I would have to say honors
been doing some really great stuff and
if you're able if you're able to sort of
bump up the price just a little bit you
can go from on or 6x up to on or eight
and the honor 8 is an exceptional phone
at its price because I hate the way they
market it because they literally use the
word millennial in every sentence one
day were like anything at CES this year
starting with the very first
presentation the Fiat Chrysler yeah
portal and you're thinking like porno
good yeah you're like it's an electric
meeting man for millennial families yeah
all right I do think that honor has been
doing a really good job and it's one of
the easiest phones to get because it's
it's like front page center on amazon
and it's super easy to get same thing
with the honor 6 x so i would say honor
but the ZTE Blade v8 pro uh-huh not bad
so far not bad so far there's definitely
some good features on there the what
what is a hang time on when you hit the
button on the camera on that horse snaps
and I'm just if that's the one thing
it's like everything else looks
fantastic and it feels good in the hand
I mean click and like em wonder if
they're gonna fix this takes the picture
in firmware it's on board that's always
going to be the the Achilles heel is
that just a little bit of polish because
obviously they're using like a
Snapdragon 635 or something like that or
6 20 or whatever the case may be so of
course it's gonna be a little bit of
slowness to it but I'll you know the
main thing I would say our phone of the
year for 26
in was the one plus 3t and if you're
able to add just one hundred more
dollars to your price point to make it
about 2 3 99 to make you 399 you could
get one of the best phones on the market
right now all right hold on it all right
love you an Android so bad our Android
tablets dead sorry I thought I was gonna
stop asking questions you're totally
fine um there is no no installed android
tablets have just stall completely
stalled and there's one really good
reason for it uh actually one really
horrible reason for it but one one
reason for it androids not made for
tablets Android as a whole is just not
made for a large screen right you don't
have the window side of things even iOS
to some extent is not really made for a
huge square but they've done a good job
of catering it um now I have to give a
shout-out because I didn't get to see
these guys at CES this year but remix OS
basically takes the Android back end
puts a windows front end on Oh funny and
it's so it's awesome you can have a
window on the left and look at your
calendar and look at your slack and all
that stuff via and they all look like
the android app there's just in separate
windows and on the right side you could
be playing clash your clients so it's
all at the same time it does require
pretty powerful with machine and those
do exist like the nexus tablets or stuff
like that but yeah that's what's needed
or else otherwise Windows tablets are at
the LA auto show we saw a Porsche that
literally had chinese tablets on the
back of headrests and they were like
look we have android nothing and that's
really all that android tablets are kind
of good for it this way i'm not only
video I mean they work good for a whole
bunch of stuff most elegant say I one of
these to be dealing with his I've been
testing this this this rune audio player
it's a it's kind of like you know it's
it's an audio system and they runs on
android or iOS but iOS disconnects
android won't disconnect so doesn't it
doesn't have reconnected the rune player
every time you relaunch or go come back
from sleep with the application and I'm
like wow man I can't find a 10 inch
tablet with better specs in the one I
already own from 2014 like well yeah i
would say tablets do need a resurgence i
do think that they're still useful in a
lot of cases it's just that when the
phone has more capabilities than even
the tablet
and what's the point of having two
phablets kill the tablet fragmentation
killed the template is and then and
phablets are exactly part of that reason
you know why would you make a 6-inch
phone why would you make a section 6
inch phone no sir is better not for me
six-inch that sounded terrible i'm not
gonna be good 6-inch phones are an
abomination in my in my opinion I've
never liked a 6-inch phone look it's not
like my hands are small but yeah
somebody's like why didn't you get the
6s and I'm like cuz it won't fit my
pocket yeah the if I had the smaller
pixel right I wouldn't need this pop
socket on the back to hold it easier but
other than that I remember oh the Sony
Xperia Z ultra three years ago I
remember there's a segment on that video
where I gave it to some of my friends
and they were like that's not a phone
and that's the thing the general public
doesn't understand why the companies do
that kind of thing and I'm like why they
make the phone general why they make the
television thinner and why they and they
think it's cool right what they would
ever buy it yeah you have it yeah so
that's why I mean I kind of bringing it
full circle that's my whole point is
that I'm afraid that the tech community
and obviously many communities in
general we've gone to use the preaching
to the choir it'll be interesting to see
whether Apple can look outside for for
their customers rather than keep doing
what they think their customers or what
they need to tell their customers to do
oh yeah that's what I've got people have
been using macbook pros for you know
since before window like since like
windows 98 or like I'm thinking about
moving back to Windows cuz i hate the
macbook pro I'm like whoa dude yeah you
were like OS 10 on a raging stick and
he's like the specs suck i'm not paying
that much for it i was like wow i mean i
wanna i want to see like i don't know
you know it's been a rough year for
samsung but like man a lot of people
were pissed off about the iphone 7 to ya
there but that's the pistol is still
selling yeah well Samsung's diving a
little bit more into uh some places that
i would love to see them dominate not
dominate i shouldn't say dominate but
succeed succeed to the one word I want
to see them I want to see them actually
be a part of it my guess is why I'm
saying high-end gaming laptops the odd
see laptops look so good yeah I should
think they're amazing there's a lot I
mean dell announced gaming laptops I
really want to see if the I really want
to see if LG's I can't think of the name
of it they're there to point 16 pound
14-inch laptop they're living 21 hours
ago so you know I want to call it the
Grail but obviously that's not the name
yeah but the yeah it's it's I don't know
it's it's at some point I'm feeling like
you know thinner and thinner bezels and
thinner devices man we've said this like
six times in this show you know i would
i would like to see more products that
are ya built for how people use them
mm-hmm you know and not for you can have
this amazing thing but if you have
children you're gonna hate your life
because there's been your entire time
talking the amazing thing that is
incredibly delicate from the creatures
that you have you know bread I don't
know man specialization is very
underrated in tech yes everybody wants
to do the that everyone wants that one
product that every single person will
use but well I don't know this but that
CES like especially go into sands or if
you look at some of the vendors where
it's like you know people are like
building you know little tiny sensors
and all they do is like detect
temperature or there's it's amazing like
how much very very you know narrowly
focused stuff you can find if you look
around especially the edges are over at
the sands that's worth do it no I've
been able to go to the sands yet um I'm
she's right I should get my badge first
