the HTC Desire series has something for
almost everyone
HTC recently released the Desire X a
dual-core phone for the mid-range market
now here comes the budget-friendly HTC
Desire u1 for the entry-level market HTC
tried hard to balance prettiness power
performance and price and this one did
HTC succeed in doing so does this phone
make you want to desire it make your
conclusion after watching this video
small and light the HTC Desire U is easy
to grasp with one hand and easily slips
into a pocket I love its physical size
because it makes the phone easy to use
one-handed my fingers can reach the side
buttons easily this model that I have
here is the black one it's black all
over and I find this design pretty and
awesome on the front there's a black
bezel surrounded by a shiny metal like
frame which adds a touch of class to the
front only the silver HTC logo and the
capacitive navigation buttons disrupt
the all-black facade there's no front
camera along the right side is a volume
rocker and at the opposite side is the
standard microUSB port at the top is a
power button and headphone jack while at
the bottom side is the microphone hole
and a backplate knotch
the back has a soft touch rubber texture
useful for better grip and for
preventing oil smudges the main camera
and flash are also at the back the
camera housing is surrounded by engraved
concentric circles this accent plus the
glassy HTC logo actually breaks what
would otherwise be a plain and
monotonous back and down here is the
Beats Audio logo printed beside the mono
loudspeaker grille what I like most
about the back cover is that it's
removable the phone uses a mini sim and
there's also a slot for a micro SD card
up to 32 gigabytes its 1650 mAh lithium
ion battery pack is also removable with
normal moderate use this battery can
likely get you through a working day the
HTC Desire U comes with a four inch TFT
Super LCD touchscreen with display
resolution of 800 by
480 it's not exactly HD but with a pixel
density of 233 PPI you can be sure of a
crisp and sharp display don't expect
this phone to blaze trails with its
speed you'll just be disappointed
although the packaging says that a
Qualcomm s4 chipset is inside its of the
single core variety coupled with 512 MB
of RAM the GPU reported by System Info
apps is the adreno 200 the desire ease
processing whistle is immediately
observable when navigating through the
phone's UI the lag is apparent the
capacitive buttons often take a moment
or two to respond app launching lacks
snappiness web browsing works well but
lacks smoothness and fluidity this is
android 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich running
right here with HTC Sense 4.0 on top the
5 megapixel camera at the back is quite
a capable shooter with front side
illumination autofocus and flash support
when needed although it's absurd to
hearing for DSLR quality shots from this
phone he do get acceptable quality shots
shutter lag is inevitable on this phone
in my experience it takes about a couple
of seconds before the image thumbnail
appears but the shots turn out quite ok
especially with enough lighting colors
though looks somewhat subdued and
realistic you can capture up to WVGA
resolution videos with a phone's
camcorder don't expect anything stellar
of course in terms of media playback the
desire you will never be able to match
the multimedia pleasures of its high-end
siblings but that does a good job at
basic audio and video playback it can
play 480p videos quite well but if you
play anything higher than that the phone
might stutter or choke or just won't
play the file at all audio sounds
wonderful thanks to Beats Audio
technology which does add to the
fullness of bass and sound Christmas
just a tip though use headphones if you
can the loudspeaker produces mono sound
and never cover the loudspeaker with
anything it muffles the audio the HTC
Desire U is an entry-level phone
intended for Asia in general
particularly Taiwan in China
price has an attractive 275 US dollars
it is a budget phone designed for people
who don't either greatest the biggest
and/or the fastest this is not for folks
looking for a phone to enjoy the Bliss
of HD feel smarter with multitasking or
capture high-definition videos and
photos rather this is for people needing
the basic smart features of an Android
phone SMS phone calls email web browsing
social networking etc packaged in an
attractively designed phone what do you
think of the HTC Desire U is it back for
the book share your thoughts in the
