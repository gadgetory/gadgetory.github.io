three go see hey what's going on
everybody the team from Android audience
here at Google IO 2017 at the shoreline
amphitheater not too far away from the
Google campus found view
now it's a lot similar to last year's
then all outdoors it's like an outdoor
festival but we just got out of the
Google i/o keynote where a lot of
different announcements now last year we
were given a little bit of a glimpse to
what the future of Io would be and it's
left I guess the right term would be
products they think it's a little bit
more it's definitely a developer
conference more than anything else now
so we don't have a whole lot talk about
my way of smartphones and everything but
what powers so we have a couple of
topics that we wanted to talk about a
couple of things I really jazzed up
during the keynote Chris Carlin an Arab
I think that the thing that I saw was
the Google photos oh oh yeah yeah yours
you're smiling they look good because
I'm a terrible human being I don't I
don't share my photos at all smooth by a
Google bit okay a little College man
yeah it was pretty funny but I mean yeah
anything I think anything that we can
hope that Google can do cool us to make
sharing and organizing photos better is
something everyone can use on the daily
and I think that's going to be huge it's
totally going to change though even the
just the visual fabric of what everybody
shares online because suddenly you will
actually have all the photos that relate
to you instead of just one thing you
happen to get all over all are you
shocked itself so it feels like a lot of
prior setup is reliable question is who
doesn't use good because almost
everybody uses I mean unless you are on
AOL at which point I you have bigger
issues than what we're talking about in
Google i/o today who isn't using a gmail
account and the information you give up
from there is enough for them to make at
least a reference point and then if
they're like viable or Azima oh look
this is you know we entered in
information and then okay we've seen
them in pictures with you before and is
it not that you can infer from that to
be relatively accurate so we're not
going to go too in depth with our topics
right now if you want more in-depth
analysis
to everything that was announced on the
keynote we have all of the content
manager Authority calm and also we're
going to be doing a full-length podcast
little bit later swimmer so with that in
mind while I'm talking over the not
answer your most sharing that I turn I'm
gonna take assistance and I think
there's a couple of things a life
assistant combined with Google lens as
is essentially about to completely
redefine you know voice blower
artificial intelligence in any way that
we we kind of deal with it as it is now
so let's take a look at let's take a
look at a couple of factors you've got
assistant on theory I mean the system
from Iowa is an answer 0 because Google
assistance on iOS pretty much signaled
that Elizabeth necessary apart from the
fact it won't be quite as integrated as
serious but when you have the ability to
have all this information that Google
actually knows about you could use Gmail
services you know I usually an all the
time I get I get a flight record if I
get a flight confirmation said to my
email I will get notes I will get
updates on do the system going it's been
delayed or you need to leave now
once people realize that exactly what
you know that's exactly what is this
engine abuse on iOS that's gonna it's
going to be quite difficult for Apple to
combat that especially with the amount
that Google's already plowed into a
distance I'm sorry to say for Sampson
Bickley unless you are willing to launch
the full suite within a couple of months
you are now playing catch-up what's what
worse than
arrival now get on arrival but late as
well Google just out pigs feeding late
to the dead on the right body tactically
all this stuff you have used or seen
before it's just that they're putting it
all into a system which I came across
the Android pay is pressure up above
that that's probably the ability to just
go buy stuff but I will just order from
Panera yeah without having because I
mean I you think if you Google Maps on
the open or even given on Android you
know you get you can order an uber had
it all integrated and not have to worry
about anything to do a halt in Google
Maps now from a system literally dial up
an error once it's all one thing goes
for a dial up Domino's no apps needed no
account needed no setting up of anything
and in a lot of ways
Google's just taking the Google you know
the Android pay you get system the
Google Checkout and now they're taking
on PayPal so that's what a lot of what
PayPal goes to you now is but you still
have to go by oh that website and do it
all when you now do it from one app on
your phone
there's no ten apps to download there's
none of that why would you use any other
payment versus when it's so easy and
that probably the crux of everything
Google's trying is ease of use if it's
super simple to use you're going to use
it it might be it's not my topic
probably not to take up a whole lot of
time because I just want to just I just
want to say that I'm glad Concordia
to try to bolster the budget right now
Android go is taking that same idea but
I think the layer that on top of it is
incredibly compelling because not only
do people in emerging markets get to
have devices that have Android code apps
on it so could we we could actually
download go made them and use them and
saintly people in India I mean people in
India people in any developing a market
they want Android they want the best
that they can get
they don't want some rubbish version of
Android or some low powered phone that's
super you know its sluggish it's boring
it puts you off and this returns you up
you're better off having a better
experience of a feature phone Google
seems to realize that because by
offering I'd say the key difference gold
versus one is that it now looks to be a
lot more tailored it actually looks to
be we are going after this and this is a
long-term commitment to connecting that
next billion to connecting they're
making sure if you are in a market where
you're paying extortion amounts of money
in your supplement 3G or you've got
limited amounts of resources and you're
like their key point was why would
should I be spending data on there
anything else you wanna add Chris before
we sign off speaking of developers
developer preview tune is out yep the
debater the first Peters the previous
version was the Alpha so there will be
the new features and
probably some taken away but we haven't
flashed it yet but we don't actually not
just so you guys probably have it on
your devices before we do I'm going to
say I think like we've just said about
the keynote it's sort of all about ease
of use and maturation and I think that's
sort of the same Android Oh everything's
getting more like the lofty versions of
Android have gotten more polished and
it's just you know hiding the balls and
just hiding things up and getting
everything working in a way that's
really rich and easy well there's a ton
coming from to the lie L was at a talk
about it and more stuff like Android
model which actually is going to be
shifting to something electric cars it
does how many manufacturers might
actually be tailoring a version of the
Detroit made specifically for their
automobiles and of course Android wear
which I'm actually not wearing an
Android wear you watch now what we're
going to see whatever coming in the next
couple of days
I just let that Alan do it but in any
case keep it tuned to Android authority
for all the best coverage of Google i/o
2017 follow our social media where we're
going to give you recap galleries of
various pictures that we took throughout
the day on Instagram and Facebook and
Twitter and from there make sure you
keep it tuned to the Android Authority
YouTube channel for even more from I
open I open Tina Bosch Google i/o 2015
because we are your source for all
things and joy I am
