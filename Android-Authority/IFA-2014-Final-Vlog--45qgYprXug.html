authority what's going on everybody and
I'm coming to you live from Aoife in
Berlin once again and this is probably
going to be the last time that I'm going
to do so here at Berlin for this
wonderful trade show that happens at
this time of year every single years my
second time being here I am pretty much
going to call it a wrap after this
particular video but I still wanted to
bring you a couple of vlogs I wasn't
able to vlog too many times this year
but I gave you a couple and this is the
second one obviously and I wanted to
give you just sort of my thoughts on the
entire experience we had a lot of work
to do considering there were so many
devices that were coming out that I
wasn't able to give you too many looks
into the behind-the-scenes type of
things but I will be able to give you a
couple of really nice ones here in this
particular video but first talking about
the actual venue itself obviously it's
the same experience as last year mostly
a couple of places did change their
locations in particular Samsung was the
one that decided not to stay in the
north area which was kind of the main
entrance for us but instead they moved
to the south entrance and this is the
south entrance with the ephah sign and
as you can see right over there that is
their building you can see Samsung right
over on the corner there that entire
building is theirs and it's pretty
ridiculous I'm not going to lie Sony was
able to be at the forefront when he came
to the north entrance and they had a
very good booth booth as well white all
over the place and it was very similar
to what we expect from them and that's
the same with all of the companies
including LG who obviously had a huge
display for their g-watch are but we
also got a lot of stuff from Huawei we
got stuff from a sous Lenovo and even
motorola we were not expecting to see
motorola here at Aoife but luckily we
got a nice presentation with them we
were we were able to get that sort of
special invite I guess you could call it
and we were able to go in and get a nice
presentation on it I really loved what i
saw and i think the moto x is a great
phone i'm certainly going to get my own
and it's got to be in bamboo this time
around cuz i missed the boat last time
but in any case we had that and a bunch
of wearables the Moto 360 we also got to
look at that Motorola event but also
lgsg watch our and the ax Suzanne
watches actually in the round revolution
is kind of happening right now and I
really don't blame anybody for really
trying to harness that particular form
factor because everyone's kind of pining
over it but the Zen watch is probably
the one that I feel like anybody could
work and that's
I put my points on for that I will
probably have to say that it's the Sony
Xperia z3 tablet compact now obviously
we have things like the note 4 we have
all these phones we have the wearables
but honestly I'm in the market for a
PlayStation 4 and the very prospect of
being able to play and stream games from
my ps4 that i'm about to buy soon on to
my tablet if I can't play on the TV is
extraordinary I cannot wait to be able
to do that and honestly it's one of the
coolest features at least in my
estimation I'm going to be playing PS
for a lot and being able to do that
anywhere in my house or within the
network is something that I can't wait
to do so that would be my pick for my
favorites from my favorite tablet but
luckily for me I'm like last year when I
was kind of having a little bit of
trouble dealing with being here kind of
exactly like fully on my own this year I
actually had quite a few friends I mean
I've been at this for a couple years now
and I'll get into that in a little bit
but I've been at this and for a couple
years now so I've made some friends in
the industry and you probably saw on my
Twitter G+ and Instagram feeds that I
have been featured on a couple of
particular shows and podcasts one in
particular was the mobile geeks live
stream which I if any of you were able
to watch it then thank you so much for
tuning in no matter where you are in the
world a shout out to my dad and my
girlfriend for both watching it at their
respective times i think it was midnight
in the philippines for my dad and then
830 in the morning for my girlfriend
back in LA but it was really great to be
able to do that it's just such a great
time we're able to sit down talk about
all of these devices and releases in
ways that we kind of weren't able to
before because we're used to doing so in
a very particular way in front of the
camera then after that just such an
honor for me to be able to be on the
pocket now weekly podcast with michael
fisher and taylor Martin those two are
really genuinely great guys and I have
actually known the two of them for a
little bit now but it was really at this
show that we really were able to hang
out a lot more and I will continue to do
so probably a little bit later tonight
before we call it a wrap on this entire
trip because we're all leaving tomorrow
you always see other people's content
whether it's on their websites or their
videos or anything like that but
sometimes you don't really get to know
them as people you don't get to you know
you want to be you got to cross the line
from being professionals to actually
being personal friends you know and it's
it's kind of a blessing to be able to
have that relationship with certain
people so i've been i've been at this
for two years when i was a kid i really
wanted to write about technology and now
I get to do so I don't only get to do so
I get to talk in front of a camera
present myself to all of you guys put
myself out there and you guys all seem
to really enjoy what it is that I do and
I really I really want to thank all of
you out there not just the fans but you
know the guys at android authority for
having me on the team and just you know
all these people for being gracious
hosts like for example Nicole and Sasha
mobile geeks have always been very very
friendly with me and whenever I've had
any trouble they've always helping you
out so I called it my guardian angels
and really it's that experience with all
these different types of people no
matter who they are it seems that you
know I really am reminded of just how
lovely it is to do what I do it's a lot
of hard work but it all pays off in the
end and half the reason why I pays off
in the end is because of you guys I'm
coming up on what is now going to be my
third year here at Android authority I'm
not playing on going anywhere I really
enjoy what's going on here i really
enjoy where I am so I hope you guys will
tune in and stay tunes so that you can
still see me grow I'm sure I look quite
different from last year and I'm sure
that's gonna happen again next year you
know things always keep changing but I
will always strive to get better and
better at what I do and I hope you
wouldn't enjoy that evolution just as
much as I enjoy experiencing it and
bringing you the fruits of those rewards
