this quick video we're going to take a
look at the best keyboard apps for
Android first on our list is a dab text
this keyboard has the standard features
like auto correction but it's claimed a
famous theming and customization it's a
solid option for those looking for
something a little bit different a I
type keyboard has been around for a hell
of a long time and has long tried to
compete with SwiftKey in the field of
text prediction it's a solid keyboard
with great theming options and it's
worth a shot

keyboards on the list but it made a huge
splash in 2014 it features a unique
typing experience above-average tech

something that looks and acts like a
desktop keyboard it has things like

the tab button it's also great for
tablets key monk keyboard is a favorite
of our own Josh vegara and it's a unique
keyboard all on its own you can just

overly unique it has good auto
correction some theming elements text
prediction and multiple keyboard layouts

among the best gesture typing keyboards
