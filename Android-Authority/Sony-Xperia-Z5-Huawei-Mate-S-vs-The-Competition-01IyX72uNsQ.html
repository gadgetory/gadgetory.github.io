brought to you by domain.com oh right
it's a big fan of Sony and Huawei I'm
pretty excited about two phones that
just came out the Sony experience that
five and the hallway mate s how do they
compare to the competition let's check
it out
it's no surprise here that Sony is now
the big winner when it comes to pixel
count at least with a 4k premium model
the 5.5 inch 4k display delivers a
whopping 808 pixels per inch trouncing
the 508 pixels per inch of the galaxy s6
edge+
and the LG g4s 538 pixels per inch
however the benefits of a qHD display
over a 1080p display is already
debatable while the 5.5 inch 1080p
display of the mate s may not sound
groundbreaking it does come with an
insanely high 1.8 million to 1 contrast
ratio providing the crisp blacks and
wide color gamut that we've come to
associate with AMOLED displays if
display clarity is high on your priority
list the experience that v technically
tops the rankings although you won't be
disappointed with a qHD resolution phone
either
just remember native 4k content is going
to eat into the z5 storage space also
speaking of which the experience that v
range comes with 32 gigabytes of
internal storage pretty much the minimum
for a high-end model this matches up
with other handsets in this price range
and the micro SD card slot supports up
to 200 gigabytes of extra storage should
you need it the mate s and edge 6h plus
offers options with the most built-in
storage but you'll miss out with a
microSD card slot if you opt for a
Samsung phone as for processing
performance the Xperia range features a
high-end Snapdragon 810 that competes
with other smartphones in this price
segment the adrenal 430 GPU looks like
it might struggle to render native 4k
games so I imagine some form of
upscaling will take place when using
Sony's x-reality pro technology the
experience that 5 compact still stands
out as one of the few small form-factor
phones to offer flagship level
performance the mate s and its kuren 935
processor is the weakest link
as the phone doesn't feature any
high-performance 8:57 cords for heavy
lifting and the MAL ET 628 mp4 is not
particularly high-end these days however
the octa-core chip is no slouch and will
easily handle your day-to-day tasks and
gaming on a 1080p display it's just not
the choice for those who have to have
the very fastest tech of course the
Samsung Exynos 7420 is still the
processor to beat this year although
it's only mildly faster than the
Snapdragon 810 handsets the s6 edge+ is
the only phone on our list to come with
four gigabytes of RAM but again the
real-world performance benefits are
marginal if any both of yesterday's
announcements from hallway and sony have
resulted in very promising smartphones
although they are perhaps aimed at
slightly different customers Sony's
premium 4k display may be a bit of a
gimmick but the rest of the experience
said five hardware is very solid and
completely competes and in some ways
exceeds other flagships on the market
right now the huawei mate S doesn't
quite match up with other flagships when
it comes to processing power but its
high contrast display fingerprint
scanner and range of storage options
helps to set it apart from the pack
which is important as Huawei can't claim
to have a major price advantage with the
may desk this time what do you guys
think personally I'm partial to Sony it
was the best smartphone I had before I
smashed it I had the Sony Xperia z3
compact I would get the Zed 5 compact as
my net phone if I could I've had LG's
Motorola Samsung and Sony was my
favorite phone what about you guys what
phone would you get on the list if you
could now if you guys are starting any
business or freelancing
you need your own website and you need
your own calm because if you're not
you're giving the other guy who has the
dot-com free traffic why because no
