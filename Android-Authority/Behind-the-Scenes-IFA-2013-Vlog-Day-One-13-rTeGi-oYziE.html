what the Samsung booth looks like
whenever you come to a big show like CES
or in this case Aoife in Berlin Samsung
always has this huge huge booth with
displays of TVs and we have the Galaxy
Note 3 phones right over here the
tablets are behind me and then there's a
stage where there's always something
going on in this just about maybe five
minutes ago they had a some sort of
display some sort of show of fashion and
it's like tied into the galaxy note 3
sometimes you don't really you can't
really make sense of it all but in
basically when you're here it's like
sensory overload everything is white
everything is really nice but I will say
that this one is it's not as crowded as
I expected it to be i remember at CES
when you go to the Samsung booth it was
just so hard to get around so we're just
here at the Samsung food that if I'm
Berlin so this is kind of what it looks
like
you
alright well we are at a trade show so
that means that there are a lot of
different places to get food I try to
keep you a little bit cheap you want to
uh where they serve couriers but this is
a kind of sausage that is made with and
doused pretty much in curry this is a
pretty delicious i love curry flavor so
then of course our french fries with a
mixture of sauces on the side so this is
just sort of essentially what we can
look forward to is that you know it's a
convention center you get the usual
types of food but there are some nicer
restaurants here that we might trial
later but they are quite expensive
still so solid this is so nice rate
tiles everywhere one here the dial again
to the Mo's and then you have another
dial here this is like the best of
everything I've ever loved about an
asana getting compact body any vendors
that you find her right there well band
you have a swivel screen right here I'm
sound like that oh it's amazing
it's going to be my new travel camera
for sure it's just incredible what the
camera so bad
alright and now here we are at the sony
booth we were actually here a little
while ago you can see all the people
walking around me i like in the middle
this if you want to walk around me but
anyway you can see the sony booth behind
us sony also makes great boots every
time we go to a show for them and we
were actually here a couple days ago
covering the sony onami phone or as we
now know it as the Sony Xperia z1 well
they take a little bit more it's a
couple more looks at it mainly at the
camera but i just want to show you what
the booth kind of looked like they
always have great a lot of the booths
are like all whites with a bunch of
colors about the sony booth we're going
to see not only their televisions their
mobile devices probably some experience
innovations even also the lenses we're
also going to see I hope we do see a few
glimpses of the PlayStation 4 maybe so
but we'll see but nonetheless this is
the sony booth here at Aoife in berlin
you
we're trying to figure out what the
media center is oh so we're good to go
ahead why are you so confusing oh this
is what they do great elevator on the
side over there and that's what they're
going to send the cars will bring them
down well it's kind of funny we're in a
building you know are some cars being
sent out it's near the end of the day on
day one we do have more videos to put
out but we're heading over to the next
you know sort of big events where all of
the vendors come together in one big
place called Capcom and I think that
started a couple minutes ago but looking
ahead over right
the first day of Aoife super long super
tired but there was one last event that
we had today and that was of course pep
com digital focus it's actually sort of
clearing out right now because after all
the videos that we did we had pretty
much everybody did the same thing so
they're all leaving right now so what
the teardown is starting and we're about
to get some food it's all food at events
like this so you got to take advantage
of it actually if you look over here let
me just let me just move this over it
was a gelato bar oh my goodness so I'm
definitely gonna get some chill out a
little bit Bogdan ghana's you ready he
just came by like hey Josh I'm meeting
I'm having gelato what are you doing so
yeah kept calm is a lot like
showstoppers which you didn't get to see
from yesterday but there are two
different events where vendors can come
to them and basically show off their
products in a more controlled space
smaller space more intimate space then
the huge Aoife and you saw already that
we had a lot of trouble idea for just
trying to get around anyway here at home
we were able to see HP acer we even saw
a little bit from Samsung so that's the
first day of eva for you so much to do
in so much fun but also super tiring and
I'm really really hungry it's time for
me to get some food so be cool take care
of your buddy and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
