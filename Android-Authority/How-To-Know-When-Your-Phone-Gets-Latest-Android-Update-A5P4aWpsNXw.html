Jason this is where we try and answer
your most pressing Android questions and
the most pressing the most urgent
question we get most often is Jace are
you one crack no I'm just hooked on
happy but the other most common question
we get is when will my phone get the
latest version of Android
well I now have some good news on the
subject and can point you in the right
direction here we go so although we've
answered this question before here on
Android QA we've recently found some new
news on the topic and so we thought we'd
devote a whole Android QA to the subject
to go a little deeper but first we need
to take stock of where Android version
distribution is today as you can see
here from the chart the vast majority of
the Android world is still using jelly
bean or Ice Cream Sandwich there is a
sizable population using Gingerbread and
if that doesn't surprise you there are
still people using Froyo but by far most
of the clamoring is coming from the 98%
of Android users who cannot use KitKat
in fact only 1.4 percent of all Android
users are currently on KitKat ouch but
to be fair
Google takes this issue of fragmentation
very seriously and they have recently
taken some steps allegedly to reduce the
amount of fragmentation Android police
has learned that Google plans to force
Android device makers to use newer
software versions in order to have
access to Google mobile services like
Gmail Google Maps and Google now
apparently Google has issued a schedule
that manufacturers have to adhere to in
order to have Google Maps running on
upcoming devices Noah though it has yet
to be confirmed officially by Google
this could mean we are all getting our
Android updates faster so for those of
you who want to go into this topic a
little bit deeper I encourage you to
check out the show right here where we
talk about why Android updates take so
long and how fragmentation plays a role
in that but the question remains how do
I know when my phone will get the latest
Google update now you may know that some
device manufacturers have an Android
update calendar that you can view online
Motorola for example has a site where
you can go to input your carrier name
and your device name
will tell you the expected time that you
will get the Android update but I
discourage you from doing that or
relying on that too much because the
carriers are really the last leg in the
process of an Android update and so it's
the carrier's calendars that will be a
little bit more accurate so many
carriers though not all do publish their
own Android calendar update where you
can select your device and see which
Android version is available if it is
available at all and if so you can
instigate or commence that Android
update now they also post the the months
in which they expect those new updates
will be available but the kicker is
those carriers are not bound by that
calendar that's just a projected thing
that they put out in press releases for
people like me for example in 2012 on
November 2012 my Galaxy Note was
supposed to get jellybean
it didn't come for another eight months
so you gotta take it with a grain of
salt
thanks for watching android army if you
have a question that has not been
answered already in a past Q&amp;amp;A or a
question you haven't already asked
please put it in the comments below i'm
looking for more questions questions
that will help a larger number of people
if you think it's a problem that many
other people will have i would love to
hear about it in the comments below
connect with me here on google+ and
twitter don't want to forget about my
brothers in andhra josh jo tech ninja
Kevin and Chris I shall see you next
week on Android Q&amp;amp;A</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
