authority now last year Qualcomm took
the wraps off the Snapdragon 845 its
newest flagship processor and we were
there at the launch event and we've got
a couple of videos here on our channel
about the new 8/4 I'm particular I've
got a whole in-depth look about the
internals of the April 5 and even I'll
link to that just up here but now we've
had a chance to actually do some
performance testing using a Qualcomm
reference device so if you want to know
how fast is the Snapdragon 845 please
let me explain ok so a few of my
colleagues have been down to call calm
and they've been looking at a whole
bunch of things that call con we're
doing including in the area of 5g but
while they were there they also got a
chance to play with the Snapdragon 805
built into a quorum reference device and
there's reference device is basically a
smartphone that Qualcomm make for their
own testing also they share that with
their partners to help them build the
next generation or the smartphone so
this particular device comes with a
Snapdragon 845 he's also got 60
gigabytes of RAM and of course in the
845 is the Adreno 630 GPU now while they
were there they were able to run some
benchmarks like antutu and geek bench
and so on
and we've rerun our tests on some
current devices so that we can have a
comparison between the phones that are
coming in 2018 and what we had from the
best of 2017 so devices with tested
against our the HTC you 11 plus the
picture too from Google the note 8 from
Samsung the LG v 30 plus and of course
the mate 10 Pro from Huawei now three of
those devices are running the Snapdragon
835 which of course is last year's
flagship processor from core concepts
the HTC v LG and the pixel 2 from Google
and then inside the notates you've got
the X naught 8 8 9 v from Samsung and
inside the mate 10 Pro you've got the
Kirin 970 which of course has got the
four cortex a53 calls McFaul cortex a7
t3 calls along with a Mali g72 GPU
so try to get the best scoring we can
we've run the test multiple times on
each device and we've taken the average
score that we managed to get during
those series of test runs so without
further ado let's dive in and see what
we can find out about the Snapdragon 805
so our first test is antutu and you can
see here that the winner of the last
year's devices is the mate ten pro with
two hundred and twelve thousand eight
hundred and fifty three now let's add in
the score for the Snapdragon 845 and
there you see 256 thousand eight hundred
and five now that's a 20% increase in
the antutu scores compared to the best
phone of 2017 so next up is the geek
page for scores now the geek pitch
scores are in two parts first of a
single core score which tells you how
fast a single core the fastest core
inside the processor can run and then
you've got the multi-core score which
tells you what happened when it uses all
the cause in a multi-threaded
application and they're all going as
fast as they can
what kind of speed can be achieved so
let's look at last year's phones so from
last year the fastest single core score
was from they mate eight with 2019 and
the fastest multi-core processor was the
ki-rin 970 in the make ten with six
thousand seven hundred and eighty seven
now let's add in the Snapdragon 845
scores and there we can see that the
single core score has gone up to two
thousand four hundred and thirty nine
that's a 20% increase over last year's
note eight with the Exynos 88-90 five
and four the multi-core score we've now
gone over eight thousand six thousand
seven hundred eight and seven before
past seven thousand up into eight
thousand eight thousand two hundred
another twenty percent increase on the
overall scores so I think you'll agree
me 20 percent here across and two two
and the two geek fate schools is a
really promising start for the
Snapdragon 845 now next up we've run
some tests using GFX bench which is a
predominantly 3d test which of course
will really strain the new adrene
six-thirty GPU it's just worth noting
that all these tests are actually going
to be off-screen tests that means the
GPU is doing all the work it needs to do
but it's not actually output to the
screen in the end and that saves there
any discrepancies because of different
screen resolutions but it gives us a
very good idea about the power of the
GPU behind the screen so we start with
the t-rex off screen test and the note
eight scored the best score last year
with a hundred and six frames per second
and now here we can see the Snapdragon
845 manages a hundred and fifty-one
frames a second
that's a 42% increase in raw GPU power
next up is the car chase test also from
GFX bench last year's winner was the
note eight to 25 frames a second and now
the Snapdragon 845 can manage 35 frames
a second so that's another 40 percent
increase in the GPU and our final GFX
bench test comes in the form of the
Manhattan tests that are built into that
test suite all running at full HD we've
got two tests here some using OpenGL ES
3.0 on and some using OpenGL ES 3.0 and
lastly the winner for OpenGL ES 3.0 and
3.1 again was the note eight with the
Exynos 88-90 5 which of course has got
the Molly G 71g per unit a 20 core
Marlee g71 GPU in it and it's got 55
frames a second on the 3.0 test 42
frames a second on the 3.1 test but now
look at the Snapdragon 805 results with
the new Adreno GPU in it
we've got 83 frames a second on the ES
3.0 scores and 61 frames a second on the
ES 3.1 score so that's a 50% and 45%
increase across the board so here we're
dealing with some very very impressive
speed increases in the GPU so the new G
you the Adreno 630 is definitely proving
to be the GPU to beat for 2018 and
finally to round things off we've ran
the jet stream JavaScript benchmark
which you've run inside the chrome app
on the phone of course the Qualcomm
Snapdragon device a reference device was
running was running Android last year's
winner actually for the jet stream
javascript test was the HTC u 11 plus
with a score of 62 point three one and
now this year the Qualcomm reference
device made an eighty five point nine
nine which is a thirty eight percent
increase compared to last year now if
you take all those scores and kind of do
an average across all of the phones from
last year because in some cases to make
ten one in some cases are no eight one
in some cases the UT for the HTC One and
so when we've taken an average of all
those what we've worked out is that the
snapdragon 845 on average is 33 or 34
percent faster than last year's phones
so of course we've got some big flagship
devices coming up this year which should
be running for snapdragon 845 and i
think we're gonna see some very
impressive performance numbers from
these devices and this is only the
reference device from Qualcomm so will
be really great to see what the OEMs can
do with their devices so I'm really
pumped about this it could be great to
see what we get from 2018 to smartphones
well I'm Gary sim for Android I really
hope you enjoyed this video if you did
please do give it a thumbs up it's
really good if you could subscribe to
our Channel hit that Bell icon there so
you get a notification every time we
drop a video and last but not least do
go over to Andrew authority comm because
