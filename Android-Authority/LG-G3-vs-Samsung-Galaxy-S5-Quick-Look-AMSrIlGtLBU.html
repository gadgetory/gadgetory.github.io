smartphone Giants age Joshua Vergara
from Android Authority what's going on
everybody and this is the LG g3 versus
the Samsung Galaxy s5 in this quick look
now both of these phones feature design
languages that borrow heavily from their
previous flagships but with enough
differences to keep things pretty
interesting the big move for Samsung in
terms of design was the shift from the
glossy plastic to a polycarbonate back
with the perforated or dimple design the
reactions to the new design have been
mixed at best but any move away from
glossy plastic is a good one other
changes with the s5 include the addition
of a finger scanner integrated into the
home button and the heartrate monitor
that's found below the camera on the
back similarly LG moved away from the
glossy slippery plastic back of the g2
with the g3 now featuring a brushed
metallic finish and feel which is not
actually metal it is still plastic more
like a hybrid of polycarbonate that has
been given a brushed finish the best way
to describe it is like it's a brushed
plastic but in the end it still gives it
a more premium look and feel staples
such as the ultra thin bezels and rear
button layout make a return but the
button layout is a lot more refined too
this time around with much meteor feel
and also it's a little bit more
pronounced and when it comes to the size
they are actually quite similar but the
g3 is definitely the bigger of the two
it's still amazing how close they are
considering that the g3 offers a lot
more screen real estate with its 5.5
inch screen display compared to the 5.1
inch screen of the galaxy s5 the 5.1
inch Super AMOLED display with a 1080p
resolution of the galaxy s5 brings the
signature high saturation with colors
that basically pop out of the screen you
get vivid colors great brightness and no
loss in clarity even at steep angles on
the other hand the 5.5 inch display of
the LG g3 is one of the very few to
boast a quad HD resolution with a pixel
density of 534 pixels per inch a 100 PPI
density more than the galaxy s5 this is
an absolute beast as far as displays are
concerned in the experience should and
actually is pretty fantastic
the differences will actually barely be
noticeable to the general user however
and both screens will offer a great
experience and nonetheless whether
you're reading texts watching videos or
playing games that bump up in resolution
for the LG g3 Israel
nice and it makes it one of the
handsomest displays we have seen but
when you compare it to the one on the
galaxy s5 for the most part you're not
really going to notice the difference
both the Samsung Galaxy s5 and the LG g3
feature identical processing packages
with the Snapdragon 801 processor coming
in at 2.5 gigahertz and backed by the
adrenal 330 as expected performance with
both smartphones was fast and smooth and
if you did think that the
high-resolution display of the g3 was
going to bog it down that's not
necessarily what I found in the little
time that I had with it apart from the
usual array of hardware additions new
additions in the galaxy s5 include the
heart rate monitor and fingerprint
scanner that is integrated into the home
button uses for both are still somewhat
limited and it's entirely up to you how
much you use them as I still kind of
feel that the heart rate monitor is not
a great companion for people who are
actually really into fitness
but another positive for the Galaxy s5
is the fact that the whole device is
dust and waterproof as indicated by the
ip67 rating on the phone on the g3 side
of things you also get the full host of
hardware and connectivity options as
well including expandable storage our
removable battery at least in the
international version of the phone that
I got so use NFC and 4G LTE but of
course it doesn't include the extras
that Samsung does the LG g3 does feature
a bigger 3000 milliamp hour battery
compared to the twenty eight hundred
million Bauer unit of the s5 but in all
likelihood the g3 battery life may not
be as good considering the larger
display with a higher resolution that
the g3 battery has to power for the most
part we will probably say that these two
phones will be more or less on par when
it comes to battery most likely the
Samsung Galaxy s5 features a 16
megapixel ISO cell camera that we've
covered extensively already overall you
get some great shots with this camera
and it definitely allows for some fun as
well as serious smartphone photography
on the other hand the g3 features a
camera setup that's quite similar to
what was found on the G pro 2 with a 13
megapixel rear shooter sporting Ã³as
plus and as we've seen before the camera
should perform admirably well the newly
added autofocus laser that is found on
the back next to the camera has also
made a big difference in allowing for
some quicker autofocus an issue that was
plagued that has plagued to previous
iterations of LG smartphone cameras
well when it comes to software both of
these phones bring slightly different
versions of the operating systems that
came before it
TouchWiz now brings relatively few
updates to what was already a future
heavy software suite with mostly
cosmetic changes the biggest change is
the addition of the my magazine which is
essentially Samsung's answer to
blinkfeed
while it does bring the neat news
aggregation feature to touch who is my
magazine is unfortunately not very
robust at all underneath and a piggy
backs off a Flipboard eventually feeling
like an unnecessary extra step between
you and the already good for the bored
app overall TouchWiz remains TouchWiz
even with the additions of the circles
all over the place including inside of
these settings menus it doesn't really
bring enough to the table to make the UI
overhaul worth anything that we were
really kind of expecting LG on the other
hand has managed a major overhaul with
their latest version of the custom
interface much flatter icons colors that
are not as bright and also with an
overall cleaner and minimalistic feel
that said LG still packs a ton of
features into its software with a lot of
useful additions as well returning
things are things like the multitasking
of the dual window and after that the
NOC code which we saw in the G pro two
new additions include LG's Google now
like concierge service a revamped
keyboard that allows for more
customization including adjusting the
height to what you want and also a quick
circle feature that actually piggy backs
off of a quick circle case that I also
have a hands-on with in another video
and so there you have it for this quick
look at the Samsung Galaxy s5 up against
the LG g3 which was just launched today
these are the two big Korean smartphone
manufacturers going head-to-head once
again and we do think that the LG g3 has
a lot to offer over the incumbent to the
galaxy s5 which has already been out for
just a little while already so keep it
into Android Authority for further
comparisons of the LG g3 to the flagship
devices we have already and remember to
keep it tuned to Android authority
