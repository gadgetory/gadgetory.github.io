Android Authority now if you hang around
with nerds with technical people long
enough maybe they'll use vocabulary that
you're not familiar with they might use
words like machine code or assembly
language when they use it you kind of
just smile sweetly and let the
conversation carry on because you don't
really know what they're talking about
well today I want to explain to you what
is machine code on what is assembly
language now we're all used to running
multiple programs on our mobile devices
whether they're laptops tablets or
smartphones we ran a program we started
up we use it we closed it we start
another one where there's a word
processing suite an email client a game
a graphics program we're very used to
going into a program exiting it and then
going into another one but it wasn't
always like that at the beginning of the
history of computing the initial
computers were hardwired they could only
perform one task the circuit that was
built into them that was the task that
they performed of course it became
obvious very quickly that we need a
universal computer one that can perform
any task so it's programmed to do now
there are two key characters in the
history of the development of these
stored-program one is Alan Turing and
the other is John von Neumann now Alan
Turing is famous for breaking the Enigma
code during the Second World War but he
also did a lot of other things related
to computer science and particularly he
came up the idea of a thing called the
Turing machine now he proved with the
Turing machine you could execute any
computable algorithm I were boy the
details of how he talked about it but
basically had the idea of some symbols
that could be read and other symbols
could be written to a tape because that
was the technology of the time now this
idea was picked up and taken further by
John von Neumann and von Neumann
proposed the idea of a CPU a central
processing unit with some memory random
access memory and that the CPU executed
instructions and then could alter the
random access memory in fact the
majority of computers that we use today
use what we call the von Neumann
architecture what does all this have to
do with machine code and assembly
language well machine code is the name
given for those instructions are
executed by the central processing unit
they're bad in fact just numbers they're
a long number that tells the
to do something for example under the
ARM architecture the number 288 means
move one inter-village to zero now a CPU
has registers that kind little pots
little holes you can put data in and you
can do something with them quickly and
then maybe put something else in there
very temporary even the arm 64 chips for
example only have 64 registers so they
can't replace main memory not talking
about gigabytes he'd you're talking
about a few places to store temporary
data man they're great when you want to
perform maybe do something the string
you can do things in little registers
now each of these numbers 288 move one
into register 0 each of these numbers
mean something different now of course
if you imagine writing that by hand
trying to remember what 288 is what is
329 though what is 54 do all these
different numbers would be almost
impossible so in fact there's another
thing which is a slightly higher level
more human-friendly version of machine
code called assembly language and rather
than just talking with raw numbers
there's some opt codes some short codes
that say I want to move something into a
register that here's an example as you
can see that tells us we want to move
one into register 0 now assembly
language when you start writing it it's
in a text file it has to be converted
into the machine code by a thing called
an assembler so an assembler takes this
very low-level code and turned it into
machine code which the CPU knows how to
execute so here's another snippet of
assembly language so you can kind of get
an idea of what it looks like now what
this one does is it takes the number 15
and puts it into register 3 and then
stores it somewhere on the stack now I'm
not gonna getting to stack now but base
is a part of memory and it says here
that this number is stored 8 bytes down
the stack it then takes a number 25 and
sticks it into r3 and then says let's
store that at the 12th position on the
stack and then finally it adds those two
numbers together and store the result
again in r3
now in a higher-level language like C or
Java
you would probably do this in just three
lines I is equal to 15 J is equal to 25
I is equal to I plus J so as you can see
using a higher-level language is easier
to three lines of code rather than eight
now imagine if you had to write a game
like clash Royale or Riptide GP using
just assembly language now it would be
possible and in fact in the days of the
home micro revolution the BBC micro is a
tech spectrum the Commodore 64 that's
what game programmers did they wrote it
all in assembly language quite an
amazing feat if you think about it but
today we would use a compiled in our
compiler takes a high-level language
like C and converts it directly into the
machine code so the C compiler looks at
what you want to do normal to set this
variable I want to add these two numbers
and it works out what it needs to do in
the assembly language and then in the
machine code to actually get that to
happen now there are other programming
languages in Java for example which is
the main programming language for
Android apps what actually happens you
use a compiler that converts the Java
code into Java byte code
kind of like a type of machine code bits
for a virtual machine not for a real
physical processor but for one a virtual
one that exists on the Android phone it
runs through a thing called a virtual
machine which interprets those byte
codes those machine instructions and
turns them into real instructions for
the ARM processor or for an Intel
processor or for a mixed process and the
idea of course is that therefore you can
write apps and you can actually have
them on any architecture that you want
because it's the virtual machine that
running them and then there's one little
step you have to write when you
implement Android to make it work on
that particular processor cause at the
moment the ARM processor is the most
dominant one so you've got a compiler
that converts it into a bytecode and a
virtual machine that runs it on the
Android phone now if you want real high
performance then you really should be
writing your game let's say or your
mathematical modeling program or
whatever is you want to do in C or even
in assembler language and that's
possible there's a thing called in
native development kit the NDK which you
can get from Google it allows you to
write C and assembly language directly
on your Android phone and that bypasses
that
a virtual machine and using compilers
and assemblers to create that code but
let me warn you nerds only need apply so
let's do a quick sum up here so that you
can really get the essence of what's
going on here
old days computers fixed didn't have to
couldn't do multiple tasks weren't
universal go do one thing invented the
idea cheering and von Neumann ad the
idea of universal computers that could
have memory and a CPU and they can
execute instructions and those
instructions are called machine code for
us humans to create that machine code
there's a slightly higher level a
readable form called assembly language
which converts directly into machine
code and then above that you get
languages like C and Java and other
languages that exist that can compile to
machine code to run on a processor I
hope you got all that my name's Gary sim
from Andrew authority and I hope you
enjoyed this video if you did please do
give it a thumbs up also please use the
comments below to tell me whether you've
written any machine code have you
written any assembly language do you
like writing in high-level languages do
tell us about your experiences with
these low-level things on your Android
phone also don't forget to subscribe to
and royalties YouTube channel you can
follow me on Twitter and if you use this
link here you can find me on the and
Roth or 'ti forums there's a place on
the forums where you can ask me any
question ask me that machine code ask me
about assembler and if I can help you
I'll get back to you and also don't
forget to stay tuned to an authority
