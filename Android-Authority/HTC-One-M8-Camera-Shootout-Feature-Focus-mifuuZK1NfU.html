what's going on here buddy
and every photo and video that you're
seeing in this future focus was taken on
the cameras of the HTC One m8 and on a
sunny day in Anaheim California
I took the HTC One m8 out for a date in
Downtown Disney for a photo scavenger
hunt so there gonna be a lot of Disney
themed photos in here but we'll go ahead
and start off with these photos here and
you're going to see a lot of 100% crops
so that I can show you the detail or in
a way to lack thereof once you kind of
zoom in or you kind of take a closer
look now we are working with the four
ultra pixel camera that HTC kept in the
m8 and the front-facing camera is a five
megapixel shooter that did a pretty good
job in that intro as you saw already so
primarily when it comes to this camera
you'll find that you'll get some pretty
good shots but once you look closely or
even zoom in you'll realize that the
details are pretty grainy that's just
the limitation of a low megapixel camera
but if what you see is what you get is
the sort of trope that they're looking
for here HTC has kind of nailed it
because you can get some spectacular
shots the same goes for the dual camera
which is pretty well executed as you can
see here I have the rear you focus here
it may not be fully clear in the
background but you can play around with
it to get some pretty interesting shots
here's where you can see that the
software doesn't always find the perfect
point of focus I only wanted the car in
the middle to be colorized but you can
see on the right and left that you know
it wasn't really able to draw that line
and then finally you have another effect
here with the seasons I just added some
maple leaves and it also allows you to
put the date so that was when I did this
when you come on to the other photos
that might have the Sun in the
background you'll find that lens flares
are kind of really common when it comes
to the HTC One m8 scammer but it's also
kind of common for a lot of smartphone
cameras out there as well the other
thing you'll see like in this photo is
that the dynamic range isn't necessarily
there there are some washed out areas of
pretty much any photo that is pretty
bright like you can see in the
background there and overall when you
look at these photos they may not have
that vividness that you kind of looking
for but again with the duo camera you
should be able to play around with them
and still get some pretty nice shots we
just kind of hoped that the colors would
be a little bit let's say more vivid is
what I keep using but that's really the
term to use here because a lot of photos
tend to look a little washed out now
what I should say is that all of the
pictures you're seeing inside of this
video have been taken at the 16 by 9
aspect ratio at full auto there is a lot
of manual control that you have over
your settings inside of the camera app
but in this case we just went full auto
because that's probably the most common
situation that you'll be in
so what I will say is that the app was
very easy to use as long as I had the
camera app open I just had to open my
dog view Smart Cover and it would open
straight to the camera and then I'd use
the volume down button as the shutter
button in order to take the photo so
taking the 150 plus photos that I did on
this particular day was really no
problem at all and that sort of speaks
to HTC's what there's what it seems like
they're doing is really making a camera
that is geared towards the average user
and it that means that maybe the
pictures are not going to be that
highest quality that you're expecting in
a way it's because of the lower
megapixel count yes but also just a
quality the photos themselves tend to
have this sort of washed outs not
necessarily very contrasty the
coloration to them but it is capable of
some fun stuff especially if you love
using zoe's to highlight the days that
you go out with this camera and
ultimately for a lot of users out there
the experience on the HTC One m8 is
already pretty fun and great and the
camera does add to it by being easy to
use and it's also pretty good at getting
just the right shots if what you see is
what you want to get so in a way what
you're probably gonna have to do is just
frame the photo the way that you want it
to be because if you try to crop anymore
it may not turn out the way you want it
to be here are a few low-light shots
just to show you again what the
low-light capability is of the HTC One
m8 are just like from before and as you
can see they are a little bit hit and
miss the darker areas are grainy but
that's to be expected anyway and so
there you have it for this feature focus
on the cameras found on the HTC One m8
we took a look at the video capabilities
of the front and the back camera as well
as the pictures from the dual camera
setup in which you are able to get some
style into your photos very easily when
you go into the gallery and edit them it
does give you quite a bit of freedom and
it can yield a lot of pictures that look
really nice but as is the case with a
lower megapixel camera like the one
found on this phone you do see that once
you zoom in even just a little bit
you're gonna find that some of the
detail is not there that you might like
but for a lot of you out there this
general camera might be perfect for your
general users out there who are on
social
and whatnot so stay tuned to address
already for all of the best coverage
including the rest of our coverage and
my full review of the HTC One m8 keep it
tuned to Android authorities YouTube
channel and then remember to head on
