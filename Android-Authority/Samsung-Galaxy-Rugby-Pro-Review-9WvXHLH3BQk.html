Authority and we're here with a review
of the Samsung Galaxy rugby pro while it
may not be top-of-the-line spec wise
it's not really meant to be the main
advantage of this phone is that it's
built like a tank
the Galaxy rugby pro will cost you $99
with a two-year contract from AT&amp;amp;T and
$449 without a commitment looking at the
specs the Samsung Galaxy rugby pro has a
4-inch WVGA Super AMOLED display with a
resolution of 480 by 800 and 16 million
colors it runs a Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
plus chipset with a 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core processor and one gig of ram
internal storage is eight gigs
expandable up to 32 gigs via the microSD
slot the phone is powered by a 1,850
milliamp hour battery rated for up to 11
hours of talk time and 336 hours of
standby time
looking at the build quality it's easy
to see that the Samsung Galaxy rugby pro
is very ruggedly built it's water dust
and shockproof to military
specifications and while we couldn't
test this because Samsung would get mad
at us
it looks like it could survive a drop on
a concrete floor without any problems at
all the phone has a big chunky feel to
it but despite this it's surprisingly
light weighing in at just four point six
ounces on the front of the phone we find
Hardware home menu and back buttons
below the screen and the 1.3 megapixel
front-facing camera above it on the left
side we see the volume rocker and a user
customizable button right above it on
top of the phone there is a covered 3.5
millimeter headphone jack
while the right side is where we'll find
the power button the bottom of the phone
has a covered microUSB port finally on
the back of the phone we find the five
megapixel rear camera the flash and the
speaker below this you'll notice this
little lock you'll need a coin to unlock
this and beneath it is where the battery
SIM card and microSD slot are located
the Samsung Galaxy rugby pro runs
Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich with
Samsung's TouchWiz UI running on top of
it so far there is no word on whether or
not the rugby will see an update to
jelly bean every once in a while the
phone somewhat lower specs become
apparent when you're scrolling through
the home screens but performance is
generally good there are a lot of apps
included and some are more useful than
others for example users might find s
voice useful but not AT&amp;amp;T Navigator
especially since Google Maps is included
already
unfortunately users who don't want these
apps will find that they can disable
them but can't actually uninstall them
the quality of the Galaxy rugby pro is 5
megapixel camera is good for the most
part and pictures are sharp but you may
find that the colors are a little washed
out in certain pictures the phone is
capable of capturing 1080p video which
looks fairly crisp but does have the
same issues with washed out colors that
photos taken with the phone
the Samsung Galaxy rugby pro z' 4G LTE
works very well the connection was
always fast even in areas with low
signal and web browsing seemed at least
as fast as Wi-Fi if not faster in some
cases call quality was also fine it was
neither dramatically better or worse
than we expected to wrap up while
performance did have to take a bit of a
hit in order to make the phone so tough
it's surprisingly fast and should
perform well as long as you don't need
the absolute highest specs available
while the chunky body and buttons won't
appeal to everyone the phone is by no
means ugly either the Samsung Galaxy
rugby pro might not wow you with its
specs but it's a great phone for anyone
whose line of work for example
frequently puts them in situations where
a normal smartphone might be just a bit
too delicate if you're unusually clumsy
this could also be a great phone for you
have you used the Samsung Galaxy rugby
pro yet do you plan on buying this phone
or do you know anyone you think it would
be useful for let us know what you think
this has been Christopher wolf for
Android authority please let us know
what you think of this video as well as
the other videos on our channel thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
