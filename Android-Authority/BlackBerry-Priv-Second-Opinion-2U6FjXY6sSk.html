Authority and today we're taking a look
at the black very prim and this is not
going to be a full-on review or anything
like that I'm just going to offer you
guys my personal opinions and what I
think about this particular device so
I'm not going to get too in-depth with
all the technical information regarding
this phone if you want to know more
about that stuff make sure to check out
Josh's full review where he will also be
offering his own take on what he thinks
about this device as well but with that
being said I'm just going to talk about
what I personally think about the Prive
as far as the design the build quality
the performance and all that good stuff
so let's go ahead and get right into it
this is the BlackBerry Prive
so let's start with the design of the
BlackBerry prin so it's a portrait
slider phone so we haven't seen this
form factor in quite a long time so it's
kind of interesting to see that
blackberry brought this back and it's
actually not all that thick for being a
portrait slider it's a little bit over 9
millimeters thick which is actually not
all that bad and it feels really good in
the hand it's easy to use in one hand
because it only has a 5.4 inch display
which is kind of an odd screen size but
it's still very manageable in one hand
and it's also extremely easy to hold on
to because the back is very grippy it's
got this sort of a carbon-fiber / Kevlar
look to it but it's a very grippy back
probably the grippy astac that i've ever
touched on any smartphone and it's sort
of tacky in a way not tacky in a fashion
sense but tacky in just the way that it
feels it just sort of suction cups
itself to your hands so this is phone
that you can definitely go without a
case and not have to worry about
dropping it I was a pretty big fan of
the portrait slider form factor back in
the day so the fact that the BlackBerry
Prive is a portrait slider form factor
kind of takes me back a little bit and I
really like it it's a spring-loaded
mechanism so it's really easy to slide
up and down so if you slide up the phone
about half way it pretty much just
springs into place and the same thing we
said when you slide the phone downwards
it just springs right back and it's
really easy to slide up and down because
the front half actually protrudes a
little bit above the bottom chin and
there's also a metal rail that sort of
lets you sort of grab onto with your
thumb and slide the phone up and down so
these sliding McNab's mechanism works
extremely well and obviously when you
slide the phone upwards you reveal the
physical QWERTY keyboard which is
something that BlackBerry has been known
for for a very long time and I don't
know if blackberry enthusiasts if
there's any of them left out there if
they're going to be satisfied with this
particular keyboard because I actually
found it to be a little bit cramped and
it's just really hard to type on and I
don't have the biggest hands in the
world but you know it's just not the
easiest keyboard to type on and the
travel on the keys are actually kind of
a little bit shallow the nice thing
about the keyboard though is that also
doubles
a trackpad so you can actually use it to
swipe between home screens or scroll
within a webpage or your social media
feeds but I did notice that the
scrolling is very inconsistent
sometimes it's inverted and sometimes
it's not inverted and I'm not entirely
sure why that is but the keyboard also
can be used to autocomplete words so if
you're typing out a text message and you
see a word that pops up that you want to
use you can just swipe up on the
keyboard to autocomplete that word and
you can also swipe left to delete words
as well so I really like the
functionality of the keyboard I just
wish the typing experience was a little
bit better so like I mentioned earlier
the screen on the front is a five point
four inch screen and it's an AMOLED
screen with 2560 by 1440 resolution so
being that it's AMOLED you're going to
get those really inky deep blacks those
vibrant saturated colors and high
contrast ratios and the high resolution
makes it great for you know text browse
on the web watching videos and playing
games so I really had no problems with
the screen at all I don't think it's the
best AMOLED screen that I've ever seen
on a smartphone I think that title still
belongs to Samsung
but generally I really had no problems
with this display at all it's a great
looking screen and one thing that you'll
notice what the display is that it's
also curved along the edges sort of like
the Samsung Galaxy s6 edge except it's
not quite as drastic and there's really
no functionality to the curved glass at
all it's more for aesthetics and the
majority of the curved glass is actually
mostly just bezel anyways alright so
let's talk a little bit about the
performance of the BlackBerry Pritz
running on a snapdragon 808 with 3
gigabytes of RAM and generally
performance has been pretty good um you
know it opens apps quickly it multitasks
and plays games well so I've really had
no issues with you know general everyday
performance but you know some users have
reported to have a very buggy experience
with the Prive and some people have
reported that they've had a flawless
experience with the prove and I happen
to fall into the former rather than the
latter and some of the bugs are pretty
minor but then there's ones that sort of
stick out at you a little bit so for
example sometimes when I'm sweat when
I'm typing on the physical keyboard and
I want to
which to the software keyboard the
software keyboard doesn't want to show
up and I actually have to exit out of
the application and open it back up to
get the software keyboard to finally pop
up another problem that I've had is with
phone calls when I hit the dial button
on the dialer it actually completely
blacks out the screen and if I hit the
power button it doesn't come back on
which I thought was extremely weird I'm
not exactly sure why it does that I
don't know if that's intentional or if
that's a bug because I don't have you
know another crib to compare it to but
the biggest issue that I've had with the
privet is that it overheats it actually
gets extremely hot when playing games or
watching videos and I know phones get
warm but this was beyond warm it
actually got physically hot to the point
where I had to actually put the phone
down and just sort of let it rest for a
bit next up is the camera so on the rear
is an 18 megapixel sensor with optical
image stabilization and it's actually a
pretty decent camera it takes really
great photos in most lighting situations
so outdoors and daylight or in well-lit
places I take some really great looking
photos really great colors sharpness in
just a lot of detail but the biggest
problem is low-light it doesn't perform
that great in low-light there's a lot of
noise and photos just tend to sort of
fall apart in low-light situations and
the front-facing camera isn't really all
that great either it's only 2 megapixels
so you're not exactly getting the most
high resolution selfies but it is
serviceable for that particular purpose
now the camera app itself I think you
know it's very easy to use for the most
part and I do like the exposure slider
on the bottom of the viewfinder it makes
it really easy to just dial in the
exposure on the fly but the actual act
of taking a photo is really slow like
the shutter speed is very slow it takes
a few seconds before you actually can
take a photo that's a little bit
unacceptable for a flagship smartphone
in 2015 and hopefully that's another
thing that can be resolved in a software
update battery life for me has just been
ok
eh I can get through a full day if I'm
very diligent with my usage so if I stay
away from YouTube videos or playing
games I can make it through a full day
just fine but if I play games or watch
youtube videos for even just a couple of
hours typically find myself having to
recharge a midway through the day at
least once a day if not more one of the
most notable features of the BlackBerry
Prive is actually the software so it's
not running on BlackBerry's own
operating system it's actually running
on Android so it's android 5.1.1
lollipop and it's a mostly stock build
of Android so you're not going to find
too much customization here from
blackberry and they've sort of taken the
Motorola approach as far as how they've
chosen to customize Android so you still
have blackberry messenger pre-installed
and you also have detect by blackberry
which is a security application and
security is something that a lot of
blackberries have been known for in the
past so you're still getting back here
with the BlackBerry Prive there's a lot
of other really cool features built in
here so for example you can actually use
third-party icon packs from the Play
Store to customize the launcher which is
something you can only normally do with
a third-party launcher but you can
actually do it here with the built-in
launcher on the blackberry Prive and
that about wraps it up for this video
again this is not a full review if you
want to see the full review and find out
what Josh thinks about the blackberry
proved make sure to check the link down
below in the description or over here in
an annotation or up here in a card
wherever it might be but overall I think
the BlackBerry Prive is a solid
smartphone it's got really great
blackberry hardware and really great
software with an Android operating
system and BlackBerry's customizations
on top now will this phone be enough to
actually save blackberry I don't think
one phone can actually do that but we
will see we'll see if this actually
helps BlackBerry out but that's really
it guys hopefully you enjoyed this video
