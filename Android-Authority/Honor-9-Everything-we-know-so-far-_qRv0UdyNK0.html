nine and what we know thus far and we
know quite a bit the upcoming honor nine
has stopped by kena recently tena is the
Chinese regulatory body for these
devices and this means that we know
exactly what it will offer in terms of
hardware and as expected
it will feature high-end specs as it
will be powered by the Cure and 960
chipset and come with either 4 or 6
gigabytes of RAM both versions will
offer 64 gigabytes of on-board storage
which you will likely be able to expand
for an additional 256 gigs with the help
of a micro SD card just like its
predecessor the honor 9 will be equipped
with a dual camera setup on the back
this has been confirmed by the
promotional poster which shows two
cameras alongside the number 9 the main
camera setup features 20 and 12
megapixel sensors while the front-facing
selfie snapper has 8 megapixels the
smartphone will sport a 5.1 5 inch
display with Full HD resolution and pack
a 3100 milliamp hour battery
it's expected to ship with Android new
get onboard with the latest version of
hallways user interface on top it looks
like the upcoming smartphone will ditch
the headphone jack though this is based
on an image leaked by the tech point
that shows the bottom as well as the top
of the honor 9 as you can see the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack is missing
which means that you'll have to plug in
your headphones with the help of an
adapter that will hopefully be included
in the retail box alright gotta stop
right there and answer an obvious
question why is there a growing trend of
manufacturers eliminating the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack are their
consumers somewhere clamoring to take
the hole out of their phone no
manufacturers want to quote extend the
line meaning they want to create
opportunities to sell you more stuff
adapters Bluetooth headphones etc that's
why it's happening Apple started the
trend and everyone else is following
like what you want
when you want Wow let's move on to
design quite a few images of the honor
nine have popped up online so far giving
us a great look at its design the first
picture was revealed by tena on its
website which you can check out here it
shows that the upcoming smartphone looks
a little bit different than its
predecessor it has a glass back that
slightly curved on the sides which
should make the device sit better in the
hand
the biggest difference though is when it
comes to the fingerprint scanner it has
been moved from the back to the front
the image posted by tena shows that the
owner nine will be available in what
looks like to be a gold color option
however you also be able to get your
hands on a few additional color variants
including blue sky blue yellow white and
grey this has been revealed by images
leaked by price Raja
which you can check out in the gallery
here alright let's talk price and
release dates just like its predecessor
the honor nine is expected to be a great
bang for the buck pricing obviously
hasn't been confirmed just yet
the rumors have it that the smartphone
with the four gigabytes of RAM option
will cost two thousand two hundred and
ninety-ninth one
while the version with six gigabytes RAM
will set you back two thousand five
hundred and ninety-ninth on this comes
out to 335 or 380 US dollars but it's
worth pointing out that those prices and
US dollars are expected to be higher
than those in China when launched the
honor eight with 32 gigabytes of storage
retailed for 399 while this 64 gigabyte
model was released for 449 the best-case
scenario here is that the honor 9 will
cost the same as predecessor although
there's still a chance that the company
might have a slight increase in prices
this year now the owner 8 was officially
announced in July 2016 in China and then
it went on sale in the US and Europe a
month later in August it looks like the
company will speed things up a bit this
year although not by very much a
promotional poster for honor nine has
recently linked showing that the
smartphone might be announced on June
12th at a press conference in Shanghai
China so what do you guys think of the
device so far I like it it doesn't have
super high specs compared to more
premier flagships but it's still pretty
darn good and I like the fact that it's
only five point one five inches it's not
a massive phablet the battery isn't so
large but for the size of it not bad at
all
what do you think let me know right
there in the comments or on Twitter meet
Jeremy Schoemaker otherwise known as
shoe money and he became famous for this
photo where he showed off a cheque that
he made from Google Adsense and he's
become so good at making online
businesses that he made an announcement
that he does not start a new business
unless he can secure the business's name
in a dot-com now why is that exactly
well no domain name extension tells your
story with the same degree of trust as a
dot-com or dotnet domain name.com and
dotnet domain name extensions inject
credibility and your online presence and
who doesn't want to be credible and
don't forget you get 15% off when you
use our coupon code Android when you
think domain names think domain.com
