brought to you by domain.com o LG and
Huawei gods please restore Nexus to its
former glory remember this puppy the
Nexus 5 this thing was simple elegant
and had flagship power all for 350 bucks
glorious unlike more recently we have
the nexus 6 which is a beautiful big
phone if you love big phones but there
wasn't anything super innovative super
new and it was expensive whereas the
original Nexus 5 truly gave other
manufacturers an idea of what a flagship
powered android phone could be now when
it comes to producing Nexus phones LG
has an impressive record the South
Korean Giants previous efforts are the
most affordable and celebrated
smartphones on Google's Nexus roster
although LG's current flagship handset
is more expensive than devices like the
oneplus 2 or the Moto X style it is
still quite a bit cheaper than flagships
from Samsung and HTC and we'd expect the
Nexus 5 2015 to push the pricing
envelope even further what might really
work for the Nexus program is for LG to
return to the basics that means
delivering a solid product without too
many bells and whistles but at the same
time working to keep compromises and
sacrifices to a minimum to ensure a
flagship level experience and an
affordable price I know what you're
thinking you're thinking Jace come on
you want too much you want both
innovation and power and a cheap price
but the Nexus 5 the original did strike
a sweet balance thankfully the recent
leaked images seem to suggest that's
exactly what we'll see while the LG
Nexus 5 2015 will have some modern
amenities like a fingerprint scanner and
possibly front-facing speakers its
design still has the minimalist quality
that many of us appreciated with the
original Nexus 5 now let's talk cheddar
what's it going to cost if Google and LG
really want to hit here they'll need to
reach a price point comparable to
Motorola's Moto X pure edition if LG can
do this while delivering experience that
is somewhat on par with the LG g4
they'll be sure to have another modest
hit on their hands rumored to be tasked
with the construction of Google's larger
Nexus tablet we
to see huawei go all in on the hardware
front and produce a well-balanced
powerhouse hopefully the company's new
handset will draw inspiration from its
top shelf p8 which features an excellent
metal body and one of the better cameras
that we've seen in a smartphone in quite
a while even though the ph octa-core
hisilicon processor holds up pretty well
we'd like to see Huawei's king-sized
handset ship with a more prominent chip
in tow for now it's hard to say what the
new hallway Nexus will look like but a
recent leak suggests that it could have
an all metal design with front facing
speakers and a rear-mounted fingerprint
scanner looking at the typical pricing
of hallways previous devices it's very
possible that the huawei nexus could
bring us a premium experience at a
pricing that is at least a little more
aggressive in what we saw with the
motorola nexus 6 thus giving us the best
of both worlds when it comes down to it
LG's biggest challenge will be producing
a handset that feels like more than just
a shrunken g4 running vanilla Android
and as for a huawei steam its biggest
challenge will likely be dealing with
skeptics who want a phone from a more
popular manufacturer like Samsung HTC or
Sony and both companies will have to
launch their devices with competitive
price points in order to be successful
now when the original Nexus 5 came out I
called it flagship power without the
flagship price and that was true and I
hope it's true with the new Nexus
devices coming out but I believe that if
the Nexus brain is going to mean
something they need to go back to the
original intention and that intention
was to demonstrate to other
manufacturers what is possible with an
android-powered device you see the
original Nexus 5 wasn't just elegant and
sleek and cheap it was fast it
demonstrated what a slimmed down version
of Android could do so what meaningful
push what meaningful innovation can
these new Nexus devices bring to really
push the envelope let me know in the
comments below and no I've not forgotten

did want to clear up a detail from a
couple of days ago surrounding the
samsung galaxy note5 i said in the show
that there would be no 128 gigabyte
version and that is true many people in
the comments were commenting that know
there was going to be a 128 gigabyte
version and they were citing samsung
itself but that was a mistake on
samsung's part and they later retracted
it there will be a 32 and 64 gigabyte
version for the note 5 not 128 according
to samsung itself alright thanks guys
