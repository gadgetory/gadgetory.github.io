primarily because I've been watching or
rather binge watching a couple shows on
Netflix and playing quite a few games
from the Play Store to catch up on my
android gaming but what makes it so
enjoyable this weekend is what I have
been using in order to perform all those
tasks and I'm here to show you my first
impressions on it hey it's Josh regards
manager or authority what's going on
everybody and here are my first
impressions on the Nvidia shield tablet
now first things first I do have a bit
of a disclaimer for you yes there is a
shield wireless controller that you more
or less are supposed to use with this
tablet as it is perfectly optimized for
the PC games that you might be streaming
to here as well as plenty of the games
that are available in the Tegra Store
for your gaming pleasure unfortunately
we don't have our hands on that
particular controller yet primarily
because it is backordered or otherwise
sold out across the internets and we
have to wait for it to be available
before we can get our hands on it but we
are working on that and I will have a
follow-up on the controller itself and
the experience of gaming on this tablet
when using it in the future
unboxing the tablet was pretty much a
basic affair you pretty much just open
the box itself there's the tablet and
underneath you have a charger a USB
cable and one booklets you don't really
get a whole lot in here unless you do
get the bundle that comes with the
controller which does come in a separate
box but nonetheless you have the tablet
right here as far as Hardware goes it is
a very good-looking tablet to be honest
I do love minimalistic designs and this
one takes from a little bit of
inspiration from the Nexus 7 primarily
looking at the shield logo on the back
because it is in landscape mode and I
really think this is a wonderful look
with the soft touch plastic on the back
that does get a little bit smudged but
it's not that unattractive when it is a
little bit dirty thankfully when
compared to glossy plastic as far as the
weight of the actual device goes there
is definitely some heft to this tablet
you have a sizable bezel around the
screen it's not that unattractive we
would definitely prefer smaller bezels
all around but it's not necessarily that
big of a deal especially when you
consider that there are front-facing
speakers on there for a good audio
experience and as far
speakers go you have speakers coming out
the wazoo on this thing you have the
front-facing speakers then you have ones
on the sides and then you even have a
couple of holes on the bottom that allow
for some of the sound leaking to come
out also to really provide for a
immersive experience a stylus is
actually available as well on here and
the stylus is a bit of a peculiar thing
because while it is nestled nicely on
the top right of the tablet when you
take it out you'll notice that the tip
is not just a rounded tip it has a bit
of a brush designed to it that does make
it quite pleasant to use it's a little
bit different from other styluses out
there but the reason why that brush is
there is if you're going to use the
Nvidia dabbler application that will
allow you to draw on the fly but the
stylus for the most part works about a
standard as you would expect it and it
is pretty comfortable in the hand along
that same area where you have the stylus
is the button layouts with the power
button and the volume rockers I do feel
that they are a little bit squishy but
they do get the job done and right next
to those buttons is a micro SD card slot
to bolster the at least 16 gigabytes of
capacity that I have on this version of
the tablets once you power on the
display though you'll see that it's
mostly a standard affair the display is
an 8 inch 1080p full HD display that
does pretty decent color reproduction
but all in all there isn't really
anything particularly special about it
but it's when you get underneath the
surface of that display that you find
what those defining features are after
all the Nvidia shield tablet is the
follow up to last year's Nvidia shield
which gave you a new way of playing
Android games with a peripheral that had
a controller built in but this time they
brought it to a tablet form factor which
I think does make a lot more sense for
plenty of Android users out there
I've already had trying to pre-installed
on here it comes pre-installed on the
Nvidia shield tablet but then after that
I've already installed a bunch of games
and the ones that I've played already up
until now other than trying to our
Riptide gp2 and I did fire up GTA san
andreas already for a little bit of fun
I also will have dead trigger 2 anomaly
2 and GTR racing 2 available and I'm
going to be using those as a basis for a
couple of videos so you can see the
performance on this tablet up until I do
my full review
I have had no issues with slowed down
especially when gaming by getting
through the stock Android build of
KitKat 4.4.2 one here has been a breeze
as well the Tegra k1 is really doing its
job quite well thus far and I have had
no issues really getting the native
applications and games to run smoothly
on it
game streaming is something we're going
to take a look at a little bit later on
especially after we get that controller
because it is what is needed in order
for a fully optimized experience when
streaming games from your in my case a
laptop or from your desktop computer
that has an Nvidia card built-in but
other than that I have also watched
quite a few episodes of orange is the
new black in particular great show and
of course it's on Netflix I actually
didn't feel like I wanted to turn off
the tabla and just watch the show on a
TV with a louder speaker on there either
because the speaker setup on here did a
good job of keeping the immersed into
the media I really felt like once I got
into the episodes I had no reason I
could find no reason to really turn it
off and look for a different way of
watching those episodes I was able to go
through about a quarter of a season
already
and yes the battery life did get done
pretty low at that point but my full
battery life testing will of course be
saved for my full review so I want you
to keep it tuned to Android authority
for the future coverage of this the
Nvidia shield tablet including maybe one
or two videos of me just playing games
on it we will do some benchmarks which
you will be able to see in the full
review and also on Android authority
comm but until the full review make sure
you stay tuned he refer to the other
videos and for also videos from my
colleagues in Android Joe Jace Kevin the
tech ninja and of course lon and from
there you can also subscribe to our
channel if you haven't already and to
drop us likes in our videos because we'd
love to see thumbs up on every video
from there once you're done head on over
to Android Authority calm for even more
in-depth coverage because we are your
source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
