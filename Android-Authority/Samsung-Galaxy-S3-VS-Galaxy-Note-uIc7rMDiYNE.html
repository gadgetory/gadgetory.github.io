Authority calm and in front of me is the
Samsung Galaxy s3 and the Samsung Galaxy
Note one of the things that people asked
me after reviewing the s3 is that which
divides better to s3 or did not well
honestly speaking I feel that that
question is pretty much a question of
preference which device will you prefer
will you prefer the latest from samsung
or if you are busting who uses the
stylus a lot you should probably
consider the note and it is popping on a
secret that by the end of the year
probably by the third quarter they would
probably very likely be a no 2 so at
this point of time these two devices are
pretty much the cream of the crop if you
could say that from Samsung so in front
of me as you can see the notes in the
Chrome browser I'm currently using the
Chrome browser on 4.0 on the not as well
as Chrome browser on the s3 as you can
see is a bit laggy if you could stay on
the not while the s3 is just super small
so let's just do a trial run loading the
web page of Andhra Authority
what lost equally fast and that should
be because both devices are pretty much
multi course the tree is a track called
the node is a dual core but in terms of
fluidity it's something that denote
hasn't really got it's not as smooth as
the Astra
they can see that even from the screen
that the tree is sharper than D not so
I'm mostly speaking it depends on which
device that you prefer as you can see is
fully loaded on both pages and it's
still very laggy on the galaxy note
that's understandable mainly because of
the bigger resolution but on the Astra
is smooth is fluid
unlike D note
even even the notes struggle a bit in
terms of the browser but let's just look
at the gallery this was actually a photo
that I took earlier and you can compare
the difference the node would
practically give you a bigger picture
but in terms of camera quality is pretty
much the same so in terms of the
daylight camera shooting this which is a
smoked character while this one has more
clarity but honestly speaking I think
they don't really die further than much
except for the ash tree it has a low
light sensor
if one were to compare both devices on
performance basis the ash tree would
definitely win and if we were to do a
quadrant benchmark right here right now
without a doubt the tree will win but
the question is by how much as you can
see already the answer is steaming ahead
to us the goal of the node is struggling
with this to cost but honestly speaking
it don't really that much of a
difference in terms of real-life
performance everything on the ash tree
is fluid body not this acceptable so on
this basis alone it's safe to say that
in terms of a day to day device both
devices work fantastic they not would
give you the edge with a bigger screen
and stylus but in terms of gaming and
quad core performance the s3 would
definitely win from here you can see the
quadrants chorus 5360 tree while the
notches call about three thousand five
and his cost 3192 wishes pretty much the
standard not just course so is it is a
clear cut that ds3 is a better performer
while the node is perhaps more feature
pang with the stylus it is probably has
more potential it can do more things
with the stylus which ds3 cannot if we
were to compare in terms of video
capabilities it's pretty much the same
of this switch of the music for this too
and I'll just put them side-by-side for
you to have and look at them
as you can see they're both equally shut
the display of both devices are
emmalin's and all honestly speaking they
aren't that much difference between the
two screens the ds3 is slightly brighter
but in terms of videos I don't see how
one would want to compare it instead one
device is superior mainly because both
of them are equally good an equally
clear high definition so it's a matter
of preference what screen size do you
actually want and need so thus this
clear really really short look at the
two devices as you can see the notes on
4.0 is rather fast
however the s3 is still smoother again
it's not matter of performance but
preference in this matter so that's
about it I'm gonna show you have a nice
thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
