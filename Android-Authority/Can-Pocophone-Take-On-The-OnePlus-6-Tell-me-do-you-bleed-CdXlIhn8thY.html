past on this channel but I feel as
though this one is a real grudge match
the Paco phone f1 vs the one plus six
what makes this such an epic showdown is
that in many ways paco phone is
positioned to steal a crown that's
belonged to one plus for a long time
one plus has always been the OEM you
turn to when you're looking for flagship
specs at a mid-range price over time
though one pluses handsets have
gradually seen a bit of price creep to
the point where they're starting to
price themselves out of budget for a lot
of their initial audience which makes
space for the paco phone f1 a device
that's been getting a lot of attention
recently thanks to just how much it can
offer for such a low price
so the oneplus 6 exemplifies the
company's trend towards nicer but
pricier devices is an excellent phone
with a beautiful build quality running
on top and specs thanks to a snapdragon
845 up to 8 gigabytes of RAM and up to
256 gigabytes of storage it has a large
6.2 8 inch AMOLED display with an 83.8%
screen to body ratio and an excellent
1080 by to 280 P resolution there's a
dual lens 16 megapixel camera and a 16
megapixel selfie camera around the front
plus a 3300 milliamp hour battery but it
all costs $529 for the base model enter
the Paco phone f1 despite the really
weird name this is a device that boasts
the same key specs the Snapdragon 845 up
to 8 gigabytes of RAM and up to 256
gigabytes of storage the screen is
slightly less impressive although it's
similar in size and resolution is an IPS
LCD display rather than AMOLED the
primary camera is also a slight
downgrade of the 12 megapixel dual lens
but that said the front-facing camera is
actually decent step up at 20 megapixels
it also has a larger 4,000 milliamp hour
battery stereo speakers splash resistant
and lightning-fast infrared face
recognition it's packaged in a slightly
cheaper feeling plastic body compared to
one plus 6 is glass and aluminium frame
but it doesn't look bad by any means and
especially if you opt for the Kevlar
backed version instead and what makes
all of this really impressive is the
fact that you get all of that for
about $300 the price varies depending on
where you look so for over $200 less you
get the same performance and a bigger
battery the trade-off is the build and
the slightly lower megapixel camera but
if you don't care about that it's a
no-brainer right well not quite in terms
of what these devices are like to
actually use there's really very little
difference between the two
they both blaze through apps and games
and have ample specs for any task you
can throw at them in the camera
department they're also similar their
cameras are absolutely reflective of
their decent and mid-range status they
both do surprisingly well for their
price but they fall short of the
greatness we see on galaxy's pixels or
Apple devices but then there are few
other considerations that might give you
pause for thought one of these is the
software both are on Android 8.1 Oreo
but the oneplus is running oxygen OS on
top whereas the POC I phone has me UI
both are just fine me UI is actually
pretty uninvaded for the most part and
may even have some features that you
like but a lot of people will choose one
plus for its stock Android light
experience this is something that a lot
of people look for and it may just be
the clincher for some and that
differentiator becomes all the more
important when you consider that Xiaomi
has recently begun the shady practice of
speaking ads into their software uses a
noticing ads appear on pre-installed
apps as well as in the settings menu and
more apparently this is to offset the
price and they're very subtle I haven't
seen this happen once yet myself but the
fact that Xiaomi would do this without
warning on the device that you paid for
in good faith is pretty uncool I can't
imagine oneplus pulling a stunt like
that there's also the slight issue of
streaming that you may have heard of the
Paco Phone f1 doesn't have Widevine l1
which means that you can't stream HD
videos from Netflix BBC Amazon etc and
it will instead be capped at 5:40 P you
can see the difference but whether
that's an issue for you will depend on
how much you use those services so with
all that said which is the better phone
well that would have to be the 1 plus 6
this is a nicer device to use with fewer
compromises and a fantastic build
quality and no ads which is the better
value though that would have to be the
Paco Phone f1 because I'm honestly not
sure that all those extras you get with
the Wampler
are worth over $200 words like flagship
mid-range and budget are thrown around a
lot to the point that they've lost
pretty much all their meaning rather
than putting everything into neat little
categories it's better to think of this
as a spectrum with cheap disposable
phones at one end and premium luxury
devices at the other better yet think of
it like a buffet we can pick and choose
the specs and features that matter to
you and mix and match to create your own
perfect device there's enough option out
there now
that this is possible often it's not
actually the raw specs that create the
perfect Android experience the devil is
in the details details like video
playback or splash resistance and those
details are unique to every user the
oneplus 6 simply sits a little further
along the spectrum and has a few more
tasty morsels on its plate the poco
phone f1 is a little better value but if
you have the budget for the oneplus 6
then you will be able to feel that extra
expense hope you found this video useful
interesting guys if you did then please
