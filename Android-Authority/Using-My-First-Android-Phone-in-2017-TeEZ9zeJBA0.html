the very first Android phone that I ever
owned and see if I could still use it in
2017 this was a bad idea
the very first Android phone that I ever
owned and actually the very first
smartphone that I ever owned was the
mytouch 3G slide if you don't remember
the microsflyn of phones was a t-mobile
exclusive and this version was called a
slide because they had a full slide out
physical QWERTY keyboard which we really
don't see on smartphones anymore but
this was a pretty common form factor
back in 2010 when this phone was
released I've been using this phone for
several days now as my daily driver and
I'll admit there were some feelings of
nostalgia to going back and using my
very first Android phone but those
feelings quickly wore off after using it
for just a few hours before you can
start using a phone you have to pop in
your SIM card obviously but most if not
all phones now use nano SIM cards but
back in 2010 phones were still using
full-size Sims so in order for me to
even be able to use this phone I had to
plug my nano sim into a micro sim
adapter and then plug that into a full
sized sim adapter going back to an
Android phone that is seven years old
makes you really appreciate how far
Android phones have come and as you
would expect this phone has definitely
shown its age in pretty much every way
as far as the phone's design it's really
thick and chunky because of the keyboard
but the overall footprint of the 3G
slide is really small you could
comfortably reach every inch of the
screen with just your thumb and the
entire phone practically fits in the
palm of your hand
that's not something you could say about
most Android phones anymore back when I
originally owned this phone I thoroughly
enjoy using the keyboard and while I
prefer on-screen keyboards now it didn't
take me that long to readjust using it
again it wasn't the most spacious
physical keyboard but it was still
fairly easy to use the keys are nicely
spaced out there's a good amount of
travel to them and it's also backlit
which made it pretty easy to use in the
dark the phone is entirely made of
plastic which wasn't that big of a deal
because back in 2010 plastic phones were
a lot more common but in 2017 it feels
pretty cheap compared to phones made of
glass
or metal there's really no point in
talking about specs because they're all
very outdated but if you must know it
had a blazing fast 600 megahertz
processor half a gigabyte of RAM and a
whopping half a gigabyte of internal
storage it also has a micro SD card slot
but it only supports up to a maximum of
16 gigabytes with only half a gigabyte
of storage I was only able to install a
few app and one game before receiving a
warning that my phone was low on memory
so having a microSD card was basically a
must on this phone for it to even be
remotely usable when this phone came out
it was actually considered a mid-range
phone and anything that was a flagship
at the time typically had a 1 gigahertz
processor a 600 megahertz processor
sounds pretty laughable at this point
but the definition of what is a
mid-range phone in 2017 is very
different from what it was seven years
ago
the performance on this thing is
extremely laggy it drops frames
constantly apps or slow to load and you
can pretty much forget about playing
games on this phone it's so choppy that
it's virtually unplayable another part
of this phone that has not aged well is
the screen it has a three point four
inch display that's extremely low
resolution so it's pretty easy to see
pixels and there's a very noticeable air
gap between the glass and the actual
display itself it's running a very old
version of Android with Android 2.2
Froyo and before I could even download
any apps on it I had to manually update
the Android Market to Google Play it
almost wasn't worth the effort to be
honest because the app selection is very
limited and the versions of the app that
you can download are all very old which
isn't all that surprising this phone
also shipped with HTC Sense it was
slightly modified for the mytouch line
of phones but it was mostly the same
experience that you got on other HTC
phones at the time like the Evo 4G or
the Thunderbolt this phone also predated
the selfie era so there was no
front-facing camera and if you wanted to
take a selfie you had to do it the
old-school way and flip the phone around
and use the five megapixel rear camera
compared to current Android phones the
camera on the 3G slide just doesn't hold
up it's slow and clunky and the quality
is pretty bad but it did come with a
physical shutter button which is
something else we also don't see a lot
on Android phones anymore a couple other
things that this phone has that have
gone the way of the dinosaurs or are
heading that way is a headphone jack
removable battery and it even had a
trackpad but because this phone is so
old it lacks more current technologies
like wireless charging fast charging a
fingerprint sensor or water resistance
the big question I want to answer here
is is this phone usable in 2017 and the
technical answer is yes it's totally
usable as a phone but because this phone
is so outdated it made it really tough
to use as a daily driver I still had to
carry around another Android phone
simply because this phone can't do
everything I need my phone to do I could
deal with the sluggish performance I
could deal with the lack of
functionality due to the much older
version of Android but what it really
came down to what's the app selection
most of the apps that I use and depend
on nowadays like slack for communicating
with my colleagues Philips hue and lifx
apps for controlling all the smart
lights in my home and many other apps
and games just aren't compatible with
the 3G slide it's almost as bad as using
a flip phone as a daily driver you can
certainly get by with it but with my
life revolving around staying connected
and getting work done on my phone it's
no longer a viable solution but what is

you still use it in 2017 let us know
