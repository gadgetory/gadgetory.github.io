has even been called one of the best
phones of the year
so this Android user wanted to know what
all the fuss was about
with this Windows Phone hey distress
regard from Android 30 what's going on
everybody and this is the Nokia Lumia
928 do you remember back in the day when
Nokia phones were considered virtually
indestructible their build quality was
second to none and nowadays we have a
lot of nostalgic jokes about it well
it's been a long time since I've even
held a Nokia phone and I have to say
Nokia still got it although this entire
device is made up of a glossy plastic it
immediately feels very sturdy in the
hand there's a very high build quality
here that is alluded to by the rigid
corners and almost completely flat
profile it's not a heavy phone by any
means but it does have a certain heft
and because of the four and a half inch
screen it is quite easy to handle in
just one hand
the front is made up of that screen
front facing camera and the capacitive
keys at the bottom coming around the
back as a white body with just one black
slit down the middle this is the carl
zeiss powered camera next to the xenon
flash and the speaker grille is on the
bottom the microUSB port and SIM card
slot are located up top while all of the
buttons are on the right these are from
top to bottom the volume rockers power
button and finally the two-stage
dedicated camera button all together
this is a pretty thick device which
helps with the handling though all in
all it's an attractive device that is as
nice in the hand as it is on the eyes
okay quick story while I probably won't
be doing a dedicated drop test for the
Lumia 928 I will say that this device
has actually been dropped unfortunately
it was from a table heights it did land
on concrete and it landed on the two
corners right here but I'm happy to say
that all those jokes you make about
Nokia phones do actually hold up because
instead of any real damage happening to
the phone you only got a couple of
scratches on the actual corners
sometimes when you drop a phone on its
corner the entire screen might end up
shattering but in this case it's just a
couple of scratches a couple of scuffs
that you can't even see unless you make
the effort to look so kudos to you know
kia for making a pretty sturdy phone if
you follow smartphone trends the first
difference you might notice about the
Lumia 928 is the fact that it doesn't
have a 5-inch screen while some might
have gone
used to larger screens on smartphones by
now the lack of one really shouldn't
take away from the Lumia this is because
the screen on the 928 is actually quite
good
coming in at 1280 by 768 resolution the
AMOLED panel of the 928 is rated at 332
PPI this means that despite being a
smaller screen you will still get grave
saturated colors and good sharpness
don't be fooled by the simplistic style
of Windows Phone 8 the screen is very
much capable of more than just primary
colors over black and white a few issues
come up though mainly the viewing angles
are decent at best even at a slight
angle you start to see a bit of a blue
hue and in broad daylight the brightness
is unfortunately not powerful enough all
things considered though the new AMOLED
display is great not just for adding
vibrancy to the OS as elements but for
almost anything else that the Lumia is
capable of Lumia 928 sports the
Snapdragon s4 plus not the pro this is
the dual-core variant of the same
processing package that clocks in at 1.5
gigahertz it might not be the fastest
processor around but it still makes the
928 fly through its elements being
backed by the audrina - 2 5 and one
gigabyte of ram gives this phone just
what it needs for multitasking and
gaming while in the Android space this
might be considered more of a mid-range
package we have to remember how much our
OS of choice sometimes requires that's
not to say that Windows Phone 8 is
overly simplistic it just doesn't demand
as much as Android or even iOS more on
that later
Nokia kept the hardware offerings of the
Lumia 928 pretty simple 32 gigabytes of
onboard memory is available without
expandability as this is a Verizon
exclusive phone you get the very fast
LTE network right at your fingertips
Wi-Fi Bluetooth and GPS are available
with NFC being in the mix for the most
part the Lumia 928 is a
what-you-see-is-what-you-get kind of
device call quality is pretty good as
the call speaker is pretty dang loud
even at three-quarter volume there was
no problem hearing the person on the
other line once that loud enough though
it could muffle out some of the details
of the call the rear mounted speaker is
also adequately loud but also lacks
richness and detail
battery life of the Lumia 928 is backed
by a 2000 milliamp hour unremovable unit
and goes for a very decent amount of
time an entire day is handled with ease
by this device though nightly charging
will still be required some of the power
saving options that are available should
be able to help you out as well and
finally we get to the two big
differentiators of the Lumia 928 the
camera and the software we'll start with
the camera the 8.7 megapixel F 2.0 rear
Carl Zeiss optics aren't just a mouthful
to say but they're actually pretty darn
good performers the app itself is
accessible primarily by pressing down on
the shutter button until it is activated
this can be done at any time even when
the phone is locked the app is pretty
standard although it does allow you to
just ISO and exposure extra modes are
only available through downloaded
add-ons or so-called lenses carl zeiss
2.0 aperture and PureView stabilization
all do their job to make the quality of
the pictures very good it is certainly
good for portrait shots
happy graduation my friends the aperture
brings depth of field while the Carl
Zeiss optics bring vibrancy and detail
finally peer view brings low-light
performance everything from broad
daylight to indoor lighting will look
pretty great while lower light shots can
definitely benefit from the xenon flash
this is a nifty little camera that makes
the best of a myriad of features added
in to ultimately create good pictures
and finally with the software as an
Android user I might find a lot to like
about a Windows Phone until I get to the
user interface was that true here yes
pretty much I will say this though there
is a lot to like about Windows Phone 8
and I give it props because I remember
what earlier versions looked like before
this unified interface he used to be
pretty bad what you get here is a black
or white background behind all elements
in a color of your choice these elements
are customizable if not very simplistic
but that is the point of Windows Phone 8
giving you just what you need in an easy
way the home screen is made up of live
tiles that are essentially your
shortcuts to any and all apps they do
more this time around in version 8
however when you resize pretty much any
tile to a larger size it displays even
more information for example the photo
tile will show you previews of your most
only taking pictures and the musics I
will show you what song is playing it's
a nice way of getting previews of what
are otherwise your notifications swipe
over to the right and you see your app
list and here is your obligatory app
ecosystem comments yes it is not as
large as Androids much like what the
BlackBerry z10 I reviewed I had trouble
getting many of the same experiences I
get from Android to translate over to
this OS and also much like in the z10
the main solution was to use the mobile
HTML versions I will say Spotify did
just recently become available for
Windows Phone though so that was nice
what I did like was the social media
integration the people app can use your
Facebook account to display a built-in
feed of your friends activities you
don't have to get the dedicated Facebook
app when this happens to do the trick
already and as for messaging you can
facebook chat straight from the
messaging app as well the biggest appeal
of Windows Phone 8 is its ability to do
the basics in a very clean functional
and unique way if you're not a big app
person the Lumia 928 is a good phone to
get because everything already baked in
is very reliable many people including
myself do like the simple color motif of
the user interface it makes smart phone
usage seem unique while remaining highly
intuitive if you like the whole
what-you-see-is-what-you-get idea with
maybe a few extra bits put in Windows
Phone is likely to make your day we end
on price the Lumia 928 is only available
on Verizon for the price of $99 on a
two-year contract otherwise it is $499
for the device outright and so there you
have it I made the notion earlier on
that Lumia 928 can be considered a
mid-range device when you look at it
inside of the Android space and with the
smaller screen and the lesser specs it
can certainly seem that way but we also
have to remember that the Windows Phone
OS is a totally different beast it is
still a fun and speedy experience that
manages to be stylish and unique this
time powered by Nokia's handset and just
the right specs to give it the power
that it needs so how does it stack up
well let you come as no surprise that
the Windows Phone ecosystem still has a
long way to go and it's going to be
quite some time before I can rival
Android and iOS
but to be honest it is nice to use
something unique and from time to time
it is nice to use something a bit
different and the Nokia Lumia 928 is a
great example of what else is out there
