smartphone photography and it starts
with this the HTC Desire eye aah Josh
regard from Android authority what's
going on everybody and here is your
first look at the new HTC Desire eye
despite bearing the designer name the
HTC Desire eye actually has quite a few
flagship tendencies you can ready see
the boom sound speakers up front which
will provide that signature HTC sound
and underneath is the Snapdragon 801 for
all the power you need for HTC Sense to
run smoothly here on the side you're
going to see this two-tone unibody
coloring that actually includes a
dedicated camera button so you can
really see that HTC is trying to up the
ante when it comes to smartphone
photography as far as the look goes this
two-tone unibody is actually also
waterproof which is a big deal because
you'll be able to do a lot with this
phone and it will come back wanting more
even if it takes a dive upon drawer
spill here on the back we have the
plastic and it does slip around quite
well in the hand and also gets a little
bit smudgy but as far as the looks and
aesthetics go this is pretty much one of
the trendiest phones that HTC has put
out and it doesn't feel that bad in the
hand with a 5.2 inch screen that is
still not too hard to maneuver with one
hand but we're going to go ahead and get
into the camera portion the rear-facing
camera is a 13 megapixel shooter with a
F 2.0 aperture and 28 millimeters in its
focal length but the real story here is
the fact that on the front it is
actually a very similar package it also
comes in at 13 megapixels but this time
has an F 2.2 aperture and a 22
millimeter focal length but no matter
how you slice it having the same power
on the front as you do on the rear is a
big deal and for anybody that is looking
to up their selfie game this is going to
be a very good tool for them because you
will not only be able to get great shots
using the rear camera but you'll get the
same quality from the front camera we do
have some examples coming up in a little
bit and we'll show you how the
front-facing camera has the same
capabilities as the rear in both video
and photo the HTC eye experience which
is what the camera app will be called
brings back a lot of features from the
Desire 820 including things like the
face fusion the photo strip and live
makeup but you also now get a feature
called crop me in which
we'll basically cut you out of a photo
and then allow you to take that and put
it on to any other photos later on but
then the face detection in the camera
app has also been improved so that you
can take full advantage of the 13
megapixel front-facing camera for things
like video calls and for apps like Skype
HTC was gracious enough to send Darcy
out with the phone in order to get some
pretty incredible shots these are with
the rear facing camera with some
wonderful panoramic views of New York
City and after that he was of course
able to take some selfies and have some
fun with a couple of the modes that are
available inside of the camera in
particular the dual view that will allow
you to use both cameras simultaneously
in order to get a nice shot and finally
the selfie that I took for the purposes
of this video and so there you have it
for this first look at the HTC Desire
eye now once again we will say it does
bear the desire name but it has its
excited the way that we would be for a
flagship not only does it have the power
underneath in order for you to get
everything you need done but it is also
waterproof and then we have the camera
experience which brings a great rear
facing camera to the front and provides
a great selfie experience if you really
need it and 13 megapixels will provide
you a lot if you do so keep it tuned to
Android authority for all of the best
coverage and for our future coverage of
the HTC Desire eye we're going to put
those two cameras to good use and not
only take a look at their photo and
video capabilities but also see how they
stack up against some of the best after
all we're looking at a great package
here optically and we're going to see
how it stacks up not only to its
flagship brethren the One m8 but also to
the other smartphones in the game so
keep it tuned here drop us some likes
