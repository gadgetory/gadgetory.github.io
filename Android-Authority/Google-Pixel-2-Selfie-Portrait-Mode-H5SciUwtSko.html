Authority and today I'm joined by Joshua
Bogar who you will see later on in this
video and we already know that the pixel
2 has a very impressive rear facing
camera but it also has a really awesome
front facing camera so in today's video
we're gonna compare it to some of the
other big flag ships on the market like
the LGB 30 the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Li
1 plus 5t and the more recent honor view
10 just to see how the pixel 2 stacks up
in terms of quality and features so
we're gonna kick things off by comparing
the pixel 2 against the 1 + 5 t + LG b
30 and having had a chance to take a
look at a lot of different samples
there's a few common themes so you're
gonna notice as I cycle through these
photos for starters the pixel 2 produces
consistently sharper and more detailed
results the 5 t produces pretty decent
results but is a very distant second
place and the LG b 30 just really lags
behind both cameras when it comes to
quality a lot of that just really has to
do with LG using a much lower resolution
sensor and if you care about how your
selfies look the V 30 isn't going to be
the best choice I also like the colors
and skin tones that the pixel 2 produces
they just look more natural whereas the
5 t + v 30 tend to be more orange e or
blue depending on the lighting
conditions the pixel 2 is also the only
camera out of these three to offer a
portrait mode on its front facing camera
which I'm a pretty big fan of it isn't
perfect as you can see in this example
it didn't get my glasses quite right but
for the most part it's pretty convincing
and I like the extra level depth that it
adds to your selfies the 5 T does
however offer a beauty mode and I
usually don't care for beauty modes that
much but the 5 th beauty mode is pretty
subtle and does a pretty nice job of
hiding blemishes and imperfections
without making you look like a wax
figure switching gears now let's take a
look at how they pixel to compare to the
Galaxy Note 8 and on or view 10 hey it's
Josh of Ag arm what's going on everybody
and I thought I would chime in real
quick to just give my thoughts on a
couple of other phones as well I have
the Google pixel 2 XL going up against
the Galaxy Note 8 and then in this case
the honor of U 10 which I just did a
review
but the reason why I'm coming to you in
a video on the front-facing camera is
because you're allowed to do this that's
right this is beauty mode on the
front-facing camera now you can kind of
use a little bit of a beauty mode on
other phones as well but obviously this
one really focuses on that
so my freckles were gone I don't really
have that defining feature of my face
everything's really soft now even though
I'm under good lighting this is still a
very soft portrait and it kind of
carries over into the photos as well so
what you can see here is that these
photos are a lot softer even when the
portrait mode or even the white aperture
motor turned off of course when you turn
all of the beauty mode options to full
then things get a little bit crazy and
that's simply not the case for the
Google pixel - which provides the very
opposite end of the spectrum which is
going to be sharp photos with a lot of
detail and of course you have all of
that algorithmic processing happening as
well the front-facing camera of the
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 provides a number
of these options as well but they're not
quite as egregious probably the main
thing that it does different from the
rest is this spot light where it
actually takes your face and just makes
it brighter than the rest of the photo
even when you're in good lighting you
can have your face be incredibly lit up
these beautification options are not
available for use during video recording
but there's one thing I really like
about the front-facing camera of the
Galaxy Note 8 here you can record video
in quad HD resolution and that's pretty
awesome because you can get some higher
quality video out of the front-facing
camera for things like vlogs and be able
to shrink it down to get even more
detail and a better looking video
overall when you're bringing it down to
let's say 1080p size that's something
I've always liked about recent Galaxy
phones and it's true for the note 8 as
well of course the main difference with
the pixel two is that the pixel two
allows for a portrait mode using the
front camera but on the pixel two you
get the blurred background with a highly
detailed front subject so I think the
main consensus here if you couldn't
already tell is that the pickle 2 has a
very amazing front facing camera and it
steps ahead of the competitors I don't
think that's necessarily a bad thing
because that's only gonna push other
OEMs to put more focus on the
front-facing camera and that's going to
result in a win-win situation for
everyone but that's really it for this
video I hope you guys enjoyed it if you
