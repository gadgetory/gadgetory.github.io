available in two different sizes the
Galaxy Tab A series offers the Samsung
experience for under $300 this is Bailey
Stein with Android authority and this is
my full review of the Samsung Galaxy Tab
a 8.0 and nine point seven the
differences in design between the eight
inch model and the nine point seven inch
model of the Galaxy Tab A are minimal
with the exception of an extra speaker
and a slightly less protruding camera on
the nine point seven inch model the
tablets offer the same aesthetics the
story here consists mainly of a matte
plastic rear with a silver dis light
frame while the plastic is certainly on
the cheaper side when it comes to
overall feel both tablets resist
fingerprints well sadly there are
parting lines to be found on the sides
and the corners of each tablet being
more noticeable on the white model well
this is unlikely to bother the average
user I do feel that it is worth noting
there are two Smart Cover connectors on
the back if you'd like to add one of
Samsung's covers to the tablet well
there is no backlighting on the bottom
keys there is an ambient light sensor on
the top of the device which enables auto
brightness to the right of that there's
a 2 megapixel front facing camera both
tablets are about seven and a half
millimeters thick and weigh 313 grams
and 450 grams respectively unlike many
Android tablets Samsung has chosen to go
with a four by three aspect ratio as
opposed to them sixteen by nine ratio
this makes the tablets slightly wider
and more iPad like the eight and nine
point seven inch displays have the same
1024 by 768 resolution that leaves for
very low pixel densities of 160 PPI on
the 8 inch model and 132 PPI on the nine
point seven inch model it seems kind of
paradoxical to have a four by three
aspect ratio which is usually best for
reading you have some of the lowest
resolution displays despite the
noticeable lack of sharpness both panels
have vibrant colors and excellent
viewing angles sunlight readability
could be better but the displays are
bright enough for most indoor use cases
there is a thin black border around each
display which sort of adds to the bezel
of the device it's more noticeable on
the white model and I imagine that some
people may be bothered by this
performance on both tablets is about the
same with each model being powered by
the same quad-core Samsung processor
clocked at 1.2 gigahertz it's slower
than what I would expect at this price
point but both tablets are still more
than usable the benchmark scores are
relatively low as well especially for
the price each model includes one and a
half gigabytes of RAM which does offer a
bit a more breathing room compared to
the dreaded 1 gigabyte of RAM but not
much it's enough to play music and
browse the Internet at the same time but
it's not enough to dismiss my concern
over how future-proof the device truly
is the Galaxy Tab a tablets were able to
play most games without any issues
thanks to the Adreno 306 GPU
occasionally there are some dropped
frames but the tablets are otherwise
able to handle gaming well both tablet
support 802 11 and Wi-Fi GPS and
Bluetooth 4.0 Samsung has also announced
LTE models but it's unclear when those
models will be released if you do app
for one of the LTE models you'll get 2
gigabytes of RAM instead of one and a
half as well as 32 gigabytes of storage
as opposed to 16 thankfully you can
always expand the internal storage by
using a microSD card up to 128 gigabytes
the speakers on the Galaxy Tab A are
reasonably loud and sound pretty good
they are sight firing however which
makes them easy to block while holding
the tablet the larger nine point seven
inch model does have a slight advantage
over the eight inch model with its dual
stereo speakers however audio quality on
both devices is about the same in
real-world use cases
the five megapixel rear camera is on
both tablets produce some decent looking
images however I would still strongly
suggest to use your phone instead the
camera app offers a few different modes
as well as a few different effects with
4200 milliamp hour and six thousand
milliamp hour internal batteries
respectively the Galaxy Tab a tablets
both offer great battery life during my
battery test I used each tablet with
Wi-Fi on and brightness set to about 75%
both tablets lasted for just over 14
hours with nearly 7 hours of screen on
time on the 8 inch model and 8 hours of
screen on time on the nine point seven
inch model Samsung has included a
standard power saving mode as well as an
ultra power saving mode the standard
mode is similar to what can be found in
stock Android and the ultra power saving
mode goes beyond that by offering a
minimalistic launcher and by limiting
the number of usable apps unsurprisingly
Samsung is shipping both tablets with
TouchWiz over Android 5.0 point 2
lollipop with the exception of 6
Microsoft apps old tablets are free of
third-party apps which is pretty nice
the Microsoft apps don't really bother
me since I would have downloaded them
anyway and Microsoft is offering 100
gigabytes of free storage for two years
if you choose to use onedrive in
addition to that Samsung is offering
other incentives when you buy a Galaxy
Tab A including a three month
subscription to next issue one free
Kindle eBook every month for a year
three free audiobooks from audible and
three months of Sirius XM Radio for new
users some of the positive points for
the software experience include quicker
access to the quick toggles the ability
to edit those toggles a split up
settings view a close all apps button
and Samsung's multi window I really wish
all Android tablets had multi window and
the addition to the tab a may just be
the strongest selling point in the
software Department what does seem to be
a bit confusing to me however is the
amount of duplicate apps for example
there's two web browsing apps two
note-taking apps two email apps two app
stores and three music apps although it
may not confuse the enthusiast how is
the average user supposed to know
whether they should use music milk music
or Google Play Music in addition to that
issue I also found the
non-alphabetical organization method to
be a bit confusing and the keyboard to
be mediocre at best these aren't that
big of a deal however as you can always
download a third-party launcher or
keyboard to remedy this both models of
the Samsung Galaxy Tab A can be
purchased in either white smoky titanium
or smokey blue the Galaxy Tab a 8.0 is
available with 16 gigabytes of storage
starting at 229 for the Wi-Fi model the
nine point seven inch model is also
available with 16 gigabytes of storage
although it does carry a slightly higher
price tag of $2.99 you can purchase the
nine point seven inch model with an S
Pen for an additional $50 if that's
something that interests you for those
prices the Galaxy Tab A is a
tremendously tough sell on the positive
side of things
the tablets do have good audio quality
great battery life and a few Samsung
exclusive software features however the
low resolution display slower
performance and high price tag make it
tough to recommend the Galaxy Tab a if
you're in the market for an affordable
Android tablet you should instead look
towards Lenovo's a series the xiaomi
knee pad the Nokia n1 or even Samsung's
own Galaxy Tab s 8.4 another good option
for those on a very tight budget might
be the Nexus 7 if you don't mind buying
used the Nexus 9 or Nvidia shield are
also better options thank you for
