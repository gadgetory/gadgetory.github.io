brought to you by perf speedtest hello
again ladies and gentleman i'm joe hindi
the android a30 app guy and welcome back
to another episode of Android apps
weekly let's get right into the
headlines for this week a woman claimed
her account was hacked this last week
and is suing Google for allegedly
unauthorized in-app purchases that
apparently cost her thousands of dollars
according to court documents her account
was charged 650 times and she managed to
not notice the money missing or receive
any of the emails you always get when
you buy things from the Google Play
Store a new humble bundle is out now and
includes ten titles from ten man games
you can pay whatever you want and get
four titles you can pay the average and
get an additional four titles and for a
flat nine dollars you can get all ten
games it's a great way to get some
awesome games on the cheap and donate to
charity a new study came out to show the
quarter won numbers for both Google Play
and the Apple App Store as per the norm
Google Play has more apps and more at
downloads while iOS continues to lead an
overall revenue nothing new here but it
is the latest stat sheet and we don't
expect it to change anytime soon
some developers in Italy who called
themselves orange tech managed to port
Cortana to Android this last week there
are a lot of limitations including no
offline mode and it's only in Italian
but it's still Cortana's back-end that's
being accessed we imagine Microsoft will
shut it down eventually but it's still
fun to see in a blog post earlier this
week Adobe has officially promised to
support Android better in the future
Adobe has Android apps but their most
innovative creations remain iOS
exclusives and that is about to change
we can expect to see some progress on
this over the summer of this year for
more Android apps and games releases
headlines and updates don't forget to
check out this week's newsletter linked
in the video description below where we
round up all of the app news over the
last week if you're so inclined you can
also sign up using your email to get
this news delivered directly to your
inbox every single week ok folks let's
take a look at the applications and
games that made any big splash this week
as usual if you want to check any of
these applications or games out you can
find the links in the video description
below
Google has released the official Android
for work application obviously you'll
need to have the Android for work on the
web to make this work but it's nice to
see it available for mobile devices and
tablets the compatibility is a bit
limited but you should be able to find
all of the tools there including
contacts calendar downloads the office
suite and email it also includes the
hallmark admin
of Android for work service Li as a root
application developed by Francisco
Franco the application allows you to
identify control and shutoff processes
that may be draining your battery while
you're not using your device it's
similar to greenify but works more
efficiently to keep tasks shut off so
they don't keep your phone awake when it
shouldn't be there is a pro version that
you can access for free but you can
donate later if you want to and we
totally think you should tiny guardians
is a tower defense style game that was
released to relatively positive reviews
earlier this week like your typical
tower defense games your goal is to
guard against waves of bad guys unlike
tower defense games tiny Guardian
doesn't actually have any towers you
control guardians that must defeat all
the bad guys and you lose if your
strategy doesn't work out and all of
your Guardians die it's a unique concept
that could be a lot of fun hello is a
new application released from Facebook
that acts as a dialer application for
their facebook messenger service
Messenger has had calls for a while but
now has a dedicated interface to access
them on top of working with Facebook
service you can automatically block
calls get free calls and texts over
messenger and integration with your
phone contacts and Facebook contacts it
does work like a regular dialer with
your phone number if you need that last
up this week the long-awaited Mortal
Kombat X is here kind of the game has
made its way to the Google Play Store
but has only been soft launched in
select markets ostensibly for testing
purposes we don't know when it will roll
out to everyone but it is here and that
means it's coming for everyone very soon
Mortal Kombat X features a whole bunch
of your favorite MK characters along
with the classic tropes from the series
like fatalities it should be a lot of
fun once it's fully released thanks
again for watching the show everybody
but let's take a quick moment to talk
about some serious business perf
speedtest is a comprehensive speedtest
application that allows you to test your
web speed it does so in three tests
which includes your classic speed test
along with a browsing load test in a
YouTube streaming test you can test on a
Wi-Fi or mobile connection and even
compare your final score with other
carriers and Internet service providers
you can track history and location of
each speed test and it comes with a
pretty decent user interface it's free
to use and we'd like to thank perf
speedtest for their support of Android
apps weekly once again I'm Joe hindi the
Android authority app guy while you're
here why not subscribe to the Android
Authority YouTube channel if you're
hanging out for a minute we have a
couple of awesome videos for you to
watch right over there and they're also
