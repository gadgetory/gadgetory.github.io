authority what's going on everybody and
here we are with the brand new Nexus 6p
we're looking at the larger of the two
devices that were announced today at the
Google event and as you can see already
this is a pretty substantial device but
it actually feels pretty nice in the
hand we are looking at 5.7 inches in the
screen right here about the size of a
note 5 without going really all that
large still has a pretty nice feel to it
able to get to the left and right pretty
easily the body is of a metal
construction and it feels really nice in
the hands and be honest it doesn't look
like it's going to have too many smudges
on the back because of this really hard
material right here and of course on the
top you can see this bar that now houses
the larger camera objects and updated
camera optics as well and the
fingerprint sensor that is on the back
now it is called Nexus imprint and as
you can see on the bottom down here
we're looking at a Huawei indicator
right here that is showing us that
Huawei was at the helm of creating this
fingerprint sensor and if you use any of
the Huawei devices that have a
fingerprint sensor do you know that this
one should be pretty great now I'm not
going to be able to put a fingerprint on
here yet because their biometrics and
their codes are on here and these
devices are locked so what we can't tell
you of however is that by just pressing
your finger right here it will turn on
the device and it will be able to unlock
it just from a quick 600 milliseconds or
less time now we are going through
specifications today we are working with
the latest Snapdragon 810 on here a
quad-hd display as well bringing all of
the grades displayed experiences that
you should be expecting from the Nexus
and really I'm just enjoying just the
speed of this particular device the way
that it feels in the end it all feels
really nice here Android marshmallow
does bring a few great features to the
table here including now on tab which I
can actually show you right now and I've
been playing around with already so by
holding on the home button on any
particular portion of the phone you'll
get information and searches based upon
what you're seeing there now a lot of
the enhancements in in marshmallow
are pretty much aesthetic but now on tap
is definitely one of those very good
additions that should be useful for
everybody
Android marshmallow also includes the
ability to have your frequency apps here
at the top and also the app drawer is of
a vertical scroll which allow you to go
alphabetically using the side right here
and we think that is pretty nice
especially if you have your most used
apps here up top and the search bar is
all of course available but really just
the speed of marshmallow especially here
on the Snapdragon 810 seems to be pretty
great already already we're already
really enjoying it and if you head on
over to here we just go ahead and take a
look at the easter egg from marshmallow
and there it is three gigabytes of RAM
will give everything that's needed for
multitasking and with Android
marshmallow it should be a pretty
seamless experience and as far as the
battery underneath we look again 234 50
million power battery that also has the
USB type-c port here on the bottom for
fast charging as well which is great to
see fast charging is going to be really
needed for this if you're going to be a
power user
32 64 and 128 gigabyte storage options
are what should be available there is no
micro SD card slot unfortunately but at
least the storage actions are going to
be pretty good for the general user now
taking a look at just the app here we
all can then put this camera through its
paces and see if the camera is up to
snuff with the rest of the Android
iterations available right now we go
into the settings we will find right
there 12 point 2 megapixels is what
we're working with here at 4 by 3 ratio
going back down to 16 by 9 we'll make it
8 point 3 and for the video you do have
UHD 4k but as we mentioned already there
are some new features some added
features on here rather but we still
have some pretty familiar ones here
including the photosphere and the lens
blur and hdr+ makes a return as well so
HDR photo should be pretty easy to get
so I've been over we go to the video
mode and that new HD 4k is available as
well and slow motion is this option up
top so you can stay tuned for our full
review so we can really see if these
cameras provide the quality that we're
looking for on these brand new devices
the Nexus 6p is available in the Google
store for $499 available for pre-order
today but there are some extras that are
included with them as well including a
50 bucks of play credits but also a new
program called the Nexus protect which
will cover for 2 years of accidental and
also manufacturing coverage you can also
file a claim if your phone does get
broken or malfunctions and you will be
able to get a new phone even the next
day that will run you about 89 dollars
for the 6p in order to have this kind of
coverage we are looking forward to
seeing the rest that is available on
here at so stay tuned to enjoy 30 for
our full coverage of the Nexus 6p and
the 5x of which there should be a
hands-on video available already on our
youtube channel stay tuned for more
comparisons and the full review of this
phone because we are your source for all
things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
