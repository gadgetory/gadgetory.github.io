motorola event here in New York City and
they are announcing three new devices
today it is the Moto G seven the Moto G
seven power and the Moto G seven play
now they're all running the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 632 processor which is
definitively a mid-range processor it's
not going to compete with the 845 or the
855 that's coming out later this year
but for mid rates processor it's
actually pretty good now the main thing
that separates these three phones is
gonna be a couple of things we've got
different amounts of RAM different
amounts of battery capacity and
different amounts of storage but it's
all very small for the regular Moto G 7
we have got four gigabytes of RAM but we
have a three thousand milliamp hour
battery and we have 64 gigabytes of
storage so this is technically the best
phone out of the three but if you want
more battery you can actually move over
to the g7 power where you're going to
get a five thousand million power cell
and that's like almost double that of
the regular g7 so that's probably gonna
last at least a couple of days the
difference here is that has three
gigabytes of RAM instead of four
gigabytes of RAM so you're getting a
little less memory there but if you want
to move down even further which also
moves down in price point you've got the
g7 play which has just two gigabytes of
RAM the other major change from these
phones is that the regular g7 is going
to have that 1080p display while the
other two phones are gonna have a 720p
display but at the event they looked
pretty good I honestly don't think that
720p displays are that bad
other than that honestly these phones
are really similar they're all running
on Android 9.0 Pi
they've all got fingerprint readers and
they've all got headphone jacks so if
you want a headphone jack you're gonna
have to get one of these lower end
phones the cameras are pretty similar to
obviously on the g7 you've got a 12
megapixel camera and you have that same
thing on the power the play has a 13
megapixel camera but it's not as low
than as an f-stop so you're not gonna
get as much light so honestly the
trade-off is pretty negligible here now
the one big catch here is probably that
none of these phones have NFC and we saw
how that turned out with the oneplus 2
way back in the day people freaked out
about that I personally think it's a
very important feature motorola said
they did that to save costs which is
kind of strange so if you don't really
use NFC these might be pretty good deals
but otherwise
a little weird as for pricing and
availability you're gonna be able to get
the Moto G 7 play for $199 the Moto G 7
power for 249 dollars and the Moto G 7
for 299 dollars which is about the same
price as the Moto G 6 series was last
year all these phones will be available
in spring they didn't say exactly when
they're going to be available or what
carriers they will be available on but
there was a Verizon rep at our event so
you can probably assume it's gonna be a
Verizon especially since every other
Motorola phone has launched on Verizon
in the past alright guys so that's been
about it for these new Moto G 7 phones
if you have any questions make sure you
leave them down in the comment section
below we've also got a full article with
lots of photos lots of information so
head over to the website and ERDA 30.com
if you want all that specky detail and I
will catch you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
