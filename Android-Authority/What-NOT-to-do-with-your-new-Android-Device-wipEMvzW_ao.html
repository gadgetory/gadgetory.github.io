domain.com well if you want to tweak
your device to get the very best
performance out of it you not only need
to know what to do but what not to do
and for that I'm your huckleberry
first off you want to stop installing
apps with unnecessary permissions why
does that flashlight app need your GPS
location actually why are you even using
a flashlight app since lollipop has the
built-in functionality for it look
whenever you download an app make sure
you're only giving it the permission to
do the things that make sense for that
app some shady developers like to take
advantage of unnecessary app permissions
to harvest sellable data about its users
if you're looking for a basic doodling
app and it has 15 permissions it wants
to use you might want to find yourself
an alternative digital canvas and second
stop using a task killer task killers
were useful back in 2009 before the
Android operating system got good at
managing its own memory to render them
irrelevant most apps spring back to life
anyway even if you deliberately kill
them so you're really just wasting
battery power in addition to press the
seconds of your infinite lifespan on
planet Earth if your phone is acting
sluggish check out which apps are
hugging your resources and uninstall
them find more efficient alternatives
greenify is an alternative to task
killers that actually works it
hibernates apps rather than kills them
but you really have to have a rooted
device for it to be worth it for most
users the answer is not to kill
rebellious apps but rather to drive them
off your device for good never to return
again the third thing you don't want to
do is to expect an apple like experience
this is crucial advice for people coming
to Android from iOS on Apple the quote
everything just works is the design goal
Android is completely different and it
focuses on making your device your
device we recommend former iPhone users
pick up a Nexus device which is produced
by Google by Nexus ensures the most
streamlined apple-like experience
especially when you're using google apps
you'll also have all the Android
versatility at your fingertips to test
the waters of tinkering customizing and
personalization the fourth thing you
really don't want to do is to buy a care
you're branded phone why well they put a
lot of bloatware this is apps on your
phone that you really don't want or need
it's just promotion for them and to
their painfully slow with rolling out
new Android updates so when Google comes
out with a new version of Android and
the Nexus owner gets it in the first
week you're waiting nine to twelve
months if you're lucky and finally it's
just much more expensive you often have
to buy into a two-year contract and
you're going to spend a lot more money
on that contract and if you just bit the
bullet and bought the phone outright at
the beginning and then you can jump to
new deals as they arise so do you guys
remember from like 15 years ago when
people were making money hand over fist
in the dot-com bubble remember we didn't
call it a dotnet bubble or dot org
bubble we didn't call them dot biz
billionaires we called them dot-com
billionaires because that's the power of
a dot-com now why is that because no
domain name extension tells your story
with the same degree of trust as a
dot-com or dotnet domain name.com and
dotnet domain name extensions and jet
credibility into your online presence

web hosting when you use our coupon code

think domain names think domain.com
thanks for watching edward army my name
is Jace I'm still sick I know forgive
the voice but I wanted to say that I
still am taking domain name suggestions
via Twitter or in the comments below
Twitter's usually best because I follow
that all the time and I will announce
that at the next domain.com show alright
good stuff don't want to forget about my
brothers and sister and Android who are
working super hard to be your source for
all things Android
