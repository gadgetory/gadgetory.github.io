Android Authority what's going on
everybody and this time we're looking at
not the flagship phone from Lenovo but
the one that is just a step down the P
series in this case we have the p90 you
can see already from the look that we
still have that nice flat aesthetic all
the way around the phone and on the left
side of the screen we have the volume
rockers and the power button but
nonetheless you got this soft touch
plastic all around that feels really
nice
this flat design really makes it nice
and easy in the hand to use and I really
enjoy the way Lenovo creates their
phones with this particular aesthetic
nonetheless let's get the specifications
out of the way this one is not a
Qualcomm user this is a intel atom z3580
it is a 64-bit processor that is a
quad-core and goes up to 1.8 3 gigahertz
the screen is a 5.5 inch full HD IPS
display so you're going to get that
1080p goodness no matter what and the
super colorful operating system that
lenovo puts into their devices really
shows quite well right here including
these new translucent icons that are
available in this update this we this is
still KitKat in terms of the Android
underneath but without the app drawer
it's going to be a little bit different
but nonetheless it is still very
functional and we've had a good time
with lenovo's operating system in the
past a 13 megapixel rear camera which
we'll take a look at later is backed by
a five megapixel front camera for
self-portraits 2 gigabytes of RAM and a
four thousand milliamp hour battery is
underneath so let's take a look at some
of the interfaces here we're just going
to go through some of the elements of
the lenovo based operating system a lot
of what is down here will be very
familiar to a lot of people out there
and on this mid-range device you will
see a lot of the same lenovo features
there are quite a few gestures and
whatnot that are available here kind of
a smart mode that is available as well
but nonetheless it is a very simplistic
look at Android and this colorful
colorful background really does do a
good job of showing that this screen is
pretty nice jumping into the camera like
I said already it's a 13 megapixel
rear-facing camera that is available
with a number of different modes
obviously video modes here 1080p and you
know the ability to change quite a bit
of the
manual modes so let's take a look there
5 megapixels is on the front so we can
go and take a couple of self-portraits
now it is a fixed angle but it also is a
pretty wide angle so you'll be able to
get a few shots off let me get one right
there not a very flattering photo but
nonetheless that is the Lenovo p90 and
in this particular red version I do
think the phone looks quite nice
like I said already the flat aesthetic
is something I really enjoy from Lenovo
and it's something that I feel is a
little bit underrated in the West this
flat design that makes it feel really
nice in the hand nonetheless we're here
with Lenovo kickin it with them here at
CES 2015 so remember you stay tuned to
our channel drop us some likes and
subscribe if you haven't already because
you're going to want to we're here at
