still have a lot to go before they could
reach the same level as some of the
elites in the space the LG g5 recently
launched but it wasn't considered such a
great hit and now we have ZTE latest
device hey guys John Velasco here with
Andrew authority and this is a quick
video comparison between the ZTE axon 7
and the LG g5 the best thing about the
two is that they're made out of metal so
they do have that premium finish but
between them I'm gonna be inclined to
say that the ZTE axon 7 has the slightly
more favorable design because it has
that sturdy premium metal feel whereas
the LG g5 even though it has that
modular design it does still come off
just a little bit Hollow between the two
of them it's the ZTE axon 7 that has the
slightly larger 5.5 inch display whereas
the g5 has only 5.3 inch or they're both
quad HD so when you look at them from a
normal distance it's really hard to tell
which one's more detailed or technically
it should be the g5 but despite that we
still like the ZTE axon 7s display
because they've used an AMOLED screen so
when you look at different angles
it grew maintains its sharpness and
clarity whereas with the g5 it tends to
be subdued and kind of washed down I'm
not sure about you but I wasn't really
too thrilled with the LG g5 s experience
yes it is straight forward it's pretty
self-explanatory but it kind of scaled
back compared to the geforce experience
so for power users it isn't just as
versatile as it was before with the ZTE
axon 7 it pretty much remains faithful
to last year's customized Android
experience but most part you have some
stock like elements and the thing I do
like about is that you have a dedicated
apps panel so there are things there as
opposed to being littered throughout the
home screen at the same time - it's
pretty powerful you're going to get work
done and straightforward again like I
said either war can work for you it's
well not which visual
for better well shouldn't shock anyone
that both handsets here powered by the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip with 4
gigabytes of RAM so when it comes to
basic elementary stuff opening them apps
using the web browser they both move at
pretty much the same rate but we should
note that the ZTE axon 7 is going to
have another model that's going to have
a whopping 6 gigabytes of RAM which is
going to be useful when it comes to
doing some heavy processing stuff
especially things like VR we know
exactly how the LG g5 s camera performs
you have that 60 ml pixel dual camera
setup with an F 1.8 aperture lens and it
does take those wide-angle snapshots and
videos you're not going to get that with
the ZTE axon 7 because now it's only
sporting a single camera in the rear
it's a 20 megapixel one with an F 1.8
aperture lens you also have a sapphire
lens over that to protect everything so
even though you're not going to get that
post bokeh fact that the camera and last
year's model was able to do you can
still achieve the same thing in a
relatively quick time thanks to the fast
processor it has but we're really
curious to see how well performs under
low-light the LG g5 has been out for a
little bit of time now and some people
will say it's still kind of
underwhelming despite the fact they've
gone with this totally new and
intriguing modular design so for the ztx
on7 it's really going to need to bring
the goods to actually win over the
hearts and minds of consumers well we
did check out some other things with the
phone like its dolby atmos speaker
experience it does really sound
incredibly powerful through the handset
and has almost like that 360-degree
field and thankfully this year's model 2
is going to feature a built-in radio
that's going to support all four major
networks here in the US so in addition
to t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T support you're now
going to get Verizon and Sprint which is
great for this handset that's going to
be sold unlocked now they didn't specify
the pricing of the ZTE axon 7 yet but
all indications point to somewhere
relatively close to lasher's model if
not
lower than the LG g5 so that should have
a little bit advantage for it
so if you guys want to learn more about
either a handset you could check out our
