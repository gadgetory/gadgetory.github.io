officially over and as we are all
recovering from the show itself we want
to look back at some of our top picks
and awards that we gave out to 10 items
at CES 2015 if you really want to
enhance your Android audio experience
than these two speakers just might be
the ones you're looking for following up
on the great UE boom is Logitech's ue
mega boom the larger version that now
has a Bluetooth connectivity range of
100 feet a larger battery that allows
for playback of up to 20 hours and
overall it's a larger more powerful
speaker but right next to it is the foo
go XL now this is the much larger
version of their ruggedized go anywhere
series and the tough excel is the most
rugged of the lot said to me nearly
indestructible and these bluetooth
speakers come with the ip67
certification and as far as its audio
quality goes six different acoustic
drivers will drive all of the audio to
your ears making this an experience that
might be unparalleled in the bluetooth
speaker space our third pick on the list
might not be a real mobile Android
experience but it is one that will
enhance your television experience with
Android TV users now have access to
movies TV shows games and music all
through google play and now on Sonia's
bravia tvs android TV comes a standard
we focused mostly on the 4k model during
our CES coverage but what truly makes
Sony's Android TVs partnership ex
significant is that it applies to all of
their smart TVs from here on out Sony's
commitment to Google's TV platform is a
huge boost for Android TV and Sony is a
great place to start now one of the more
interesting developments at CES 2015
came from a brand you may not know very
well Sega's with their v2 now looking at
the front facing speakers and a very
nice display is only hitting the tip of
the iceberg when you consider a 21
megapixel rear facing camera a 13
megapixel front facing camera and a
fingerprint scanner all in a premium
looking Kevlar and metal body yes the
marquee feature of the Sega's v2
actually is it storage capabilities with
64 gigabytes of on-board storage
enhanced by two
128 gigabyte microSD card slots for a
total of potentially 320 gigabytes
underneath this is a phone that
basically pads every single thing you
would want in a phone and if you are
looking for the absolute most in your
smartphone to Sega's v2 just might be
the one you're looking for the fifth
pick on this list of 10 goes to the
yotaphone to yes this is a phone that
came out a couple of months ago but
Yoda's presence at CES 2015 was a great
way for the company to showcase the
unique phone to the US market on which
it will be coming as we have been told
pretty soon this year the other phone to
pax great hardware of course but the big
story if the smartphone is the e-ink
display that's found on the back with a
slew of software features like the Yoda
mirror and the Yoda snap you'll be able
to take advantage of the rear of the
screen and be able to have a very
different tape when addressing a common
issue with most current smartphone's
battery life this device may not feature
the latest and greatest in terms of
specifications but the rear display is
far from just a gimmick as it has
already been proven not only in the
first version of the ODA phone but in
this second one that we have already
given a pretty great review of here at
Android authority as we've seen recently
with TVs watches and now automobiles
Android is not just limited to
smartphones and tablets and if you want
to take your Android experience to a
much larger scale than probably what
you're looking for is the ZTE s pro to a
projector that is also a 4G LTE hotspot
device and brings all of the
capabilities of Android this pico
projector is capable of outputting a
720p image of up to 120 inches in size
with a brightness of 200 lumens and
those might be enough already for a
projector to be very great but we also
have autofocus and auto key stoning
which is a very big deal for any
projector USB 3.0 and HDMI connections
with audio on the back allow you to
connect anything you need to this
projector don't forget that 5-inch
screen up front that will allow you to
control everything via a full android
iteration this is the kind of device
that puts everything you need into one
place and you can think of a lot of
different situations to be able to use a
smart projector much like this which is
why the s pro 2 gets one of our picks of
CES 2015 while HTC may not have broken
the mold under desire line at CES 2015
the newest iteration the
26 looks to be a way for them to show
that they've learned some lessons from
the previous the desire I day 26 might
follow a similar design and the desire
family but one of the best parts about
this phone is that the front-facing
camera now takes on the well-regarded
ultrapixel cameras for low-light
performance and better self portraits
now you can already see on the front
that the camera is a little bit larger
and that is one of the main additions
when it comes to the desire online
nonetheless everything underneath is
still a nice performing phone and with
good economics despite its slightly
larger screen we give the desired hit 26
a top pick of CES 2015 because it is a
continuation of a line that we do enjoy
from HTC last year's CES could have been
considered the stomping ground for a
sous given the releases of their three
different versions of the zenfone but
now they're back with the zenfone 2 the
first generation line already put a
great phone in people's hands for a very
max price point but that continues this
year with the zenfone 2 it's
ergonomically curve design and slim
edges has a pricing of 199 and there is
a model available for a little bit more
money that comes with a massive 4
gigabytes of RAM which is a first in the
Android industry the bottom line is that
the zenfone 2 takes everything we liked
about the original zenfone series and
upgrades it with an improved
intel-powered internals and overall
better design aggressive pricing is what
really sells this series but we still
don't know exactly how much the
higher-end for gigabyte variant will set
consumers back nonetheless the two
gigabyte model at 199 is still something
that is very compelling for many users
our last two pics of CES 2015 kind of go
together which is why we are using the
phone to showcase the processing package
which takes the ninth spot the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 810 the latest in the
Snapdragon 800 series brings a move to
64-bit processing a step up in
performance and to the adrenal 430 which
is sure to be a gamers dream but we want
to be able to tell you about this time
dragon 810 in the flesh if we didn't get
a look at our top pick number 10 on this
list the LG G flex 2 the new version of
the g flex brings that curved display
back into the fray with some
enhancements across the board but not
one of them was as surprising as seeing
the Snapdragon 810 up on that list
the subject in a tent makes this one of
the most powerful phones and LG's can
possibly in the Android space at the
moment but with a great 5.5 inch screen
that makes the ergonomics even better
now enhanced self-healing on the back
stronger screen on the front and all of
the capabilities underneath the LG G
flex 2 looks to be the unique but still
very powerful and useful phone that you
might have been waiting for and it
certainly feels like it's going to be a
daily driver for some of us here at
