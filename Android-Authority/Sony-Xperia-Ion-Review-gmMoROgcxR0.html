clayton young we're coming at you from
your one and only source for all things
android android authority calm today
we've got an in-depth review of the sony
xperia ion this is a fairly new device
and it's rocking some nice hardware it's
got the acceptable android software its
rocking 2.3 so it's a little bit behind
the times in that area it's a great
phone on this phone we're rocking a
dual-core 1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon s3
processor we've got a 12 megapixel
camera in the rear with an LED flash on
the front we've got ourselves a 1.3
megapixel camera capable of 720p video
capture now the display is also a
beautiful 4.6 inch 720p HD Reality
Display and we also have these software
layer the sony Mobile BRAVIA Engine
that's going to help us watch videos
play games and view pictures with great
clarity and quality so anyways as you
can see we have our nice lock screen
this is running the timescape UI which
is manufactured well by Sony and it's
it's a nice overlay over the android
gingerbread operating system it's not
too obtrusive as i always like to judge
the overlays by i don't like them too
gaudy and I like the usability of
Android anyways this is our nice
lockscreen we can slide right to unlock
or we can choose our sound profiles by
sliding left go ahead and slide right
you see this is our nice home screen the
timescape UI is a little breath of fresh
air from the usual like TouchWiz or
sense you eyes and stuff like that and I
actually like it a lot so anyways we do
have our usual Android apps here in the
app tray this does come with some nice
AT&amp;amp;T apps because this is the AT&amp;amp;T phone
it is available from ninety dollars of
their network so we do have our AT&amp;amp;T
bloatware as I'd call it but we also
have some nice Sony apps some native
apps to Sony such as the livewire
manager we also have the office suite
coming in on this device we have the
sony music unlimited service which is
actually going to battle the Samsung
Music Hub service which we will have a
video for when the tentative release
date is upcoming we have our power saver
features um this game is great with
the spiderman game with a lot of like
graphic intensive games the Snapdragon
s3 processor just blaze's through a lot
of stuff it's very fast this is our
timescape now the timescape is a social
integration client so all your social
networks are just integrated right into
your phone we'll go ahead and go into
our settings to show you the menus on
the xperia ion now all of the themes are
changeable we can change whether or not
we want them green or turquoise or
whatnot in the background so we'll start
with our Xperia settings here under the
experience settings we have our
connectivity options on the Facebook
inside Xperia is part of the timescape
feature then we have our livewire
manager so I did integrate my Facebook
and my Twitter so we'll check that out
here in a minute we do under our
wireless network settings have NFC
options despite die Android Gingerbread
running on this we also have the Wi-Fi
all the usual connectivity options such
as a you know Bluetooth VPN settings
tethering mark all settings sound and
display under the display is where we
choose our brightness now the brightness
has no auto brightness feature as of now
we kind of just have to use our own
judgement as far as what brightness we
want we can turn on our mobile bravia
engine from here which enhances games
videos and photos but they actually look
great we'll go ahead and do some demos
here in a minute as well we have our
accounts and sync the privacy the usual
Android Gingerbread menu options we can
go into about phone super rockin two
point three point seven we just have our
software updates from here this did
receive a software update while I had it
but it's not going to update to ICS
extremely soon it is slated and I hope
jellybean is slated as well now on that
topic there's not strong developer
support for xperia phones and Sony
phones in general they're pretty lot
they're locked down pretty tight so we
don't have a lot of rums and stuff
coming out for this phone yet or even a
root method but anyways this is one of
our nice Timescape widgets you see that
we have all of our nice twitter feed and
our Facebook just aggregated into one
source right here we can scroll up and
down nice user interface runs really
fast and smooth and it's great we will
go ahead and you can change the
wallpaper add widgets create folders
shortcuts and themes just with a long
press
on the home screen we'll go ahead and go
into the theme settings here which is
really nice we have our turquoise theme
emerald ATT gold ruby just a bunch of
cool themes I'll leave it here on the
emerald so click that now you can also
create folders on the gingerbread add
widgets the widgets are there's a lot of
cool ones included those clocks AT&amp;amp;T
widgets and then the Native timescape
widgets with nice skins on them as you
can see our power manager up here has
some nice looks to it anyways pulling
down the notification bar of course
being Android Gingerbread we don't have
the functionality of being able to grab
and swipe away to kill apps but we can
clear simply by pressing be clear now
under the messaging we'll go ahead and
check out our keyboard some random crap
there but our keyboards very nice
actually liked it a lot it's great for a
stock keyboard we do have predictions
and suggestions up here and then it
works smoothly then we have our settings
android keyboard settings and stuff like
that so the keyboard works great we'll
go ahead and test out some HD video
right now I'm not logged into anything
but we will type in HD video 1080p just
go ahead and click this I'll show you
the nice bravia engine on the Sony
Xperia ion whenever we're watching a
movie and this has some nice audio on it
as well so let's go ahead and watch that
this is an animated video but as you can
see the colors are really great the
vivid bravia engine is just incredible
so it looks great we'll go ahead and go
back and aside from playing videos
excellently we can take videos just
wonderfully with the touch of a button
we have our 12 megapixel autofocus
camera on here it does have the LED
flash let's go ahead and bring a pencil
over you can see one little problem I've
ran into is the autofocus or the focus
in general you kind of have to let it
sit for just a second but once you take
a picture it's easy we have basically
zero shutter lag we can just go as fast
as we want and we also have our options
here we have our different scenes we can
have Auto Scene Recognition normal us
choose to our front camera three sweet
panorama three sweet multi-angle sweep
panorama we have our scenes landscape
night sports all that great stuff and
then we have a document we have our
white balance right there we have our
flash options and then we can hit the
menu the android menu to bring up more
options such as the resolution smile
detection focus mode we have face
detection multi autofocus touch focus
i'll go ahead and choose touch focus and
then we have our ISO and metering image
stabilizer geo-tagging capturing methods
shutter sound quick launch and data
storage under the capturing method we
have the on-screen button touch capture
or we have the dedicated hardware camera
key up here right next to the volume and
the power rocker this takes great videos
as well being that it is 12 megapixel so
we'll go ahead and just brush past this
pencil take a nice video it didn't focus
in on it as much as I'd like it to but
it did do well we'll go ahead and view
that video right from the gallery the
gallery is set up in a nice intuitive
manner we can scroll through and see all
of our images so we'll go ahead and just
play this very quickly so you can see it
didn't focus kind of a strange
coincidence it did not focus as well as
I wanted it to though sinners will go
back I'm another great feature of the
xperia ion is the fact that sony has
included NF
see and we've got our experience smart
tags on deck now these are great they're
actually um pretty um built well
compared to other smart tags or other
NFC tags they're hard plastic and they
can hang on things and just work really
nice so this phone comes with the smart
tag application and with nfc-enabled
from the settings menu in the wireless
settings we can go ahead and just tap
sometimes I have to move it around to
get the sweet spot on the phone you know
that's this is a problem I've ran into I
have NFC enabled but the tag does not
register sometimes that's a complaint
with the NFC client on the phone that i
have not registering there we'll go
ahead and go there you go it registered
there so there you go there's a good
idea of how long it takes to actually
get the smart tag going that's a one of
my number one complaints for this smoke
of this phone the NFC just does not work
some of the time so anyways our smart
tag is detected once we do that we can
choose our different profiles for the
smart tag and we can choose different
actions to assign the smart tags we can
control our wireless settings such as a
Wi-Fi Bluetooth all that good stuff and
then we can choose our car modes bedroom
modes are sound profiles and stuff like
that our brightness at the tap of the
NFC tags launch different applications
all the great stuff that NFC tags have
to offer are available with the sony
xperia smart tags so we'll go back a
quick look at the body it has a really
nice form factor we have our nice xperia
logo down here it's a nice curved edge
around the phone here it feels great in
the hand then it has a nice slate screen
that's just awesome it's rocking we have
a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack on top
we also have right here in h mini HDMI
out and then we have the mini USB as
usual then I also found that you can pop
this bottom off but it does not reveal
anything down there of use so i'll go
ahead and as you can see there's nothing
down here you can access besides some
body screws it's an awesome phone it has
the Bravia Engine it does a great mobile
gaming the Tegra 3 no no no excuse me
the Snapdragon s3 works wonderfully so
we'll go ahead and do
quadrant test very quickly just to show
you the speed of this phone okay so for
our benchmark looks like we scored 2938
which is actually pretty good that's
higher than the Galaxy Nexus or the
samsung galaxy tab and giving that this
is only a dual-core and it is the
Snapdragon s3 rather than the snapdragon
s4 which is being implemented I'd say
that's a fairly good score it's just
blazing fast it'll power through your
games your HD video is um it won't lag
really I haven't run into any lag on the
UM experienced user interface or
anything especially when you grab a
widget like this you kind of have that
wave that you can pull along it gets
dragged then nothing ever lags there's
no lapses in performance in the app tray
it's all great everything is awesome the
Snapdragon s3 just powers through it so
anyways guys that was the sony xperia
ion closer look one more time at the
bottom keys down here we do have our for
capacitive keys now they don't light up
at night which is kind of a pain in the
ass but we do have the nice little
lights that come on under them so
anyways guys that was the sony xperia
ion go ahead and check one out if you're
looking for a budget price phone with
great performance and you're on the AT&amp;amp;T
network coming in around ninety nine
dollars so pick one of these up they've
got NFC a great blazing fast dual-core
processor the reality screen four point
six inches of great HD quality the nice
form factor too it's it's not one to get
scuffed up or scratched or anything
anyways thanks for watching guys we
always appreciate your support</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
