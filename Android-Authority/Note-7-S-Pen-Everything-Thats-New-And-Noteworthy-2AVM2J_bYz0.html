Authority what's going on everybody and
here we have a feature focus video
focusing on the new features of the
s-pen now the S Pen has always been a
bit of a trump card of sorts for the
note line oh is that little bit more
that this phone had over pretty much any
other smart device and it still brings a
lot of the same great functionality
there are a lot of features that return
from before and will mostly focus on the
new things that Samsung put into this
new seventh iteration the S Pen however
is still able to be used like a mouse on
to the note 7 screen being able to hover
over let's say folders in the gallery to
get a better look at what might be
inside of that folder you can still use
the air view for a lot of different
functions not really anything new here
but it's still a nice feature to have
for a style as found on this phone we'll
go ahead and dive into one of the new
features however we'll start off by
opening up the air commands menu and you
can already see a couple of new
shortcuts you can change these shortcuts
also so if you're going to take the S
Pen out and go straight into let's say a
regular application you can always put
one as one of these shortcuts but I go
ahead and put down the translate and the
magnify features now translate is a
wonderful new feature that we think will
be pretty useful for those of you who
travel and of course what you'll do is
just select the Translate shortcut in
the air command menu and be able to
hover over again using air view any
particular words in a particular
language and translate it to another
language there are 71 in total there's
only one real limitation to the
translate feature at least for the
moment and it's that you can only do it
word by word we have yet to have the
feature to highlight a sentence or even
a whole block of text and be able to
translate that on the fly but at least
word for word you will be able to get
translations easily then we move over to
let's say a simpler feature but it's
still quite powerful the magnify feature
essentially you get a small square that
you are able to use with air view to
hover over areas of the screen that you
want to look at more closely you can
have a bunch of different zoom
percentages including 300% if you really
need to get close into there and you'll
be able to magnify pretty much any bit
of the screen and then we'll go ahead
and move into the smart selects smart
select in and of itself is a feature
returns from the note 5 but you now have
the ability to create gifts now
animation over on the top there is what
is used in order to create a small frame
of the size that you can pick that will
take the motion off of the screen and
create a 15 second clip that is in gif
form now smart select was already an
easy way of just taking out just the
little sections of a display or of just
even a website that is on the display in
order to share with your friends but
with the smart select animation capture
you'll be able to get 15-second gifts
pretty much in the easiest way possible
and be able to share them straight from
that ability but putting away air
command means that we can go into the
Notes app now they made a big deal about
the streamlining of the UI in the
samsung galaxy note 7 in that with the
Notes app you now have a consolidation
of for different applications I used to
all do different things and we're all
installed on previous note devices now
action memo memo S note and scrapbook
are all put into the same application
just to consolidate all of their
features and it's pretty much your very
full-featured notes application you'll
be able to create notes you'll be able
to type on them paint on them write on
them with a bunch of different brushes
and be able to put together colors with
a full palette of colors that when you
put two colors together will create a
whole new one too much like in real life
and you'll be able to share those notes
not only in the pen up social media app
but also with your friends and through
different regular sharing applications
as well the final feature we'll look at
is the screen off memo now screen off
memo is not new in and of itself you
just have the phone on standby with a
turned off display or in this case they
always on display displayed and when you
take out the s-pen you'll have a black
canvas to easily write on in order to
just jot down quick notes whenever you
feel the need to the cool thing about
the screen off memo now however is that
you can pin it to the always-on display
essentially when you create your screen
off memo there's a small little pin at
the top that you'll be able to hit and
then the screen off memo that you just
created will be part of the always-on
display or aod for up to an hour unless
notifications or any other things come
up that have to take up that space and
the always-on display
so that's just your quick look at the
new features of the s-pen there's
definitely a lot more that the Aspen can
do and it's one of the reasons why the
note line is actually quite popular
there is an extra feature here one that
we weren't really able to show except
for a demo as you're seeing right now
the s-pen is water-resistant as is the
entire phone so there is the ability to
write down notes underwater and if you
actually have ever wanted to do that
before maybe you can tell us in the
comments below why you would actually
need that water resistance is nice to
have but being able to write underwater
we're still not too sure about that
keep it tuned to Android 30 for even
more about the samsung galaxy note 7 the
s-pen the future focuses we have n
comparisons of the phone and you can
keep it tuned here for even more because
we are your source for all things
