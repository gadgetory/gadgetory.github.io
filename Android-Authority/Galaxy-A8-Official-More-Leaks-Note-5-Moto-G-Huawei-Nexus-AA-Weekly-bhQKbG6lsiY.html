to you by domain.com recent leaks are
suggesting that the upcoming huawei
nexus device will be powered by a
Snapdragon 820 processor isn't that kind
of overkill kind of like swatting a fly
with an axe got him can I get a few
band-aids hmm you laugh but that's not
the only thing about this device that's
a bit overkill based on evleaks
information the hallway nexus will
reportedly feature a 5.7 inch quad HD
display that's 2560 x 1440 pixel
resolution which equates to roughly 515
pixels per inch density and is slightly
higher than the nexus 6 thanks to the
smaller display of this year's Nexus
evleaks also claims that the hallway
nexus will be powered by a Snapdragon
820 processor but hallway has never used
anything but it's curing processors on
its flagship smartphones a switch to
Qualcomm's latest processor would
represent a mark change over the past
devices but it may be one of the
conditions of building Google's next
flagship and for those of you girlie
awaiting the note 5 it looks like you
might only have a month to go multiple
reports have confirmed last week's Wall
Street Journal report that stated
Samsung will likely launch this device
in mid-august the galaxy note 5 will
likely resemble Samsung's early 2015
flagships and feature metal construction
and glass backs it will definitely not
feature a micro SD card slot the phablet
is also expected to feature a very thin
bezel like the galaxy a8 speaking about
that galaxy a8 it's official the galaxy
aah features a 5.7 inch full HD Super
AMOLED display a 64-bit octa-core
Snapdragon 615 processor back by 2
gigabytes of ram 16 gigabytes of
on-board storage and a microSD expansion
slot up to 128 gigabytes it also has a
16 megapixel rear facing camera and a
5-megapixel front-facing shooter and a
3050 milliamp hour battery it runs the
most recent version of Samsung's
TouchWiz overlay atop android 5.1
one lollipop it also comes with a
fingerprint scanner integrated into the
physical home button now if those specs
aren't good enough for you the device
somehow manages to measure just 5.9
millimeters thin and weigh only 151
grams making this the thinnest
smartphone to come from the manufacturer
yet here's the problem though line
extension I'm sure Samsung is well aware
of what line extension is but for the
rest of you line extension is when you
have a product in a category that's
doing well so you make more products in
that category and in the short term it
makes money in the long term they
cannibalize each other because they're
very similar products and they water
down the brand in the users mind line
extension always leads to problems in
the long run and Samsung is the king of
line extension according to the latest
leak the Moto G 2015 will be powered by
a Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor and
2 gigabytes of RAM although a previous
report suggested there could be two
models one with one gigabyte of RAM and
the other with two likely the Moto G
will run the latest Android OS out of
the box which in this case is android
5.1 point one lollipop and should be
updated to Android M once Google's next
platform launches later this year we can
expect the Moto G 2015 to sport a 5-inch
720p HD display with a choice of two
storage options 8 gigabytes or 16
gigabytes which both are expected to be
expandable on the back the Moto G is
expected to support a 13 megapixel rear
camera and a 5-megapixel front-facing
snapper and the handset will be powered
by a removable 2470 milliamp hour
battery now if this phone is 150 to 200
bucks could be good if it's much more
Motorola has just send out a rather coy
invite to the press inviting us to a new
york city and london event on july
twenty eighth now the invite promises
that our quote relationship status is
about to change it doesn't reveal any
details but it is likely all about the
Moto G I really wish I could find the
guy who came up with the very best
Android related domain name it was Star
Wars inspired because every true star
wars fan is an android fan
he came up with the droid you're looking
for dot com brilliant why because no
domain name extension tells your story
with the same level of trust as a.com
or.net domain name dot com and.net
domain name extensions and Jack
credibility and your online presence and
who doesn't want more credibility you
can say fifteen percent on domain name
and web hosting when you use our coupon
code Android at domain.com check out
don't forget fifteen percent off when
you use our coupon code Android when you
think domain names think domain.com
