bunch of new Android smartphones like
the Nokia a Scirocco and Nokia seven
plus these are pretty much all really
great smartphones because they were
based on the Android one platform which
uses a really minimal UI that takes
advantage of a lot of different google
apps
they're also all based around jewelry's
so they have this really fine design
that looks pretty much completely
different than any other Android phone
on the market right now and apparently
the strategy is working out for them
because they've sold a ton of phone
since they relaunched less than two
years ago and now they're launching a
new phone they like to call the Nokia
7.1 so the Nokia 7.1 is a pretty small
phone at least by today's standards it's
got a 5.8 4 inch display and the bottom
bezel is a little bit big but it still
feels pretty compact compared to all the
six point four inch phones that we've
got on the market right now no keys
making a pretty big deal about this
display and it's using a technology that
they like to call pure view now this
really just means that it has a lot of
dynamic range and it can play HDR
content up to HD or 10 it can also
upscale regular content so that it
basically works like HDR content so
you're gonna get a lot of more space
between the blacks and the whites now a
share isn't exactly uncommon right now a
lot of the big manufacturers are using
this tech in their flagship phones but
it's really nice to see Nokia putting
the technology in a definitively
mid-ranged phone the body of the Nokia
7.1 feels awesome they're saying it's
85% glass on the front and back and the
aluminum frame is carved from a single
piece and it really does just feel like
a really nice piece of jewelry they also
managed to pack dual cameras into this
phone which isn't exactly uncommon
anymore it's 2018 but this is obviously
used for things like portrait mode and
they've packed some pretty cool software
magic in there like enabling you to use
the front and back cameras at the same
time so the outsides of this phone just
look pretty nice and really seem like
pieces of jewelry the insides of this
phone are definitively mid-ranged in the
US you've got a Snapdragon 636 4 gigs of
ram and 64 gigabytes of storage but
internationally you're gonna be able to
get a three gig of ram and 32 gig of
storage bearing
the Snapdragon 636 isn't a bad CPU at
all I mean it's not gonna compete
head-to-head against like the Snapdragon
805 or probably even the 835 for that
matter but for just general browsing and
multitasking it's probably gonna do you
just fine
well this phone does have is a headphone
jack though which apparently is now
reserved for mid-range and lower end
options but I'm definitely not
complaining here so with that weird
interaction between a really premium
body and kind of mid-range specs it is
probably a little bit hard to tell how
much this phone is gonna cost nokia
decided to price this at three hundred
and fifty dollars and I think that's a
pretty decent price I mean it's not
gonna compete with like the poco phone
obviously but this is just an entirely
different market nokia is definitely
targeting this at people who want a
really nice and premium phone but don't
really care about the speed they just
want it to look good and feel good and
just generally performed pretty decently
so only got about 20 minutes with the
phone and I can't exactly draw
conclusions based on that time but we
should be getting a review unit within
the next few weeks and we'll be sure to
put it through our paces and let you
know what we think of it until then
leave your thoughts in the comments
section below drop your questions down
there I'll be sure to answer them the
best way that I can because of course we
are a source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
