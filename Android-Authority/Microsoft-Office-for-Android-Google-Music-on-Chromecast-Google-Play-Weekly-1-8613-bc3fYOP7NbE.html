handy the Android authority app guy and
welcome to our newest show called Google
Play weekly in Google Play weekly we're
going to be telling you about all the
best things that have happened in the
Google Play Store over the last week so
without further ado let's get started
let's start out with some good news over
the last week's and new stats came in
that showed that the Google Play Store
surpassed the Apple App Store and total
downloads this is a big victory for
Google because it now means that they
are the most popular mobile OS in the
world when it comes to applications
we're not entirely sure of the numbers
but we're sure they were in the billions
by now some amazing journalism by USA
Today posited that the reason why the
Google Play Store was more popular than
the Apple App Store was because there
were more Android handsets out there and
iPhones some good work there in USA
Today Apple may still have some boasting
rights however even though the Google
Play Store has more app downloads in the
Apple App Store the Apple App Store
still has a higher app revenue by a
whole bunch however if we're not gonna
let that stop ruin our day to day
because today is Google's day Google
Play Music got an update recently that
allows it to be streamed to television
to be a chromecast so the million
billion trillion people who went out and
bought it on the first day preventing me
from doing so can have their music
stream directly to their television
there were two updates the first
actually brought the support while the
second brought some improvements we're
sure competitors like Spotify and
Pandora are working on their chromecast
app right now but for now Google Play
store it where it's asked
since I don't have any videos shield or
any other Tegra devices I can test this
game with here's some of the footage
from the official trailer for a
hack-and-slash game it looks really good
what I buy shield just for this game of
course not but if I got shield I would
probably buy this game it's only a
dollar but sadly it's also only for
Tegra devices well friends if you
haven't had a reason to be angry at
Microsoft this weekend you really wanted
one this next story should help tide you
over for a little while Microsoft has
finally released Microsoft Office on
Android upon a cursory glance it doesn't
look that bad you can do basic edits to
Word Excel and PowerPoint files
my fellow video host Josh regarde took a
look at it on his weekly show which took
place just this last weekend and one
that you should totally check out so is
there a catch you bet there is in order
to use Microsoft Office on Android you
must first be an office 365 subscriber
which run you ten dollars a month so in
order to use Microsoft Office on Android
you got a paid work every single month
so does it get worse you bet it does not
only as Microsoft not going to support
Android tablets but nobody got fired
over this terrible decision our last bit
of news this week deals with an
application was actually kicked out of
the Google Play Store for looking too
much like iOS 7's control center it's
called control center and it was
actually kicked out by Google for get
this infringing on too many of apple's
designs that's right Google used the I
word instead of Apple - an app developer
the app received a small update and was
re-released to the Google Play Store
Angry Apple bloggers predict probably
correctly that the app will be pulled a
second time from the Play Store the
funny thing is is that while it looks
exactly like the iOS control center
control center for Android is actually a
more powerful application even though it
looks exactly like iOS 7 you can change
the buttons inside the interface to
change the functionality of the
application if you want it you better
pick it up quick because it's not going
to be around for much longer
that about does it for this episode of
Google Play weekly to
next week for a much better episode if
you liked it don't forget to share with
your friends and subscribe to our
YouTube channel don't forget to check
