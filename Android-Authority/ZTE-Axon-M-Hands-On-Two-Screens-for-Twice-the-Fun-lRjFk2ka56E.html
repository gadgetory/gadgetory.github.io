been around for quite some time now and
we've seen some concepts from companies
like Samsung and Lenovo but that's all
they've been so far is just concepts at
least until now we finally have a
foldable smartphone that is real and is
coming to market and it's from a company
that you probably wouldn't expect it's
made by ZTE and it's called the axon M
let's take a look before we dive deep
into the foldable aspects of the axon M
let's get all these standard smartphone
stuff out of the way inside the axon M
is going to be powered by a Snapdragon
820 one processor and 4 gigabytes of RAM
not exactly sure why ZTE did not go with
the Snapdragon 835 but the 820 one is
still plenty powerful so I don't think
performance is going to be that much of
an issue it also comes with 64 gigabytes
of internal storage and a micro SD card
slot if you want to add more and yes the
phone does have a headphone jack but
it's not water-resistant like most
phones that we've seen in 2017 I'm going
to take a wild guess and assume that
that might have something to do with the
fact that it's foldable but don't quote
me on that
the power button on the axon 10 lives on
the side and this also doubles as your
fingerprint sensor it's going to ship
with Android Newgate out of the box and
it does have some customizations from
ZTE but for the most part it feels
pretty much like stock Android no word
as to when it'll get Oreo but hopefully
that'll happen sooner than later it
doesn't have the flashiest of design
since it's practically just a rectangle
with short body lines but it is made
completely out of metal so it does have
a nice and sturdy feel to it the fact
that the axon M is foldable is really
what makes this phone special and a
little bit different from everything
else in 2017 but unlike a lot of those
foldable concepts the axon M does not
have a foldable display instead it uses
a hinge sort of like a door hinge and it
utilizes two separate displays that can
be joined together to give you a much
larger screen when the phone is folded
open both of the screens are 5.2 inch
LCD panels with 1080p resolution and
having two screens on this phone does
happen to make it quite thick at a
little over 12 millimeters the hinge on
this phone also makes it feel a little
awkward I'm not gonna lie it's not
uncomfortable to hold by any means but
it definitely feels very differ
from any other phone out there right now
because this phone has two screens it's
going to be pretty interesting to find
out what battery life is going to be
like it has a thirty 180 milliamp hour
battery inside which is a decent size
but we'll have to wait and see if that's
actually enough for a phone rockin two
screens so obviously with these two
screens you can combine them and use it
as one big screen to give you sort of a
tablet like experience but ZTE software
lets you do a few other things as well
you can of course use just one display
if you want like any other normal
smartphone but you can also mirrored the
displays to show the exact same content
and because the phone is foldable you
can put the phone in a tenth position
and share content with your friends or
family without having them uncomfortably
huddle around you both screens can also
be rent independently of each other
which is great for multitasking purposes
and because of this the axon M does not
have regular split-screen multitasking
as far as how apps scale when you're
using as one large screen most apps will
scale perfectly fine but for the ones
that don't it's going to be up to the
developers to update their apps but ZTE
does have software built in to force
apps to rescale to the larger screen if
they don't properly rescale on their own
now because this phone has two screens
it actually eliminates the need for a
front-facing camera and instead you only
have one camera on this phone the camera
is 20 megapixels at F 1.8 and when using
it as a rear camera it uses the screen
on the opposite side of the camera as
the viewfinder and when it's being used
as a front facing camera it uses a
display that's on the same side as the
camera we've seen a lot of interesting
designs in 2017 and I think the axon M
is definitely going to catch a lot of
attention but what do you guys think
about the axon M do you think foldable
phones is going to be the next big trend
in smart phones or is this going to wind
up as they failed gimmick let us know
down in the comment section below and if
