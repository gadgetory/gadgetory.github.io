what's going on everybody and here we
are taking a look at another feature of
the note 7 a brand new one
the iris scanner but it is actually
going to be sort of a small part of what
is the overall security feature of the
samsung galaxy note 7 security is a big
big portion of the phone this year and
Knox is actually being made available so
that you can have something called a
secure folder now this folder which is
accessible either through a shortcut on
the home screen or in the settings but
ultimately the purpose of the secure
folder is to put applications any
content even files and folders inside of
it that are then locked by any and all
rather of the different security
features found on the note 7 you could
use your fingerprint you can use a pin
you can use a pattern or password and
you can also use the new one the iris
scanner at the front of the device near
the front facing camera is a new
dedicated camera made specifically for
this purpose and to the other side of it
will be in infrared light that turns on
red and you have to look kind of in a
general direction and just have your
eyes within the little areas to capture
your iris
unlike fingerprints you'll only be able
to scan one iris one set of irises
rather and from there it will be able to
detect your eyes when compared to pretty
much anybody else that's trying to get
into your phone now there are going to
be some caveats to this the iris scanner
does require you to have just your pure
eyes available for scanning and then if
later on when you try to unlock the
device or the secure folder using the
iris scanner you happen to have glasses
on or contacts even it could disrupt the
scanning itself and make it so that your
eyes are not recognizable to the phone
but by having glasses off and actually
with contacts on I didn't have any
problems with this but then again I did
scan it with my contacts on to begin
with the iris scanner is actually quite
fast we were kind of impressed by it
because we've seen iterations of this
security feature in the past that
ultimately were just a little bit too
slow if you're looking at your device
already when you're unlocking it then
it's a pretty easy step to be able to
get into the interface essentially you
just turn on the phone
using either the home button or the
power button on the side when you swipe
up which is still a gesture you have to
use according to Samsung the swipe up
was just the extra layer of protection
so it's not always just firing the
infrared camera but when you swipe up on
the lock screen it will bring up a small
area where there are some let's say
Terminator or HUD like elements on there
showing you where your eyes should be
and once it recognizes just the actual
composition of your iris then you would
just unlock the device it does so in a
very quick way almost as fast as the
fingerprint reader actually and we were
pretty impressed by it like I said all
right you can use the iris scanner for
blocking the device unlocking the device
rather or the secure folder making it
another feature already fully integrated
into the package that is the note 7 so
that should look at the security
features but more specifically the iris
scanner of the note 7 and you can keep
it tuned here for our look at the S Pen

our comparisons we have a lot of
coverage of the Samsung unpacked events
