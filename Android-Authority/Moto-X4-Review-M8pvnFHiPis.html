Motorola slate a smartphone and it looks
like a pretty average standard
smartphone right for the most part it is
but there's a couple of things that
makes this phone special first it's an
Android one device which means a couple
of things it's very affordable the
experience is basically stock Android
and it'll get timely software updates
secondly it's on Google's short list of
project 5 compatible phones and at 399
dollars it's the most affordable project
5 phone you can get right now but what
else does it offer let's take a look on
the outside there's nothing overly
flashy about the Moto X 4 but Android 1
phones aren't meant to have a ton of
bells and whistles it does still have a
pretty nice design but if you were
expecting this to be anything like the
Moto X's of yesteryears you might be a
little disappointed this is really a
different phone entirely like a lot of
phones nowadays the x4 has a mostly
glass design with glass on the front and
back and metal wrapping around the sides
it feels really nice and comfortable to
hold especially with the rounded corners
and it's not that big of a phone either
so it's pretty easy to use in one hand
unlike Motorola Z series of smartphones
the export does come with a headphone
jack so no adapter required here to use
your favorite pair of headphones and
it's also ip68 water and dust resistant
which is really nice to see on a phone
of this price point there's nothing
fancy about the screen either it's not
curved or bezel is it's just your normal
smartphone display it's a five point two
inch LCD panel with 1080p resolution and
it's not a screen that's going to blow
your socks off but it's honestly fine
and I really had no complaints using it
the coves are nice it has good viewing
angles and has decent outdoor visibility
the black levels aren't quite as good as
an AMOLED screen but in general I think
most people will be happy with the
screen and I still thought it was a
pretty enjoyable experience for watching
YouTube or playing games the biggest
perk that you'll find with the Moto X 4
is that it has dual cameras on the back
just like Motorola's flagship the z2
force but unlike the z2 force which has
a monochrome sensor the secondary sensor
on the x4 is a wide angle lens there's
also a camera
but it's merely just an aesthetic
decision here there are no moto mods for
this phone so the main sensor is 12
megapixels @f 2.0 and the secondary is a
little lower resolution at 8 megapixels
with an aperture of f-22 so it isn't
quite as good in low-light but the wide
angle is great for landscape shots or
group photos it does have that grow pro
like distortion towards the edges which
I personally don't mind but I know not
everyone is a fan of that look the
secondary sensor also lets you do a
depth effect or portrait mode as it's
called on a lot of other phones and
motorola also lets you do some other
neat tricks like crop out the subject
and replace it with a different
background or turn parts of the image
black and white to put emphasis on a
specific part of the photo the depth
effect however doesn't really work all
that well compared to other phones that
I've tried they're not very convincing
and be blurring bleeds onto the subject
most of the time even ones with pretty
simple edges you can just e blur after
the fact but it doesn't really help all
that much general picture quality is
decent and good lighting and you can get
some pretty good detail and color but it
crushes the shadows a little too much
and photos fall apart pretty quickly in
low-light and they're especially noisy
and soft on the wide-angle lens and it
doesn't handle highlights all that well
I'm also not really a fan of the tap to
expose that Motorola uses it's just too
finicky and depending on where you tap
you can get some pretty wild exposure
swings my biggest problem with this
camera is that it's just slow it's slow
to capture photos especially in
low-light since it doesn't have oh is
and it's also pretty slow to switch
between lenses but hopefully that's
something that could be easily fixed
with a software update
speaking of software it's your typical
closest stock Android experience that
Motorola offers which I personally have
always enjoyed there's no bloatware on
this phone at all and you of course get
all the Motorola enhancements as well
like the moto display and various moto
actions like the chop chop to turn on
the camera flash and wrist twist to
launch the camera it's running Android
new get at the moment but considering
this is an Android 1 device
I assume it'll get updated to Orio
pretty quickly since that's one of the
perks of being an Android 1 phone in
terms of specs it's gotten
dragon 6:30 processor with three
gigabytes of RAM or four depending on
your region
it comes with 32 gigabytes of internal
storage with a micro SD card slot if you
need more and it has a fingerprint
reader on the bottom chin that's very
fast and accurate and I like that
Motorola lets you use it to put the
phone to sleep it's not the most
powerful phone on the market but I've
had no complaints about the performance
it's been very smooth and fluid whether
I'm just using it casually playing games
or multitasking back and forth between
apps I haven't noticed any stuttering or
hiccups battery life on the x4 is not
amazing but it's not bad either it's
just average it has a 3000 milliamp hour
battery and I can get through a full day
with pretty normal usage which includes
reading emails texting social media and
some light youtube but you can kill this
phone pretty quickly with more intense
use like gaming or a lot of video
watching and screen on time mostly
hovered around the four hour mark so
overall I think the Moto X 4 is a pretty
solid smartphone but if you buy it with
the expectation of it being anything
like previous Moto X's you'll be sorely
disappointed the only thing this really
shares in common with Moto X's of the
past is the name otherwise it's a
completely different phone again what
makes this phone great is the fact that
it's part of the Android 1 program but
it's also project 5 compatible at the
same time and at an affordable price of
$400 it's the perfect gateway phone if
you're looking to get into project 5 for
the first time without spending a lot of
money but even if you're not looking for
all that it's just a good budget phone
in general something that Motorola
continues to excel at time and time
again as always thank you guys so much
