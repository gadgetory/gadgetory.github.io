authority and a lot of the flagships
have come out recently have had at least
one or two things that make them a
little bit different or unique whether
that's a super tall and skinny 18 by
nine screen a secondary display dual
cameras curved edge glass or an AI
assistant manufacturers have to try a
lot harder nowadays to really make their
phones stand out and HTC's newest phone
be you 11 has a new feature called edge
sense that lets you squeeze the phone to
activate a particular function of the
phone itself and this is a very
interesting and unique feature something
we've never really seen before on any
smart phone so let's go ahead and take a
closer look at it see exactly how it
works and what it can do for you see
what I did there
you cuz you 11 just to the intro please
so the sides of the hvcu 11 are pressure
sensitive and in order to start using
edge sense you first have to set it up
which is something you're prompted to do
during the initial setup process or you
can do it later by enabling it in the
settings to set up edge sense it's going
to ask you to set the intensity of the
squeeze or at HTC calls it the squeeze
force level which is basically how hard
or how soft you have to squeeze the
phone in order for the function to
trigger you set the squeeze force level
by squeezing the phone as hard as you
want and this will be how hard you have
to squeeze the phone every time to
activate the feature you can also hit
the plus or minus buttons on the setup
screen to fine-tune the level of the
squeeze and from here you can test be
squeezed by sending virtual balloons
into the air to make sure it's exactly
what you want something to keep in mind
is you don't want to set the squeeze to
be too soft or you'll run into
accidental squeezes which sounds kind of
weird to say but it does happen and if
you squeeze the phone too hard it
actually makes it a little uncomfortable
to use when you have to apply so much
force
I found the sweet spot to be somewhere
in the middle there are also options to
enable visual or haptic feedback to make
it easier to tell that something is
actually happening especially if you're
squeezing the phone without looking or
while the phone is
once you have it all set up you can
start using the feature right away and
by default it's set to open up the
camera
squeezing once will launch the camera
and squeezing again while you're inside
of the camera app will snap a photo and
if you like using it for the camera you
can keep it that way obviously but if
you'd rather use it for something else
you can change it to pretty much
whatever you'd like you can have it open
up any app of your choice like Facebook
Instagram Gmail Twitter Google Maps or
perform other actions like taking a
screenshot turning on the flashlight
starting a voice recording or launching
HTC's own sense companion if you want to
take things a step further you can
enable the advanced mode which will let
you assign two different functions with
a short and a long squeeze for example
you can do a short squeeze to launch the
camera or squeeze and hold to open up
Google assistant but again you can
customize both the short and long
squeeze to be anything you want whether
it's turning on a specific feature of
the phone or launching an app if you do
use the advanced mode to control the
camera and Google assistant you'll gain
some additional functionality within
both of those apps once the camera is
launched a short squeeze will take a
photo just like before but performing a
long squeeze can switch you back and
forth between the front and main camera
with Google assistant if you're typing a
message in an email text message or any
input field that would require the
keyboard and would like to finish up the
email or text with your voice voice the
text can be activated with either a
short or a long squeeze one of the
biggest benefits of the edgesense
feature is that it still allows you to
interact with the phone even when it's
wet or submerged so if you want to take
a photo take a screenshot open an
application or turn on the camera flash
you can still easily do that and that's
all made completely possible by the ip67
certification and that's all there
really is the you Elevens edge sense
feature it's a very different and unique
way of interacting with this phone that
we've never seen before on any other
smartphone and I know that squeezing
your phone may sound like a very weird
thing to do at first but it's actually
pretty intuitive and I've thoroughly
enjoyed using it as a shortcut to Google
assistant but what do you guys think
about HCC's edge sense feature is it a
smart phone game-changing feature or is
it another smart phone gimmick that
won't really make much of an impact on
the way we use our phones let us know
