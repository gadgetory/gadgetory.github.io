Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome to the 150 seventh episode of
Android apps weekly let's roll that
intro and then get right into those
headlines Android pay is reportedly
coming to Google Chrome sometime soon
the idea is to make shipping on mobile
browsers much easier by implementing the
service directly into it thus you'll be
able to make purchases on the web
without doing anything special this is
similar to how Google used to do it and
we're glad to see the feature returning
under the umbrella of Android pay there
is no word yet on when this will show up
on Chrome but we do hope it's soon
Pokemon go popularity is still surging
although not as much as it was before
that said the game has passed the 500
million download mark along with that
the company released stats that have
shown that players have walked two point
eight five billion miles which is just
insane even in the unlikely event that
Pokemon go tails off by the end of the
year it's definitely nothing to scoff at
this game is doing very well about the
only big news that came from the apple
event this week was that Nintendo was
bringing a Mario game to mobile called
Super Mario run as exciting as that
sounds the game appears to be a
side-scrolling infinite runner that
doesn't sound all that exciting however
the good news is that it'll have a
single price and it won't be a freemium
game and it'll also be level based it is
definitely coming to Android but we
don't know when just yet speaking of
Nintendo they have officially delayed
the releases of their fire emblem and
Animal Crossing mobile games until early
2017 Nintendo stated that they wanted
the mario game to get fully released
before it launched any of their other
properties many have speculated that the
games will be launched in the first
quarter of 2017 before the March 31st
earnings call but nothing is set in
stone just yet the latest humble bundle
is out and you can pick it up right now
it's a fairly decent haul this time
around and you can pick up games like
Tomb Raider one and two shooting stars
space grunts cloud chasers and more
you'll be able to get four games for
paying at least a dollar or six games if
you beat the average those who pay more
than five dollars will get every game in
the bundle these games can retail for up
to thirty four dollars individually so
it's a great way to get some games for
cheap and donate to charity while you do
it particular is a platform runner where
your goal is to break out of prison each
level will have you running forward
jumping over crevices and guards while
avoiding all sorts of obstacles there is
suede decent little soundtrack and the
minimal unity based graphics should run
on most modern devices whether they're
low end or flagship you earn 3 stars per
level by beating the time limit and
you'll have power-ups to help you along
the way it's a freemium game which isn't
ideal but it's a fun little time killer
the official NickJr application was
released this last week to mixed reviews
it features the ability to watch a
number of shows and videos including
many shows from Nick juniors programming
lineup you'll find it easy to use
interface that was designed for kids and
there are even some games that you can
play to get full access you'll have to
be a subscriber to Nick juniors network
one way or another unfortunately the
application has had some responsiveness
problems and other release date bugs so
you may want to wait a couple of updates
before trying this one out over Lux
constellations is an atmospheric RTS
where you must take over all of the
planets it features colorful graphics
along with slow relaxing gameplay that
can get rather challenging the longer
that you go you'll get 160 levels
android TV support and online
multiplayer support through Google Play
game services there are also some
additional features if you happen to own
an Nvidia shield device including 4k
support it's a freemium game but it's
actually a pretty good one taskbar is a
nifty little application that gives you
an actual task bar on your Android
device it operates much like the start
menu on Windows and you'll be able to
quickly browse your applications or add
apps to the task bar for quick launching
those running Android nougats will have
the bonus option of launching the
applications in Windows like on
Microsoft Windows a lot of the
functionality is lost on phones so we do
recommend that you try this one out on a
tablet it's a completely free download
for now lifeline crisis line is the
latest text-based adventure in the
critically acclaimed franchise and this
one you'll be helping a detective figure
out clues a particularly unique murder
scene it uses a lot of the same
mechanics from prior games and you'll
essentially be reading a bunch of texts
and then making decisions for the
character in the story it's not the most
exciting game ever but it should play on
most devices and it's a fun little game
it's two dollars and ninety-nine cents
and for now there are no in-app
purchases for even more Android apps and
