Friday debate podcast by Android
Authority discussing topics in Android
every single week this is episode 11 of
the FDP
this time we're talking about Chrome OS
now we did see a lot of announcements
this past week around April Fool's Day
about some chrome ecosystem products
that are coming out including the chrome
bit by a sous or with a partnership with
a sous I should say and a couple of
Chromebooks and an updated chrome OS
that now we'll be able to take a tool
that will alight to test Android on
Chrome OS we talked about whether or not
Chrome OS is a sustainable ecosystem
especially for the types of people that
we are in the world that we have with
pcs and Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro
and all these things and whether or not
we would be able to convert to Chrome OS
or to a Chromebook per se now the only
person on the panel I'm joined by the
usual panel this week is Jonathan vice
that has a Chromebook he's the only one
in the group that has one and he gives
us a rundown of how he feels about the
Chrome OS and how he uses it on the
daily and then we kind of pontificate on
whether or not we would be able to dive
into that particular ecosystem we have a
double feature today because last week's
technical difficulties made me have to
find some extra solutions and release
last week's episode today as well so
you're getting two episodes today and I
hope you enjoy them some changes down
the pipe are going to happen with the
friday debate podcast nothing too
drastic but we will let you know what
that is in a specialized episode by me
probably for about five minutes letting
you know everything that you can do to
add your voice to the FDP
not only on social media but in plenty
of other places across the Internet's
with all of that if you're watching the
YouTube version of this make sure you
hit the card on the side and you'll be
able to head on over to the Friday
debate podcast post at Android or decom
to find all of our social media links
you'll also be able to find where you
can get the podcast in other formats
other than YouTube like on stitcher and
iTunes and pocket casts and those are of
course the best ways of listening to the
friday debate podcast without any
further ado this is episode 11 Chrome OS
of the Friday debate podcast hope you
guys enjoy you know guys I would love to
change the world but they won't give me
the source code every single week we're
gonna get a nice start through Joe yes
my new goal I'm going to start off the
podcast every week with that with a
really stupid joke I think we should
have considered the weekly topic the to
be why do they have to keep ruining you
know TV shows and things from the 90s
and making and remaking them I think
that would be a great non Android
related topics well that's also what
they're doing with movies all the time
right like they're yeah pretty much
they're remaking a bunch of Disney
movies and stuff like that
I remember seeing Saturday Night Live
they made fun of that whole notion that
the rock did the rock oh my god yes that
was hilarious basically a gun-toting
Bambi like you're shooting everyone in
the Freddie do so nice no I saw a post
on Google+ so I was like oh man they're
rebooting all these TV shows they should
reboot Firefly and like the first
comment was no actually be well what uh
what TV show you would you want to see
rebooted I don't know I don't know if
anyone even has an answer to that
because it's like I don't think I want
to see anything we would have liked to
see new things new ideas Yeah right
did you hear that um yeah I think was
yesterday uh Netflix is exploring I kid
you not a spin-off of full house oh yeah
fuller house yeah that's what made me
think of this is like I read that
earlier it's like are you serious and
it's been really ridiculous I mean
scream is being turned into a TV show if
you guys didn't know that no no yeah
we're turning scream into a television
show um yeah it's just getting
ridiculous
I would I would be done for fuller house
if they lent
Sagat be himself he's actually a super
vulgar guy like he's he's not the kind
of guy you would you would want as your
dad let's go that way like this is the
bitter years after another 20 years that
you just turned the other it should just
be a brittle aged house it should just
be super meta like all of the full house
characters are acting like the actors
who had to play the characters in full
house and they're all bitter about being
a part of full house there'd be a lot of
drug use some actually be a reality TV
show like you don't have all the
different sitcom characters like get
together in a house that could I could
see that working yeah you know all the
different things like some family
matters and all of them and just put
them all on a house together I think
that's a good idea I think we should
pitch that to someone rehashing a lot of
ideas also not just like revamping or re
or reviving them like isn't there a CSI
now that's about the digital age like
there's there's a CSI that deals with
like hackers and stuff like that and
gets like CSI yeah I'm trying to get the
name of it yeah I am like uh and I
showed her to think just how inaccurate
they get with like tech pop culture like
like how long order always mess it up
you know like they always had freaking
ice-t be the guy who didn't know what
technology was like why would you put
your why would you tag it on location on
that photo main like the worst ice-t
okay Josh you were on a ten-minute
banned from doing impressions I will
gladly take the cone of silence yes
all right well we're back into it this
week our topic as you may probably are
seeing on the title of this and we have
a double feature today because since I
had trouble with the audio from last
week's episode I'm actually just gonna
release two episodes today so I hope all
of you guys are really happy with that
last week's episode was super fun it
turned out to be like 90 minutes long
and we just learned up this pageant all
day about sci-fi stuff I listened to
back it was your fest really a room full
of nerds - talking about IT stuff or
sci-fi stuff what else you think was
gonna
so this week we're actually going to
delve deeper into a topic that last week
we kind of touched upon and that was
cloud computing but Google is obviously
really going all not really all in but
they're they're really supplementing the
Chrome OS the Chrome ecosystem even
though a lot of these announcements have
been on April 1st which everyone was
taking everything with a grain of salt I
don't know if you guys got got got
caught by any of the April Fool's jokes
did you guys know I thought in that day
snake I followed them but yeah I mean
most of them are pretty obvious they
don't know a job of making it up sorry
Joe
I'm sorry I came really close to
believing one of them and that's because
it was posted on April 2nd of that it
was the The Walking Dead gets canceled
for some reason or other I didn't read
the whole post it was just like the the
guy the director guy or something's like
on Twitter Google+ something he's like
oh yeah the Walking Dead is getting
canceled but they like it was posted on
April 2nd so I took it seriously for a
second then I saw it was a repost I'm
back at the post I was April 1st I was
like screw you who host April Fool's
jokes on April 2nd so just like that
yeah so give me how Christmas presents
on New Year's Christmas it's next year
jerk well did you guys see the Motorola
April Fool's joke
I think that's hilarious I think they
should have done that for real I think a
lot of people would have bought it there
are some there are some people who would
buy those actually I'm sure there are
what was it I did mr. dick I know I know
Josh was disappointed he couldn't buy
one no I hate selfie sticks with a
passion like I said it okay the only
thing you need to do is go to a to a
museum and you'll see everyone with
selfie sticks almost toppling over all
of the artifacts or that definitely art
but basically the the Motorola April
Fool's joke was moto maker now has a
selfie stick option and you can get like
a bamboo customizable and
it looked kind of cool like in leather
like I thought that was kind of funny
did you stick for all your beat BDSM
selfie-stick there it is did you guys
see the Samsung Swan no they call it
obviously Note edge know that yes the
Galaxy blade edge it was a knife it was
a smart knife that had a sharp edge that
could cut through things and supposedly
was stronger than steel and some kind of
ceramic and it was yeah it was crazy
they actually went really detailed and
like explaining the software and like it
had NOx protection to make sure you
don't cut your fingers and it was pretty
good last year yeah they tend to be
samsung tends to go really overboard
Google does the most but Google's none
of them are really that that's like
they're all pretty quick you know they
don't go into a lot of detail they're
just here here it is all the little
things Easter eggs you know like the
pac-man thing on Google Maps over
against a topic but did you guys want do
you guys use time hop at all I used to I
stopped because I just made you
depressed yeah I posted from five-year
do my post from five years ago were
really bad I was looking at myself I'm
like man I was everything I currently
hate about the Internet five years ago
oh yeah I know same here I was I was
posting song quotes and vague booking oh
this person made me so mad I wish I
could walk back to five years ago and
slap myself right across my face I think
you were gonna grow up and get over this
immediately the one that I had the one
that I don't really like are the so when
I was in college I had my first
long-term girlfriend so some every now
and then I'll see like five pictures of
just me and my ex and they're like super
corny and super campy and those are the
ones where I'm just like I kind of think
I want to uninstall this happen oh
that's gotta hurt right deep down in the
fields right not only not not just
because of that but because you know I
mean what
who is this guy who's like super cheesy
and wants to show the world like I'm so
not that person anymore thank God and
I'm and think of I'm dating somebody now
who's not like that either just a real
like a real but the time hop April
Fool's joke was called time book and
they said oh now there's a now there's a
brand new way of looking through your
past and then it showed just the link or
the picture of you clicking on one of
the years and the Facebook Timeline and
they're just like this is time book
everybody and I made like a huge deal
about it I thought that was pretty funny
all right so we are jumping into the
Chrome OS ecosystem right now and so
Chromebooks chromecast and now chrome
bit a number of these aside from
chromecast a number of these
announcements did happen on April Fool's
Day which is why we went on that tangent
but they're real they are absolutely
real and I will admit when it came to
the chrome bit which we'll get into a
little in a little bit the the the I
actually thought that it was fake like
to create a small little dongle like
that for an HDMI TV HDMI capable TV TV
rather and all of a sudden have a
working PC there that's something we'll
get into in a little bit but I
personally did not think that that was
like a viable like like like peripheral
to have but the first thing I wanted to
get into because I know that we're all
gonna have positive feedback on this is
you all have chromecast right yep yes
all right don't cast yes chromecast is
it not one of the greatest things google
has ever invented unless someone's
actually going to disagree with me on
that I use mine all the time yeah and I
actually got but you I'm a cable cutter
yeah I never use mine either well but I
like knowing that it's there it's used
on rare occasion it's on the bedroom TV
but we don't really use that TV that
much well what do you guys undiluted
then um Roku a person like that I like
ooh III I don't know I just I like
having a remote I'm sorry I just stick
huh I can't get over the head I like
remotes it's real lessons thank you with
the it's like you Josh with
the physical keyboards you know it's III
like to have to I like to press the
buttons on a remote okay fair enough but
yeah well it's become like my lifeline
you know i the TV in my room is used for
ps4 which is funny because I don't
really use the ps4 for like Netflix and
Hulu and all that stuff mainly because
it it heats up the room like a mother
like it's but when that then is going
the room just gets really hot so the
chromecast is a much better solution for
that but even then I didn't I didn't
have my DirecTV connected to my TV for a
long time and I didn't need it because I
would just watch Hulu or watch Netflix
on and it's just as easy as hitting that
icon on the Android operating system you
know but Joe you don't use your
chromecast at all oh no not really I
mean I use it to like test apps and
stuff when you when the situation calls
for it but like on my main TV I have my
xbox one and a cable box and an Xbox 360
and Nintendo Wii U so I mean if I can't
get to what I'm going for using one of
those devices chromecast isn't the
solution
I need a lobotomy and then you know my
the other screens in my house you know I
got my laptop or my yeah my laptop my
computer upstairs my tablet which has
you know it's the Nvidia shield tablet
so I got that something just broke sorry
about that I just drove it I was messing
around with like a screw and it just
dropped it but yeah everything you know
I just I don't need it everything is
already connected to the Internet in the
ways that I need it to be and the one
thing that I would wish what had
chromecast support doesn't which is the
Funimation app watch all of my anime you
don't use like a crunchy roller yeah
it's like crunchy roll but as smaller
you know it's more specifics a
fundamental you know they do a lot of
dubbing and subbing and stuff so the
stuff that they dub and sub they have
licensed for so they camera it's the
first time I'll ever be able to ask a
anime related question dubbing or
subbing what's better
dubbing really yes and there's a reason
there's a reason for it and I know like
for the authentic experience you want
the subs but the thing is is it you know
if I'm sitting there and my you know
eyes are at the bottom of the screen
reading the text
I'm missing what's going on at the top
of the screen so like you know it might
be like something subtle like you know a
lot of animators do that little like
subtle stuff sometimes or it's just like
a quick wink or you know it's like three
frames you just see the wink and but I'm
missing it because he's saying something
and I have to read what it freakin is so
I like the Dubs
at least when the doves are done well
that in a compliment they aren't most
the time but you know like Full Metal
Alchemist had really good dubs Fairy
Tail has really great dubs do Dragon
Ball Z had really terrible dubs
holy crap that show Joe has never
sounded more gangster than right now how
about you fuzzy so you are you are of
the chromecast army like me oh I thought
you're asking about dubs and subs the
subs man come on stop screw yeah
absolutely i use the chromecast all the
time now here's the thing I'm still kind
of in my my transition my move from
Canada to the eunuch to the US so a lot
of my stuff is still in storage in
Canada my playstation my you know DVD
player stereo system all that stuff is
still up there so I've just got a little
TV and a chromecast and for what little
I use it and pretty much if the TV is on
the chromecast is being used okay so
obviously we have the chromecast taking
so it okay the cloud which is such an
odd term to you sometimes because it's
like that movie that Jason sequel is it
no one understands the cloud and that's
it so essentially you have your
smartphone you're already streaming from
the cloud you're already streaming your
media then you hit a button and then it
sends that same signal to a different
peripheral into your TV you know that's
that's kind of the whole basis of cloud
computing being able to have everything
either stored in the cloud or coming
from it now now we move into the PC base
which is what the crux of our our topic
is fiesty being the one person in this
chat right now that has a Chromebook can
you convince us as to why a Chromebook
is a better solution than what pcs or
Macs if it happens to be we have now
no I cannot so I'm going to try okay but
so here's the thing I found with
Chromebooks and I spent a lot of time
researching before I purchased mine I
should have gone all out and gotten the
pixel but you know budget dictated that
wasn't in the cards if you get one of
the low-end small like 11 inch 11.6 inch
and I think they are and a Chromebooks
unless you're looking for a tablet
replacement it's not gonna suit any of
your needs now the Chromebook I got is
the HP Chromebook 14 and it's got one of
the the newer bigger Intel processors I
mean it's not much but you know 1.4 gig
dual-core processor and it's enough to
get by a plug it plays 1080p video I
mean it's it's more than enough for
daily usage but again I spent the extra
time I spent the extra money I got a
bigger unit it's a little bit more
capable where did I go wrong I got one
with two gigabytes of RAM and we'll let
Jos jump in later and talk about RAM
usage through Chrome but let's just say
if you're buying a Chromebook get as
much RAM as you possibly can if there
were ever a hate portion of this device
it's based on a lack of RAM okay well
coming from the writing standpoint and I
guess crushy you can you could give us
your insight on this coming from the
writing standpoint let's say you're not
necessarily doing a whole lot of let's
say video editing or photo editing or
even gaming let's say gaming is this a
viable this is a viable laptop or
computing system for somebody who
doesn't do those other things do you
would you recommend someone use it over
the locally processed you know like word
processors or even like Evernote which
in a way is a cloud computing platform
is this a viable solution for anybody
who doesn't do the creative types let me
jump right back in there for one quick
second although the Chromebook does
focus on the cloud quite a bit it does
not need
I mean most of them come with for a year
or two you know 100 gigabytes of free
Google Drive storage
I haven't activated that I don't really
need it or want it I have other
solutions but there's this misconception
that Chromebook is strictly the web
browser and strictly for cloud
operations but it isn't it has its own
built-in File Explorer media players
calculator you know it has local apps
that work offline it has a text editor
and I mean I would I don't use it for
writing for you know for Android
authority I use blogger or you know our
website for that but the text editors
are there can be used locally off
offline okay we go on well I mean even
even with that in mind even the fact
that and that's true there are some
there are some local storage / local
localized work that can be done on a
Chromebook but even given what is
available in the Chrome OS itself is it
a viable solution for someone who's
maybe used to the Microsoft Office
ecosystem for example know if you're
dedicated to and I encounter this all
the time people in my world of Microsoft
Excel
there is nothing locally that comes even
close to comparing to Excel you'd have
to go online of course a Google Drive
Google sheets whatever it's called now
but nothing locally no okay so groshi'
how do you feel about Chromebook and
Chrome OS in general I guess because you
are you are primarily a writer for us so
it doesn't as a does a system like that
appeal to you as someone who's not going
to delve into anything graphically
intensive um yes and no I mean I've I
don't own a Chromebook like you know but
I I have used them battery life for the
most part tends to be I don't know on
your model what's the life john-john on
your particular model but I know it
tends to be pretty good depending on
what you get I get about 10 hours that's
one aging yeah see to me yes as a writer
especially like when we write like
events like CES when my laptop was dying
every like two hours yeah it sounds
amazing for basic stuff and the reality
is the cloud computing if you're in an
area with reliable
action most things you can do locally
you can do on the cloud I mean if you're
a Microsoft person there's what office
365 and you know there's there are
solutions you can still enjoy a full
computing experience if you're willing
to put things in the cloud now not
everyone's willing to do that obviously
some people either don't have reliable
connections all the time oh I think
that's becoming for those of laced in
major mark you know major countries you
know you know developing countries you
know in Europe and you know the United
States it's probably less of an issue
anymore honestly most of us probably
have reliable access most of the time
not all the time but most of the time
but I think it comes the more down to
like people fearing privacy concerns and
things like that but to be honest you
know mm-hmm
so yeah would I would I use one yeah
I've actually considered getting one um
I uh and even though I'm a little bit
leery about the whole Loram thing like
first as mentioned like they have the
new uh Isis it's a convertible that
turns into a tablet basically you know
folds back I think it's kind of cool for
well I think it's only like 250 or 300
dollars or something you know like that
it's pretty cool for what it is I mean
yes technically Chrome OS isn't great
for touch but yeah I don't know it kind
of appealed to me I thought it looked
interesting cuz I like I like the idea
of convertible devices none of them have
really worked out very well but I like
the idea of you know being able to
converge things you know okay
Joe what do you what's your workhorse
what's your main computing platform
right now I use Windows currently and I
think it's as I told the guys before we
started the podcast I was like I really
hope you guys can carry the lion's share
because I really can't say much about
Chrome OS I've never used it it's never
been in my presence and that's mostly
because you know I am a Windows user
currently and it's I mean it's Windows I
don't know I've never had a problem with
Windows that other people have had and
it actually boggles my mind like oh yeah
I get like 60 besause a day like man I
looked at your Google+ profile you have
a bachelor's degree in freakin computer
engineering and you get a blue screen of
death on your computer and you don't
know what's causing it like hmm
I can I can speak to that actually I I
did a I did IT support for faculty and
staff at my college and from what I can
tell even people who are very savvy with
computers there it's that that's like
that somehow that is separate from the
part of people that will click on
anything that looks cool I can't really
understand it because the first thing I
would do when I would go to computer
science professors let's say like
desktop computer in their office is I
open up there first of all they're
browsers Internet Explorer for God's
sake and then they're like a dozen
different toolbars on it it's like do
you not read what comes on the screen
before you click anything that's what I
kind of realized so it's so I will speak
to that in the sense that it seems like
those two worlds are separate somehow
and I don't really understand why so but
uh yeah you know um so instead of like
talking about actual Chrome OS like
these you know yeah that you guys have I
was gonna go from their perspective
perspective of why I don't have a
Chromebook yet and it's simply because
you know the the unique nature of our
work prevents me from doing so I spent a
year in high school and a year in
college learning Adobe Photoshop
I'm not leaving Adobe Photoshop you know
I know like oh you know giimpse better
at this or giimpse free or you know f
OSS and all that jazz it's cool and all
if you have never used imaging software
before but you know and and this is also
true for you know Microsoft most
college-educated people have taking
courses on Microsoft Office anybody
who's done in graphic design or video
game design or you know video editing
stuff in college has used you know
Premiere Pro and Photoshop and these
really big really heavy programs that
you don't get on Chrome OS or even on
Linux for that matter and you know so
when people ask me like well how come
you just don't switch it's because I
have learned how to use this ecosystem
and for me to change to a wholly
different ecosystem without the tools
that I you know currently use is
literally a step backwards for me
because I'm gonna have to relearn you
know I don't even know is there even a
video editor on Chrome OS
no no yeah so I'd video I dare not his
job I don't think yeah yeah it's um
there's some online stuff but there's no
local editor can YouTube editor you know
the reality is if you have a specialized
job yet that's not who Chromebooks
Chromebooks are meant to be your casual
device you know most people who use them
on a daily basis have no you know major
need and if they do then they have two
devices one they use for business one
they use for pleasure well he used to
say that about Mac's also that for the
creative types Mac's or the
end-all-be-all type of ecosystem and
then slowly Windows sort of got that
backing from Adobe to the point where
they got their own suite of great
creative applications that aren't just
for Mac so I don't know maybe Chrome OS
is going to make that leap one day well
obviously is not gonna happen yet well
and to be fair I mean if you have light
needs for professional needs you know if
you're not doing like a bunch of YouTube
videos if you're just like you know
maybe quickly editing something you know
uh image or something you know Adobe
Photoshop does exist now on Chrome but
it's it's a web-based version so it has
almost all the same features though you
know and some but you have no connection
doesn't it also cost money like per
month like you can't just buy a license
for it I'm not I believe that's true I
think yeah I think it is a much exact
description I'm not a hundred venture on
that yeah that's why I haven't gone to
the Creative Cloud yet I still have the
this I think yeah it is you have to have
that correct it just looked at yeah so I
mean and it's it's likes cheap either
it's like what 20 bucks a month or
something like ten to get like yeah it's
it's not it's not user friendly
especially if you're like me and you
know you went through the trouble years
ago of buying you know you know cs5 or
cs6 or something and go yeah I switch to
Chrome OS you can still use those tools
online for $50 a month like nope sorry
well I guess my point cost so much that
it's isn't so much that it's where we
need it to be yet but that it's possible
no it's definitely possible and like you
know once Chrome OS starts getting those
you know those hard core tools I will be
much less of a you know one of the
people that are against it so much but
you know currently has I mean I think we
I came ever had this conversation with
you guys on this very podcast or if I
had it with somebody else but you know I
hear this the thing that people say all
the time it like most people can just
switch to Chrome
be okay and you know cuz like and and I
think about that it's like well most
people I know use Photoshop or they play
games or you know they do something have
iTunes or something that you absolutely
cannot recreate on Chrome OS and I think
you know the the way that statistic goes
is you know if every person does ten
things on a computer nine of them could
be done on Chrome OS and one of them
could not and it's that one of them
could not part that really bugs me and
that really you know that keeps me away
from the Chrome OS ecosystem because
like even when I'm not doing work you
know I still game so like I still
couldn't have a Chromebook because it it
would be missing the one feature that I
used on a personal thing that I you know
that I can't also do on my desktop yeah
definitely like is it kind of is out of
line to say that Chrome OS or home books
are somewhat supposed to be used as a
supplementary piece come down to your
let's say desktop computer your your
hardcore desktop computer at home car
you say true could we see Chrome OS
becoming like a desktop solution I don't
think that really no not right now or
not in the way it's going either he's
like even if it gets it because I know
we're gonna talk about this eventually
but I'm gonna bring it up now anyway
even if it gets full Android integration
Chrome OS still can't hold a torch to
the kinds of things you could do on on
an iMac or on a Windows desktop or even
to some extent on the lace well I guess
to a different extent on a Linux desktop
because I mean you have just so many
more tools and so many more things that
you can do you know like putting Chrome
OS on a desktop is kind of like putting
a v8 engine on a tricycle like it's just
like it doesn't make it easy v 8 engine
needs to go in the car and kids ride
tricycles so like it was just it just
seemed wrong like on too many levels to
have a chrome OS desktop at least right
now the obviously version of me is
seething right now like I'll be so cool
I think the more pertinent question is
you were riding tricycles at eight years
old buzz it was it's a five whenever
kindergarten
I remember at my at my school they had
like a shed and there were just
tricycles in there and we would just
ride around the whole school like that
was really fine
so yeah speaking to the Android let's
say the having Android on Chrome OS as
we say as we see here there is also the
possibility or rather there's going to
be tool that allows Android apps to be
used on Chrome OS for testing before
testing is the main word they're feisty
do you have any Android based
applications on your Chrome OS at this
point no not at all why not I've had
known because the ones that are there do
not appeal to me I don't use them on my
Android device why would I use them on
the okay fair enough
I didn't yeah that's that's a big issue
a lot of the apps they have right now
are that they're missing a lot of the
big ones you know it's a lot of the
small ones what do they have I thought
they had Evernote and dang what else was
there like like the Google apps right
though they have most of those apps as
native apps like Google keep for example
has a native app it's not an Android app
it's it's you know it's it's a Chrome OS
app you know as far as I'm probably
should have done a better job of looking
at a time I'm trying to member what all
they have for actual Android apps but
they're it's limited a lot of the big
things like you know if your Facebook's
and stuff aren't there to my knowledge
you know let's see available for ya okay
well let's look at it while groceries
looking that up there might be a a
different angle to this that if Chrome
OS Joe already said that even if Chrome
OS becomes even more Android like it
still won't hold a candle to the to the
full on Windows and Mac desktops that we
have or laptops for that matter but
would that would that further appeal to
someone like you Joe or even see any of
you guys really if Android applications
were natively supported in Chrome OS so
if gaming was an issue maybe you might
be able to throw on like shadow run on
your on your Chromebook pixel or coat or
you know you're not gonna get any of the
super new games obviously but what if
that was a part of the ecosystem by in
like a year it would mitigate a lot of
the the things I don't like about Chrome
OS but I think I don't think it would
completely you know get rid of I mean
yeah I could still play games on that
but I
for me again I can't speak for it this
is not speaking for Everest rickly me
but I have one two three Android devices
in my immediate right reach and one of
them is a tablet if I want to play an
Android game I have my choices at least
two out of the three these devices are
charged 100% at all times so you know a
you know I don't see the point of
getting a laptop that does what my
tablet does already especially when I
already have a laptop and a desktop you
know it's just there's just no place for
something like that to fit in because
it's not really bringing anything new to
the table I think that's part of the
problem though is we're looking at it
from our positions as you know super
nerds know not everyone is going to have
you know a billion phones you know that
none of them have SIM cards inside that
I you know you keep them next to you at
all times I'm not jabbing at anyone in
particular I have faced 25 smartphones
all next to us at once and you know 80
tablets you know and so the reality is
that if you're a consumer especially if
you're consumer in a either emerging
market which right now clouds out of
grapes you know what's still you know
depending on where you are in the
emerging market you know a cloud-based
solution isn't the right solution yet
but it could be eventually anyway or
even if you just have a low budget if
you could get one device like that could
convert into a tablet that could also be
used as a laptop that would probably be
a pretty good you know savings
proposition if it could run everything
that you that you need you know on the
Android side and you can also have a
little bit of desktop side because of
Chrome OS I don't know I could be a good
way to do everything at once and save
yourself some money
yeah I'm saying what uh what
applications fiesty are you waiting for
to take Chrome OS to that next level is
on the Chromebook side of things good
none I don't care I love explain but
Grusha makes an excellent point that I
haven't thought of is a you know if for
example the entire Google Play Store
were available for Chromebooks that
would that certainly open up quite a bit
but I've gone the opposite route and and
this was my purpose when I originally
purchased this specific Chromebook was I
have installed and I run a little
program called crouton what it does is
it allows me to not quite dual-boot but
we'll just for the sake of it will say
dual boot with Chrome OS and then into
just a Ubuntu you know there's different
streams of Linux available but you know
I'm using the precise penguin or
whatever it's called so I've gone the
opposite route is instead of trying to
bring in Android apps and focus and try
and find ones that work there or even
just apps through the Chrome Web Store
I've just got it you know it's a few
keys on the keyboard shortcut and it and
it jumps over and I'm into a full you
know full OS environment and so I've got
all the GIMP image editor and Skype for
example Skype is a big one but if
anybody was missing that and it's really
hard to get Skype going on a Chrome OS
if you even can nonetheless I mean
there's this full OS in the Ubuntu and
Linux
there's the Chrome OS and then there's
the Android apps these devices are
really becoming quite appealing aren't
they yeah well the problem though is
that angle you're going with requires a
lot of tinkering it's not out of the box
you know and that's not gonna work for
everyone and for some of us it might
just be even those who might be able to
do it just for convenience sake why do
that when you can just buy yourself a
Windows or whatever allene a laptop you
know and so it gets down to that uh I do
have a question though for you Feist uh
so what would it take and that's kind of
a you know what would it take for you to
not want to boot into the abouttwo side
what what would Chrome OS need to do
differently
basically as you guys have already
stated it would need to support some
more older and localized apps nah I
didn't learn Photoshop like Joe did
however I did learn the GIMP image
editor and yeah that's you know I can't
run it on the Chrome OS and then that's
almost exclusively what I jump over to
Ubuntu for so without with some you know
again the Chrome OS oh one other thing
that really is shortcoming on it is the
file explorer it's there it works it
functions you can you know can zip and
unzip folders and files and stuff but
yeah it's missing this one key little
thing that I'm accustomed to doing is
selecting a file or two or or 100
whatever right-clicking and saying
properties it doesn't exist here it's
just a basic basic file explorer it
shows you your files and you can do some
copy and pasting you know that sort of
stuff that is really where it flash
works for me can you get by without
those I mean if you're comfortable in an
Android device without a file explorer
then this won't bother you if you're not
doing any serious image editing or
you're comfortable using the online ones
there's one called Pixlr P IX l are a
it's a great little app but I don't like
it but it's a great little app works
fine and its cloud-based and you know
it's a Photoshop mini so to speak and
they'll hate me for saying that because
they believe they have more features
than Photoshop but yet that's another
start you guys feel about the chrome bit
then it's it's it's extending the Chrome
OS into a larger platform per se you
just put in that little dongle as it's
called and put it into the HDMI port on
a TV and now you have a full working
Chrome OS on there is saying I'm seeing
that we understand the limitations of
Chrome OS is this is this a move that
needed to be made do you guys think let
my channel Gary real quick sorry Gary
would say the Raspberry Pi is out there
and the
a few other like MIPS power devices and
stuff that already do this but sorry
Guangzhou and I start channeling Gary
there I guess next time try to the
British accent thing alright sorry no
good at that I won't even try the chrome
bit of all the Chrome OS devices that
have ever come out
I think the chrome bit is the one that
makes the most sense really I I think I
like that a whole lot better than all of
the other ones and the reason for it is
because it's a form factor that is a
that is incredibly weak I mean that you
know yeah we have the chromecast and all
that but can you guys name like an
Android stick or like another stick
computer that has the kind of Cape
from it's one of those things were like
you know when you look at a chrome
Chromebook you know you look at it from
you know being on a Windows laptop or
being on a desktop and looking down at
the Chromebook when you're looking at it
from a computer stick perspective you're
looking up at the chrome bit because the
chrome bit is you know
functionality-wise far and above like
pretty much any other stick computer
that you can probably think of so you
know at least in my and that's just my
opinion by the way but you know it might
in my mind's eye you know if I'm gonna
have you know Chrome OS anywhere it
would be on a little stick that I could
plug in everywhere because I mean that's
essentially what you know the pen Linux
or whatever it's called pen yeah
something like that
yeah something like that yeah you know I
mean that that's the reason why those
things exist is because you know is it
being able to transfer your entire
computing environment from one monitor
to the next and you only have to carry
your peripherals with you like that's
something that seems like it's more
suited for cloud computing than
something like a laptop which you can
take with you anywhere even in the
offline places so yeah I'm kind of going
in circles at this point so I'm gonna
stop talking obviously has to do with
your no it obviously has to do with your
your your use case right cuz honestly
when I think of a little stick that goes
into the into the TV I'm thinking of the
chromecast because what's the main thing
I want to do on a TV is enjoy media
and yes there would be nice to have
maybe a few things that are better
work-related on there but if I would
have a chromecast and I have my
smartphone already anyways on me
then that would be my use cases to just
turn on Netflix or Hulu or YouTube for
that matter so I suppose to me the
chrome bit just kind of seems like it's
such a niche is what I think it seems
like to me yes I know go ahead sorry go
ahead yeah I was gonna say you know it I
can't imagine a use case that couldn't
use something like the chrome bit
because I mean it's you know you have a
little like say bluetooth keyboard or
something you can type on with it you
can still go to Netflix you can still
engage in all of your media since it's
all it says it already has to be on the
cloud anyway so you know you just plug
it in the back of the TV connect to
Wi-Fi and boom you have all of your
music and all your stuff like that no
you have to do is carry on like a you
know a little app there a little uh
keyboard on you all the time which isn't
that bad but uh you know I can't imagine
like you know being able to take that
out and go to a friend's house and plug
it in and you know you still have hooli
still have Netflix and all that stuff it
just seems like it would be more
convenient yeah you know regardless of
the use case then having a lot a whole
laptop to carry around you just have
this little thing and maybe a keyboard
yeah I did give a soos a lot of credit
though eBay this really does seem to be
the company that really believes in what
Google's doing so there are usually the
ones who first put out certain things
like the Chromebook or in this case the
chrome bit I could see it working as a
replacement to my chromecast if I wanted
that extra functionality I suppose but
you know my own hope is that chrome OS
evolves to the point where you have
Android apps working natively on there
for example so if I'm in like a hotel
room I've been traveling a lot recently
if I'm in a hotel room I'm just pop that
thing into a HDMI port on the TV inside
the hotel room and be able to do pretty
much anything I want on that TV that
does sound like a good time to me so but
yeah Grusha you were gonna say something
well yeah I guess to me I think well
you're kind of I don't know say you're
looking at wrong but I think that part
of the point of chrome Bay isn't so much
I think it basically is chrome boxes
have not done well and they haven't done
well because they're kind of pointless
they're big they're bulky
they really don't accomplish anything
beds that special unique and so I think
the chrome bits just an evolution on the
idea basically it's saying hey now it's
smaller now it's more convenient and you
can take it with you where's that
chromeboxes we're big enough that that
wasn't really it you know and so pricing
is not too much more I mean not too much
yeah not too much less on the chrome bit
then you know these chrome boxes but
they're a lot more convenient and I you
know Google has really I think that
they're going after
you know once again people who might
have a monitor sitting around you know
from their last computer but now that
they have a tablet and a smartphone they
don't really want to buy a new computer
but every once in awhile they wouldn't
mind word process you know using our
word processors hype up a document or
during tax time doing this or doing that
well I have a monitor already I already
have a keyboard in the mouse they're all
USB compliant now I can just plug in
this Chrome but bit to the back of my
monitor and I have a cheap computer I
can use for when I need it you know and
so I think it's really more about
appealing to those people who have you
know cuz how many people have a monitor
that would work an HDMI monitor I mean
yeah maybe not as many but that they
aren't using I know I have several I
have two HDMI monitor so not being used
now you know I will say that I've run
into those people who have gotten like a
chromecast and this was when the
chromecast was first announced and I
remember people calling me like how do I
use this thing and then I went to you
know basically be tech support for them
and their TV did not then you know my
ports blows it does happen yeah so I
guess to me I just I think Google's just
Google very much is trying to get you
know this kind of trying to get their
services to people who don't have them
now and I think the crumpets crumpets
just an extension of that you know
opening up I have to agree with you
completely it you know it's just a
transition and a you know another option
out there amongst other options now you
don't need this device it does not fill
a niche but it is a neat little unit to
have and and if you're looking for
something to you know to fill that empty
slot on an unused monitor TV it sounds
great but
than that I mean right now I believe
Best Buy has the of course that's gonna
be dated by the time anybody hears this
podcast but I mean there's a Chromebook
on sale right now for like one hundred
and twenty nine dollars yes
and you can pick up an HDMI cable for
five bucks and so essentially for just a
few dollars more than you know this
chromebit plus bluetooth keyboard you've
got a portable device that is its own
computer with screen that you can just
hook into a computer and do the same
stuff Touche
you you win that one sir yeah not to uh
not to
if you don't mind Josh ever question I
woulda might ask me both that cool yeah
not to hijack the I just have a not at
all we're co-hosts it's not I there was
that like if Google was listening and
you could give them and this is for
anyone and you could give them tip this
isn't on what they could do differently
with with like what functionality would
you like to see on like a chronic
Chromebook or a Chrome OS would you like
to see you know Google Play full store
would you like to see you know support
for Lana what what do you think that
they should would add you know what what
would you give them as advice to make
chrome OS more appealing when compared
to like Microsoft's you know windows and
you know Mac and whatnot well I'm gonna
take a bit of a off-base answer on this
one because I haven't think invited
since we were talking about like the
Chromebook pixel and whatnot I was there
when the Chromebook pixel was first
announced and I remember seeing the
specs on and I thought man that's a
great looking laptop with some pretty
good specs I want necessary to be able
to get too much done on that not just
because of carmelize but because the
specs themselves are not really geared
towards the hard core creator slash
gamer type I want to see Chromebooks
that have the specifications of a let's
say ultra book like the one I have right
now and perhaps maybe Google can start
to push the idea that you know much like
when Mac finally real oh when Apple
finally realized you know there's
certain things that out that that
Windows will be able to do that our mac
OS won't be able to and one of those
main things was gaming and eventually
they create boot camp I would love to
see Google create some sort of that's a
campaign or some sort of software that
will allow you to dual boot from one to
the other and wasn't there something
where Chrome OS was a
actually like you could try it out
within your windows yeah if you have
Windows 8 basically you you pretty much
if you go into you know the Metro desk
what do you want to call there you know
Start menu and you uh and you boot it as
there as a Start app it will come full
screen it will basically have almost
everything that you could do on a
Chromebook other than like you can't
change wallpaper and there's a few other
little things that are not the same but
it's bolstered that a little bit I would
love a dual booting system where if I
needed to do the creative stuff I could
be in Windows but if I wanted to tap
into Chrome OS without having to reboot
then of course you could have that that
simulator or whatever you want to call
it and it will tap into the Chrome OS
side of the partition I think they'll be
awesome and then when I just want to get
some work done and have you know cuz
someone said back at an end WC I think
it was Sascha over at mobile geeks when
we were on the podcast together he said
it's better to have a device that
doesn't allow you to get distracted
because it doesn't even have the
capabilities of distracting you so if
you have like the Chrome OS just for
work I would be okay with that because I
see the appeal of that but for times
when I do just want to sit down and play
something yeah as an experiment when at
first when that functionality you know
that you mentioned it first came out I
started using that in in the metro
desktop and exclusively like for like a
week like I would not boot back it you
know I was just using the interface and
after a while you didn't notice it until
you did you know main like like when it
came to just loading up like you know
doing things like on WordPress for work
and you know Android authority you know
just little stuff and just even personal
stuff looking up social networks didn't
notice at all until all of a sudden you
get the urge to play a game or do
something and that's when you notice
then you notice hard but you get what
they did a good job with the interfaces
what I'm saying like it feels like any
other operating system you know hmm uh
but then it's not mine is really quick
so I'll go um Josh you were talking
about the ability to you know dual boot
into other operating systems mine's kind
of a copy of that idea but vice-versa
instead of you know me having to buy
google hardware and then you know go buy
a copy of Windows and dual boot into
Windows I would much rather I would much
prefer to get a copy of Chrome OS and
dual boot on my existing Windows
hardware oh yeah I can't do that by the
way I know I can't take my do that it's
called Chrome browser and I know you can
do that even more than that just like
okay you know how Chrome has the open
source side chromium right yes so does
Chrome OS there's chromium OS oh good
the problem is like many other Linux
distros you can do it but like I tried
it once on one of my old HP laptops it
ran like crap
exactly you know capably issue all right
fine I will rephrase that for mr. I
don't understand sarcasm they're a
functioning well performing dual boot
with my windows hardware because you
know it's one of those things where it's
difficult to even you know I mean yeah
you can run the emulator you can get the
chromium OS or you know I maintain that
using Chrome browser is essentially
using Chrome OS you know - a large
features especially with all the RAM it
takes up like you know you got 4
gigabytes of RAM swallowed up into a
browser it's running a freaking
operating system I don't care what
anybody says but the idea that I can't
test it I can't play with it I can't
really do much with it unless I go and
spend even if it's only a hundred and
twenty dollars that's still a hundred
and twenty dollars that I have to you
know sit down before I can even decide
if I like this this operating system or
not and that's really the number one
deterrent for me for trying out Chrome
OS is that I don't have a means to do so
reliably without actually buying the
hardware and you know if I end up not
liking it then I just wasted $120 on
something I could have you know I could
have gone to the movies like five times
with that or something you know I could
have done something enjoyable with that
instead I'm gonna you know sit around
with this you know if I if I don't like
it this aging dust it does no Chrome
book on my desk going why did I
by you I hate you you know my mistake
staring me in the face every day like
this waterproof Bluetooth speaker that
cost me $20 and doesn't work anymore
does what you get for buying something
at the checkout come on it was an Amazon
add-on I you know that's exactly the
same thing there you go guys there's
your Joe's an idiot we are your Joe's an
idiot thing for the week holy crap I
didn't think about it that way if I want
to try Linux I can download 40 50
different kinds of Linux and if I want
to try you know a Mac I can I mean
granted I'd have to do some stuff to my
computer you know get some something
different there but I mean I can build a
hackintosh and you know get Mac for free
and try it without I not know it's
piracy I'm sorry I don't condone that
behavior but I can try it before I go
and spend $3,000 on a MacBook but with
chrome you know there's no way to try
there's no really way to really immerse
yourself to get into that kind of
experience unless you buy the hardware
as well because mean like crushy said
you know the software just doesn't run
that well outside of chromebook hardware
and I think that's really disappointing
I'd like to you know well I mean to be
fair though the same goes for hackintosh
you have to build them you have to make
sure you have specific parts and I'm
sure you could have a great working
chromium OS experience too with the
right hardware
you know I'd be okay with that but you
know I don't know what the hardware is I
don't know where they've built the
drivers I mean you can go find the
hackintosh specs it's really easy and
Intel I bla with Ajith with the NVIDIA
GeForce GTX bla with you know and then
you just have to figure out though the
motherboard and the you know yeah just
the motherboard at that point cuz it'll
accept pretty much any RAM in hard drive
so you know it's like you have to go
shopping for one parts otherwise you
know I mean my five-year-old laptop
downstairs is hackintosh compatible so
you know it's not I mean yeah you do
have to do some special stuff but it's
not that difficult to even accident'
Tilly build or own a computer that's
hackintosh compliant I guess is what I'm
saying yeah all right well we'll go
ahead and head over to feisty then I am
sorry crushy can you reiterate your you
can you say your ears so basically if
you give Google advice and you got
touched on this with Feist to an extent
but if you give them advice on how they
could better either change it or market
it or what they could do differently to
make it more remain to give it more
mainstream appeal what would be eat the
big things I hesitate to say these words
but I'm going to they need to be a
little bit more user friendly now
certainly Google user friendly you know
and I mean our podcast shuts off okay
yes okay the whole marketing campaign of
the Chromebook is it's extreme
simplicity but just step it up to go
beyond the browser so to speak in Chrome
OS it gets complicated
I mean Linux people you know in the days
of old Linux people that you know people
used to be scared of it because you
always had to go to the command line and
you know it's difficult you have to
remember these weird codes and do these
odd things and create your own drivers
and I don't think that's true anymore
most you know the bigger streams I keep
saying Ubuntu because that's where I get
stuck at but you know it works out of
the box you don't have to deal with all
the stuff unless you want to however
with the Chrome OS I'm going into the
terminal so to speak quite a bit I'm
running crash commands just to be able
to get through and not so much for
day-to-day browsing I mean you can open
up a a tab and go to Facebook or Google+
whatever it is for you but if you want
to do anything else it it takes a bit of
nerdy tweaking to get there and I think
that needs to be eliminated it just
needs to be a little bit more user
friendly to do more stuff on the device
and then from there I echo what you guys
were talking about a nerdy tweaking yes
sorry comment here from one of the guys
echoing what you guys said you know
having that access the the dual boot
kind of stuff whether you take Chrome OS
and dual boot it into your other
computer or or have this dual boot into
Microsoft OS for most people
let me quickly again explain how the the
Linux sort of speak dual booting word
works here and it's not an actual dual
boot because again Chrome OS is Linux
base it has that same Linux kernel this
kirtan program lets you you again it's
just a basically boots the new OS into a
window if you will it's a little bit
more than that but you know you just
ctrl alt forward on your keyboard and
you're into that entirely different
environment and then ctrl alt back and
you're back to the Chrome OS environment
kind of like not that great you know
that's a great way to explain it yes a
virtual machine chroot if anybody is in
the note cares
it's a chroot so to speak virtual
machine so I mean it's not requiring you
to shut down the Machine and bring it
back up as a dual boot setup it just I
mean it's there and if the Windows
programs that people are accustomed to
and Nolan love we're also available that
easy I think this thing would be killer
however it doesn't have it and I end up
slamming the lid closed and walking away
from it quite often mm-hmm
what's the worst feeling to have to do
something like that slamming the same
lid down saying I'm done with you for
today we're going out or in Joe's case
like why are you here I hate you that
was a Josie you were here I hate you and
I it's just like either way if I see
explain it's almost like he has like
it's like having a fight with your
girlfriend or something like a you know
what I'm gonna go near the room and cool
down I'm not talking to you anymore
you get asleep on the couch Chromebook
go for a go for a walk yeah
it's time for bed Chrome I oh that's
great um all right awesome the UH we
have talked at length about Chrome OS
and it looks like
were pretty succinct in what we all
thought about Chrome in general
personally I think that the chromecast
was a very well it was almost a game
changer and for the for the for the
Chrome ecosystem and go forward
obviously we're talking about something
very different with Chrome OS and chrome
looks compared to the chromecast but you
know that they're taking that form
factor and trying to put it into
something like the chrome bit I don't
know if brushing you had any more you
wanted to cover on and the topic or if
we kind of covered it pretty adequately
I mean yeah I think we covered most the
big things I mean there's definitely
more that could be said but I mean yeah
I guess I feel like for me I think
Google's if I had to give Google advice
I would just say that keep doing what
they're doing I mean like they're I
they're slowly bringing like they're
slowly bringing Chrome App support to
Android and they're relying more and
more on web-based code and I think the
idea of someday and I think that's where
Google is heading is that you'll be able
to run the same app on your Windows
machine your Mac your uh your at your
iPhone your you know Android phone your
Chrome OS device because it will all be
ran through Chrome you know and that's
what that's what Google is aiming for
they want the cloud to all run through
Chrome and it's there already laid the
groundwork and I think there just need
to keep doing what they've been doing
and I actually I thought that Chrome OS
was a stupid idea
I'll a minute I'll be probably quite
frank it wasn't that was stupid I just
didn't see it would have enough appeal I
always liked the idea of cloud computing
I just I thought it was too early and
was probably right it was too early but
Google wasn't Google didn't care about
the media they cared about the long game
you know yeah and so I think they're
just laying all the pieces and I think
each year we're gonna see just a little
bit more of that vision come forward and
I think eventually more and more people
will say yeah they are going somewhere
with this and it's kind of cool you know
and so a Google does it alone
what's that going oh I just gonna say
that that Google has enough resources
that they can wait about until it gets
to where it needs to be and I think that
the competition will continue
to shoot themselves in the foot in other
ways you know I think Microsoft has a
good CEO finally so that's helping them
a little but a lot of damage was done
with Windows 8 even though I personally
and I know Joe personally had no major
issue with Windows a a lot of people did
and so Microsoft has been you know for
the consumer side for the business side
it still is great but for the consumer
side it's lost a lot of faith from
people and people hate change
yep that's the problem well and even on
Mac I mean Macs have seen a lot of
growth but I think that girls starting
this it doesn't seem like it's as as
crazy as it was for a few years seems
like it's starting to you know it's the
same thing with their iPhones the people
who buy Mac books are going to buy Mac
books forever and I don't think it's
growing more people anymore so I'm
saying for a while I was going through
this you know nexus of change you know
where the people were just jumping
aboard and switching over and I think I
think it's slowing down a bit and so I
think that Google just needs to play
play their long game and keep it going
and so yeah I think we did a great great
job you know I Jonathan I think you had
some things you want to say though no I
just wanted to add on kind of what you
were saying there is and speaking to the
hardware side of it which I know isn't
really Google's control but and then I
think there needs to be more options you
had mentioned you know having a really
high-end machine where the pixel is you
know fairly high end as far as
Chromebook goes but let's just look at a
price point right now you can get pretty
much every Chromebook for less than 300
or the pixel for over a thousand where's
the middle ground where's the 500 the
$800 units amen I don't that's all that
is
yeah no mid-range it's either super high
end or super low a hacker
all right great well that should
probably do it for this week's edition
of the Friday debate podcast by Android
authority we are of course talking about
or we just talked about Chrome OS
Chromebooks chrome bit chromecast who
knows what would be next Chrome fridge
we're talking about their implications
on it now there was one aspect of this
question that I did want to get into but
I actually think I'm still pushing for
great
to approve that help approved this one
day that we talk about security in terms
of mobile and the whole idea of the you
know the cloud and all your data is in
the cloud we have had hacks in the past
and stuff like that maybe that'll be an
aspect for that particular show sometime
in the future but security when it comes
to security when it comes to mobile
computing is something that I'm really
kind of into because it's really
interesting to me that someone's life
could get ruined basically because of
some data that got kind of shot up into
the air and all of a sudden someone was
able to pull it back down but any case
chrome Chromebooks in terms of feisty
being the only person who has it you
know he was able to give us a lot of
good insight on it we gave her opinions
on the rest so as always make sure you
listen to the Friday debate podcast and
all the different podcast networks if
you're on the YouTube version as per
usual there's a card over on the corner
so you can find our link to the Friday
debate podcast post at Android or decom
and find yourself some links to all of
our social media websites and also to
download the podcast to one of your
podcast programs if you're not using one
already like podcast stitcher and any of
the rest like even itunes we are
actually going to start taking some
feedback from our fans we're going to
probably put some sort of poll as andrew
was telling me right before the show in
order for you guys to give us maybe
different topics that you want to hear
us talk about or even just have some
questions for us maybe we'll do some
sort of a Q&amp;amp;A episode when we get enough
questions from the fans so make sure you
keep it tuned for that
go on to our social media and tag us in
your tweets when you're listening to the
Friday to be a podcast or just talk
about it with the hashtag FD P that
should pretty much do it and we will see
you guys next week we're probably going
to record earlier in the week next week
because I'm actually going to be gone by
Friday off to just a tiny little mini
vacation for myself so we'll probably
record a little bit earlier next week
and hopefully with a couple of solutions
I have in place I'm not gonna have those
audio issues I had last week that made
me do a double feature for today so I
hope you guys are enjoying both episodes
of the Friday debate that are coming out
today
that should do it for episode number 11
of the Friday debate podcast and guys
will go ahead and do our outro thank you
so much for listening and for watching
on our YouTube channel and for reading
