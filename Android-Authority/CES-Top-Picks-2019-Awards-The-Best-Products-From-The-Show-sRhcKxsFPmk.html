last day of the show we just wanted to
point out the products that really
caught our attention this year so this
is our best of CES 2018 list for the
best smartphone we picked the Alcatel 1
X 4 it's extremely high price to
performance ratio it's got that nice
dual camera with 13 megapixels we just
think it's a really good buy the best
laptop we picked the Dell Alienware area
51 M which is basically a desktop in a
laptop you can upgrade all the
components it looks really nice it's
just a nice upgrade from last year the
best part much of the show is gonna have
to go to the Kate Spade scalloped
SmartWatch 2 or it looking really nice
performing really nice no raw we just
think it's probably the nicest
SmartWatch that's here at CES for the
best fitness product this year we've got
the Withings move ECG and it's pretty
insane that you can get an ECG in a
SmartWatch that's 130 dollars it also
looks really nice has really nice colors
that's probably the best fitness
accessory we saw this year for the best
smart home product we've got the Google
assistant Connect because it's really
nice that you can just make any of your
home appliances smart and you can use
them with Google assistant so we're
really excited to see that roll out
later this year so the best audio
products we've got the audio technica
ath AMC 900 BT and it's just a really
nice set of headphones the guy is sound
guys looked at it in detail so go check
it out on their website the best concept
we've got the whirlpool connected hub a
wall oven it it's got a 27 inch
transparent OLED which takes the place
of a traditional oven door and LSU
calendars look up recipes and even
suggest personalized meal ideas based on
your dietary restrictions for the best
mobile accessory we've got the corning
gorilla glass case and it's really
interesting that you can put really
glass on your gorilla glass phone to
make it kind of double protection and
you can pair it whatever you want on it
so that's really interesting we're
hoping to see this roll out later this
year for the best innovation we've got
the LG signature
OLED TV our which like last year was a
concept at the show but now it's an
actual product it's really expensive but
it is really cool and I'd love to have
something like this in my home
so that was it for our best of CES 2019
the show is basically over but we got
NWC coming up in just a month and
there's a lot more stuff coming up soon
make sure you stay tuned to the channel
and stay tuned to the website as well
for all the latest on all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
