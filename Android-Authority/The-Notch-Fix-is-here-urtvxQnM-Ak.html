but it turns out that a moderator over
at XDA feels your pain and he has a
solution okay it's a little bit better
than that it's an app called nacho not
because the knotch is not your brand
that's right it's called nacho notch or
the notch hider created by an XD a
moderator and it takes the top of your
phone from this to this and it does that
by of course blackening out the very top
of your phone you are giving up some
real estate but for those of you who
have an irrational hate for the knotch
this is your friend now this might all
be moot because there is talk about OMS
providing a notch toggle that's writing
the knotch thing just does it leave the
news cycle and it gets worse because the
co-founder of one-plus was talking to
the verge and put his notch into his
mouth Carl Pie's interview with the
verge where he explains why the company
is including the knotch display with the
1 plus 6 was well intentioned but it
became a PR nightmare for one plus on
damage control carp I deleted his tweet
promoting the interview and now 1 plus
CEO P Lau has posted a message to 1 plus
fans on the company's official forum he
also explains that the users made it
clear that they don't want 1 plus phones
to get bigger but they do want more
screen space
he says the knotch display as of now is
the only way to appease users he went
preemptively dismissing progressive
designs like the vivo apex with his
pop-up selfie camera as being too new to
include on a phone like the 1 + 6 now to
be fair that is a valid point if you
remember the Oppo phone from a few years
ago Josh reviewed it and it had that
flipping lens camera feature work it
flipped back and forth and he pointed
out at the time that there is a lot of
moving parts and a hardware feature like
that too many opportunities for that to
break down over time
I think the notch is here to stay my
question is why do so many people have
so much venom for the knotch is it just
because Apple did it first because come
on they were trying to fine
a way to increase screen real estate and
not have to move the camera yeah I don't
really care why do you guys care so much
let me know in the comments below now
let's talk about what was once the king
of mid-range devices and I'm talking
about the Moto G specifically the Moto G
6 a hungarian retail site just posted
listings of the motorola moto g 6 the
Moto G 6 plus and the Moto G 6 play with
the information provided in the listings
we have confirmation of all the specs of
the upcoming mid-range Motorola phones
as expected the Motorola g6 line
features a bunch of spec upgrades from
the Moto G 5 line released last year
most notably a move to 18 9 display
ratios the Moto G 6 and G 6 plus feature
dual cameras and fingerprint sensors on
the front while the Moto G 6 play
features a single camera and a rear
fingerprint sensor and as expected none
of the phones have a notch now let's
talk a leek surrounding the honor 7a
which not only shows a tall display but
the return of a microUSB port huawei's
sub-brand
honor might have another affordable
smartphone on the way as a new leak
appears to have outed the design and
specs of the honor 7a according to slash
leaks the honor 7a will sport a 5.7 inch
display with 1440 by 720 resolution and
an 89 aspect ratio also around the front
is reportedly an 8 megapixel camera with
LED flash while dual 13 megapixels and 2
megapixel camera sits around the back
under the hood the honor 7a will
reportedly feature a snapdragon 430
chipset 3 gigabytes of ram 32 gigabytes
of on-board storage and a 3000 milliamp
hour battery we don't know yet if the
phone will support microSD cards though
it seems to feature a micro USB port for
charging and syncing based on the leaked
image the honor 7a will not have a
fingerprint sensor supposedly in its
place is facial recognition for
authentication along with the usual
array of pattern pin and swipe methods
now if these leaks are correct honor
will announce this on April 2nd just a
few days away so we will keep you up to
date now if you want to get serious
