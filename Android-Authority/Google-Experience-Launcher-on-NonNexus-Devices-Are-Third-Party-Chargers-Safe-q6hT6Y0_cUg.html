Jace and this is where we try and answer
your most pressing and drug questions
like why is it that the Google
Experience launcher is exclusive to
Nexus and Google Play edition devices
and why is it that I can't talk and surf
on my phone at the same time and Jace
did you know that roda means beard in
Polish pack vm such a name it all right
let's start off with some Google
Experience launcher envy hey Jace quick
question buddy do you have any idea why
the Google now experienced launcher is
exclusive to the Nexus and Google Play
edition phones also will it be released
two more Android devices yes that is a
good question Brian and we don't really
know for sure I asked other android
authority staff what they thought about
it and most of them feel that this is
really about google marking its
territory which could be true I would
also add to that that Google can't force
manufacturers to use stock Android but
Google can make Android so compelling
and so appealing that they force Android
users to demand for their manufacturers
that they bring us at least somewhat
closer to using vanilla Android but
Brian if you're willing to wield some
geekery magic you don't have to wait you
can follow the links below for
instructions on how to sideload the
Google Experience launcher yourself
Marlin Cruickshank had a question
regarding using voice and data at the
same time Jase why can't you talk on the
phone and browse the internet at the
same time while using the nexus 5 thanks
for the question Marlin it's a good one
I know many other people have suffered
from the issue if you remember a number
of years ago when 18t first acquired the
iphone 18 to put out a commercial with a
bumbling idiot husband who forgot his
wife's anniversary oh my god too cliche
and the fact that the ATT phone could do
voice and data at same time allowed him
to book a wedding anniversary event
without his wife knowing that he forgot
it but it is generally considered to be
a cdma issue right so with carriers like
Verizon and Sprint it's especially an
issue but though not all I found some
forums where users on verizon said that
they didn't have this issue it's also
considered to be a tri-band issue which
concerns me because the Nexus 5 is dual
band so you should check with you
Karen see if there's a way that you can
sort that out if not you might want to
consider changing carriers when your
contract is ended good luck Marley next
question helps out all you travel bugs
who want to take advantage of Google's
location services hey Jase how do I tell
Google that I'm now living in a
different country well Samuel it will
only take a minute follow these
instructions you should be fine go to
the Google homepage on the bottom right
hand side select settings in that pop up
click on search settings then select
location where you can fill in your
location and benefit from Google's
location services like Google now now
Neil brought us a new battery question
that I haven't read before hey Jace does
using a 2 amp or higher charger have a
negative impact on your phone's battery
my Nexus 5 gets quite warm when plugged
into a samsung galaxy tablet charger so
Neil first warning if your phone is
getting warm from using a different
charger don't use that charger use the
proprietary charger if you can and you
avoid warranty issues you don't want to
do that now you should know that each
phone has a chip that controls how much
power it can draw so in theory if you're
using a 2 amp charger the phone can only
draw 1 amp or whatever specifications
that particular phone has so generally
speaking not a good idea thanks for
watching a droid army my name is Jace
