speaker needs to listen to you to hear
for instructions but the new Google Home
minis up until recently have been
listening to everything all the time
Google home minis touch activation had
prompted an error which saw some units
almost permanently record conversations
around them but Google was quick to
release a fix for it
despite this google has now said it will
permanently disable that part of the
functionality in a bid to allay further
fears in a statement a 9 to 5 Google the
company said and I quote we take user
privacy and product quality concerns
very seriously although we only received
a few reports of this issue we want
people to have complete peace of mind
while using Google home mini we have
made the decision to permanently remove
all top-notch functionality on the
Google home Mini as before the best way
to control or activate your Google home
Mini is through your voice by saying ok
Google or hey Google which is already
how most people engage with our Google
home products you can also adjust the
volume by using the touch control on the
side of the device now you know what
this really gets my goat because when
companies like Google say that they care
about our privacy concerns and they want
us to have a peace of mind when it comes
to those privacy concerns it's sort of
like a big oil company saying hey we
really care about the environment and
then they sell us billions dollars of
fossil fuel that soul sucks our
environment yeah Google's basic
fundamental business model and large
tech companies like it are based on
collecting private data personal data
and using that to sell us stuff you
can't really care about our privacy the
way we want to care about it because
those interests are in direct conflict
with each other
so no they may turn off this
functionality and this particular issue
on this particular product may not work
anymore may not collect your data but
there are hundreds thousands of other
ways that they are collecting your
personal data now I don't want to go
overboard here I want to clarify that
Google
and tech companies like Google do not
care about your individual data they're
not looking at your emails your tax or
your phone calls it's valuable to them
and aggregate with everyone else within
your social group right so for example
they care about my data as they care
about my whole group all middle-aged
white guys in southwestern Ontario have
a certain income University grads in a
certain country you know if you're a
female university student from Gujarat
that's a whole certain segment that they
will sell stuff to that's that's the
kind of data that's valuable to them in
aggregate not individual stuff so you
please don't worry that Apple and Google
are reading your personal text they
don't care about your personal stuff
it's valuable to them in aggregate let's
talk about some better news specifically
leaks surrounding the Oppo f5 Oppo has
confirmed the launch markets for its
first full screen smartphone the Oppo f5
coming October 26th the latest device in
opals selfie expert series will be made
available in India Indonesia Malaysia
Myanmar the Philippines Thailand and
Vietnam though details of what the
handset will offer are currently scarce
Oppo has revealed only a few bits of
information about the f5 which they gave
to us via email most notably that it
will feature a full HD display with 2160
by 1080 resolution and an AI beauty
recognition technology Oppo says the f5
will use the AI to beautify selfie shots
learning the unique facial features of a
subject for example the nose cheek lower
jaw etc to make the best enhancements
for each image regardless of the facial
expressions or shooting angle the AI
component is also said to understand the
differences between age and gender to
make the most appropriate tweaks for
each subject and will self learn to
improve future pictures and we also have
good news for those of you who are
looking forward to the Galaxy s8 active
Evan Blas folded up on his report from
September 29th with an image of what's
alleged to be the Galaxy s8 active for
t-mobile looking at the image there's no
notable difference between t-mobile's
and 18 T's version of the device Evan
got his hands on marketing
revealing that the t-mobile's variant of
the s8 active will carry the model
number SMG 8 9 2 t this isn't surprising
based on the fact that the 18 t version
of the device is already available in
retails for 850 bucks and it has the
same model number with the a at the end
and this matters because of course the
active models have traditionally been
exclusive to AT&amp;amp;T now if you're Timo
blur you have the option well as someone
who runs an online business I can tell
you that I look for tools that make my
life easier and our sponsor fresh books

they make online payments and accounting
much less painful and how do they do
that exactly

input your receipts you can take
pictures of your receipts with your
phone using fresh bookses mobile apps

Android and in the section where it says
how you've heard about us Phil in
Android authority now I'm curious to
know what you guys think of the whole
privacy issue with not just Google but
of course what's happening with oneplus
and all these tech companies they want
our data they need our data data is now
more valuable than oil yes as of this
year that's officially happened I don't
know how they measure that but it's
happened and these press releases that
are written you know with subtle
manipulation and they're leaving out
bits of information just to allay the
concerns and fears of sheep people who
either don't think about it deeply or
just don't care enough to think about it
deeply your privacy is done it's been
done for more than a decade and any
notion that they care about your privacy
is utter nonsense let me know what you
think about it in the comments below and
