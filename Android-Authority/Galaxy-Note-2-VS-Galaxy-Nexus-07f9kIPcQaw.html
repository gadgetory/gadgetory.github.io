we're live at the ground in Berlin over
the Samsung unpacked event we just
gotten outside we did have a chance to
meet with Samsung before seven hours
before the event for pre briefing where
we brought you a lot of great verses
obviously we're looking at the Galaxy
Note 2 it's the star of the show so just
comparing here to the Galaxy Nexus
obviously these are two totally
different devices for different product
categories both are running Android 4.1
jelly bean with his famous 60 frames a
second guaranteed minimum performance
this is a 5.5 inch screen it is running
almost similar very similar resolution
it's obviously got a 16 by 9 profile 5.5
inches but it's a skippy 1280 by 720 5.5
inch panel and it isn't of the pentile
matrix variety it's powered by 1.6
gigahertz quad-core Exynos processor
obviously with the Galaxy Nexus although
it's a lot better in the hand it's only
a four point six inch screen and for
some people that's going to be a lot
better anyway we're just taking a quick
look at the Galaxy Nexus versus the
samsung galaxy note 2
one of these is very old this is the
Galaxy Nexus device made by samsung and
this is obviously made by something as
well anyway no word on availability yet
we heard from their Director of Product
Marketing in the States it's going to be
guaranteed to come out sometime in q3 q4
no word on pricing yet as well this one
also has a microSD expansion so you can
have up to 128 gigabytes of our total
potential storage anyway guys here we
are the the unpack for Lin event from
Samsung check it out pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
