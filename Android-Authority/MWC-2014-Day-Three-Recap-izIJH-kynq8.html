by bitdefender mobile security hey it's
josh regard from andrew i thought it
what's going on everybody and I'm here
with Darcy lock away of course and the
two of us have been running around mwc
with our lead editor bug done giving you
all of the great coverage of all of the
big announcements here at the mobile
world congress in barcelona spain today
is day three for us and if you saw day
to yesterday I gave a little story about
how hard it is to get there but how nice
it is to come back home after a show
like this and that's exactly how we're
feeling right now we it's yet another
crazy day up and I'm gonna let Darcy
start off our recap of what we were
doing today was a pretty long day but a
very productive day too yeah i mean
breakfast it by saying you know we were
portion enough to attend a dinner with a
lot of LG guys last night we've got our
copy review copy the LG G pro two which
were fortunate met some really cool
people stay tuned stay tuned for some
coverage of leg up it'll become really
soon we were really swamped with devices
right now and then after I was fortunate
to attend a private function with
Motorola and they talked about
revitalization of the brand how they're
really excited to take advantage of the
economies of scale that Lenovo is
ringing and you know we're going to be
digging really deep on that but I'm
really a lot of wonderful people in
motorola and that said they're going to
be releasing a SmartWatch in the next
few months but it's gonna have a really
improved design / anything that's on the
market so we're going to be going really
hard call on that and then today today
was a lot of relationship stuff and also
we give away our awards as well you know
passed it off to Josh alright so we do
have a lot of awards that we gave out
today you'll be able to find them if you
look hard enough on their particular
websites but we did give an award away
to and and yes there are specific
devices for these but we'll go through
them in a nice little round up to tell
you exactly which device has got them
but we can tell you this much we gave
awards to lenovo to LG we also give an
award to alcatel and really just showing
them that some of the products that they
have especially the ones announced here
at mwc really they really capture what
it is to be a best in that category
and if you remember our CES awards it's
the same vein here but we have even more
than we did at CES we have a total of
how many was it eight yeah eight awards
that we have for this particular show so
stay tuned for our best of video showing
you exactly what awards were given out
in for what devices people are wondering
exactly why something as they say as
incrementally up in the step from the
galaxy s4 is getting so much attention
well here's my thought on that I've been
wanting to say it's for a little while
now it may not be that the galaxy s5 is
an incredibly remarkable device you know
that's it's arguable it's arguable but I
will tell you this Samsung has a knack
for putting in just enough things just
the right amount of stuff in the next
phone that you have to talk about no
feature on the galaxy s5 can be glossed
over you have to talk about it you have
to talk about the heart rate monitor
even if it's why is it there you have to
talk about it and you know what once you
start talking about those little
features selective focus in the camera I
so cell 16 megapixel camera I'm taught
water waterproofing on the first
waterproof phone out of Samsung's camp
that isn't an active phone you have to
talk about those features and once you
start talking about the features you
can't stop it just keeps coming that's
what I think is the charm of the Samsung
Galaxy S line and the s5 is totally just
fulfilling that completely and I wanted
the other stuff too I mean with the gear
fit you know in the gear 2 and the neo
we really impress the stuff across the
line ninja you know in order to really
cover it fully we really have to go
hands-on a deep and you know consumers
really want to know yeah samsung puts
everything they operate a breakneck pace
and whether or not you are a fan of what
Samsung is put out at the mwc here in
Barcelona have fun watching all the
videos really diving into the software
into why the gear fit might be a great
peripheral for you even if you're not
much of a smartphone or smart watch or a
let's say a fitness buff but also the
camera on the galaxy s5 we like we said
the other day it's the camera on the s5
that we think people are going to talk
about the most it's yeah it's great and
that is the reason why we end up talking
about Samsung because you have to talk
about it and
well once you start you can't stop it's
the iso cell you know I people don't
really know what I so cell is but you
are going to want to know because it
represents a huge shift in camera
technology and the s5 is the world's
first to have it and other vendors are
going to be accessing it but of course
Samsung with the proprietary technology
they focused on the image sensor
business several years ago and now they
have I think over fifty percent market
share of all image sensors that are
shipped into smartphones mobile devices
Sony used to have the crown now
Samsung's got the crown and we're going
to be going really deep on it so stay
tuned guys will be infinite yeah thank
