authority my arm techcon 2015
Californian I've come to the green hills
boots talked to Joe hi Joe hey Gary how
you doing I'm well thank you tell us a
little bit but you're rollator
greenhills sure I'm a director of
platform solutions at green hills
software I work with a lot of our
silicon as well as software ecosystem
partners to build reference platforms
for different vertical markets so
Internet of Things it's the buzzword we
haven't really got much in the way of
consumer products yet people still
developing them but that's where you
help them out because in the development
stage now the fear is we don't want our
fridges are microwaves are wearables all
being hacked baby monitors security is
being hacked and you've got some
security systems some security solutions
for people developing I o TQ tell me a
bit about that sure security has been a
very keen focus of green hills since we
first created our integrity real-time
operating system back in the mid-90s in
fact some of the requirements for
integrity when it was being created was
something called orange be orange book
level a1 which for government and
defense systems was the highest level
security standard at the time that is
evolved into something called the
international standard common criteria
for security certifications and
integrity is the only operating system
in the world that's ever been evaluated
to the highest level e al 6 plus the
O'Neill places them in the world that's
right wow yeah so you know we're very
serious about security and we have
architected things into integrity to
enable the highest levels of security
not only that but we also a few years
ago formed a subsidiary company to focus
on other areas related to IOT security
and that is things specific to the
Internet of Things as soon as you have a
device on the internet of things of
course it's communicating and so we have
crypt embedded cryptographic toolkits as
well as everything for managing secure
communication authentication and the
entire lifecycle of a device from the
time it's manufactured and doing the key
injection to the management of that
device in the field and doing secure
firmware over-the-air updates managing
the certificates and and everything
around security that's a complete lie so
from men
factoring through two when you throw it
away you're covering the whole thing
that's a great solution okay now you
were telling me earlier you've got
something for Android as well tell me a
bit about that sure with our integrity
real-time operating system ants and
separation colonel we also offer a
technology called multi visor and that
provides a virtualization platform where
we can host guest operating systems like
linux or android and in fact we've done
this in several different markets and
the idea there is that you have a very
rich ecosystem in something like android
and you might want to develop you know
like an IV I system using Android to
take advantage of the App Store and
everything that's good and great about
Android but linux and android are not
necessarily great for security and so we
use these proven separation concepts in
integrity to allow you to have that
great user experience with android
button migrate the security critical
components over to be native integrity
applications where we can keep them
separate and secure and so that's
another part of this whole thing is
architecting the system to identify
those security critical or safety
critical components and move them over
to be native integrity applications that
sounds actually fantastic so it for real
high levels security serious
applications people could build their
own bespoke system maybe a tablet or
interface somehow usual stuff and it's
completely secure that's right in fact
we've done examples of mobile devices
smartphones in the past we've done ivi
systems medical devices so all of these
different areas we've applied this
technology to attain the highest levels
of safety and security well that's just
great Joe thanks very much for your time
you're welcome
