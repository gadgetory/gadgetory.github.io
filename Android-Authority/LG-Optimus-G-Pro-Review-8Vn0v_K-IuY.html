to be the year of the 5-inch 1080p
screen device however what if you need
just a little bit more out of your
smartphone well there really only were
just a couple devices out there that
fulfilled the need for a device that was
bigger than a regular phone but smaller
than a tablet and luckily LG has decided
to throw their own name in the category
with their newest release a drop of agar
from Android Authority what's going on
everybody and what you're looking at
here is certainly the biggest phone that
I have ever used this is the lg optimus
G pro this is by far the largest
smartphone that LG has ever put out and
that does come with a number of expected
aspects the Optimus G pro comes with a
5.5 inch screen that makes the entire
form factor almost six inches tall and
it is just about as thick as the Samsung
Galaxy Note 2 at nine point four
millimeters the blends on the LG are
pretty typical with the power button on
the right opposite the volume rockers
you get the home button on the face of
the phone flanked by back and menu
buttons it even has an LED rim around
the home button for notifications a 2.1
megapixel front facing camera is up top
the main addition here is the inclusion
of a cue button at the very top left of
the device for programming a specific
shortcuts coming around the back you
have the 13 megapixel camera surrounded
by a flash diode a speaker an LG's
typical but beautiful crystal reflection
pattern
the only other feature of the back cover
that is probably most important is the
fact that it can be removed we'll get to
the bits underneath but calm your nerves
the Optimus G pro is capable of
expandable memory and the battery is
replaceable oh and yes there is an
antenna also a long one so yeah there's
that if you still find it difficult to
handle a phone larger than 4.7 inches on
the screen then making the leap to 5.5
inches is going to be a bit of a stretch
quite literally - you will be stretching
your hand to get around the body of the
optimus G pro
the button layout isn't completely
practical as the power and volume
buttons land above where the fingers
would land on the phone not to mention
the faraway q button while the flat
sides do lend to some ease and
grip the plastic feel reminiscent of
Samsung phones makes this a very
slippery phone this is definitely a
phone made for two-hand operations and
if you try too hard with just one hand
the optimist repro can just slip right
out I've only gotten used to five inch
devices recently and I have never owned
a Galaxy Note so this is definitely a
foreign handle for me as much as a big
screen might be awesome I'm not entirely
convinced that this is the kind of
device for me but if you are already
used to Note sized proportions then you
should feel right at home with the feel
and look of the optimus G pro and it is
that screen that helps bring the main
appeal for LG's biggest device this true
HD IPS screen is 5.5 inches and sports a
1080p resolution the high resolution
does benefit from the larger screen size
making viewing videos and gaming all
really fun pixel density comes in at 401
PPI which is a bit of a mid-range value
considering the lower performing screens
and in the more dense 441 PPI screen
from the likes of the Droid DNA and the
Oppo find 5 the difference is pretty
negligible however so the sharpness is
still very good despite not really being
a fan of such an immense phone I do
admit that the bigger screen is quite
fun videos look great especially when
formatted for the Full HD resolution go
and get an HD gaming you'll see you
perform greatly as well the display also
has numerous viewing angles that
showcase its prowess at pretty much any
angle the display still looks good and
elements on the screen remain legible
under
if that enormous screen is one of the
more advanced processing packages we
should start to see these days in an
upgrade from the s4 pro the Optimus G
pro is packing the Snapdragon 600 CPU
that clocks in at a great 1.7 gigahertz
now we all know and love the adrenal 320
graphics processor that is included and
then finally there are 2 gigabytes of
RAM benchmark tests showed that the
Optimus G pro sits among the best and to
to benchmark brings in a score of just
under nineteen thousand which might have
been a result of the larger screen and
it's pretty immense demand for power
Epic Citadel then gave the graphics
processing package its stamp of approval
with a wonderful rating on 57.2 average
frames per second thus this is LG's
biggest effort in performance and it
definitely shows in the user interface
and in the experience so the numbers
don't lie this is definitely a beast in
more ways than one otherwise you do get
the usual bevy of bells and whistles GPS
Wi-Fi bluetooth you don't have to worry
about storage in the optimus G pro as it
already comes with 32 gigabytes of
onboard memory but then that brings us
to the real story here the removable
back cover 3 2 gigabytes of memory is
already awesome but consider that there
is an SD card slot available now you
have all the storage you could want it
is one feature many people really want
and the Optimus G pro does well to
include it and then there's the battery
there have been mixed results with
batteries and phones with larger screens
as of late but LG has made sure power
won't ever be an issue
so the first step put in a massive 30
140 milliamp hour battery looping a
video yielded about 7 hours of straight
battery life but in using the phone for
an entire day it didn't run out of juice
before being plugged in for the night
and the second step give the customer a
spare battery and include a charging
dock that can charge that spare battery
for usage whenever you need it finally
the third step great power saving
options you can have a number of
features turned off automatically when
the battery level reaches a programmed
low LG has done well to include all of
this so you never have to fear a power
loss again which brings us around to
software the Optimus UI is largely
unchanged from the one found in the
Optimus G it comes with a lot of
different additions to the install to
jellybean 4.1 point 2
most notable of all of these are the Q
apps a couple of them include Q slide
which is a multitasking feature that
allows for a number of small apps to
overlay whatever you are already working
on this includes videos memos or even
calendars also there is Q memo which is
a neat feature that takes a quick
editable screenshot of what you are
looking at right all over it or
highlight key areas now these are only a
couple of the multitude of editions LG
has put into their user interface and
speaking of which the Optimus UI happens
to be one of my favorite third-party UIs
it is one of the most customizable which
allows changes to the lock screen in its
unlock design or programmed icons and
even has the inclusion of swipe effects
and color schemes for the home screens
its style is simplistic and elegant but
there are so many elements involved that
the Optimus UI feels like the whole
package as I mentioned before this is a
phone made for two hands there are tools
however that help of one-handed
operations for example the keyboards or
dial pads can be shrunken down and moved
to either side of the screen for one
hand to perform those tasks it's nice
especially with the inclusion of swipe
typing but once you have to reach over
to the other side of the screen the
feature loses its magic LG tries quite
hard to make this phone accessible for
everyone but it's obvious that only a
specific subset of people will really
jump at the chance to call this behemoth
a daily driver and finally we have the
camera with 13 megapixels the 2.4
aperture optics on the optimus G pro
bring some good specs to its images
megapixels never tell the whole story
but luckily the camera and the G Pro is
a great performer much like the Optimus
G from which this camera might actually
come from resulting pictures have
wonderful color reproduction so much so
in fact that sometimes you might see
that there's a little bit too much color
in certain elements and they wash out
some of the details nonetheless outdoor
shots have a great vibrancy to them and
indoor shots are surprisingly good
because the optics flood in enough light
for a good picture features in the
camera include an intelligent Auto that
changes the settings according to the
perceived scene and a VR panorama mode
that is much like the photosphere found
in jelly bean 4.2 videos are given the
full HD treatment regardless of which
camera you
using rear or front dual recording as
you saw in the intro is a neat feature
that I will certainly use for fun dual
shot or dual person videos ultimately
the camera is a wonderful performer that
reminds me how much I loved it the
Optimus G's camera I would venture to
say that it is even more of an
improvement and despite the size of the
phone it is one damn good photo
companion to have and so there you have
it
the optimus G pro brings you all the
best LG can offer in a large body made
to take full advantage of those features
personally I'm not completely convinced
of the 5.5 inch factor especially with
the lack of a peripheral like the s-pen
found on Galaxy Note devices but there
is a lot of fun to be had on this large
device yet if you are already having
trouble with 5-inch screen devices then
this is definitely not going to make
anything any easier nonetheless the
Optimus G pro is the full package with
it's awesome screen wonderful
performance expandable memory and a
replaceable battery all features that LG
has properly taken advantage of it is
currently one of the best devices
especially for those who need a little
bit more out of their smartphones if you
happen to be one of these people then
the Optimus G pro by LG just might be
your perfect device for all of the news

features we'll have upcoming stay tuned
