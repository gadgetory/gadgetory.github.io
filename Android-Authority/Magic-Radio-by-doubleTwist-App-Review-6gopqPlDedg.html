the android authority app guy after the
intro we're going to take a closer look
at a new music streaming service from
doubletwist called magic radio to get
magic radio you must first download the
already well-known doubletwist music
player once you download it and open it
you'll see magic radio at the bottom of
the screen and that's how you access the
streaming service it comes with a seven
day free trial but after that it will
cost you three dollars and ninety-nine
cents per month it's not that bad
considering that magic radio has over 15
million songs at its disposal and we
imagine most people won't have
difficulty finding the songs they love
to add a station simply click the plus
sign in the top right hand corner from
there you will have a myriad of options
you can search for an artist or a song
and create a station based on that
alternatively you can make a station
based on your mood or based on a genre
magic radio has a whole bunch of each so
music enthusiasts shouldn't have trouble
finding or creating stations for any
music mood there are a set of stations
that come stock with magic radio they're
called music you love music you discover
and hot artists they're all pretty much
self-explanatory music you love is an
aggregate station that takes all your
stations and mashes them up to create a
sort of super station that has all your
music tastes combined hot artists is
essentially a pop station that'll play
music from the top of the charts music
you discover ostensibly plays music
similar to the music you already like
once you've selected your music and
something is playing you'll be shown the
main music interface if you click the
top left button you'll be taken back to
the main screen the top right button
will let you share what you're listening
to to Facebook and Twitter and the more
options button covers more social
networks like Google+ the bottom left
button will take you to where you can
buy any given song you're listening to
and give you access to the equalizer and
tune station settings equalizer is a
premium feature and you'll have to pay
extra for it but the tune station
settings are actually pretty interesting
the tempo setting determines whether
fast or slow songs play on your station
the other setting determines how close
the station sticks to the genre song
artist or mood you've chosen magic radio
did surprisingly well in terms of
obscurity it was able to find all the
obscure stuff that I personally listen
to it won't have everything obviously
but it can go pretty deep into the
obscure stuff if you need it too there
were two big things we didn't like about
magic radio first there was no free
ad-supported version don't get us wrong
we love the fact that the paid version
has no ads whatsoever and four dollars a
month is more than reasonable for a
music streaming service but we would
have liked to
seen a free offering with ads the second
thing is that there is still a song skip
limit according to the app you can only
skip six songs an hour it's not a deal
breaker but it can be pretty annoying if
you're listening to a station where you
only like about half the music being
played overall double twists magic radio
is a great streaming service it comes at
a very reasonable price the library is
gigantic and it has all the features
you'd expect in a music streaming
service we were hard pressed to find any
reasons not to recommend this to people
at the end of the day the things we
liked far outweighed the things we
didn't like once again I'm Joe Hindy the
