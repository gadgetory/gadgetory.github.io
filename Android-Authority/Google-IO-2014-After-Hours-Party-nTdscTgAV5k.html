well here we are at the after-hours
party after the first day of the
conference now I'm not going to talk too
much in this video I just want you
taking the sights and the sounds but
here's a quick mention some of the areas
had this random furniture it was almost
to San Francisco II in a way very
googley also and you even had like this
bed that you're going to see on the side
over here but one of the best parts
about this entire party was the food by
God the food there was really just a
bunch of little kiosks and booths and
little areas where there was a lot of
food and it included even an entire
section that had just vendors across
this entire way and I definitely picked
out while I was here it was really fun
there was one main live stage for some
live music and a couple of bands went up
there actually quite a few and I did
miss a couple of them but then there was
yet another stage where the artists
hide/show was going to perform which was
really great this was held in the Yerba
Buena Gardens in just across the street
from where Google i/o was being held and
you can see here right below the mission
and just a lot of people congregating it
was just a really big communal
experience now here's where the night
really opened up at least for me now you
have a DJ icon there in the background
and you'll notice that yellow headphone
that she has on there I have never seen
anything like this before but what you
have here is DJ icon creating the music
and making the mix for everybody to
listen to via headphones this is called
a silent disco and as you can hear
you're not hearing the music that we're
all rocking to right now and this is
where we really got lost at least I did
and really just had a lot of fun when
you don't have the headphones on it's
almost absolutely ridiculous because you
don't hear the music that they're
dancing to but you get to watch them
dance the night away
after quite a bit of dancing I decided
to head on over to the beer garden which
was at the other side of the park right
next to one of my favorite places to eat
and drink tea anywhere samovar Tea
Lounge
we're getting out
so one of the big alors of the
after-hours party this year was the fact
that you got to see everybody just come
together in one place and they were all
able to have their fun whether it was a
silent disco the various bands or even
Thai Joe doing his thing on the on the
stage over on the side and even the
Biergarten that I just left and it was
really nice to just see everybody coming
together especially the people who have
been working really hard to put together
this year's i/o the people who are
covering in and of course the patrons
who get to come and enjoy all that
Google has to offer them if you wanted a
real sense of community well you really
got it here at after-hours and even
though I was on the way back from the
beer garden and I found that title was
really doing his thing do you know that
there was only one place that I had to
return to I mean how could you not it's
just a brilliant idea
throw those headphones on drown the
world out around you and just have a
blast anyway I'm signing off here so
thank you very much for being there with
us throughout our Google i/o coverage
I'm gonna throw some music on you guys
just go ahead sit back enjoy thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
