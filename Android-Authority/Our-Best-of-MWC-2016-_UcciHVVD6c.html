authority what's going on everybody and
here we're taking a look at our award
that we gave out at MWC 2016 now it does
feel pretty sharp in the hand and it's
really hard to get a good grip around it
so you're not really gonna be using
one-handed just kidding guys let's take
a look at what products we gave the
award to this year we start off with the
future of VR and 360 cameras starting
off with the Samsung gear 360 now it
came out alongside the galaxy s7 and the
s7 edge and this is a camera that
basically shoots 360 degree photos and
videos now the wide-angle lens is on
opposite sides of this little sphere
allow it to stitch together a full
360-degree image in just a few moments
there is a replaceable battery inside as
well as a micro SD card slot and it is
also splash and water resistant the
camera is supposed to interact
seamlessly with the s7 lineup and Nan
Samsung smartphone users can use the
device with eight PC application the
pictures that are taken are 30 megapixel
shots and the quality isn't that
incredible but this is the beginning of
an easily accessible ecosystem for
360-degree shots and for that so we give
Samsung a Award for putting together a
nice looking peripheral that might be
able to show us what the future will be
of digital imaging speaking of the
future we bring our next award to remix
OS buy guide technologies now we've been
covering them a little bit since CES
2016 and at MWC 2016 the announcement
was for a beta release that remix OS is
able to get on two pcs and since we saw
it at CES there have been a few big
changes now you couldn't install remix
OS on a computer's hard disk instead of
having to use a USB Drive and the
operating system has been given some
extra optimizations now the main reason
why remix OS makes our list is because
it feels like a very original idea and
it actually is pretty well done it
brings Android multitasking to the next
level not only allowing you to use a
recent app screen but actually showing
you all of the apps in real time running
in conjunction with one another taking a
look at this clip you can see a video
running wild going on to social media
networks and the fact that this just
might be the way that Android tablet
computing should be going in the future
gives
a good reason to give J technologies and
remix OS a lot of recognition here at
MWC 2016 xiaomi is a company that's
already known for low cost high-end
smartphones and they've taken the wraps
off their latest device than me five
combining a very low price and really
great specifications the me5 was going
to be a human for this particular list
and we were lucky enough to get a look
at hit and the me5 pro writing down the
specs this phone actually has the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor with 4
gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes of
on-board storage and even a fingerprint
sensor on the front of device a 16
megapixel Sony IMX 298 sensor on the
rear and a 4 megapixel sensor are up on
the front the me 5 Pro which is the
highest end of all these variants comes
with a ceramic backplate rather than
just a glass that's found on the other
models now of course with the software
we have the me UI and not everybody is
always that down for the me UI way of
looking at Android after all it doesn't
have an app drawer but it is still one
of the most updated and most regularly
updated versions of Android that is
available out there but really the me5
pro and its price are what make us very
excited about it it costs just three
hundred and sixty dollars without sales
tax or 410 as a direct conversion now
these prices might fluctuate a little
bit but it is still much more affordable
than plenty of other flagships that have
been coming out recently in the last
year or two
speaking of affordable but still
high-end we have Alcatel with the idol
4s last year's idol 3 was a great device
and was very well received by pretty
much everyone here at afterword
Authority and two new smartphones were
announced at MWC 2016 starting with the
idol 4 but we're giving the award to the
item 4 s it has impressive
specifications and is rumored to have a
sub 400 dollar price point overall
however this 5.5 inch quad HD AMOLED
display is a real bump up from the idol
3 and it comes with a snapdragon 6 5 -
processor and 3 gigabytes of RAM 16
megapixels is in the rear camera with a
3000 milliamp hour battery and plenty of
on-board storage with microSD expansion
but they have added in what is called
the boom key feature now the boom key is
a physical button on the side of the
device that allows users to perform
different actions when the device is on
various screens so for example pressing
the boom key in standby mode
can launch the camera or holding it down
will immediately take a burst shot
it can also shuffle through photos in
your gallery or add special effects to
videos and even allow you to do a cool
parallax effect on the devices own home
screen as a follow up to last year's
wonderful offering by Alcatel the idol
4s looks like one of those phones you
might be able to get for somebody in
your life who doesn't necessarily need
to have the best and the most expensive
phones that are out there but speaking
of those high-end and generally more
expensive phones we can finally get into
the heavy hitters of MWC and we start
with the Samsung Galaxy s7 lineup in
this particular case we have the s7 and
the s7 edge the s7 edge is the larger of
the two devices at 5.5 inches with its
quad HD display we have the return of
the two curves on the sides allowing the
screen to pretty much be flush with the
very sides of the device a Snapdragon
820 or annex II knows eight series
processor and will be backed by four
gigabytes of RAM and this time around we
finally have microSD card expansion and
an ip68 rating for water and dust
resistance makes this a pretty resilient
phone well we're really excited about
however is the 3600 milliamp hour
battery in the s7 edge and the 12
megapixel rear camera now 12 megapixels
might sound like a bub down from the 16
that was in the s6 but it provides also
larger by micron pixels that allow for
even faster autofocus because phase
detection autofocus is available in
every pixel and even then having larger
pixels allows for better low-light
performance and better performance
overall we also have to give recognition
to the original s7 because at 5.1 inches
we also have the curves that are all on
the back of the devices which makes it
sit so much easier in the hand and it
definitely feels like what are the most
pocketable high-end devices that are
available out there we have extensive
coverage on the galaxy s7 lineup
including a look at the apps edge and
the various edge features and even a
color comparison available here at
Android authority comm and the YouTube
channel so make sure you check them out
so you can see why it got one of our
Ward's of MWC 2016
but if updates to the previous devices
are not what you're looking for and
you're looking for some real leaps
forward you probably are going to be
looking at the LG g5 it really surprised
a lot of us not only because of its
stark departure from the g4 design but
also because of the features that not
many other tech companies are doing
overall
for starters LG has managed to figure
out how to make the removable battery
may have even more capabilities as we
have the modular design on the bottom of
the LG g5 you are able to press a small
area that slides out the entire bottom
panel in there is the battery snap off
the battery and you'll be able to put
this battery into other modules that had
even more capabilities to what is
already a very powerful device the
Snapdragon 820 is what you get in the LG
g5 with a 5.3 inch quad HD LCD display
with 4 gigabytes of RAM and expandable
storage as well so LG is still keeping -
the two main features that they had last
year that plenty did not have dual
cameras on the back provide a great
imaging experience with sixteen and
eight megapixel cameras for taking very
regular or in the case of the 8
megapixel camera much wider 135° shots
and it has a 2800 million of our
removable battery which can be replaced
quite easily and you're going to be
snapping that thing off if you are going
to work with the modules but then we
have to give our last award to the LG
friends these are the modules that are
going to be used with the LG g5 and they
are ultimately the trump card for what
is considered in a way the underdog
device of 2016 when compared to the
Samsung Galaxy s7 the modular design of
the LG g5 makes it incredibly expandable
and one of the videos and features that
we had at and rathore decom is a look at
the camera module itself now the camera
module has manual controls physical
controls rather for the camera including
a dial for zooming in and out of the
viewfinder and it even adds 1200
milliamp hours more to the battery
showing what kind of expansion you could
have on the LG g5 now if this is going
to be the new way that we look at smart
phones moving forward we have to give a
lot of credit to LG for making it come
to the market before pretty much anybody
else more modules are going to be
created as we were able to look at even
another one called the hi-fi Plus which
allows for the LG g5 to have a high
quality deck for those audio files out
there who want even better audio from
their device and finally the modular
design is just simply one of the more
innovative ideas we've seen in recent
years and we're happy to see it in the
smartphone world where LG at least
believes that there is going to be some
stagnation it means that we have a great
year moving ahead from us and at MWC
2016 we just might have gotten our first
look at what might be an incredible year
for the future of tech so keep it tuned
to Android authority for even more and
don't forget to check out all of the
content that we have at Android
authorities YouTube channel and beyond
in order to see for yourself
all of the phones and devices that we
gave the best of NWC 2016 award to this
year keep it tuned here for even more
because we are your source for all
things MWC 2016 and of course we are
