and this is the Fitbit flex - the Fitbit
flex - is the latest upgrade to want a
Fitbit small entry level fitness
trackers a first glance it might appear
to be little more than a fancy pedometer
but I'd be a very unfair judgment of a
device that actually has a fair few
tricks up its sleeve or up your sleeve
let's take a closer look and see if the
Fitbit flex 2 is right for you so first
up let's look at the design this is a
little hard to judge things the design
can be pretty much whatever you'd like
it to be that's to say that the main
brains of the unit can be removed and
then inserted into a range of different
accessories the device itself is
absolutely miniscule and weighs under an
ounce meaning that can easily work in a
variety of form factors the two included
rubber bands both in black one large one
small look nice enough and a plenty
svelte for wearing all day but you can
also find a ton of first-party in
third-party alternatives which include
an attractive bangle and even pendants
there should be something here to suit
everyone meaning that you can complement
your own style and get the device to
work with your routine there's no screen
on this device like the one you'd find
on the Fitbit charge - but you do get a
5 small LEDs these can be used for very
basic notifications or to show you how
close you are to accomplishing your step
goal DoubleTap on the band and you'll be
shown a corresponding number of lights
to indicate your performance so far so
say your step targets 10,000 you've done
4,000 steps two lights will show and so
on tapping is sometimes unresponsive
though leading you to jab at the thing
like a madman and I find myself half
wondering if this was a sneaky way to
get us to burn more calories the Fitbit
flex 2 has no heart rate monitor or GPS
which means it isn't going to be a good
choice for serious athletes but that's
clearly not who this is aimed at it
works well as a step counter and seems
to be pretty consistent with the results
for my vivoactive
HR and that information along with some
basic metrics such as height and weight
will then allow the Flex to to
guesstimate your calorie burn for the
day note though that without asking for
your body fat percentage or taking a
heart rate reading this isn't going to
be terribly accurate it should be good
enough for most users though and what's
important here is that the calculation
is consistent and that the numbers are
moving in the right way it also handles
basic sleep tracking
auto detect when you doze off in theory
in my experience that hasn't been
terribly accurate however it seems to
think I'm sleeping when I'm awake a lot
at the time it's nice to have it with
air when it does work though what it
does do remarkably well and what makes
this much more than just a pedometer is
it auto detection for activities so if
you go for a run or a walk then the flex
pay will automatically detect that
activity and log it for you this works
really well and the algorithms it must
use a mind boggling I've had it auto
detect runs walks and even swims are
pretty shoddy swimmer so the latter was
especially impressive after 17 minutes
of rest stroke at a local fitness center
I was able to review my number of laps
and the rough number of calories burned
and yes that of course means of devices
also waterproof the full list of
activities the Flexsteel detect our
walking running cycling elliptical
training sports aerobic exercise and
swimming unfortunately there's no option
to log awaits workout though I tried
keeping on while I did my usual cast
annex and pumping iron and I didn't get
a peep from it so this isn't going to
cut it for most gym rats which is a
shame with a name like flex other than
that unfortunate omission though I do
believe that Fitbit is the best in the
business when it comes to activity
detection one more Fitness feature is
the obligatory movement reminders which
cause the device to buzz when you've
been sitting for too long this is pretty
standard by this point but it's well
implemented here so this is definitely
no Smart Watch and if you're looking for
an assistant you can wear on your wrist
and I think you should look elsewhere
however the Fitbit flex 2 does offer
very basic notifications for texts and
calls there's to say that if you receive
a message or a call you'll get a small
light and vibration to indicate that it
does also support whatsapp and hangouts
etc but you can only use one messaging
app at a time the last point to consider
is the battery this will last roughly
four days on a full charge or as Fitbit
likes to put it up to five days this
isn't great when you consider that many
fitness trackers with a screen can last
significantly longer but then again
though it makes more sense when you
factor in the tiny size of the unit what
I do find irritating is that you only
get a small notification to warn you
when your device is running low on
charge that's pretty easy to miss and it
led to me failing to record quite an
active day when I actually walked around
13,000 steps on the software front
Fitbit has always had one of the best
Android apps of any fitness tracking
solution and that shines here with the
Flex - the interface looks clean and is
generally easy and intuitive to find
your way around
and Fitbit has also included a lot of
built-in additional functionality here
too such as the ability to map your
walks or runs using the phone's GPS or
the option to track your calories by
scanning barcodes or entering foods
manually Fitbit also syncs with all the
major third-party solutions such as
MyFitnessPal RunKeeper or endomondo
but it's nice that the functionality is
built-in for those just starting out you
get plenty of encouragement from Fitbit
too with badges awarded for various
milestones and a strong social element
so the Fitbit flex 2 is a well-designed
fitness tracker that has lots of neat
features and serves as a great
introduction to fitbit's excellent
software and ecosystem it's a small
convenient device that can take on any
look to match your style and that will
easily survive a dip into the pool while
let my lack advanced features it's
nevertheless smarter than you might
expect it to be thanks to a highly
capable app and brilliant activity auto
detection it's not a viable option for
serious athlete but for those looking to
just shed a few pounds or improve their
basic fitness it's definitely one of the
better options on the market right now
so that's the Fitbit flex 2 thanks a ton
