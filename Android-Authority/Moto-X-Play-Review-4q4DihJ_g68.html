announcements got everyone a tiny bit
excited one of these was a very exciting
but curiously placed mid-range option
the Moto X play
if our is instantly representative of
what motorola have deemed their ongoing
design language the design is clean
simple and personally a pleasure to look
at the grills and the inconspicuous
front-facing camera are the only
features during the front on the side
you have to take your power button and
the volume rocker however unlike the
Nexus 6 these feel cheap and loose to
the touch we have the dual slot for the
nano SIM card and SD card slot alongside
the centrally located 3.5 millimeter
jack the back gives way to the signature
motorola dimple which sits in a metal
strip underneath the camera module it's
a nice and simple design touch the phone
feels good in the hand you don't really
notice the fact that it's slightly
thicker than average this is helped by
the curved back which is removable
should you wish to try out the different
backs through a moto maker this is by
far one of the best features that
motorola have carved out creating a
sense of personalization with not only
the back but also accent colors there's
engraving and more like every other
phone most your interaction will come
through the screen and let me tell you
it's a great panel in fact is one of the
best 1080p panels I have ever seen
it's a TFT LCD panel which some of you
are like and some of you want sure you
won't get the potential battery savings
of an AMOLED panel but the more neutral
colors on the LCD panel gives a more
balanced and pleasing presentation if
5.5 inch display takes up most the front
side leaving relatively little else and
it's a perfect size you'll like it
it's nicely contrasted by the bright
bold screen I don't really ever have the
need to go above half brightness and
even when you lower it down
there's no color shift a quick note on
the sound internally it surprised me
coming from the Nexus 6 I wasn't
expecting much but the Moto X plate
invariably sounded better it was able to
drive various headphones I had easier it
also produced a more pleasing sound that
is not too far off neutral with a touch
of emphasis externally I'm disappointed
there are no dual front-facing speakers
only the one on the bottom and with that
it's okay again coming from the Nexus 6
I was hoping something close to the
sound of that one of the most appealing
features of Motorola devices in recent
years has been an ear stock Android
experience this time it's no different
subjectively stock Android is the best
way to go there
sniff acun notions such as the visual
presentation having pure Android early
access to updates but there are also
more smaller notions such as the
fluidity and touch response that on the
whole make it an infinitely better and
more enjoyable experience
Motorola's additions are few and far
between but when they are they're
genuinely beneficial some highlights a
moto assist which enables profiles based
on locations or activities the tried
tested and loved active display if you
don't know this is when the phone offers
you a glance at your notifications when
it detects you've picked it up
admittedly this was a feature that
technically made more sense due to the
AMOLED panel of previous generations
regardless it's a great way to peek at
your notifications in a quick and
precise manner these are all useful
additions which aren't really intrusive
any matter just the way it should be
packed inside we have a Snapdragon 650
which is a somewhat curious but
ultimately safe choice there's 2
gigabytes of RAM which hasn't really
been an issue for me at all and your
Drina 4 or 5 ultimately the process of
choice is indicative of the mid-range
labeling of this device it doesn't
impact it in any significantly negative
way my normal daily usage consists of
browsing watching videos replying to
emails and most of the time listening to
music but all of this is been running
without a hitch hasn't started at all or
held up Android has matured and so has
the tech you don't need top-of-the-line
components to have a good experience
this all aged towards giving a better
experience that can also last topping
that notion off is the biggest selling
point of this phone the big 3630
milliamp battery I won't waste time it's
fantastic damn it's just so refreshing
being able to go the entire day and
still have sufficient battery life to
expel in my usage so five easily been
seeing upwards of four hours and more
often than not I get just over five
hours of screen on time
it's excellent that's all you need to
know the other big inclusion is Motorola
turbocharged functionality which is
supposed to give you eight hours of use
in just 15 minutes of charge this is
through producing up to 12 volts at 1.2
outage over all comes out to 15 watts
this sounds amazing but unfortunately I
wouldn't know any better as Motorola
don't include a compatible charger in
the
box the final thing you're probably all
wondering about is the highly touted
camera motorola claim is to be the best
I've ever made and they're right they
also say this is one of the best on the
market and well maybe they're they're
not so much
it's a 21 megapixel shooter with a dual
LED flash it's great but not amazing I
can confidently say in my subjective
opinion that it's better than the
previous phone I reviewed the Sony
experience at 3 plus in good light
there's detail and it looks wonderful
but you can easily degrade in low-light
or where conditions on admirable
regardless you won't be disappointed
despite not being the best of the best
the camera software and true Motorola
style is still far too simple for my
liking
in my opinion the LG g4 did it perfectly
it works
it's just finicky and all picture based
it's not the most efficient when you're
quickly looking for a particular setting
there aren't many settings either which
I hope to see developed finally I don't
really ever comment on the actual
function of phone calling because by and
large the experience is all the same
however here the call quality is far
above average the dedicated mic for
noise canceling works extremely well
even in busy environments it sounded
like I was pretty much alone so should
you get it absolutely it's a great phone
at a great price you get a great camera
a fantastic screen exactly what you'd
want from the battery there's expandable
storage up to 128 gig and the beautiful
pure Android experience however it
doesn't really come without some curious
decisions it's not fully waterproof the
IP 52 rating only gives its splash proof
rating which is questionable when
Motorola are aiming this for on-the-go
users there's no wireless charging and
to top it off there's no turbo charger
in the box the phone does a lot right
and contain some incredible features of
its flagship brethren but you have to
wonder who Motorola ultimately aiming
this for it feels all a little unfocused
and slightly lazy so that's it for me
guys let me know what you think down
below and if you need to get in touch
hit me up on twitter at trembling water
be sure to check out all the rest of the
great content from the team anyways
thanks for listening take it easy and
I'll
see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
