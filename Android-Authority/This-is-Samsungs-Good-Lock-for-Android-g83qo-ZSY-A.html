really only two camps those that love
the TouchWiz interface and those that
absolutely hate it but what if you could
have the best of both worlds all the
software features that you know and love
but with plenty of customization
potential as well I'm Chris Carlin with
Android authority here to take a closer
look at Samsung's new advanced UI called
good luck at first glance good luck
looks pretty standard with a clock up
top and notifications in the middle but
you'll notice that at the bottom we have
a lot more than the usual two lockscreen
app shortcuts right now I've got five
shortcuts visible at the bottom but
swiping up reveals even more good luck
can actually store up to 20 app
shortcuts right on your lockscreen this
thing's called bad tray and it's
completely customizable so you can keep
all your favorite apps in the top row
with the rest always just to swipe away
you'll still need to unlock your phone
to launch them fully but it's a pretty
sweet time saver and a really nice
feature for an official Samsung
interface at the other end of the screen
things look pretty normal too
but again there's a lot more going on
than meets the eye when we expand a
notification you'll see a totally
redesigned notifications panel
we've got status bar icons pulled
straight from stock Android and a really
nice material design series of quick
settings toggles the other big
noticeable change here is the presence
of two tabs all and keep swiping a
notification in all to the left will
dismiss it but swiping to the right will
add it to the keep tab keep is an
optional feature of good luck that
provides a kind of holding area for
notifications you may not have time for
now but don't necessarily want to
dismiss entirely or have clogging up
your main notifications area it can be a
really handy way of prioritizing
notifications without ever having to
unlock your phone so when you have the
time the important stuff is waiting for
you the good lock provides even more
options for handling notifications so
you can categorize a particular type of
notification so it will appear in
grouped folders in future kind of the
way Gmail does it with social and
promotions you can also snooze
notifications for later
now a nice visa is the review appearance
of lock screen widgets neatly hidden
behind the clock where you can add
multiple widgets for quick access
continuing the influence from stock
Android the good lock quick settings
panel looks like it comes straight from
a nexus which begs the question what
exactly is Samsung up to here while it's
possible that Samsung is using good lock
as a kind of testing ground for what may
one day replace TouchWiz it's also just
as likely that it is just an
experimental UI being used to provide an
alternative to what comes out of the box
but with monthly updates and a lot of
attention being paid to user feedback
Samsung is absolutely going about it in
the right way
another big visual change appears in the
recent apps menu where the marshmallow
rolodex has been replaced by a list our
app shortcuts appear at the bottom and
you can still open up the full app tray
and if you don't like happening it here
you can easily remove it personally I
find the new version to be much faster
but the lack of a preview card won't
appeal to everybody and of course if you
prefer the old style of recent apps you
can easily choose that from the settings
because there's so many more options in
regular touch wiz good lob gets its own
dedicated menu this is because good lock
installs as an update to the system UI
but it's limited to only certain parts
of the interface the good news about
this is that it's also very easy to
uninstall if you want to return
everything to normal the Advanced
Settings menu here provides access to
various options for the multitasking
menu blur effect and of course the app
tray and if you're not a particular fan
of having separated tabs in the
notification shade you can disable key
to remove the split view send other nice
feature that Samsung has brought in
based on user feedback
the last major part of good lock is
called routines and they're the reason
why the interface accent color has been
changing continually throughout this
video so to give you an example let's
dive in and create one routines are kind
of like do not disturb mode but they're
much more powerful than that they can be
toggled on and off like alarms and
you'll see the color scheme change
depending on which routine is currently
running
now the first thing to do when creating
a routine is to give it a name based on
the situation that you want to create it
for next you'll have to give it a
location and then add a start and end
time for it just like do-not-disturb
unfortunately for now you can only set
times but not days of the week but
hopefully that will change in the near
future next we choose a few basic
settings for our routine like what audio
settings we'll have while it's running
and then we choose a clock style we like
from the relatively short number of
options hopefully that will increase in
future as well color schemes come next
which you can choose from huge color
wheel and if you're not into the
brighter colors which select the accents
automatically you can go or monochrome
on the far left last stage is layout you
can add a widget that will hide behind
the lockscreen clock and you can add
more than one if you want to you can
also decide whether the widget will be
accessible from a secure lock screen or
not which is pretty handy if it's
something like email the checkboxes here
let you decide what content will appear
on your lock screen including the
notifications and app tray and that's
all there is to it your interface colors
will now change automatically as each
new routine is activated that's a quick
look at Samsung's new advanced UI a
pretty intriguing look at what TouchWiz
may one day become but with its monthly
updates community driven features and
customization potential it feels more
like a custom ROM than it does a
manufacturer skin whatever is ultimately
going on we're pretty excited to see
where Samsung takes good luck in the
future and we definitely recommend that
