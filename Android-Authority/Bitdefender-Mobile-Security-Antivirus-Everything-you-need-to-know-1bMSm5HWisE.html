handy the Android authority app guy in
this video we're gonna be reviewing
BitDefender mobile security and
antivirus so let's get started
unlike the last bit defender a pre
reviewed this one has a whole suite of
antivirus related features to start
you'll have the ability to scan your
device this is actually the same scan
that gets run on the much lighter app we
reviewed last week so there is not much
difference there first let's talk about
the web security this keeps an eye on
you while you browse the web so if you
end up on a shady website it can help
you stay safe it's on by default and you
won't know it's there until it needs to
tell you something also included is
anti-theft you can configure SMS control
to control your device that way when
it's not in your presence and there's
also a web interface that will help you
find it if you've lost it it's easy to
configure easy to use and easily one of
the best features in any antivirus app
lastly there is a feature called privacy
advisor what this does is scan your app
to see which one's might be the greatest
threat to your privacy and then gives
you the option to uninstall them this is
one of the best ways to see what
permissions your apps ask for and you'd
be surprised which ones asked for the
most stuff using this app is very simple
but there are a couple of really great
features that can help out most of the
time the app does nothing but sit in the
background waiting until you need it
once you configure the web security and
anti-theft you really just kind of let
it go and it does the rest obviously
using it to keep yourself safe while web
surfing and using it to find your lost
or stolen device would be two of the
most common uses so here's what we liked
all anti-theft features always Rock
being able to find a lost or stolen
phone is never a bad thing the web
security feature is very useful
especially if you're into surfing sites
that are known for causing problems the
privacy advisor gives you a look at the
app permissions in an easy-to-understand
user friendly manner so even people who
aren't so tech savvy can understand what
their apps are doing and here's what we
didn't like we would have liked to have
seen some configuration options for the
web security it's nice that you can turn
it on and just go but it doesn't feel
like the user has any control over how
aggressive the service is the only thing
the privacy advisor is missing is route
controls this is nitpicking of course
but having the route option to disable
specific permissions would have been
nice it's not a huge deal but root users
still need a separate app if you want to
disable permissions all in all this is a
very solid offering in the antivirus
space it has all the features you'd
expect an ant
Barriss apt to have such as scanning
permission viewer anti-theft and web
security the interface is nice and is a
free app which is always good aside from
a couple of small things we really
didn't have anything bad to say about
the app so if you're looking for an
anti-virus go ahead and give it a shot
