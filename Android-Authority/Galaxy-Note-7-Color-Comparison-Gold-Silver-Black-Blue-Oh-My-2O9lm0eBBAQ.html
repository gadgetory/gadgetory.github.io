what's going on everybody and here we
have a color comparison a look at the
four different colors that we have for
the samsung galaxy note 7 now generally
when it comes to meeting with samsung
and going to these announcements and
unpacked events we are actually able to
look at all of the colors which is why
we even have this comparison available
for you so hopefully you enjoy and the
first one we're going to look at is the
Gold Edition
now gold platinum is the official name
for it unfortunately this edition of the
note 7 will not be coming to you the US
and that's kind of a bummer and
especially for our own lawn because he
actually wanted to have the gold edition
out of the four of them but we'll move
into the next color which is silver
which has sort of a middle placement
when it comes to all of our opinions on
which ones we would pick silver is not a
bad color by any means but for us here
in Android authority is not the one we
would pick first one thing that's nice
about the Silver Edition is that the
translucent look really kind of makes
the silver pop and it also blends in
very well with the silver and rather
metallic skeleton that holds the whole
device together but from there we'll get
into the brand new color for the note 7
the blue coral color now if you're
thinking that you've already seen blue
phones in the Samsung Galaxy line before
you're absolutely right but this Edition
is just that little bit different it
kind of has this baby blue look to it
and of course once you put that
translucent look around at all it has a
kind of different look when compared to
plenty of other darker blue phones that
we've seen in the Galaxy line before and
because of that it kind of pops a little
bit more and even if it's not
necessarily the first choice that we
would have if it's the one that we ended
up getting well we weren't really
complain
which finally brings us to my personal
favorite the black onyx now there is
something really nice about having just
a black slate design and I've always
loved that about a lot of different
phones in the past but this one really
seems like one of the best and out of
the four it is the one I would
definitely pick first
and so that was your look at the colors
of the Samsung Galaxy Note seven let us
know which one you would pick in the
comments below and just to reiterate LAN
would really want the Gold Edition but I
just can't get enough of that black onyx
the blue coral is a great addition to
the line and honestly if we ended up
getting one of those it wouldn't be that
bad of a deal keep it tuned to Android
authority for all of our coverage of the
samsung galaxy note 7 including our full
hands on our comparisons and also our
feature focus videos which we'll take a
look at a number of different new
features that have been put into this
new iteration of the note line keep it
