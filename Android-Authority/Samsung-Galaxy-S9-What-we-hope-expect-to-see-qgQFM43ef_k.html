never too early to talk about the next
flagship and at the top of our wish list
is an under display fingerprint scanner
the fingerprint scanner is one of the
biggest drawbacks of the s8 due to its
location it's on the back next to the
camera which not only looks weird but
impractical placing it below the camera
in the middle of the device of the
galaxy s 9 would be an improvement but
that's not what we're really hoping for
we want to see Samsung equip its
flagship with an under display
fingerprint scanner that will allow you
to unlock the device by placing your
finger on a certain part of the display
that would solve a number of problems
the overall design would be cleaner the
fingerprint scanner would be virtually
invisible and it would be far more
practical you wouldn't have to flip the
phone back and forth all the time just
to check your notifications now we've
heard plenty of rumors regarding an
under display fingerprint sensor over
the past year one which claimed that the
Galaxy S 8 would be the first to get it
obviously that didn't happen but the
latest rumor now suggests that the
technology is still not quite ready and
that the first Samsung device to feature
could be the Galaxy Note 9 now many of
you will have argued that this should
have been at the top of our list because
every geek knows we always need more
power
you see Samsung decided to play it safe
when it came to batteries the s8 packs a
three thousand milliamp hour battery
just like its predecessor that has a
much smaller 5.1 inch display the LG G 6
on the other hand which is around the
same size as the s8 sports a 3300
milliamp hour based on the assumption
that the upcoming Galaxy S 9 smartphones
will have roughly the same footprint as
their predecessors a 4000 milliamp hour
battery for the larger handset is
something that we'd really like to see
if while we can pull this off so can
Sammy as for the smaller brother bumping
the battery up to at least 3300 milliamp
hours is the way to go which would put
it on par with other similarly styled
devices and next up is a good dual
camera setup and this is a category
that's becoming increasingly competitive
in the market the Galaxy s8 and s8 +
have a single primary camera while the
majority of their rivals are equipped
with 2
on the back there for a dual camera
setup is something that we'd really like
to see for the s9 the note 8 is the
first Samsung device to come with a dual
camera setup and the likelihood of the
company bringing it to the Galaxy S
series is pretty high the only major
flagships that don't have it at this
point are the pixel 2 smartphones but
they are still available to capture
those fancy bokeh images despite missing
the second lens if my wish is granted
we expect to see the same setup on the
s9 as on the note 8 a standard sensor
and a secondary telephoto lens that can
achieve two time optical zoom however
we'd like to see both sensors sport
larger apertures that would improve the
quality of the images taken in low-light
conditions next on my list is a proper
headphone jack okay
a geek can dream okay I know some of you
are tired of this whole thing because
it's not gonna change I've said it
before pining for a 3.5 me when we
headphone jack and our flagships are
done but the reality is Bluetooth
headphones suck they suck
really bad latency is bad there's a
delayed reaction you know every four
five six hours I gotta charge the thing
they're easy to lose and wired headphone
jacks are just simple there's better
quality there's more options they're
faster simpler they're just better on
almost every measure they stay in my
head better I could go on and on and on
so bluetooth headphone manufacturers you
got to up your game you got to make
everything better for us to not Pine
over this anymore do you guys have
Bluetooth headphones that you really
like that you use more than your wired
ones how many of you actually do that
and I'm not talking about something I
have to charge every four hours I'm
talking about something that is as good
or better than Wired ones when it comes
to convenience let me know I want to
hear it and next up is a priority for
many of you is dual front-facing
speakers
although the Samsung Galaxy s8 excels in
the performance Department we can't say
the same when it comes to audio the
device only has a single bottom firing
speaker that gets the job done but is
average at best a flagship smartphone
should be able to produce
quality sound which is why we hope that
Samsung will equip the Galaxy S 9 with a
pair of loud front-facing speakers you
see front-facing speakers offer a great
audio experience as the sound is
directed straight towards you
unlike bottom firing speakers they're
also more difficult to cover up with
your fingers when playing games or
watching videos now we got to talk about
price I know that's going to be an issue
for many of us we want flex ship power
without the price and petitioning and
hoping and pining for Samsung to lower
the price on their flagship is
unrealistic not gonna happen it may go
up a little bit I mean here in Canada
it's like thirteen fourteen hundred
dollars that's like I don't know a
thousand eleven hundred dollars American
something like that it's a lot so if you
want that flagship power but not the
flagship price you gotta go for a wall
way or one plus or Xiaomi or one of
those other Chinese manufacturers that
are really delivering best bang for your
buck options let me know what you think
in the comments below or on Twitter now
my audience is smart so smart that
sometimes you're inspired by a business
idea and then you try and get the name
of that business in a domain name and
your next prospective customer is
searching your business name and they
assume you have the dot-com and if you
don't you're giving your business away
to the one who does that's the power of
a.com now why is that exactly
well no domain name extension tells your
story with the same degree of trust as a
dot-com or dotnet domain name.com and
dotnet domain name extensions and jet
credibility and your online presence and
who doesn't want to be credible and
