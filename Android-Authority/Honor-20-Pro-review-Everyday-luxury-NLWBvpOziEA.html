Huawei just lost their license to
Android which is only a small part of a
much larger story which we're not gonna
get into here but basically what this
means is that Huawei devices are no
longer going to receive Android OS
updates and future Huawei devices will
not have access to Google services this
includes the Google Play Store apps like
Gmail YouTube Chrome pretty much
anything that requires a license from
Google and because honor is a sub brand
to Huawei we assume that honor is going
to be affected by this as well and the
honor 20 Pro goes from being device that
I could definitely recommend because it
has a lot of really great hardware and a
lot of really great features to a device
that I'm a little bit more apprehensive
with recommending because of its
uncertainty with software updates and
software updates are important software
updates are very critical and nobody
wants to buy a brand new smartphone that
has the potential of zero prospect for
getting software updates now this review
is being filmed a day before the honor
launch event so we don't know exactly
how honor plans to address this and we
also don't have any information in terms
of pricing and availability because
honor typically doesn't disclose that
information ahead of time so if you guys
want to stay updated on all the honored
20 pro news make sure to check out the
written review which will have linked in
the description below software issues
aside the honor 20 Pro doesn't do
anything extensive or gimmicky but it
has a lot of excellent hardware for
starters you have the powerful Kiran 980
processor that Huawei has used in many
of their recent smartphones like the P
30 and P 30 Pro and the honor View 20
that was released a few months ago
you're also getting plenty of RAM and
plenty of internal storage so
performance is not an issue here it's
very smooth and regular daily use and
even though this isn't a gaming phone
it's very well optimized for some of the
most popular high-end gaming titles like
pub G mobile and fortnight battery life
is also just as good but with a four
thousand milliamp hour battery I didn't
really expect anything less I'm able to
hit six hours of screen on time pretty
easily and consistently even with a lot
of my time being spent playing games
it does have fast charging with honors
supercharged but there is no wireless
charging if you want to go the wireless
route and it also does not have a
headphone jack the overall design is
fairly standard territory it's got a
glass back with a metal frame and a
large nearly bezel the screen to achieve
this honors gone with the hole punch
approach for the front-facing camera and
it's pretty small doesn't really get in
the way and for the most part you'll
pretty much forget that it's there the
only time you'll really notice it is
when you're using an app with a lighter
background or watching a video in full
screen it does have a fingerprint sensor
but it's not an in screen fingerprint
sensor it's a physical sensor and it's
actually placed on the side which is
something that we don't really see all
that often if you use your phone in your
right hand it's in a very comfortable
spot for your thumb but it's probably
not the most ideal placement if you like
using your phone in your left hand honor
sort of made a big deal about the glass
back it has what they're calling a
dynamic holographic design and it's not
something that will make you run out and
buy the phone but it is very tricky to
look at it's supposed to give you a
sense of depth and it certainly does do
that I'm not entirely sure how well it's
going to come across on camera but the
best way that I can describe it is it
sort of feels like you're looking
through a window and not just a
reflection on a regular sheet of glass
it's one of those things that you'll
probably have to see in person to really
appreciate the main attraction with the
honor 20 pro is really the cameras
there's a total of four cameras on the
back and I like the approach that honor
is taking it's a camera system that
provides a lot of versatility in terms
of focal lengths the main sensor is the
48 megapixel Sony IMX which is a sensor
that is currently being used in a lot of
smartphones
you also get a 16 megapixel wide-angle
camera and an 8 megapixel telephoto lens
that provides 3x optical zoom and a 5x
hybrid zoom you can also zoom all the
way up to 30x but anything beyond 5x is
purely digital at that point so I
definitely don't recommend using it
unless you absolutely have to because
the fall-off in detail is pretty harsh
the last camera is this tiny little
sensor here it's a 2 megapixel camera
for macro photography and it lets you
get the camera within 2 inches of a
subject and still be able to pull focus
which is something you can't do with the
other lenses the downside is it's only 2
megapixels so the images aren't that
sharp and the colors are pretty washed
out the main camera takes really
great-looking photos and every phone
that I've used with this 48 megapixel
Sony sensor has performed extremely well
so I wasn't all too surprised by the
results there's tons of detail great
dynamic range and I like honors color
reproduction it's still colorful but it
doesn't go overboard with saturation the
wide-angle and telephoto lens are of
course extremely useful in all sorts of
situations and because the 3x zoom is
completely optical you're not losing any
detail and even if 5x images are still
incredibly sharp it's not quite as
impressive as the zoom on the Huawei p30
pro but being able to zoom in at 3x or
5x and still capture a crisp and clear
image is definitely very useful the
honor 20 Pro also performs really well
in low-light especially if you use the
super night mode the super night mode
will not only give you a brighter image
but you'll also get much more details in
the shadows and highlights it works by
taking multiple images at different
exposures and stacking them together it
takes about 5 to 6 seconds to do this so
it's not gonna be something you'll want
to use all the time and it won't really
work with moving subjects but anytime
you get the opportunity to use it you
definitely should so that's pretty much
gonna do it for this review of the honor
20 pro overall I think it's a really
solid smart phone that checks a
a lot of the right boxes it has a great
design great performance good battery
life and it also has a really great
camera that's extremely versatile with
the four different lenses but again the
whole Huawei situation sort of changes
things a little bit we don't know what's
gonna happen with the software on this
phone when it gets released we don't
know if it's gonna get updated so if you
do decide to buy this phone that is
something that you have to keep in mind
and it's something that you really need
to be aware of when you make this
purchase but that's it thank you guys so
much for watching this review hopefully
you enjoyed it give it a thumbs up if
you did subscribe down below if you
haven't already and I will talk to you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
