authority now hang around Android long
enough hang around pcs long enough and
you might come across this term the
Linux kernel well what is the Linux
kernel why is it important where did it
come from well let me explain the thing
that most people forget in fact is that
computers are incredibly dumb all
they're doing is following instructions
and it's only when those instructions
are actually designed to perform a
complicated task that computers seem to
have some kind of ability but actually
all they're doing is repeating one
instruction after another instruction ad
infinitum and therefore they need
software to do everything even just to
boot up they need to be able to run some
software and when you boot up your
Android smartphone you're used to seeing
a launcher and some apps and maybe the
web browsers and games but there's lots
going on underneath the bonnet for
example underneath the launcher there is
a bunch of Android services including
the Google Play services below that
there is things like the Java Virtual
Machine and below that there is a thing
called a kernel it really is the core of
what's going on now every multi-tasking
computer system uses a kernel Windows
has a kernel os10 has a kernel iOS has a
kernel and Android has a kernel now
Windows and Windows Phone Windows Mobile
use a thing called the NT kernel OS 10
and iOS user thing called the Darwin
kernel and Android uses the Linux kernel
now these aren't the only kernels that
are available there are just a whole
plethora of kernels out there for us to
try and play with some of proprietary
some are open sources the FreeBSD kernel
is the Kentucky kernel there's the free
artist kernel there's the kernel from
embed from embed OS that recently
released by arm there are just so many
different types of kernel now everything
from us wearable from an IOT device
right up to a
the computer uses a kernel so what is it
well basically the kernel is the theme
manages the CPU resources the memory
resources and the processes on any
computer
it also has device drivers in it so when
you want to do any networking that goes
through the kernel we want to talk to
Bluetooth that goes through the kernel
we want to use the file system that goes
through the kernel it really is the
lowest layer above the CPU so for
example on Android when you start an app
it is in fact the kernel that starts the
process for that app and enables the app
to be loaded from the flash into memory
if that app then needs some memory it
will be the kernel that will allocate it
to it if the app wants to do some
networking it will go through the kernel
is the app want to do something in the
background create a background service
that's handled by the kernel eventually
when the app closes that it all
resources that we use will be tidied up
and collected up by the kernel it really
is the center of everything that's going
on on your smartphone now as you can
imagine kernels can be quite complicated
they're doing a lot of essential work
and there are actually some different
ways in which kernels can be designed
now the two main theories today for Co
design are what's called a monolithic
kernel and a microkernel now Linux is a
monolithic kernel that means that all of
these services that are going on all the
drivers or the stuff handling memory all
occur inside one program that occupies
one memory space now the alternative is
a thing called micro kernels and with
micro kernels the kernel itself is in a
very very small piece of memory space
and then other things like device
drivers and networking and file system
drivers are running as user level
programs and the kernel talks of them
saying hey do this hey do that for me
please go and get this file go and get
that and they talk to the kernel the
idea being that if one of those crashes
the kernel itself doesn't crash now back
in 1992 a man called professor Andrew
Tannenbaum who is very very famous but
he's operating system design books and
he's networking but if you ever
do any studying at university or higher
education about computer science you
will definitely come across an Andrew
Tannenbaum book he had a conversation
with Linus Torvalds
online some sort of flame war about the
merits of monolithic kernels versus
micro kernels and of course what
happened is that Lana's was writing a
monolithic kernel and that's how he
stayed doing it and the monolithic
kernel is what we have today if you are
at all interested in micro kernels then
go and check out MINIX three it's and
root an unbound unix-like operating
system that uses micro kernels now as
you can imagine the Linux kernel being a
monolithic kernel can be quite big and
complicated in fact they say there are
15 million lines of code in the Linux
kernel now not all of that code is used
all at once because in there there is
support for IBM mainframes a support for
PC the support for SPARC processes their
support for ARM processors there's a
whole range of different device drivers
in there in fact they say the 70% of
that 15 million lines of code is just
device drivers now when you build the
Linux kernel you say which bits you want
it's got a configuration program I want
this I don't want that I want this I
don't want that but you can do more than
just say what you want including what
you want execute you can also tweak the
way the operating system works and that
makes sense because if you're running
Linux on earth on a mainframe you might
want it to behave differently than if
you're running it on a wearable if
you're running it on a database server
you might want to do think differently
than if you're running it on a
smartphone and this is where we get into
the idea of custom kernels because you
can download the Linux software it open
source under the GPL because you can
download Android it's very possible to
build your own kernel build your own ROM
which has their your own kernel
including inside of it and of course
there is a whole community of people
that build custom kernels just for your
smartphones now a quick word of warning
to do that you're going to need root
access and you're going to probably need
an unlocked bootloader and if you go to
a site like XDA and there are many
others you can find a whole list of
different kernels that are available
alternative kernels that are
your smartphone and there are some
famous ones including the Franco Colonel
Elemental ex and so on now there are
some pros and there are some cons to
using custom kernels first of all you
need to have root first we need to have
your bootloader unlock and some people
don't like to do that it's not in
everybody skill set to do that also you
need to recognize that you're using a
kernel made by some guy somewhere in the
world and there is a question of trust
and the real question of how reliably is
if you start to get problems will he
answer your question will he issue a new
version of the kernel there's also the
danger that you can break your phone but
if you're prepared to go past all of
those problems of course you can find
you can get a kernel that's highly
configurable it even may have extra
features built into it it's got extra
things that the standard stock kernel
doesn't have in it and you may enjoy
downloading new kernels tweaking them
seeing how they operate with different
CPU governors different IO schedulers
different priorities for different
things and you might say this kernel is
better than the stock kernel now as I've
said before a lot of this information is
anecdotal people say oh I got more
battery life I got better performance
and they probably did but remember that
companies like Samsung and Google and LG
and Sony are spending millions and
millions of dollars developing
smartphones and if they could get better
battery life or better performance just
by tweaking a little thing in software
you can guarantee they certainly would
of course you can get better performance
but you get less battery life you can
get better battery life but it means you
have to run your processor at a slower
speed and of course the OEM Samsung
Google LG and so on are trying to find
that happy medium where you get good
battery life and yet good performance
and so as a summary the kernel is really
the lowest level of any operating system
it is responsible for the CPU resources
the memory resources for the file system
for the drivers for the networking it
really is the lowest piece of software
that comes just above the hardware now
Android uses the Linux kernel which is
an open-source kernel and with itself is
open source and all of this software can
be downloaded and you can build custom
roms and separately or together a custom
kernel now the kernel can tweak
different parameters about how
the scheduling occurs how the IAO
scheduling occurs how the cpu is
controlled and those things can be
tweaked and put into a custom kernel you
can download that custom kernel onto
your phone as long as you have root
access and as long as you have your
bootloader unlocked however how much you
benefit you get out of that custom
kernel will depend on your usage
patterns my name's Gary Sims from
Android and I hope you enjoyed this
video if you did please do give it a
thumbs up also please use this link here
to connect with me over at the Android
Authority forums if you want to talk
about kernel technology then please come
over and let's have a chat I'm probably
not going to tell you about how to flash
a particular kernel onto a particular
handset but if you're interested in the
kernel in general and the technologies
around kernels and come over and let's
have a little chat together also please
don't forget to subscribe to and rathore
ities youtube channel you can follow me
on twitter but most importantly stay
tuned to andrew authority comm because
we are your source for all things
Android
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
