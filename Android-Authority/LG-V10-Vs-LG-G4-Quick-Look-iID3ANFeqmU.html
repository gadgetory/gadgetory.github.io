authority and we're taking a look at the
LG v10 versus the LG g4 and right off
the bat the first thing you're going to
notice that's different between these
two devices is the design and build
materials the v10 is basically sort of a
g4 on steroids it's made of a
combination of stainless steel along the
sides and Duras skin on the top bottom
and back panel for enhanced durability
against drops and just a better overall
in hand feel due to the soft and
gripping nature of the dura skin the g4
on the other hand is made of plastic or
a combination of plastic and leather
which still feels really nice but you
can definitely tell the LG put a much
bigger emphasis on higher quality
materials with the v10 another thing
you'll notice is that the v10 is also a
lot larger in comparison to the g4
mostly in height and that might put some
people off especially if you're
concerned about one-handed usability and
in that case the g4 is definitely much
easier to use in one hand and the curve
of the g4 provides for better ergonomics
whereas the v10 just maintains a
standard flat profile LG also stepped up
the security on the v10 by adding a
fingerprint sensor into the rear mounted
power button something that the g4 did
not have and with so many OEMs adding
this feature into their flagships it was
only a matter of time before LG joined
in on the party and the fingerprint
sensor was also partly why the power
button received a slight makeover to a
much more circular flatter key both of
these phones feature quad HD IPS LCD
displays with 5.7 inches on the v10 or
five point nine inches if you add in the
secondary display and the g4 has a 5.5
inch screen they're both really great
looking displays with great color
reproduction and contrast so the only
real differentiator here is the screen
size and the secondary display on the
v10 which can show you notifications the
time weather and can also be used as a
multitasker to quickly switch between
apps these specs between these two
phones are pretty much identical the v10
and the g4 are both being powered by the
Snapdragon 808 with the
any difference being the RAM the g4
comes with three gigs of RAM whereas the
v10 has an extra gig of ram for a total
of four gigabytes but performance
between these two devices are more or
less going to be the same for storage
the v10 comes with 64 gigabyte standard
compared to the 32 gigs on the g4 but
both support microSD card expansion with
up to 200 gigabytes on the v10 and 828
gigs on the g4 underneath is a 3000
milliamp hour battery on both and we
already know the g4 has pretty decent
battery life and hopefully we'll see
something similar out of the v10 another
leg up that the v10 has is in the audio
department the v10 supports hi-fi audio
for higher quality sound so better
sounding audio is a high priority for
you the v10 shouldn't disappoint both
phones are carrying the same exact
cameras it's a 16 megapixel sensor F 1.8
with optical image stabilization and
both have DSLR like manual controls and
the ability to shoot in RAW but the v10
takes things a step further and brings
those DSLR light controls to the video
side of things which is going to give
you much more flexibility and control
when shooting high quality video for the
front camera the g4 carries a more
traditional setup with just one sensor
at 8 megapixels whereas the v10 is doing
something a little bit different with
two five megapixel cameras on the front
which allows the v10 to switch between a
narrower field of view and a wider field
of view through the camera software and
also film footage simultaneously with
all three cameras software wise you're
looking at android 5.1 on both with LG's
GUI so no real differences in the
overall experiences here they're both
packing all the same LG features like
knock on knock code and split screen
multitasking among many other LG
features LG says the v10 will be
receiving marshmallow either before
year's end or early next year and
hopefully the story will be the same for
the LG g4 but this has been a quick
comparison of the v10 versus the g4 the
v10 basically takes what made the g4
great and steps everything up a notch
from the build quality camera screen
size full manual video controls and a
fingerprint sensor to boot so if you
passed on the g4 because it was missing
something then maybe the v10 has exactly
what you're looking for
