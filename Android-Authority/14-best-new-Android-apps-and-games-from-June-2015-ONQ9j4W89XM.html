Hindy the android authority app guy
we're nearing the end of June and that
means it's time to round up the best new
apps and games from June of 2015 adobe
released not one but four new
applications in the month of June the
first is a new photoshop mixed
application that acts as a photo and
image editor it's not overly powerful
but it does a good job with that was
color CC which helps you discern the
colors used in any given photo or image
brush CC which allows you to create and
save various brush types and shape CC
which turns images into vector graphics
they all plug into the adobe creative
cloud and they're all free to download
chaos rings 3 is the first of a few
large square enix releases that we'll
talk about today chaos rings 3 is an RPG
that has you exploring a ruined world to
complete missions and find hidden
treasures it features gorgeous Kingdom
Hearts style graphics decent music and a
long story line you can also engage with
battle mode if you want to take a break
from the story mode it's expensive but
there is a lot to do and there are no
in-app purchases cloud player by double
twist is a unique music player because
it allows you to play songs from your
cloud storage this is similar to how
Google play music does things except
cloud player allows you to use onedrive
Google Drive and Dropbox to listen to
music the interface is pretty good and
other features include a 10 band EQ
airplane chromecast supports and support
for lossless codecs it's free to try if
you're interested Dragon Quest six is a
JRPG out of Square Enix and it joins
dragon quest four and five as the
trilogy that tells the sanity and
storyline it features first-person
turn-based battles portrait mode
gameplay retro graphics and some side
quests and mini-games to give you a
break from the main story in classic
Square Enix fashion the game clocks in
with a fairly lofty price tag but there
is a long story with dozens of hours of
gameplay and there are no in-app
purchases Final Fantasy Tactics war of
the lions was a particularly awesome
release because the strategy RPG
community had been begging for a mobile
tactics game for quite some time this is
a remake of the original PlayStation
game with revamped graphics and the menu
system was also read bad for touchscreen
controls in fact the gameplay was also
tweaked for touchscreen controls and
altogether it was all surprisingly nice
it's expensive like all square enix
titles but it is a long game and again
no in-app purchases the game on project
is an application that helps you find
games the way it works is you install
the application open it take
survey and then your recommended games
based on how you answer the questions
listing all the games you know may be
tedious and some of the questions are a
little weird but the results are fairly
decent it's also totally free with no
in-app purchases so it's worth a shot if
you're looking for games it feels like a
good long time since Google photos first
came out but it really was a June
release for those who don't know Google
photos as a cloud-based storage
application where you can store an
infinite number of photos and videos for
free as long as you don't mind Google
processing them down a bit it also works
as a gallery application so you can see
your entire collection it simply a
must-have app with moments is a new
application released by Facebook that
essentially does the same thing as
Google photos with this service you can
backup your photos and share them on
Facebook facebook Messenger and
Instagram as you so choose photos can be
tagged searched and otherwise organized
you can also save photos other people
share with you directly to the service
it's not as powerful as Google photos
but it's worth a shot if you're really
big into Facebook the portal by
pushbullet is a new application that
helps you move files from your PC to
your Android device and vice versa the
interface is done in the flavor of
material design and it's extremely easy
to set up and use you can move a file
multiple files or even whole folders at
your whim and you can use the
application to browse and open files
that you've transferred the only caveat
is you need android lollipop or better
to use it shoot by bit torn is a phone
to phone transfer applications allows
you to transfer whatever you need
between two Android devices it works by
generating a QR code than the other
device scans it once the connection is
made the file is downloaded this
provides a dead simple solution to those
who want to share files whether they're
large or small the free version is a
trial but you can pay for the pro
version as an in-app purchase and unlock
the application permanently let's each
fall is a new freemium strategy game
from Gameloft in terms of gameplay it
falls somewhere between boom beach and
clash of clans by supercell but with way
better graphics more control and more to
do it features a very long campaign mode
and plenty of things to upgrade it is a
freemium title so do keep that in mind
but as far as freemium games go this is
probably among the best that will be
released this year once again I'm Joe
