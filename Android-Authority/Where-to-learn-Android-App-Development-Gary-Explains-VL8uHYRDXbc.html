Andrew authority now you've may have
wondered for a long time how do you get
into writing apps for Android what's the
secret what tools you need and how do
you do it well today I've got a big
announcement for you that's really going
to help those of you who want to learn
how to write Android apps so if you want
to find out more please let me explain
now writing Android apps can be really
enjoyable and can be very very rewarding
not only financially in some
circumstances but also kind of just
personal satisfaction that you have been
are creative and you've created an app
which you can actually publish a further
and wider on the Play Store now the real
there are three types of people that
want to know how to develop Android apps
one is the hobby it's someone who just
like to tinker someone who wants to just
kind of it's a pastime they won't know
how to do it they like doing it maybe
there's a little app they want to write
and they kind of like oh it'd be good if
I knew how to do that for whatever
interest they have in a real life and
they want to kind of write an app to do
that so the hobbyist the second kind of
person is really the kind of the indie
developer someone who wants a side gig
who actually wants to create Android
apps and maybe sell them on the App
Store maybe get a few dollars of revenue
and who knows made they write a big
success and they actually get quite a
lot of revenue but something that's kind
of for the independent developer and the
third kind of person is the software
professional who maybe knows how to
program on a desktop or knows how to
program servers but they'd like to get
into mobile so they're pivoting from
their existing programming experience
over to using a Android now in all three
cases there is a learning curve you need
to learn how to write Android apps now
of course there are many many ways of
learning how to do that you could buy
yourself a book you can go to the
YouTube and kind of pick up different
videos here and there or you can take a
course now what I'm announcing today is
a new Android development course that I
have made that is available on our new
sister website called digit Academy now
the idea behind a digit Kadim is we want
to teach you new skills so the first
course we've designed is the
introduction to Android app development
now what you get in this course is over
50
Sion's that take you from in installing
Android studio which is the fundamental
tool for writing Android apps right
through to writing fairly complicated
apps that you run on your device that
are talking to the network that are
reading files that are doing things with
graphics we're gonna cover all of it in
this course as well as 50 individual
lessons you also get over six hours of
video
where me Gary Sims tell you how to do
Android app development as well as the
50 lessons which includes six hours of
videos there is a third bonus and that
is you get access to a unique slack
channel where you can speak to me and
other software engineers as we help you
learn Android app development now as you
probably know Android app development
can be done with two main principle
programming languages Java and Kotlin
now this first course covers how you to
write Android apps in Java so along with
those six hours of video you get an
extra three hours of video where I'm
just talking about the fundamentals of
the Java programming language and those
skills are applicable to using the
desktop or using a server or to using a
smart phone it's just pure Java and
understanding how the Java language
works
so to summarize you get nine hours of
videos of which three hours is Java and
six hours is Android app development you
get access to over 50 lessons plus you
get access to a unique slack channel
where you can chat to me and together we
can go step-by-step to help you learn
Android app development
so check out digit Academy com and also
check out the Android Authority website

coupon codes and discounts
so that you can get the course at the
best price for any given moment
well my name's Gary Sims and this is
Andrea authoritative ideo and I really
