joking to the Android a 30 appt guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 174 so let's get
started adobe is reportedly working on
an application that will let you edit
images with your voice they released a
youtube video that demonstrates the tech
at work in the video the man crops the
image flips it around and then shares it
on facebook it's not currently available
for everybody but the demo is definitely
promising it could be months or years
before we see something like this hit
the market though so we'll just have to
be patient for right now google voice is
apparently reimagining itself once again
sometime soon those who still use the
service hubs likely see a notification
on their dashboard that a new version of
google voice is coming to consumers we
don't know what features are there yet
but it will definitely be coming soon
some have even had google voice call
them and leave a cryptic message about
speed dial it's been a while since boys
got an update so here's hoping it's
really awesome Facebook made headlines
this last week when it was reported that
the social media network may start using
mid video ads this means that you'll see
an ad in the middle of the video instead
of at the beginning or the end the
feature is currently in testing so
please book can see how users react to
it we imagine that it'll make its way to
Facebook proper if the blowback isn't
too bad as everybody knows Fitbit has
been busy buying up SmartWatch companies
apparently they're also working on an
app store according to CEO James Park
they want this test completed as soon as
humanly possible they didn't say why but
the popular conjecture is that the
company is working on its own SmartWatch
platform at least that's where all the
signs are pointing we don't know much
yet but we'll keep an eye out and we'll
let you know when something happens the
google hangouts API will be shutting
down in April the announcement came late
last week and had some people
legitimately worried about the service
basically what's happening is that a
bunch of applications that use the
hangup API will be denied access we're
talking about the applications and
Google Hangouts video chat that put some
mustache on your face or makes fun sound
effects the good news is that the app
itself isn't going anywhere star wars
force arena is an action-adventure game
featuring everybody's favorite galaxy
from far far away the game features
third-person freemium style combat
mechanics and you'll have to assemble a
team from 80 available characters you'll
also be able to form gills with friends
upgrade your characters and you'll be
able to compete with each other to earn
in-game rewards it's a freemium game
through and through so make sure to
temper your
expect a shin accordingly posture is an
application that tries to modernize your
posture the FDA arises that we look at
our phones an average of 85 times per
day and as it turns out we've probably
been doing it all wrong the application
uses the sensors in your phone to detect
when you're holding your phone at next
training positions it will then let you
know and you can adjust accordingly the
ultimate goal is to improve your posture
while using your phone it's completely
free if you want to try it out yugioh
duel lynx is the latest game in the
popular card collecting franchise like
most other games that came before it
this title is a card collecting game
you'll have to collect cards and then
build decks that you'll then use to duel
against opponents there is a campaign
mode as well as an online PvP mode as
you'd expect the mechanics are simple
enough to learn but still has a bit of
depth for those who want to play
seriously however it is a cranium game
and certainly plays like one weather Wiz
is a new weather application that's also
still in beta it covers the basic
features including temperatures that
feels like temperature forecasts UV
indexes and other things like that like
most there are also weather widgets
support for weather tracking for
multiple cities and a lot more the
design is simply done it actually looks
pretty good there are also themes that
you can apply if you want to it's a
solid weather app and it could get even
better before the beta is over it was
only a matter of time before someone
cashed in on the grumpy cat meme the
game is called grumpy cat's worst game
ever and essentially a game of mini
games you can do a little bit of fishing
eat food break boards and various other
activities you can also get high scores
on leaderboards win little in-game items
and share your progress with your
friends on social media it's a pretty
fun little time waster if you need
something to kill a few minutes for even
more Android apps and games news
