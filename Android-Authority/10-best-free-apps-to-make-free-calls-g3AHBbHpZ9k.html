handy the Android authority app guide in
this quick video we're gonna take a look
at the best Android apps to help you
make free phone calls first on our list
is Facebook Messenger the application
gives you the ability to make phone
calls to other Facebook users this is
actually really good because a lot of
people already use Facebook and thus
it's already available Google Hangouts
is Google's answer to Skype and with it
you can chat call and video chat with
people for free with other people who
use hangouts it's a solid platform and
only requires a Google account so pretty
much everybody watching this video can
already use it Kakao Talk is a very
popular messaging option particularly
outside of North America it allows you
to make group and individual calls to
other users and it works cross-platform
which is always a nice feature line is
another popular option outside of North
America and it has over 400 million
users worldwide
you can call line users for free and you
can call other people that are not on
line but it does cost a little bit of
money to do so magic app is brought to
you by magic Jack which many of you may
know for its free calling on computers
people in the US and Canada can make
free phone calls to almost anyone and
all caused to other magic app users are
of course free Nimbuzz has been around
for a while but doesn't get the press
that many of these others get as per the
norm you can call any Nimbuzz user free
of charge and the service also offers HD
voice calling pretty much everybody
knows about Skype with it you can chat
video call and voice call for free to
other Skype users and pay a nominal fee
to call regular phone numbers it's very
popular and frankly it's also a really
solid platform tango was one of the
early applications to allow for voice
calls on Android and it's still fairly
solid today not a lot of people use it
comparatively speaking but as usual you
can call any other tango user for free
viber is a popular messaging platform
that boasts over 200 million users to
date it's a fairly simple application
that allows you to send free messages
and calls to other vibrate users it also
supports group messaging last up is an
odd one with Yahoo Messenger you'll need
the application and a plugin to get it
to work most people probably won't use
this one but it is a solid experience if
everyone you know uses Yahoo and you go
through the pain of setting it up and
that about does it for this video folks
that video likely won't be updated but
the written version definitely will be
so check back every now and again to see
what's new also I'm always down for
hearing suggestions so if I missed a
really good application in this cat
Gouri let me know about it in the
comments if you haven't already don't
forget to follow us on social media and
subscribe to the YouTube channel as
always thanks forget for watching
everybody and have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
