and one of the comments I read quite
often attached to my YouTube videos
particularly videos that touch on
Android performance or on iOS in some
way is that Android isn't optimized now
why do people write that why do people
make those comments online YouTube
videos and is there any truth to it well
let me explain so why do people make
these comments that Android isn't
optimized well I think that there are
two reasons I think the first reason is
that somewhere deep in people's minds
whenever they read something that talks
about how a different phone other than
an Android phone could actually be doing
a good job they kind of have a you know
kind of a mental crisis and they have to
come up with an answer to why that
particular phone could be better than
the phone they have and somewhere deep
down in the psychology people say oh
it's because andrew is not optimized
maybe they're thinking that if it war
doctor my you think the next version of
Android that comes out or or something's
going to happen magically it's going to
make my phone better than the other
phone I think also there's an element to
it of the kind of whole idea that
applicant portraying for years even
before the iPhone came out and that is
that it just works this idea of a
tightly integrated system which of
course we found first of all in the Mac
Apple controlled the software the
hardware the ecosystem and that kind of
model they carried on forward into the
iPhone whereas of course Android comes
from a whole variety of different
manufacturers you've got Sony and
Samsung and HTC and LG and Huawei and
loads of others and they all use
processes from media taken Qualcomm and
Huawei and Samsung and they displays
from different places and their
different version of Android and people
talk about Android fragmentation and it
kind of gives this idea away or kind of
things like chaos and and and not a
coherence at all and that leastly idea
is not optimized
whereas Apple is just optimized
one phone for one manufacturer with one
Hardware one software and it's all meant
to be tightly knit together well is that
true let's have a look so the first
thing we have to look at is the
different programming languages that I
use for iOS and for Android because
wherever your accusations that are often
thrown at Android is a user's Java and
Java has to use a virtual machine
because it uses an intermediate language
called the Java bytecode which is
interpreted at runtime on the phone
whereas iOS uses native apps you you use
an objective-c or Swift compiler and it
produces direct machine code which runs
on the phone there for Android is slow
in unoptimized whereas iOS is sleek and
fast well that's really actually not
true and there are a number of reasons
for that first of all on a normal app
for example if I am using the Gmail app
the app spends most of its time actually
just waiting for me to press something
it's not kind of doing intensive
computing tasks it's not kind of you
know calculating all these immensely
difficult things you know he's waiting
me to tap something and then when I tap
something actually then wait for the
network to respond so if I'm using a 3G
connection or a 4G connection or or you
know I thought wait two days to come
over the network and then come back to
my phone before it can display something
so apps actually spend most of their
time waiting for user input or waiting
for the network and the majority of
productivity apps don't do much in the
terms of calculations I mean there's not
much calculational CPU power going into
displaying email for example and it's
also worth mentioning that there is a
native development kit available for
Android where you can write programs in
C and C++ and if you play any kind of
game based on unity or based on the
Unreal Engine and there's probably
several others as well they're actually
just native apps not running in Java
they're running
C that's being compiled down to machine
code because you couldn't do all that 3d
stuff in Java you really have to do it
for the best performance in C so at the
end of the day when they use benchmarks
or running I actually contacted
Geekbench about this I asked the people
at geek bench when you run a benchmark
are we trying to compare Java on Android
and Objective C on an Apple phone missus
know both of them actually written in C
and they both compile using the
respective tool chains you get the same
code running on both Android and running
on on iOS it's not a debate about Java
versus C or native versus Java that's
just naturally not true another thing
that's interesting is that actually
Android has developed its virtual
machine significantly over the years and
androids being developments before 2008
if you compare Android 2.0 X to androids
7 that we have to doe mean there's a
huge difference between them and the
code has been modified and changed and
being made better for example we've seen
these new changes with the art virtual
machine actually there's so much
compiling that goes on beforehand so
actually the Java rack are turned into
native apps but it does that actually in
the phone when you install the app and
if you look at my Java versus C
performance video that I've done on this
channel you will see that while C is
faster it Java isn't so terribly slow
that actually is just it's just
laughable but actually the difference
between Java and C is actually not as
far apart as we might think now there's
also the other interesting thing is
actually large parts of Android itself
are written in C and not in Java for
example the Linux kernel which is part
of Android is completely written in C
and there are other part of the android
framework now the part in android
subsystems are all written in c so it's
not as if we're waiting for Java for
absolutely everything that goes on
there's lots of C in native machine code
that running when an Android app run
then there's a question of does Apple
add some hardware optimizations that
aren't available for example in Android
things that can happen in hardware and
therefore happen quicker but Android
isn't able to do now there's probably
some truth to this how they get to the
bottom of it is a little difficult
let me explain Apple have what's called
architectural license from arm which
means they're allowed to design their
own CPUs they've got their own engineers
and they don't actually ask arm for
anything they just say we're going to
sign an arm compatible CPU now that
compatibility is verified by a set of
tests they have to run provided by arm
but when they run them they get the
results that says this is an arm
compatible CPU core but the question
that's kind of floating around and I've
been I've asked people this in kind of
tech conferences and so on is does Apple
add extra instructions to the CPU
because the test as far as I know can't
test for extra instructions they can
only test a standard arm program will
realm up a new CPU without failing and
then it adheres to the specifications of
the instruction set now let me give an
example in arm v7 there was no
cryptographic instructions for doing a
AES of cryptography and when arm
invented arm v8 they added in these
instruction so now when you do a s
cryptography on an arm 64-bit ARM
processor it actually loads times faster
like seven or eight times faster than it
would be on a 32-bit arm v7 architecture
because there are these extra
instructions that are very useful for
doing as a cryptography kind of
operations so maybe Apple have analyzed
their own operations and maybe they've
analyzed their own SDK to say hey if we
had an instruction that did this that
could give us a five percent increase to
it another instruction that did this
that could give us another five cents
into it and they may have added that to
their silicon now that is possible now
the problem is the compilers that are
Apple use are open-source and when we
look at the compilers we don't see
immediately anyway we don't see that
there are extra instructions that are
being being produced by this compiler
now could it be that Apple have their
own in-house compilers for compiling our
iOS itself that also possibly true so we
have anecdotal evidence that Apple could
be doing this but actually nothing
nothing concrete now a second way that
Apple could be actually boosting things
in hardware is to create a
six type of execution engine that's very
good at doing a certain thing now we
actually only have those in all fo seas
from Apple and from Qualcomm and Samsung
and whoever because the GPU and DSPs and
image processors are exactly that they
are bits of discrete Hardware on the
chip that are good at doing certain
things hey you want a something encoded
in a particular video codec well ask the
video encoder do it and that's done in
hardware so Apple could be adding in
something else that says hey we know
that we do a lot of this kind of stuff
in our in our operating system so if we
had a piece of hardware that did it then
it would be really good you just load up
the kind of the data and you say to that
bit of hardware go and execute and
process that now that could be very well
true and that could be buried into the
SDK so that when an app developer writes
an app the SDK automatically calls that
execution unit to do that kind of thing
but here's the interesting thing you see
because Qualcomm and others can do
exactly the same thing if you look at a
Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU it's full of
different components including the DSP
an isp and and the GPU and the SDKs that
they provide allow you to call those
functions of fat Qualcomm have what's
called the hexagon DSP SDK which allows
apps writers to compile apps and
optimize them for core core processors
and the DSP could not does more than
just digital signal processing which is
what it original was used for now you
can even do image processing it can do
recognition it can do some kind of VR
and AR and it's really complicated kind
of dedicated piece of hardware that does
specialist functions so if Apple are
doing that we can also be sure that
people like Holcomb and Samsung are also
doing that as well so what about system
integration every piece of hardware
needs a piece of software so Apple
designed the processor for their phone
but they also have to design these
software and because they are working
for the same company and there's a great
level of coherence between these two
teams obviously they're working very
closely to make sure all the software
and hardware work together very well and
that can't be true in Android well
because there's all these different OEMs
all we did
SOC makers and all this well actually
it's not quite like that
for example arm when they license some
of their intellectual property like this
is a court it's a 73 core to someone
like Iowa or the cortex a53 core to
someone like mediatek they have to
provide them with the software that goes
with it because there's a whole bunch of
stuff that's needed also for the GPU and
for the CPUs there's a whole bunch of
softer now now those companies crew
write all that software themselves but
there's very little point arm our
specialist at working with their own
hardware so they sell hardware and
software to these SOC makers so that
when the SOC makers then produces a chip
actually it has the right driver than
the right software and of course it's in
arms absolute benefit that those drivers
are optimized absolutely essential then
it gets the best performance through
that software so there are loads of
software engineers at arm who work on
just making the Android software and
likewise if you're coming like Qualcomm
of course who design their own core
sometimes who've got their own GPU they
have their own people just like Apple do
and just like arm to who write their own
software to make sure the drivers the
integration with Android is at its most
efficient otherwise it's pointless than
spending millions and millions of
dollars developing the latest Snapdragon
processor and then they've got no
software for it and in fact they're
losing 30 percent their performance
through some by software that doesn't
happen they've got equal investment in
the software and in the hardware and
what about Android itself maybe people
think the Android operating them is
somehow just kind of this woolly blob
but it doesn't really have any
optimization well again that's not true
because first of all a open source which
means that of course lots of people have
looked at the code i've looked at the
code lots of people have made changes to
it lots of people work on the linux
kernel and the loads of different stuff
that are going or arm themselves
contribute loads of code to the nearest
kernel specifically for ARM processors
and specifically for mobile then of
course you've got Qualcomm and you've
got Samsung and you've got all these
other companies Sony
HTC and LG they all have to build
Android themselves for their phones and
it doesn't take too much of a brilliant
engineer to do a quick test to say hey
this is running slowly on our piece of
hardware let's find out why oh look
there's not to Malaysian we can do here
that's not really rocket science for
engineers who do this thing absolutely
every day so there's been loads of
engineering eyes who have actually been
studying the code and looking at it to
find out whether there are any
optimizations that can be done now
that's kind of code level optimization
but what our system level you know how
the whole thing is put together from the
kernel and the drivers and the
frameworks and the java virtual machine
and the apps on top about how is that
all optimized well think about who write
it we're talking about Google here now
Google are brilliant at doing system
integration I mean Gmail YouTube Google
search I mean none of these things could
work properly with all the millions of
requests per second all the videos being
streamed constantly that just will all
fall apart if Google were no good at
doing system integration but they are
good at doing sin to me integration
that's why they've got thousands and
thousands of servers and huge server
rooms and just terabytes and terabytes
of of hearted and it's all optimized at
the system level to develop and to
deliver the most efficient a video and
email and open search results because
otherwise their business which is go
bankrupt so therefore of course Google
engineers have that knowledge and the
idea that the Android team can't do that
kind of thing as well it just is just
plainly absurd so where does that leave
us
well basically it means that Android is
optimized it's optimized at a system
level because Google know how to put
together a system it optimizes the code
level because so many different
engineers looked at the code it's
optimized by every OAM you see Samsung
are going to spend loads of money on
developing the latest handset and then
find it crippled by some bad software
that's not going to happen they got
software engineers working on that but
why do we still have this question that
Apple products are more integrated but
again it goes back to what I think I
said at the beginning there is this kind
of story put out by
Appl that it just works that the
integrated approach is the best approach
where they control the hardware the
software and the ecosystem but really of
course it actually comes down to this
there's only about one iPhone per year
where there are hundreds of Android
phones and that dedication that focus on
bringing out just one phone kind of lead
people to believe that they've Apple
have put all their efforts into doing
this one thing and they're not
distracted by doing other things whereas
Android seems to be chaotic seem to be
so many hands that so many different
things and surely that must be better
than that well actually it is not true
because companies like Samsung the
companies like LG and other comes out
just wouldn't be able to survive if they
didn't have an optimized solution for
Android well my name is Gary Sims from
AI under Authority I hope you enjoyed
this video I really look forward to
hearing your comment below
just one thing if you are going to
comment and place things like you have
Android is an optimized give me some
proof show me something that tells you
that Android isn't optimized show me the
code point to me to an area where you
can say I know this is not my kind
really like to know if it's just a
woolly ideas you've got what I hope this
video has corrected your your woolly
thinking please don't forget to
