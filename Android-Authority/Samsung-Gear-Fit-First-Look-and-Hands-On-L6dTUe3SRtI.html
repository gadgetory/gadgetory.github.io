by bitdefender mobile security imagine
the Samsung gear in a different form
factor that at least in our opinion
makes a little bit more sense
aah Strasbourg are from Android thority
what's going on everybody and this is a
first look at the Samsung gear fit the
Samsung gear fit is a bracelet style
SmartWatch that is similar in
functionality with the gear 2 but the
fit is actually very small and it's a
very light device equipped with a curved
AMOLED display that can be mounted on an
interchangeable rubber strap and as the
name suggests the gear fit is targeted
at the booming market of fitness devices
where devices like the Fitbit and the
Nike Plus have so far been very popular
to Samsung the fit is able to resist
quite a bit of rough handling thanks to
its compact build and its resistance to
water and dust much like the Galaxy s5
the fit is actually certified with an
ip67 certification just like the gear 2
the gear fit is powered by Samsung's new
Tizen operating system which the company
just recently introduced at MWC and even
if it is smaller the gear fit
encompasses much of the same
functionality of the more conventional
SmartWatch as you see today including
the media control finding your device
and of course notifications now as far
as the feel of the gear fit on my wrist
it is in my opinion easier and more
intuitive to put on than the gear
whereas the strap system on the gear or
the gear 2 might have been a little bit
tough to fiddle with at first or at
times even afterwards the gear fit is
simply dawned on by snapping a couple
pins in I do question whether or not
this will allow it to stay on your wrist
after some vigorous let's say jogging
but for the most part it feels secure
now one question I did have was in
regards to the display while it is a
very vibrant and lovely flexible AMOLED
screen in landscape
I wonder if wearing it on the top of my
wrist was actually practical when
considering the way one would wear a
traditional watch it honestly just made
more sense for me to have it inverted on
my wrist so I can look at it easily in
its sideways position and of course
being a fitness minded device there is a
heart rate monitor found on the back of
the fits unit that uses an infrared
sensor to see through your skin to count
your pulse to work the device needs to
be in tight
contact with the skin but that's not too
much of a problem with the adjustable
strap that is easy to adjust other
Fitness related functionality is the
pedometer and the exercise monitor that
make use of the onboard sensors even if
you're not into fitness and outdoor
activity you still will probably
appreciate the fit as a SmartWatch and
also you're probably going to appreciate
the fact that the gear fit takes the
SmartWatch idea and kind of makes it its
own style Samsung will sell several
color options for the rubber strap so
the sleek little gizmo can make a great
fashion accessory to the pricing and
availability are still unclear but we
are definitely looking forward to seeing
this hit the market at a competitive
price point so keep it tuned to Android
