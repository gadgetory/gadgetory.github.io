think so far it's been pretty pretty
relaxed compared to the shows that we've
done before but definitely a lot of cool
stuff to see a lot of especially if
you're a gamer a lot a lot of really
tight games to see and just a lot of VR
stuff that we've seen so far but a lot
of cool mobile games and obviously
console games so it's been pretty good
experience in feels really laid back
it's incredibly different from any other
show that we've ever done before and
really it's just we're looking at games
the whole time ends you would think that
we shouldn't get paid to do that yeah
it's it's a very different experience
like just because it's so new to us the
approach is very it's very different its
kind of it we kind of just we're just
kind of like playing it by ear a little
bit so yeah but it is interesting yeah
so we were able to okay so everyone
definitely make sure you check out our
full videos for these particular
products that we were able to see but we
got to take a look at the merge VR just
a different kind of VR platform very
similar to cardboard made of a much more
comfortable material I think is the main
way to put it but it also came with a
controller now on you were able to take
a look at another game as well I've been
getting the name wrong all night but I
think I know it's dawn of titans right
yeah I got the name wrong too but yeah
the dawn of titans if you ever played
like a tower defense type game like
clash of clans anything like that it's
very similar to that type of game where
you sort of have to build yourself up
and upgrade your troops upgrade your in
this game they call it a Titan but other
games they're called heroes and you sort
of upgrade those groups and you can sort
of go through and get other perks like
spells and things like that just sort of
make you stronger in terms of attacking
other other opponents and it's a
multiplayer game so it's really
immersive one of the most immersive
tower defense games that I've seen its
you can kind of it's a 3d world so you
can you know spin things around and look
at things from every different angle so
it's really
and the graphics were just I mean there
were some of the best graphics i've seen
on a on a mobile game yeah we felt that
way about siege fall also so we went to
a different developer and we found siege
fall and it delivery awesome also you
know and I'm not really a clash of clans
type of gaming person but this seemed
like a take on that that you know really
brought some really great graphic some
nice details and honestly it looks kind
of badass in some aspects yes each fall
definitely it's very similar to and had
a lot of really cool elements that I
really loved like the spells and stuff
they'd had in that game you could bring
a dragon down and it goes and just
basically obliterates everything so it's
pretty awesome game too yeah so once we
were done with that this is obviously
our first day recap we finally got to
get our butts out to the actual show
floor now we only went to one particular
hall so we weren't able to see let's say
Nintendo not too much xbox stuff but we
did get to see a lot of what would be my
favorite things and I sorry I took up a
lot of time looking at what I really
wanted to see I have to talk about this
street fighter 5 I spent as much time as
I possibly could there I'm a huge Street
Fighter fan I play street fighter for
all the time and street fighter 5 is
coming out in spring of 2016 which is
not soon enough but they announced one
at least one new character that I'm
really excited about they did they did
renounce Nash wish it which is basically
the Franken version of Charlie from the
Alpha series and I have to say he plays
really well there's some footage that
you're probably seeing here of us
playing now lon did win a couple of you
won a couple of rounds by button mashing
I did I did like a super slow-mo of him
button mashing and it still looks really
fast but then I got on the white stick
yeah I got it I got a chance to play
Josh and if you ever wanted to see a
lawn versus Josh this is probably the
only one you're ever gonna see
he he beat me so well we were both Ryu
though so it was kind of like I guess
fair yeah in doing some weird twisted
way yeah about my button mashing failed
me well me right that was not the capcom
booth obviously and we did get to take a
look at a couple of other booths on EA
was the one that i was really excited
about with mirrors edge mirrors edge is
one of those super underrated games that
i feel like didn't get it just deserves
obviously and finally it is because
they're remaking it and now we have a
full fledged Mirror's Edge we stayed at
that EA booth for quite a while and I
which is like we're not going anyone so
i watch this trailer um only enough we
went to square enix i did not see we
rather didn't see the Final Fantasy 7
remake that was supposed to be there but
I did but that but I know across the way
is where we did find Capcom and they had
street fighter 5 and mighty number 9
which is the spiritual successor to Mega
Man which I will be playing tomorrow or
the next day but at capcom you got to
look at a updated special edition of i
was a devil may cry yeah I got to I want
to know I actually wanted to play
Resident Evil 0 but there was too many
people the booth so devil may cry was
just basically right next to it and
there was a lot of free space so I went
over there checked it out and it's a lot
of fun it's a really cool game up I
never really i'm not a big expert on
devil may cry haven't played it a lot
but it was pretty awesome so I had a lot
of fun playing that game too but i'm
definitely looking forward to checking
out a lot of the other games like the EA
games and the star wars game looks
extremely cool so i want to be that
might be the first thing on our on our
yes yes it needs to be because there
were a ton of people just playing that
game it was just extremely hard to to
get in there so hopefully we can kind of
get in there and play that for a little
bit tomorrow but those are one those are
the ones obviously in the console area
that we want to take a look at but as
far as the android front goes we did
bring you guys some nice coverage today
and we have even more coming in the next
couple of days as andrew grush krushi as
we call them was able to give us a
packed schedule especially for the last
day of e3 tomorrow we'll probably get a
little bit more fun and make sure to
share
with you guys either on here or on
periscope to show you what ether is all
about if we get cellular coverage or
Wi-Fi inside of that Hall because we
don't just was not happening yeah it
definitely was a little bit spotty yeah
so keep it tuned to android authority
for even more this is our first time at
e3 and we're super happy to be here and
super happy to bring you all of our
coverage and also just to be able to
share with you what might be the one
show that a lot of you guys have been
wanting to go to for a long time so
hopefully we're sharing with you
everything you need in order to
experience this with us so keep it tuned
to android authority for even more from
