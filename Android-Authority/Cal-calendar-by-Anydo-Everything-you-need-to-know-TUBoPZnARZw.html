Andy the Android authority app guy cow
calendar is the most beautiful calendar
widget that we've ever seen but is it as
functional as it is good-looking in this
video we're gonna find out so what does
this app actually do as the name implies
it's a calendar app and it does calendar
app things it has all the functionality
you need in a calendar app including
syncing your calendars adding and
editing events and there is even a to-do
list plug-in that you can get from the
Google Play Store that's really it folks
it comes with some nice widgets for
phones and tablets but at the end of the
day it just does what you'd expect a
calendar app to do what makes it
different is how it looks from the
others and it does look really good as
you can imagine this app can be used to
replace your calendar app with how the
UI is set up both power users and casual
users of the calendar could easily make
the switch without relearning how to use
anything of course your mileage may vary
as different people have different needs
but cow calendar does pretty well at
being better than most stock offerings
so here's what we liked it looks really
good we can't stress that enough bright
colorful images and a modular GUI makes
navigation easy and enjoyable it's the
most simple calendar app we've ever used
adding events is mostly a matter of
selecting boxes with very little typing
unless you need it and here's the bad
there are still a few bugs to iron out
people in the Play Store are complaining
of slow performance even on flagship
devices and even we ran into a force
closer to while testing we're sure the
devs are working on it right now but
those bugs are still there all things
considered this app is legitimately good
there are a few release date bugs and
that's to be expected but aside from
that we really couldn't find anything
wrong with this application it has a
great design all the calendar functions
most people will need are there and it's
easy to use if you use your calendar app
it's worth picking this one up to see if
it's for you because we definitely
recommend it and it's also free once
