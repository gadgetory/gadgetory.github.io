it's a digital experience here we're in
las vegas live for CES
we're looking at one of the latest
devices from sony this is called the
Xperia S it's a particularly actually a
beautiful device it's got a matte rubber
black great 12 megapixel camera thats
appears to be really really really
sponsored the prominent promising us Ice
Cream Sandwich they won't give us a
target date but in terms of internal
specs we're looking at a 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core processor they don't have a
confirmed whether you know it's a TI
over this Qualcomm but they're pretty
sure it's going to be able to snap
dragon variety it's got 1 gig of ram on
board is going to come in a 32 gigabyte
of flavor like I said before we have a
12 megapixel camera is going to have
micro HDMI out USB connectivity got dual
mics but what really makes this stand
out is that it is a 720p display and it
actually does appear to be quite
brilliant see we can bring up the
gallery here it is very responsive
device
it feels really good in the hand just to
give you guys a sense of how thin it is
samsung galaxy s2 8.4 nine millimeters
and here is the sony so it's on par and
in fact it has a curved back it feels
really good in the hand it's really
really well-balanced and we're really
satisfied with this performance so far
so thanks for checking out the video
we're just going to compare it with
another leading sony device that's
coming up here which is the xperia ion
it's a pretty massive one as you can see
but not too much different screen size
is just a little bit larger so we have
the Xperia S on the lap with a 4.3 inch
720p tease excuse me 720p display and
then we have the Xperia with a 4.6 and
as we can tell with the Galaxy Nexus in
the arrival of other large devices 4.6
is going to be the way to go and
actually it feels really good in the
hand and can almost reach anyway this is
very selective a reporting live from CES
commander authorities thanks for
checking out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
