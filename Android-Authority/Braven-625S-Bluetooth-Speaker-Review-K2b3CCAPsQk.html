Youngberg coming at you from Android
authority comm number one source for all
things Android today we're gonna have a
quick review of the Bravin 6 2 5 s
speaker system this is an awesome
speaker system it's Bluetooth extra
portable extra durable and then it can
also charge your phone and has a quite
impressive battery life anyways well
unbox of this one right here as you can
see we do have one completely unbox but
I do want to show you the cool things
that are included in the box of one of
these when you do get one at least run
for one hundred and seventy-five dollars
which puts it a little bit more
advantageous of a price point than such
speaker systems like the Jawbone Jambox
which is $200 and a lot of these little
Bluetooth speaker systems are highly
priced but they still work really well
and they're awesome convenient and
rugged so you'll find yourself using
them a lot sanae's we're just taking the
tape off this box here as you can see on
the box we do have our little contents
here it says right here we are working
with a portable Bluetooth speaker
speaker phone USB mobile charger and it
includes water resistant dry bag USB LED
light USB and audio cables lanyard and
powered adapter and it was on the front
we can see that we are checking out our
HD wireless speaker system speaker phone
/ phone charger rockin music and videos
in high fidelity audio and it tells us
we get 16 hours of battery life now
again on the side right here says we
have our sound extreme technology by
Bravin ready to brave the outdoors
braving audio is crafted reproduce every
note with the perfect fusion of crisp
eyes for mids and powerful bass now I
can attest to the fact that this does
have a lot of bass
anyways 1700 milliamp portable backup
battery which is really great you know
when the battery is fully charged if
your phone's dying you can simply plug
your phone right into the Braman speaker
system and you'll have a charged phone
in no time anyways let's take out the
rest of the contents simply lift this
flap a lot of cool packaging got a QR
code some other really unnecessary stuff
here's where we get our nice travel bag
as you can see it is water-resistant
it's got a nice breathin branding on
there
and some nice side clips heels anyways
here is our LED light I won't take all
this out of its little packaging but our
LED light is right here we can demo that
out then we have our micro USB used for
charging the Bravin and charging the
phone from the Bravin we have our 8
millimeter headphone jack or your
auxiliary cable and then we have our AC
adapter / power converter to actually
charge the Bravin now you just want to
go like that to take the breathing out
of the box you can see we got two right
here we're gonna go ahead and use this
one because it's suggested that the
brave and charge is fully before
actually powering it up so I'll show you
how to actually pair your device to a
brave in using my Samsung Galaxy s3 so
on the side of the Bravin we've got our
power selector simply move that up to
turn it on get audio notification that
is running we have our Bluetooth call
button we have volume up and down our in
for the 8 millimeter and then we have
our microUSB in on the other side we
have our eight millimeter out we have
our battery notification button and we
have our USB to microUSB out and as you
can see there's two speakers behind the
stainless steel grill I've got our
brevin branding right here 6 - 5 s so in
order to pair devices you're going to
want to click the Bluetooth button on
the Bravin and hold it and then we're
going to scan for devices on our
Bluetooth device here so you can see
breathin 6 - 5 s came up simply click
pair and we will have our device paired
in no time okay so we're paired we'll
select a song to test out the brave in 6
- 5 s see we are using the USB audio we
can control it using our phone audio we
can also control on the brave in itself
by using the volume up and down rocker
sounds very very nice has nice base and
nice mids and highs as well of course
most of the sound is coming out of the
front in the direction that the
speaker's are facing but we do get a
light a nice up bassy tone from the back
if you set this on the table it'll
really vibrate it works awesome of
course you can control it through any
music player you are using with your
smartphone try our USB light as well so
your USB light works really well multi
tasking with the Bravin to charge our
phone so you get our micro USB cable
we'll just plug her in all while
listening music still folks see we are
charging our device
great great device go ahead and shut
this off real quick get our final
thoughts so anyway some of the final
thoughts on the brave and six to five s
really really nice solid music player it
kind of does have a high price point at
one hundred and seventy-five dollars but
you know if you're looking for a nice
rugged outdoors capable Bluetooth
speaker system I would suggest checking
it out is it it is a lot more rugged
than the Jawbone Jambox per se that's
the other speaker system that's
bluetooth and similar to what I've
experienced with this Bravin but we do
have a lot of nice features such as the
ability to charge our phone from a large
battery you know it's got a lot of nice
powerful bass good mids clean highs
basically any song or movie that I've
streamed through this device has come
out in perfect clarity
there's no distortion whatsoever due to
the actual speaker it's usually just the
audio track or something anyways we have
a lot of nice buttons on the side as
well that are protected with this rubber
so they're not really going to hit any
rocks or anything if they take a tumble
nice notification lights it really
refined build quality as well can't
there's no give or anything with this
device very strong within your hands the
rubber has bouncing qualities of course
and that's just a really great device so
if you guys want to check out a nice
Bluetooth speaker system don't leave out
the Bravin HD wireless speaker system
the six to five s to be exact
anyways guys this is Clayton with
Android authority comm bringing you a
nice accessory review for your Android
devices and thanks for watching guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
