with Android authority and the on rate
is a bit unique and offering both a high
end dual camera experience and an
affordable price so in this video let's
take a closer look with our eight dual
camera feature focus now before we
actually take a look at some sample
images let's get the technical details
out of the way first of all yes there
are actually
two camera lenses here with F 2.2
apertures thanks to honors unique dual
camera technology when you go to take a
picture the first lens captures a color
image well the second captures a
monochrome image essentially this allows
for much more light to reach the camera
sensors which is crucial for producing
better more vivid 12 megapixel images
with crispier details and also with the
help of the faster aperture and larger
pixel size the on rate is quite
functional in lower light conditions as
well the dual tone LED flash is a small
detail but helps even out skin tones
when using the flash the laser works
together with contrast detection for
hybrid autofocus which on IRS's improves
the autofocus speed which is obviously
very important when capturing
time-sensitive subjects also we can't
forget about the 8 megapixel
front-facing camera with an F 2.4
aperture it seems to produce great
results and although honours beauty mode
is alive and well there's now a slider
to control the amount of skin softening
the results can still look unnatural but
you could always tone down the effect or
turn it off if need be
the camera app also provides a bunch of
primary camera modes like manual
panorama HDR and time-lapse each of
which works fairly well in this image
the panorama mode did an excellent job
with stitching for example not all the
results were perfect as you can see in
this image but the mode does very well
overall there's also a wide aperture
mode which adds artificial background
blur up to F 0.95 it's really fun to
play around with and you can definitely
get a more artistic shot when using it
with that said it often stumbles
incorrectly isolating the foreground and
lower contrast scenes like this one
although there is an HDR mode manual
selectable from the menu actually didn't
notice much of a difference when using
it that's probably because the normal
automatic mode already provides more
than enough dynamic range switching over
to the photos taken in auto mode you can
see just how well the cameras on the NR
8 are able to balance the highlights and
the shadows for example what the sky
here is just a tad overexposed the
statue in the center is surprisingly
well detailed contrast is pretty good
too
across the board and the phone seems to
do well with color saturation images
aren't really oversaturated but they're
still fairly punchy overall the honor
rates camera captures great stills and
good lighting here are some more general
camera samples taken with the honor
8 unfortunately video recording just
isn't up to par with competing options
whereas most others go up to 4k at 30
frames per second the honor 8 is limited
to 1080p 60 feet capture colors are
pretty muted as well and the software
processing can sometimes mix up the
white balance mid shot which definitely
doesn't look good there also isn't any
optical image stabilization so it can
sometimes be tricky to get a steady shot
low-light performance is surprisingly
strong here when compared to other
affordable flagships despite some
noticeable noise and dim conditions
colors are also expected ly less punchy
and more muted but there is still a fair
bit of contrast in many shots detail can
be hit or miss in low-light and depends
largely at how steady you hold the phone
when taking the shot in an effort to
compensate for the lack of light the on
rate selects a slower shutter speed
which means the sensor gets exposed for
a longer period of time but once you
minimize camera shake you can almost
always get a decent shot while the NR
eights camera isn't as impressive in
low-light compared to other phones like
the galaxy s7 it's important to consider
honors competitive pricing perhaps the
most impressing aspect here is how honor
was able to largely avoid compromising
camera performance at the phone's
affordable price if you'd like to learn
