hindi the android authority app guy and
in this very quick little video we're
gonna take a tour of hangouts 4.0 which
is rolling out to everybody right now
right off the bat you'll notice a rather
substantial number of visual changes the
application seems to have been brought
up to code in terms of material design
and even includes the hallmark floating
action button perhaps the most immediate
and noticeable changes the floating
action button and the removal of the old
contacts tab before you had to swipe
over to the contacts tab in order to
start a new conversation that entire
thing has been built directly into the
action button so that's where you go to
start a new conversation and video calls
this is actually a big improvement and
it makes things a little more efficient
and ergonomic inside of the chats you'll
notice an entirely new layout that
actually does pretty much what it did
before but its laid out in a much more
logical way across the bottom you'll
have a host of buttons to share things
like photos gifs emojis stickers and
your location along with a button to
take a photo and share it immediately
this new layout takes full advantage of
all the things that hangouts can do and
there's even room for expansion in case
they want to add more it should be noted
that this is the easiest access a user
has ever had to stickers and we did
actually like that and ask you for
permission for your location if you have
it set that way in your Google accounts
the settings menu is more or less the
same as it always has been there aren't
any noticeable changes here aside from
some tweaks to the layout to make things
easier to find it should be noted that
the custom Status Messages are now back
and this time hopefully they're back to
stay there were a handful of other
changes as well those who use google
voice can now reply to group MMS
messages and hangouts and those who use
the Hangouts dialer can now make calls
with outbound caller ID so those on the
other end know exactly who's supposed to
be calling them and of course those who
use Android wear should be able to send
hangouts messages on the fly by saying
ok Google said the hangouts message and
that should be built right in now and
that about wraps it up for the features
under the hood the developers have
stated that they've been on a warpath to
fix bugs and better optimize the
application and that means depending on
your device and version of andr the
application should respond better and
faster than it did previously although
your mileage may vary you should also
use less battery hangouts
you should deliver and send faster and
messages should fail to send far less
frequently but of course time will tell
with that like I said folks it's nice
and quick most of the changes are visual
but there are a few little fun features
added in and performance improvements
baked in as well it should be rolling
out right now to device near you but if
you want to try it out early will have
the download link for the apk in the
written companion which is linked in the
video description below and that's it
for this one folks if you haven't
already don't forget to subscribe to
android authority because we are your
source for all things Android as always
thanks for watching everybody and have a
wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
