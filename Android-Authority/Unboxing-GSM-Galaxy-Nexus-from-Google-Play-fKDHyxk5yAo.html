clayton youngberg coming at you as
always from android authority calm your
number one source for all things android
now in front of me today I've got a
Galaxy Nexus gsm version right from the
google play store just arrived we're
gonna do an unboxing them in a quick
spec rundown on this bad boy now the
Galaxy Nexus has been around for a while
that's actually my daily driver I'm
rocking the verizon version right here
but we decided we pick one up for you
guys to be able to show you some
differences between jelly bean and ICS
got that video coming soon and I would
just wanted another one on deck so let's
go ahead and check it out got a nice
packaging from google play it's a
different packaging than the carrier
variants such as I verizon and sprint go
ahead and open the seal here nice little
message that we should not accept the
device if the seal is broken I would
anyways because I gotta have my galaxy
nexus goodness anyways we have our usual
FCC information here no specs on the
back we just to have our device pictures
here on the front we'll remove the lid
they're awesome Galaxy Nexus now you
gotta love the packaging from the google
play store awesome google colors around
the edges like that here's our actual
device a nice little screen protector on
their Galaxy Nexus questions go to
google.com / Nexus got our protective
wrappings on there now the battery is
not in here already know it because it
feels so light beautiful 4.6 inch Super
AMOLED display on this with a resolution
of 720 x 1280 now this has 316 PPI which
is actually really good so still better
than a lot of the devices out there
these days so we'll lift this office is
just a little compartment where the
device went we've got a quick start
guide as well also got a nice USB cable
nice headset and then our battery I'm
sure in here's where we'll find our AC
adapter nice a small AC adapter just go
ahead and put these contents back in the
box I have hundreds of these Chargers
lying around so I'll just know where it
is if I ever need it slap the box back
on we'll give it a nice boot up I'd
assume that the
battery does have some power hopefully
so here we've got our SIM card and this
has got 16 gigabytes of internal storage
so we'll pop our battery in here and
just make sure that goes in and then we
simply from the bottom put our backing
back on I've got some extended batteries
i'll pop in here and if there's any
reviews you guys want to see from the
google nexus we'll go ahead and do that
but let's power it up for the first time
right now let that startup you see we
don't have our little bootloader
unlocked icon will quickly compare this
to our verizon nexus side by side as
well just let that boot up for a minute
our classic ICS boot up animation i
haven't seen that and while I've gotten
to use to flashing custom roms over the
past few months since owning my galaxy
nexus well we've got our initial setup
screen I'm just putting the backing on
my verizon galaxy nexus I have a
different backing on because of the
extended battery but you see not too
many differences um my verizon one will
be a bit bigger just because of the
extended battery I'm rocking in there
everything else the same but we do have
our nice Google logo instead of the
verizon 4g LTE got our little dock pins
here power menus now that's a different
one too if you notice just very subtly
this has a different power icon on there
then the gsm version now of course i'm
running a custom rom on mine and jelly
bean but we'll set that aside go through
the initial setup you don't have a sim
card yet for this well i do i'm not
going to put it in just yet and i'll
skip the Wi-Fi and go next i'm just
going to skip all this is to show you
guys the home screen before we end the
video and let's see if the ships with
jelly bean i don't think
does ship with jellybeans I think it
ships with ICS go back so let's check
that out go into our settings scroll all
the way down yep it ships with four dot
0 dot for ice cream sandwich but I will
be thrown jelly bean on this phone and
will be actually restoring one of these
two stock ICS and keeping one at the
stock jelly bean just so we can give you
a head-to-head comparison between the
two OS is and show you the rundown on
everything that is different between
them anyways guys that was our unboxing
of the GSM Galaxy Nexus straight from
the google play store go ahead and pick
one up it's still a great device it
competes with the galaxy s3 and it's my
daily driver so yeah guys thanks for
watching the video as always we greatly
appreciate your views and your loyalty
to android authority com we're
constantly striving to be the best we
can for you guys so if you got any
suggestions just let us know this is
clayton from android authority calm and
