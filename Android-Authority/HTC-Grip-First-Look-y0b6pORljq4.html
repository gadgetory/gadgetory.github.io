were actually quite true HDC was going
to bring a wearable into 2015 but it
might not necessarily be the one that
you were really expecting but
nonetheless here is HTC's fitness
wearable it's Josh freghar from Android
authority what's going on everybody and
this is the HTC grip this band style
fitness tracker is the result of a
partnership between HTC and Under Armour
who will use their ecosystem of over 130
million users as we were told in order
to bring a lot of users to this brand
new fitness tracker by HTC built by HTC
rather there are no buttons on the
outside what screen is a curved OLED
screen that allows you to have some
touch inputs and there's also a
capacitive key right over on the bottom
in order for you to activate the fitness
tracker itself we stopped short of
calling it a SmartWatch because a lot of
the elements inside don't necessarily
make it a SmartWatch it's more of a
fitness tracker than anything else but
you are able to get some notifications
and to receive messages and repend
respond to them with canned responses
and from there it's just really just a
place for you to get some notifications
from your smartphone while you're out
maybe having a workout but isn't the
fitness tracking ability that HTC is
trying to go a little bit above and
beyond because underneath is a GPS
tracker that will track your route along
with other metrics like a heart rate
monitor that you will have to buy
separately because there's no heart rate
monitor underneath of the unit instead
you will use a Bluetooth heartrate
monitor for example that you may strap
around your torso like from say polar or
Under Armour's own that they have in
their lineup but nonetheless it will
connect to the heart rate monitor and be
able to track your metrics in that
fashion rather than have the meter on
its own but the lime green actually does
look quite nice it's on the inner part
of the band and it's a nice textured
rubber band that will feel very secure
in the hand especially after you get the
right size there are a few different
sizes from small to medium to large but
there are also extenders if you just
need to get that little extra bit in
order for it to fit on your wrist it is
a waterproof band ip57 which is not
ideal for swimming but it will be able
to work through the sweat that you have
during your workout and maybe get
through the rain
and any other conditions that are not
necessarily submerging into a pool of
water for example now it is very
important for us to preface that these
are very early units of the HTC grip and
there could be enhancements not only on
the design but also in the software
experience in particular but nonetheless
we just wanted to give you this quick
look at the HTC grip this is the brand
new fitness tracking wearable that HTC
has put out given a partnership with
Under Armour and it is a pretty exciting
partnership to have and we will see once
we get our hands on review units or
rather put this finish tracker on our
hands and wrist in order to really see
if it is the kind of fitness tracker
that is for you so keep it tuned to
Android authority for all of the best
coverage and clean more from HTC here at
the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona
Spain
