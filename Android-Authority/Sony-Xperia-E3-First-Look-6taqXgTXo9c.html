authority and here we are at the Sony
launch event here at the ephah in Berlin
2014 and here we have an entry-level
it's probably the way the best way you
can describe it entry-level Xperia
smartphone in the Xperia z3 now the e3
right here does have quite a bit of the
same type of design language that you
would have in the Xperia line of
smartphones anyway you have that rounded
look that was mostly introduced in the
z3 and it still has a pretty thin
profile all around but it is a smaller
offering as you can see I'm really
grasping it pretty easily in my hand
right here but it still does have quite
a few of these same design language
choices around here like the big silver
power button and the volume rockers
right in there me now these phones do
still have the same IP certification so
you will be able to douse this thing and
drop it and not get any dust inside
either it will give pretty much the same
type of protection that all of the other
Xperia files have but aside from that a
lot of these specifications are going to
get a bit of a bump down but we have
here is a 4.5 inch screen that comes in
at 854 by 480 resolution and it does
really kind of show here you will get
the sense that this is definitely not
anywhere close to a 1080p display
obviously but it really does kind of
show that this is the entry-level
version of the Xperia Line that's
perfectly fine because it should come in
at a much more affordable price point as
well and is more accessible in plenty of
other markets as far as the actual
performance goes you have the Snapdragon
400 on the inside which comes in a 1.2
gigahertz and from there the audrina 305
graphics along with 1 gigabyte of ram
now you are going to get up to 4
gigabytes of memory inside of here but
you will also be able to have 32
gigabytes in a micro SD card underneath
the surface we will also get a 2330
million
but if you look in the settings right
here we still get the same power
management options that are available to
really get the best out of this battery
and really provide the best longevity as
possible you have the stamina mode the
low battery mode and even more in order
to make this phone possibly last as long
as maybe three days or so now as far as
the software experience goes you still
get the experience you I that brings a
lot of the features that you've come to
expect from the Xperia smartphones
already you get the same sort of motif
around here with the home screens the
app drawer and the recent apps screen
which is where you have one of the
mainstays of the Xperia UI and that is
that those are the small apps now these
are just small overlays I go on top of
your current workspace that allow you to
get very small tasks done like let's say
this calculator that is right here and
they are easily accessible from the
recent apps screen and are easy to use
on top of everything that you're already
doing all right let's go ahead and jump
on over to the back and we have that
camera now we are looking at a five
megapixel rear shooter and you will see
that there is no dedicated camera button
which is a little bit of a bummer but
the camera experience although I should
be pretty similar only it will have a
lower resolution I do have the
viewfinder up here already and we're
taking a look at that you do have a
quite a few of the modes that are
available on the other phones already
including the AR effect and a creative
effect as well if we look at the actual
settings on here you'll see that right
now we're on a video mode let's move
the photo mode you'll see that we have
five megapixels for a four by three
resolution and then 3.7 at a 16 by 9
aspect ratio so those are the sort of
settings that you will be able to have
when it comes to this camera now we
imagine it's going to be a pretty decent
camera for 5 megapixels as Sony does a
pretty good job with their camera optics
but in reality what we're looking at
here is just an easy way of getting into
the Xperia line without really
sacrificing too much of the
quintessential Xperia style and
experience we do get a great design
language here that provides a lot of
what you would see in the Xperia z3 and
its subsequent other iterations but this
time in a much more affordable and a
much more accessible package for those
of you who don't need to be on the
bleeding edge in order to enjoy what you
have a new smartphone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
