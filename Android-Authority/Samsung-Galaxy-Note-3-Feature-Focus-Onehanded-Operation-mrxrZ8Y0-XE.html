while plenty of people might love a big
phone there's one undeniable fact about
its usage using it with one hand is just
not that easy
Samsung wanted to try making life easier
for us and I'm going to show you what
that is all about it's Josh of agar from
Android auto what's going on everybody
and this is your future focus on the
note 3's one-handed operation nestled
somewhat deep in the settings is a new
selection under controls called
one-handed operation no it doesn't
magically shrink your large Galaxy Note
3 to a more manageable size but it gets
kind of close I'll get to that in a bit
though you get a slew of options for a
number of applications and for specific
tasks that you have to get done a few
are actually really handy essentially a
number of controls are shrunken down and
moved over to the side and arrow allows
you to move it over depending on which
hand you're using this is true for the
unlock pattern so you can unlock your
phone easier when you need it and your
otherwise preoccupied and then you have
the calculator perhaps for when you're
trying to figure out the tip at a
restaurant the keyboard which is pretty
practical and can be further taken
advantage of if you use the built-in
swiping and finally the phone keypad and
the buttons that come up when you're in
the middle of a call for the most part
these are the functions that end up
being hardest to do when using one hand
on the Galaxy Note 3 it's a feature that
we've seen done in the lg optimus G pro
admittedly though Samsung took it a bit
further by adding more scalable apps and
elements but you know what they didn't
stop there no Samsung went even further
by adding this top option yes you read
that right all screens basically what
happens is the entire working area of
your TouchWiz
screen get shrunken down to a more
manageable size leaving the rest of the
space blue and blank the way you do this
is by using a new swipe command swipe
from one side to the screen and then
right back if it's in your right hand
swipe left then right and of course vice
versa right here you can see a working
for yourself literally the entire screen
is shrunken down and you are able to
move around if you press and hold the
top bar which is where the buttons are
for resizing the screen and for exiting
the mode there are even buttons at the
bottom for all of the main functions and
volume I do have to say however that the
all screens assertion isn't completely
true two main instances where the
one-handed operation didn't work for me
at least are in the camera and in the
games and this is most likely because of
the graphics processing required on
either
tasks honestly while its usefulness is
hard to deny for people who really can't
spare that extra hand I don't find
myself using this all that often not
only does the note 3 really kind of
require two-handed usage just in its
nature I personally just don't like the
blank space that is created by it for a
screen as awesome as the one found on
the note 3 you just want to use it
completely the keyboard option is
definitely the most practical of the
options perhaps next to the phone keypad
and maybe the unlock pattern but
otherwise I'd like to keep everything
the way it was meant to be viewed on
this 5.7 inch screen I do have to give
props to Samsung however they added yet
another tool in their large bag of
Galaxy navigation tricks we have a slew
of other features to focus on so stay
tuned we'll be talking about the s-pen
and the camera just to name a couple if
you haven't seen my note 3 full review
or the drop test make sure that you do
and stay tuned to android authority
