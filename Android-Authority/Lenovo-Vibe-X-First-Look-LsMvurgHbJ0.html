what's going on everybody and we're here
at the Lenovo booth a couple doors over
from the entrance of Aoife at Berlin and
you might not hear about Lenovo a whole
lot probably mostly because of their
notebooks is what you know them for but
they do have a smartphone Android
powered and we have it here for you this
is the lenovo 5x and so here it is the
lenovo 5x this is their high-end
smartphone not necessarily considered
top-tier but I'll get into that in a
little bit but this is basically what
we're looking at and as you can see when
I put it on inside already it is an
incredibly thin device it's very very
thin just millimeters thick I need an
even with the tether that's over here
you can definitely feel that it is very
very easy together in one hand for a
5-inch screen devices it's actually
pretty cool so we're gonna go ahead and
just power it on real quick
the power button is over on the right
side with a wired rockers on the left
side rather with the void markers on the
right you do have a 5 megapixel camera
over here and Lenovo and there is a
sticker right here that says not
available for sale in Europe including
Germany so this is probably a phone
mostly geared towards the Asian market
but nonetheless we are pretty interested
in this particular phone because it does
pack a number of nice features we're
standing over to the phone right now
you'll also see that Lenovo employs a
design that utilizes circles for their
icons but anyway it is a pretty nice and
simple interface it seems that there is
a little bit of speed right here but
what we're working with here is a 1.5
gigahertz quad-core MediaTek processor
that is powering this old you're not
really seeing a snapdragon in here like
us become very common I know was using a
different kind
processor just going through the menus
here now this is a five inch IPS display
capable of 1080p resolution at 441 PPI
so they've certainly hit the high-end
spec in terms of the screen we have our
capacitive keys here at the bottom play
Menu key
so it's an interesting device mostly
because it's design is what is most
intriguing it does pack some high-end
specs but it does sort of fall short of
getting into the top-tier mostly because
it has a lesser camera at only 5
megapixels and also I guess you could
argue that mediatek is not necessarily
Qualcomm so maybe the speed isn't
necessarily there as you can see here
there is a bit of stutter it's not
necessarily super fast but that also
might have a little bit more to do with
the operating system rather than just a
processor after all mediatek does make
some good processes that we've seen in
certain devices so we're kept just going
through here there's also a few things
running in the background so that might
be hindering it as well well yeah that
is just your first and very quick look
at the lenovo 5x we're here on the floor
at Aoife in berlin so make sure you stay
tuned because we have a lot of stuff
ready for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
