Authority and I want to show you how to
make your own VR headset a la Google
cardboard
I'm guessing it's probably a lot easier
than you thought it was and this is how
it's done until recently my only brush
with virtual reality was a virtual
reality world to 3d color golf club game
my god as a present as a kid I remember
it working properly from no more than
two or three times and dying
indefinitely when Google announced the
cardboard VR headset at i/o 2014
I didn't bat an eyelash I think most of
us were surprised and didn't really know
what to think but the developments in
the VR field as well as the things made
possible by an extremely affordable VR
headset are impressive to say the least
the upshot to Google's own VR headset is
that it's extremely affordable and made
with common household items or items
which are easily obtained
unlike other headsets Google even
provides a printable template in a bill
of materials to help you make your own
cardboard at home here's what you'll
need a piece of cardboard at least 22
inches by 8 point 7 5 inches to 2 inch
strips of 3/4 inch wide velcro one
three-quarter inch neodymium ring magnet
one three-quarter inch ceramic disc
magnet to buy convex lenses roughly 45
millimeter focal length and optionally a
rubber band and an NFC tag
additionally the tools you will need for
this project are an x-acto knife a
straightedge scotch tape some spray
adhesive or contact cement and you may
also find some super glue handy begin by
downloading the manufacturers kit
directly from Google linked below
extract the zip file open the scissor
cut template and print the three pages
use a straightedge to trim away the
excess paper from the templates and use
tape or glue to connect the three pieces
of the main body template together align
the corresponding numbers over one
another with a light numbers on top in
total there will be three templates the
body the lens holder and the lens
divider next trim away any extra
cardboard you may have working with a
large box I salvaged from my recent move
I really only needed one side of the box
once all the excess is cut away lightly
coat the cardboard with spray adhesive
let it sit for 3 to 5 minutes and press
the three separate templates into place
here is the now
so fun part cutting out every little nib
with an x-acto knife I started by
trimming away all the unnecessary
outside pieces then worked my way in for
all the type corners or small spaces
that need to be cut it's easier to just
perforate the cardboard by stabbing it
repeatedly rather than trying to dragon
cut which will often end a new cutting
off more than you need or want the best
advice for this part is to be patient
it's going to take you at least 30 to 45
minutes to cut everything out and your
hand will probably cramp up a time or
two i finished by cutting out all the
rounded pieces last you can try to use
round objects that are close and radius
to what you're cutting but i chose just
slowly freehand all the round cuts again
patience is key
once everything is cut out it's time to
begin assembling insert the lenses into
the two eye holes paying attention to
their orientation the paper template
tells you which direction the lenses
should face fold the top third of the
lens holder template down and the lower
third up so that the middle panel is
sandwiched between the two and the
lenses can't fall out next use a
straightedge to help you make straight
and sharp folds on all the lighter
colored lines on the template place the
ceramic magnet in its designated spot I
ended up gluing it and then put the
neodymium magnet on the opposite side of
that same piece of cardboard and start
folding insert the lens holder with the
divider and wrap the cardboard frame
around it lining up all the proper slots
and grooves when I folded mine up all
the way I noticed there was an extra
flap I didn't need so I cut it off and
opened up the hole for access to the
neodymium magnet which will operate at
your select button when using the
headset I added a touch of superglue to
the inside of this panel include the
headset shut you could also use velcro
here if you choose next add the velcro
strips to the top of the flap where you
will later insert your phone and
optionally you can add an NFC tag to
your cardboard program it by downloading
the app trigger and creating an action
which will launch the cardboard app you
will also need to download the cardboard
app onto your phone first then launch
the app and insert the phone into the
headset you can now experience virtual
reality at will the problem with this
headset is that it won't work with
larger phones like the Nexus 6 for that
you will need a headset based on Google
cardboard 2.0 which isn't quite as DIY
friendly but just as possible to make
yourself with a little more homework no
magnets and a conductive pad required by
the way this is a fantastic way to get
your hands on VR quickly and for dirt
cheap save for the lenses you can make 3
5 or even more of these for just a few
bucks that is it it is literally that
easy to make your own VR headset so if
