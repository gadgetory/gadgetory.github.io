john bosco here with android authority
and live at MWC 2017 I'm here at the CPE
booth and I'm checking out two new
devices that they announced we have the
ZTE Blade v8 mini and the light now
these two devices are not kind of more
entry-level devices I'll start off first
with the mini here so with the is iffy
blame mini that's a pretty nice design a
metal body and you have this stylist
aspect with the top portion of the back
that's an orange color with this
particular model another different color
but nice go fault it's the most part you
have a fingerprint sensor pretty used to
hold with one hand the rest of the body
is comprised out of plastic now it is
kind of like weight some of the key
stuff that stands out with the v8 mini
is on the back you have dual cameras so
of course you're going to get that dual
is going to have that voce effect giving
you the ability to actually adjust the
focus after you take the shot it comes
down to a 13 megapixel camera a 2
megapixel camera there's also this mode
where you could produce 3d photos so it
takes two uses both cameras six shots
and then you could view that image in V
in a Google cardboard to get viewed in a
3d mode it's powered by qualcomm
snapdragon 435 chip with 2 gigabytes of
RAM you have a 5 inch 720p display of
course the specs don't really make it
too attractive but for an entry-level
device it should suffice and it
announced a pricing for this phone or
release date but it is coming to the
European Asian markets no word yet on
the u.s. availability and this'll be
interesting lighter effect if you've
laid v8 light so the very light looks
very similar to the v8 mini but with the
exception that you don't have those dual
cameras on
it looks like it it's actually just a
single camera there which is the meet by
the critical camera so has a metal body
kind of clean we have a fingerprint
sensor right there easy to hold
construction seems easy for the most
part and you could tell it has some of
the same design characteristics that we
see in ZTE higher-end devices like the
ZTE axon 7 but as far as aspect like it
says there are a lot lighter than the
than the mini so the light dia has a 5
inch 720p display we have an 8 megapixel
rear camera you have a 5 megapixel
front-facing camera and then it has two
gigabytes of RAM 16 gigabytes of
internal storage and as far as the
processor is concerned its packing at
octa-core mt6752 so a little bit in the
lighter side tend to the lighter the
light name attachment to it just like
the mini there's no boarding on pricing
or availability but it is coming to the
European Asian markets if you guys want
to learn more about either device you
can check out our website Android's or
