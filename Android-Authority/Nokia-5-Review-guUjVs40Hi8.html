impression this is a device that looks
and feels really premium despite a
relatively affordable price tag whatever
you buy a budget device you know that
the manufacturers will have had to
sacrifice certain features and
performance in other areas whether or
not this is a good value proposition for
you will depend on whether those areas
of things you can live without
I'm Adam Shin it's key let's take a look
at the Nokia five and see if it's a good
budget choice for you so yeah the first
thing you'll notice about na q5 is the
looks and that's a good thing because
this is a really nice looking device
that's thanks to a unique body build
which has a look that harkens back to
the older Lumia devices it has a kind of
two-toned
appearance like it's wearing a jacket
with the back and the sides being a
different color from the main body on
the front in my case this is a silver
mapped chrome looking device you can
also get dark blue you can get black and
you can get something that looks like
rose gold which seems to be very much in
vogue at the moment for mobile phones
it's not just the look that's impressive
though it's also the way it feels in the
hand
it has a nice premium heft to it weighty
and the sides are nice and cool and
they're curved and it all just fits in
the hand in a very ergonomic manner and
that's an important thing seeing is
you're going to be holding your phone a
lot if it's your daily driver now it's
not gonna win any awards for its looks
it has a large bezel on the top and
bottom and it's certainly not as
outstanding or something like the s8 but
if you like a device that makes you feel
good when you put out your pocket then
the Nokia 5 is very good for his price
it wasn't actually developed by Nokia by
the way but out sourced to a company
called haitch MD global so that's a win
for them the first sign that things
aren't quite as premium as they feel
though is the screen when you turn it on
that is this is a fairly basic IPS
display at just 720p resolution now a
lot of people say they don't mind 720p
and you might be in that crowd but if
you're someone who really loves to
consume media on the go then you might
do well to treat yourself to something
with a bit more vibrancy and a higher
resolution so the screen size is 5 point
2 inches and in theory that should give
you plenty
real estate to work with in practice
though the lower resolution actually
meters that size a little so for example
when you use androids multi screen
multitasking feature you won't be able
to change the size of the two different
windows instead you'll be stuck with the
50% and 50% option also they tend to
feel a little bit cramped when you're
doing this so if you're someone who
likes to use their device for
productivity then again this is the
consideration to keep in mind and the
specs are another place where Nokia have
clearly saved some cash so this is
powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 430
which is clocked at 1.4 gigahertz and
backed up by 2 gigabytes of RAM the
average user might not find this to be a
problem you can download and run pretty
much any app from the Play Store and
that's true of most cheap devices in
fact these days the issue will come for
example if you want to play a high-end
game in which case you might notice if
you drop frames a little bit of
stuttering and longer load screens
likewise navigating the UI could
definitely be smoother when you launch
Google now there's a definite noticeable
pause and when you're scrolling through
large webpages there's also a slight
stutter while multitasking works just
fine despite the limitations in screen
resolution that I mentioned earlier
you will find that the occasional
background app gets closed and that's
due to the lower Ram again it's all
perfectly serviceable a lot of people
won't have an issue with it it's just
that if you're looking for higher end
performance and if you're so many loves
gaming on their mobile device then this
phone might not be the one for you what
is likely to be an issue for the average
user is the lower internal storage the
nokia v comes with just sixteen
gigabytes of on-board storage although
it is expandable up to 256 gigabytes via
a micro SD card but to me that's a poor
substitute and I'd much rather have that
space available right from the start at
least 30 gigabytes of it especially as
half of that space is going to be taken
up as soon as you beat up the device
other hardware features include a
fingerprint sensor which works just
about as well as any other fingerprint
sensor which is to say most of the time
but not flawlessly it has water and dust
resistance up to IP 52 which means you
can dribble on it or expose it to dust
and it won't explode but you certainly
shouldn't go swimming with it battery
life is just fine
it's only a 3000 milliamp hour battery
but because it's just a 720p display and
because
relatively stock Android that should see
most people through a full day now I'm
quite a power user I open up a lot of
YouTube videos and I use it the
navigation with the screen on and I make
lots of calls and I have no problem with
it either I could easily get through to
an evening without having to carry a
charger with me
there is quick dodge 3.0 but it's not
quite as quick as it could be you'll
find that you charge about 25% per half
an hour that quick charge is delivered
via a microUSB rather than the USBC
which these days does feel a little bit
backwards facing and it could hurt the
future proofing for this device and
future compatibility and unfortunately
the camera is also distinctly average is
13 megapixels which is just fine but
it's the lighter that's the issue with
cameras coming out very dark lot at the
time and in low-light settings
it's nearly unusable as a flash of
course but that doesn't make up for it
you can only use that in certain
situations and it tends to make things
look very bright and shadowy and the
camera wrap is distinctly uninspiring
there are no fun features there's no
filters and you can't tweak manual
settings like ISO there is HDR though
and there is auto focus so you can
create some decent photos with a bit of
practice and patience it's just that I
wouldn't recommend this as a reliable
camera to bring with you on holiday if
you want to have photos really pop in
the vibrant
there's also a front-facing camera which
is 8 megapixels and works just fine and
both are capable of recording video at
1080p which ironically means you can't
actually play it back at full resolution
on the device you've filmed it on the
software something that will make some
users happy though because it's just
basically stock Android there's pretty
much no customization and there's no
bloatware either this helps to keep
things as nippy as possible on the
relatively low specs and it also means
that the battery life is optimized again
for the relatively small battery because
it's Android 7 that means you get access
to cool features like Google assistant
as well that's really useful whether
you're navigating somewhere or whether
you're asking for instructions was
cooking ok Google how many grams in 3
cups of flour
according to King Arthur Flour a cup of
all-purpose flour weighs four and a
quarter ounces at 120 grams thanks dear
the fact that such a stock version of
Android also bodes well for future
updates that means that hopefully you'll
have Android Oh rolled out to you soon
after its released although of course
you can make no guarantees on that it
would have been nice to see some
customizations from Nokia however and
this is a very vanilla experience for
instance it would have been nice to have
a way to add a percentage on to the
battery icon without having to go into
the system UI tuner likewise there's no
easy accessible shortcut if you want to
do tethering on your mobile phone these
might not be issues for a lot of people
but just keep in mind that
customizations aren't always an
unqualified negative thing I always find
it harder to review budget devices
because when you spend less you know
what you're getting of course you're not
getting the very latest specs of course
you're not getting the very best build
quality like I say it comes down to what
you want and what's important to you
which compromises you're willing to make
in this case you're getting a device
that has a relatively poor performance
although it is comparable to something
like the Moto G 5 you're getting
something that has a not-so-great camera
so it could be worse but what's really
good about it is the design so if
appearance is important to you and if
you like your device to be a fashion
statement but you don't have the money
to splash on something really new and
expensive then the Nokia 5 is a good
choice if you're somebody really loves
consuming media who wants lots of space
to take beautiful photos then you might
want to spend that money elsewhere
overall it's a good compromise for the
right person hope you found this video
