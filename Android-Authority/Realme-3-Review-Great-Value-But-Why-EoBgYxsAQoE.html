know why it exists so in the past I
described real me phones as the Paco
phones of the sub $200 price bracket the
real me one was a really impressive
value proposition in terms of the specs
you're getting at the Helio P 60 in
terms of the screen had a notched IPS
LCD but it was a fairly large one even
at 720p with a good screen to body ratio
and yeah whilst they're not exciting
phones in any way they do blow the
competition out of the water
on the whole in terms of what they can
do for the price the competition being
things like the Nokia one which runs
Android go the nokia 2 which has a very
underpowered snapdragon the honor 7s
which was a horrible phone that was so
slow couldn't play 2d games and it
lacked a gyroscope so yeah compared to
those these devices come out smelling of
roses but they're not perfect by a
McGreevy real meet it was actually
slower than the real meet one and then
the real me 2 pro came along and had a
smaller battery they're not necessarily
steps forward all the time sometimes
they're two steps falls on one step back
and the room we three seems to be more
of the same it sports the exact same
Helio P 60 processor that we saw in the
real mean one and that just doesn't make
any sense to me why upgrade a device if
you're not going to upgrade it over an
India they get the Helio P 70 and that's
a slight upgrade but it's still very
minor we consider that there's not
really much else to write home about so
let's take a closer look and hopefully
try and figure out exactly what real me
were thinking here
one thing that is necessarily different
is the design instead of a kind of
hexagonal effect on the back you now
have this gradient which goes from
dynamic black to radiant blue looks a
bit nicer has a bit of a curve on it
which does make it feel a little bit
more premium but it also feels very
plastic very light just like previous
models and what disappointing still is
the microUSB down the bottom the
microUSB even on the real mean one fell
out dated an out of place on the real
mean 3 it just again doesn't really make
much sense if you're gonna upgrade this
device then that would have been where
you'd start it's not a huge issue to the
way you're gonna use it on a day-to-day
basis but it's just not future proof and
it means you're not gonna be able to use
a lot of the peripherals that come out
in the coming years likewise it means
that if you go around the friend's house
and asked to borrow a charger they
probably wouldn't have one other signs
this is about the cheaper device include
the button
they're separate the screen is only 70
20 P it's got Corning Gorilla Glass 3
instead of four or five the speaker
grille down the bottom sounds pretty
tinny it's not awful but you not gonna
want to sit down and watch netflix on it
that's where something like the Nokia
does have a slight edge the build
quality this also not horrible the
gradient is quite nice and it could
certainly have been a lot worse
I guess in terms of the gaming
performance the Helio P 60 is not the
fastest of course it probably falls just
below the Snapdragon 660 which was the
one found in the real me 2 pro so again
this is a step down from a recent real
me device you'll be able to play most
games pub G runs okay on lower settings
with occasional frame drops but it's
quite impressive that you can play pub G
at all on such an affordable device like
I say you won't be able to do that on
the Nokia one or on the 107 s but yeah I
don't expect blazing performance on this
by any means this isn't a device for
gaming but if you're just browsing
through the UI on the whole it's going
to be an OK experience and that's where
I have to give props to real me even
though they haven't updated this
processor since the real me want it's
still faster than most of the
competition at this price range and you
still aren't going to find this a chore
to use occasionally you have to wait a
little bit for the keyboard to pop up
you know so perceptible pause that can
be a bit irritating occasionally I have
to take a little bit longer to load but
like I say not a chore it's not awful to
use like that 7 s one thing that that
Hilo p60 does have going for it is an MP
u a neural processing unit meaning that
does have some onboard AI this means
that it can do things like face unlock a
lot quicker and it brings some AI
features to the camera or they're not
particularly noticeable in terms of RAM
you can have either three or four
gigabytes in terms of storage you can
have your 32 or 64 that is expandable by
256 by our micro SD card slot and this
space for dual sim there's also a
headphone jack down the bottom so that's
a welcome addition this is running
Android 9 with color OS over the top of
it you're not going to be to everyone's
tastes of course I'm not a huge fan of
the aesthetic changes including this
very over-the-top notification shade
they really didn't go subtle on that
front finding certain settings can be a
pain at the same time there's a couple
of odd glitches for instance on the home
screen I have this random gap where
there's no app there's a couple of
places where that's happened so yeah not
perfect again but not awful it's going
to be alright I guess one aspects of the
performance that is really
impressive here though is the battery
life it has a 4230 million power battery
which combined with that rollovers
screen is actually really impressive
it'll last you well into a second day
again that's the same battery that's
found in the real me - not the same one
in the real meeting Pro which has a
smaller battery so again it's not
actually an upgrade but in this instance
it's more of a case of it if it ain't
broke don't fix it as opposed to why
didn't you upgrade that and so that
opens up a new potential audience for
this device if you're looking for a
secondary phone you can take with you on
a camping trip where the price means it
doesn't matter quite so much if you lose
it and where the battery life means
you're not gonna have to keep searching
for a power outlet the camera is an
upgrade from the real me one it's the
same as that real Me 2 pro so you get a
13 megapixel on the back backed up by a
2 megapixel and you get a 13 megapixel
on the front that secondary lens on the
back isn't for anything fancy just bokeh
effects there's no zoom or wide-angle
here it is really nice to get such a big
megapixel count on the front but out of
both lenses you shouldn't expect any
winning performance here this is a very
average camera again it's not terrible
and it should win points for that given
the price but you're not gonna want to
enter any photography competitions
photos lack detail especially if you
zoom in they look a bit washed out at
time sometimes things like a bit soft
there are some features here such as a
beauty mode and really wants to brag
about their chroma boost which doesn't
seem to do anything that I can tell this
is the front-facing camera by the way
that I'm recording this on so that's
what that's like
the nightscape mode does fair little
better you can definitely see the
improvement when you have it switched on
however you're essentially improving
what was not the best low-light camera
to begin with whilst you can see with a
lot more clarity it also introduces a
lot more noise it's quite smudgy and it
takes a couple of seconds in order to
work so to conclude the romy 3 is pretty
good value for money in terms of the
performance you're not gonna find it
horrible chore to use it can do most
things that you need it to basically
real me is set a benchmark 40 should be
able to accomplish at this low price
point and then they failed to live up to
it themselves although it's still better
than a lot of the competition I won't
say don't buy this phone it's not
terrible but I would recommend the real
me to throw over this any day and yeah I
just don't know why they felt the need
to build it they should have waited
until they had an actual upgrade all
made this some kind of separate line but
even then it would be kind of
Londyn so there you go that's the real
me 3 it's good value but it's pointless
pokefans for the useful interesting guys
if you did then please leave a like a
comment down below let us know what you
think of the real me 3 if you have any
theories as to what real me was thinking
here there is a real me 3 Pro on the way
so that might be the one you want to
wait for head over 200 authorities calm
