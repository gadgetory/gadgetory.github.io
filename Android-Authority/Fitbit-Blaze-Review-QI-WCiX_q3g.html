make their fitness tracker a little bit
more like a SmartWatch it's Josh avatar
from Android thority what's going on
everybody and this is the Fitbit blaze
now it's important to note that we also
have a full written review that has been
on Android 30.com for a few days now
written by Jimmy westenberg and the
reason why that's important is because
Jimmy is more of a distance and
endurance runner so that is where his
opinions are going to be in terms of the
Fitbit blaze that I have on my wrist
right here I on the other hand and more
of a free weights person so I brought
this over to the gym and my opinions are
going to be based on that so make sure
you head on over to Android or decom for
even more comprehensive thoughts on the
Fitbit blaze in terms of design the
Fitbit blaze is actually kind of
attractive it is a combination of two
different peripherals first you have the
frame that the actual device will go
into and then the device itself is a
small squarish piece of kit now it has a
1.25 inch of screen on the front at 240
by 180 resolution and of course you have
the heart rate monitor on the back that
will always be firing when it is on your
wrist customization is possible here as
the different wrist bands and the frame
itself can be bought with different
materials for example leather if you
want it to be a little bit more catering
to your style and then switching between
the two is a matter of just snapping out
the device itself and then putting it
into the other frame the Fitbit blaze
does do a pretty good job of adapting to
whatever style it is put on however it
is still pretty obviously a digital
watch and fitness tracker so it's not
necessarily as fashionable as other
let's say Android wear watches or even
analog watches of the sort one little
caveat that I had about the device one
put into the frame is that you have to
fit it in just perfectly if you have the
frame right here you have the two
buttons on the Wrights
using pins on the frame that will push
into those buttons and then one over on
the left one issue that I had is that I
didn't have the device seated just
perfectly in the frame so this button
over on the left actually needed to be
pushed even harder and it was a little
bit uncomfortable it has to be seated
just right into the frame or else the
device might not get triggered with its
buttons the screen like I said is 1.25
inches and mostly it's alright the
screen does have a large bezel around it
so the device does have more beds
than it should and its sensitivity in
terms of touch is not necessarily where
you would expect it to be especially
when compared to other smartwatches
connecting the Fitbit blaze to a
smartphone is really easy you just have
to have the app on your smart phone and
then it will connect to the watch
through a simple pairing mode of the
functions include a timer and a
stopwatch and also an alarms feature
this alarm feature is supposed to wake
you up silently by just using the
vibrations in the device now while that
is a really good idea I found that the
vibration was actually too weak to wake
me up in the morning and even then you
have to rely on the smartphone app in
order to create and edit alarms not to
mention it is a little bit annoying that
when you make the alarms you have to
sync the device every single time now
the battery in the Fitbit blaze is one
that's supposed to go for about five
days and for the most part that was the
case Jimmy was able to use it for five
days straight and it pretty much
corroborated what Fitbit said me on the
other hand I was able to get between
three and five three was only really
when I was using a lot of the functions
on the daily but ultimately when it's
just being used to track your steps and
your heart rate everyday then it should
be able to go the distance
really the only problem with the battery
portion is charging it charging the
Fitbit blaze requires you to take the
full device out of its frame and then
put it into this awkward-looking clamp
that connects us be wise to any power
source it's far from an easy or even
attractive looking way of charging the
Fitbit blaze and it's one of these sorts
when it comes to the battery life of
this device which brings us to what the
Fitbit blaze is actually made for
tracking your daily now the Fitbit blaze
is able to track your resting heart rate
every single day and then using the
movement of your wrist it will track the
number of steps in our testing the step
counter was actually pretty accurate
it didn't grossly overestimate or
underestimate how many steps that were
taken and when it comes to the heart
rate monitor when it comes to mostly
resting and over the day type of
readings then it actually works pretty
well resting heart rate is obviously one
of the ways to judge what your fitness
is like if you have a lower resting
heart rate in general maybe around 80
and below then you're pretty fit and
over the day you'll be able to see just
how your heart rate goes up and down
depending on different activities that
you do
we also liked the sleep tracking the
Fitbit blaze was pretty good at figuring
out when the user was asleep even if it
was just for a nap in the middle of the
day and the graphs inside of the app
were able to show that but of course
it's when you tell the Fitbit blaze that
you're getting down to a real workout
that you're going to get the kind of
information that you need and you would
hope that the Fitbit blaze is able to
give you accurate readings because it is
a 200-dollar device I suppose to do so
unfortunately our results were pretty
mixed we'll start off by talking about
fitstar Fitbit bought fitstar a company
that creates short workouts and even
longer form workouts but the ones that
come in the Fitbit blaze pre-installed
are short workouts you have the warm-up
which is about seven minutes and then
you have a seven-minute workout and then
a ten-minute abs workout the ten-minute
abs workout does pretty much Tucker you
out and during these different workouts
you are going to get the real time
tracking including the heartrate the
thing is though that the fitstar ones
are pretty good for just on-the-go
workouts but they're definitely not
enough to really get somebody in shape
especially if you are really serious
about power lifting or bodybuilding or
just getting fit the thing about running
though as Jimmy says in the written
review is that while it does a pretty
good job based on the movement of the
risk of estimating how far you are
running it unfortunately doesn't have
any GPS installed and for a peripheral
that is a little bit more expensive like
this you will think that GPS is a part
of it so you can actually track where
and how far you are running the little
caveats did it really end there though I
brought the Fitbit blaze to my local gym
where I did some barbell workouts and I
found that the heart rate monitor was
just not able to keep up when it comes
to more long-form workouts the Fitbit
blaze is able to keep up with this heart
rate monitor because you're keeping your
heart rate at a at a high level when
your heart rate is over 150 let's say it
will be able to read that over time it's
not going to be very immediate in its
readings but that's the reason why it
got a little bit weird and that's
because the heart rate monitor is not
made for high intensity workouts high
intensity workouts are HIIT or hits are
the type of workouts where you go really
hard for about 30 seconds or let's say
two minutes it doesn't matter really how
long and you're going to get your heart
rate really really high for a short
amount of time and then when your heart
rate comes back down it usually happens
pretty quickly the Fitbit blaze on the
other
and is not really able to keep up with
that at some point during my workout I
looked down at it and it still was
trying to raise the level of the heart
rate because my heart rate was already
really high yet still coming down after
I did some heavy squats still because of
that even during that one hour lifting
sessions
I wasn't able to get the Fitbit to say
that my max heart rate was anything
above 150 which is a bit of a bummer
because the Fitbit blaze as a somewhat
more expensive in this tracker you would
hope that Fitbit is hoping to help those
who are really serious about fitness and
get the accurate readings that they
would want but there are still other
devices out there that just simply do a
better job at tracking certain things
like the heart rate and even the steps
in comparison which brings us to the
final portion of this review and that is
more of these SmartWatch capabilities
now the SmartWatch features of the
Fitbit blaze include notifications and
music control but the problem is that
that's about it notifications are
actually really limited you are able to
get notifications about calls but the
watch will only really tell you that a
call is coming in and you can't control
what to do about the call if the phone
is not right next to you and as far as
message notifications go you can pick
one application in order to get your
notifications however that's really all
that you're going to get in my case I
used hangouts and if multiple messages
came in from one person then it just
grouped them together and I wasn't able
to read them one by one very easily and
finally the music control seemed to
really need just particular applications
in order to be useful in my case using
NPR one and pocket casts I wasn't able
to actually control where I was in those
pieces of audio and so there you have it
for this review of the Fitbit blaze a
Fitbit is really trying to bridge the
gap between the fitness tracker and the
SmartWatch but unfortunately they
haven't really perfected any one part of
the spectrum on the one hand as a
SmartWatch it is just simply limited
certain functions that should be really
good on a typical SmartWatch just aren't
like notifications and even the
vibration used for silent alarms but
while a daily tracker is actually not
that bad in the Fitbit blaze when doing
more strenuous workouts and let's say
more high intensity short form workouts
it just isn't able to keep up with its
heart rate monitor there are a lot of
fitness trackers out there and the
Fitbit blaze is just one of the newest
and one of the
that is trying to bridge that gap but
unfortunately we're going to have to
wait a little bit longer to see if one
of these Fitness tracking companies can
really get it right and find that great
sweet spot right in the middle as always
thank you guys very much for watching I
hope you enjoyed this review of the
Fitbit blaze we are going to be diving
into the health portion of things a
little bit so if you've been having
trouble keeping your New Year's
resolution after all we're already in
March then maybe we'll be able to help
you out by showing you what devices
would be best for you to really keep up
with your goals keep it tuned here to
Android 34 even more and don't forget to
