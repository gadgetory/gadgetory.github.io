Hindy the android authority app guide
and welcome back to Android apps weekly
this is episode number 115 so let's get
started cyanogen has released a fun
little bundle of cyanogen OS
applications for cyanogenmod users these
applications referred to as C apps are a
collection of six applications that you
can optionally install but only if you
run cyanogenmod everyone else will have
to either install CM 12.1 or later or
just not get them last week google
acquired fly labs which is known for its
photo and editing applications on iOS
the raining and likely correct opinion
is that this tech will eventually help
make google photos image editing work
better of course it'll take some time
before we see any changes we received
some official news on Nintendo's first
android game this last week DNA who is
partnering with Nintendo to make the
game announced that the game will be
free to play which means free with
in-app purchases even I'm disappointed
about that after what we assume was a
massive success amazon has boosted the
number of paid applications for free in
there amazon underground service by
three times what it used to be if you
haven't checked out amazon underground
yet now is a great time to do so xposed
framework the popular modding root
application may be coming to marshmallow
sooner than later the developer
indicated that it should be out in the
next week or so and thus the entire
route community rejoiced for even more
Android apps and games news don't forget
to check out this week's newsletter
which is linked in the video description
below there you'll find the complete
list of news we didn't have time for
today if you want you can sign up for
that newsletter with your email address
and we'll send it to you every week okay
folks let's take a look at the apps and
games that made a big splash this week
as usual if you want to check any of
these apps or games out we'll have those
links for you in the video description
below fallout 4 is out now so it only
felt appropriate that we have something
about the game to take part in the
celebration fallout chat is a simple
little keyboard released directly by
Bethesda it features a bunch of Fallout
inspired elements including gifs emojis
and fallout themed keyboard for you to
use it's not the best keyboard ever and
we're sure gonna end up switching back
to your usual one but it's fun to play
with lost echo is a new game that was
released earlier this week it's a
mystery adventure game where you play as
a man named Doug who is looking for his
girlfriend Chloe the catches that she
seems to be lost in time and no one can
remember that she existed except for him
the game features some really good
looking graphics and the story driven
narratives are actually fun and
interesting the game has some wicked bad
early bugs but most of them seem to have
been cleared out youtube music is the
latest entrance into the fiasco that is
YouTube red it is technically a YouTube
application that removes all non music
related content the application was
meant to be used with you to read as you
can listen to music with the screen off
save stuff for offline playback and
there's also no advertising its a good
application and it works well even if
there's no real point for its existence
this war of mine is an adventure
survival game that takes place during a
war instead of playing the customary
role of the soldiers who battle it out
you instead play the part of some
civilians who are just trying to survive
the harshness of war during the day your
pin to your location by snipers and it
might you go adventuring for supplies to
keep you alive every decision you make
can mean life or death and it's a
surprisingly deep game it's on sale for
fifty percent off right now Apple music
finally hit the google play store this
last week to the usual array of
unwarranted vitriol from the more
aggressively loyal members of the
android community controversy aside the
application actually looks pretty good
an apple did well with the design
elements the service itself is pretty
decent as well boasting 30 million songs
radio stations including beats 1
playlists recommendations and more you
can get a free trial for checking it out
