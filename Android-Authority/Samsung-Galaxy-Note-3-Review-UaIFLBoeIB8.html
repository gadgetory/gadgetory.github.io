Samsung's flagship devices but there is
another phone out there that is bigger
badder and can do everything that the s4
can and then some Hey Strasbourg are
from Andhra I thought oh what's going on
everybody and this is the Samsung Galaxy
Note 3 the Galaxy Note 3 is probably one
of the most anticipated phones of the
year and for good reason after
succeeding in the numbers game with the
features on the galaxy s4 people
wondered how much greater the note line
could get with all of those extras
baked-in has a pretty new note user I'm
excited to see what this phone and its
little friend could do I'll say this
right off the bat I now get why the no
line is so popular but I'm getting a
little bit ahead of myself
first off yes I started off with the
white version of the Galaxy Note 3 but
that was the one I dropped tested it
held up really well almost surprisingly
but I think that this was the right
choice really because I would venture to
say that the Black Edition is much more
attractive in terms of design anyone who
is getting tired of this signature
Samsung glossy plastic will appreciate
this new textured material you first
will behold the screen up front and then
be pleasantly surprised when you turn it
over the back cover though still as thin
and bendy as ever is now of a textured
material that mimics leather especially
in the black version this back cover is
also removable as is usually the case
with Samsung phones giving access to the
battery and card slots move to the sides
and you will find the same classic
Samsung button layout but this time
there is a line design on the sides that
is supposed to mimic the pages of a
notebook the bottom of the phone houses
the speaker grille and of course it
houses the s-pen but also there is the
new micro USB 3.0 charging port that
don't worry
still takes the original plug finally we
see the front and the 5.7 inch behemoth
of a screen the note line was arguably
the start of the oversized screen craze
and it continues with a point to
increase for this third iteration
there's really no getting around it
though I especially love the Black
Edition the note 3 is pretty much the
most attractive Samsung device I've ever
come
the idea of mimicking leather actually
gets across and gives the node3 a look
and feel that I can only describe as
executive flatter sides much like the
galaxy s4 make the phone easier to grip
while the back rest nicely on your palm
and while I'll get into the s-pen later
I can say now that using it just adds to
that executive feel overall it's i
popping stylish almost surprisingly
classy and whether it just shows its
back with that textured material or it
shows us front with that attractively
thin bezel the note 3 just looks great
all around the screen is definitely one
of the note 3's biggest pluses it's hard
not to just generally appreciate the
quality of the Super AMOLED pentile
display taking the same great display
from the s4 and making it even bigger
was a great move lending to a viewing
experience full of vivid albeit
sometimes oversaturated colors and with
1080p 386 ppi capabilities everything
from playing games to reading new
stories is very easy on the eyes
everything is generally formatted in
such a way that was very easy to look at
there's just something about the way the
note 3 handles its content that keeps
everything accessible sure this 5.7 inch
screen is squarely in the realm outside
of one-handed usage but this is a phone
that requires two hands anyway
considering the s-pen Samsung does try
to make life easier by making keyboards
and various other elements shrunken down
to a side for better one-handed usage
it's a nice move but just know that
two-handed operation will pretty much
always be a part of your note 3 life
let's finally get into what's underneath
the surface the note 3 marks the first
not just for Samsung but also for the
general Android space in the case of
sheer power what we get here is the
Snapdragon 800 processor clocked in at
2.3 gigahertz backing up the CPU is the
audrina 330 and an inaugural three
gigabytes of RAM for a phone that is
supposed to Don multiple hats often at
once this power is all put to good use
and in actual usage the note 3 flies
through its elements and everything from
home screens to loading apps to running
those apps it the only instances of lag
that I saw came when things had to be
pre-loaded as the app was being opened
the main example of this was the new my
magazine homescreen they had to load the
new story and social media pictures as
it initiated other than that however the
note 3 basically wins the spec were at
the moment with its powerful package
made for some rigorous multitasking and
you can actually feel it working pretty
well
in hardware we do get the removable
battery and 16 32 or 64 gigabytes of
on-board storage call quality was
adequate when at full volume but it
could easily still be drowned out by
enough outside noise the speaker at the
bottom of the note 3 is pretty loud also
and complements media consumption but it
definitely isn't a defining part of that
experience but after all of this the
hardware department sees the Galaxy Note
3 take on what the Galaxy S 4 introduced
in the many sensor editions involved
these include all of the air gesture air
view smart squirrel IR blaster and even
s health measuring tools needed for new
ways of navigation just look at the drop
down shape there are so many options so
you don't even need to use the S Pen if
you don't want to that being said the
actual pen itself gets the line design
you see from the sides of the phone and
even though it's thinness might be a
little hard to handle for larger hands I
found it easy to get used to hovering
over the screen with it gives you a
small cursor that helps you aim and
reach contextual features and the button
on the stylus itself brings you either
the new Air Command menu or the quick
clip function the Air Command menu is
the biggest addition to the pen
experience and will be focused upon in
the software section another popular
feature of the note series is it's
typically large battery unit and in the
note 3 the 3200 milliamp hour performer
doesn't disappoint my experience with
this powerful phone was highlighted by a
five-hour span of time in which I use
the phone for at least half of those
hours straight for browsing the web
viewing local video files making notes
downloading humblebundle games
handwriting my text messages and even
viewing my social media networks by the
end of the 5 hours I was very pleased to
see almost 70% battery left nightly
charging will definitely be a reality
for heavy power users but if you can put
down the money for a spare battery you
should basically see no issues getting
everything you need out of the galaxy
note 3 the optics in the galaxy note 3
are largely the same as those found in
the galaxy s4 with the addition of a
digital smart stabilization that should
help alleviate shaky hands and at least
somewhat improve low-light photography
the app is also very much the same
bringing pretty much all of the many
features the s4 introduced
best modes like face or shot drama and
eraser modes dual recording the works
picture quality is about as good as was
found on the s4 which is very welcome
all these pictures were taken in full
auto mode at four by three
to ensure all 13 megapixels were being
utilized low-light shots still suffer
but the smart stabilization seems to
improve things at least a little bit but
you'll probably use the flash in most of
these cases anyway if you liked the
Galaxy s4 camera you'll largely feel the
same about the note 3 finally we get
into the software the section that
centers around the s-pen if you never
touch the pen though what you're getting
baked into the note 3 is essentially the
same old TouchWiz updated to Android 4.3
however another success of the note 3's
experience is that the touch was in it
seems very much cater to this 5.7 inch
screen and thus lends itself to
impressively easy viewing everything is
large obviously but not obnoxiously or
weirdly so altogether TouchWiz for the
note line makes a somewhat niche product
incredibly accessible there is the
addition of the new my magazine though
accessed through an upward swipe on the
homescreen it's basically like a blink
feed and Flipboard had a child it's a
nice way of consolidating news and
social media but it's new sources are
pretty determined so you won't be able
to add in your own media outlets now the
biggest additions definitely have to do
with the s-pen there are plenty of
people out there who don't use the s-pen
but Samsung is encouraging all of them
to do so by making it even easier to use
remove the s-pen and you immediately get
the Air Command menu this is a new 5
button menu that gives you access to the
main functions of the s-pen I will get
into much more detail on all of these in
a future focus video that is coming up
but I wanted to give you here in
particular my experience as anyone can
use any combination of the features
available in the note 3 mine is just one
example
I don't really scrapbook though the
scrapbooker gives much more information
than just the thing you cut out like the
website metadata so you can always
bounce back to where you originally saw
the clip the screen right is pretty much
a memoed screenshot that is another form
of documentation and then the S window
helps you make a small area on the
screen in which a small application will
be put further enhancing multitasking
really there aren't really very many
apps that you can use for this however
especially when you compare it to the
multi window out of all five of these
Pen functions I definitely use the
action level most this is the
contextually aware part of the S Pen
that opens up a pad for you to write
anything you need in it
you can make quick notes that are stored
for later or take what you wrote and
plug it into a slew of different apps
action memo Android authority and then
you can easily search for it on the web
for example or you can make a few lines
of what you need to do later and it will
quickly make a task list for you
it's an incredibly useful tool to use
when your S Pen is in hand and it helps
get a lot done quickly speaking of when
the S Pen is in your hand I generally
end up writing out all of my
correspondence using the handwriting
pop-up however over any text box and a
small icon comes up hit it and you can
write in the box that comes up the
handwriting recognition is kind of
scarily accurate and should work pretty
well for even the worst chicken scratch
writers for finding just about anything
that I have made the S finder works
really well and utilizes that
handwriting recognition put just about
any term in there and they can even find
your hand written action memo notes with
or without the S Pen multitasking is
also a must on the note 3 multi window
has been enhanced to allow two of the
same app to run at once this is most
useful for say multiple chat windows you
can even send info from one side to the
other easily by selecting the dot right
in the middle watch a youtube video
while messaging your friends yep
browse the web while checking your mail
yeah you can do that too there's so much
that the Galaxy Note 3 is capable of and
you can use just about any combination
of them to get what you need done and
that's what makes the Galaxy Note 3 one
of the most attractive smartphones
available today you do have to pay for
all of this flexibility however as the
notary will set you back an average of
two hundred and ninety nine dollars on
two-year contracts in the US and it will
be well above the seven hundred and
fifty dollar mark when unlocked if
you're already a note loyalist this step
up to the note 3 is one I'm pretty sure
you're going to make anyway but for
everyone else this kind of insurance
free is admittedly pretty steep but if
you can swing it I think you'll really
like what you're going to get and so
there you have it like I said before I
now get why the note line is so popular
especially with this note 3 I've learned
that this is more than just a large
phone while some people were stray away
from its size that's honestly really
only the main detractor in my opinion
and these days the only people who
really hate on large phones are the ones
who haven't made the leap yet as far as
the S Pen goes plenty of people use the
note without even
touching it but in its many different
implementations the note 3 works and
generally succeeds as a phone as a tiny
tablet as a media player as a backup
camera as a personal assistant as a
bridge in the gap between analog writing
and digital input as quite the looker
and overall as a tool for everyday use
and the beauty is when you start to put
these things together the power
underneath the surface then makes the
note 3 capable of handling everything
you throw at it even when you personally
just can't keep it all straight so if
you haven't quite gotten into the note
line just yet the third time's the charm
for Samsung and the Galaxy Note 3 is a
wonderful place to start I hope you guys
