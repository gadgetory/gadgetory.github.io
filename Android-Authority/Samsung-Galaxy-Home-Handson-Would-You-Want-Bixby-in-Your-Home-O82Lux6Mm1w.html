out of nowhere announced the Samsung
Galaxy home which is basically a smart
speaker kind of similar to the home pod
or maybe the Google home or Google home
max but we didn't really know a lot
about it and they told us that they
would tell us a little bit more at the
Samsung developer conference well now
we're here it's November we're at the
same some developer conference and we
were hoping to know more but they didn't
really tell us anything extra but we
never did a hands on originally so I'm
just gonna work you through exactly what
this thing is so this is a smart speaker
from Samsung and it looks kind of like a
little grille or maybe a cauldron it's
it's a really funny shape and it's
actually really big it's powered by a
Harman speakers so they actually sound
really good and Samsung says that it can
direct sound exactly where you are in
the room to make this sound a lot more
clear and just a lot louder now the big
thing about the speaker is that it's
powered by Bix feet which is kind of
controversial obviously a lot of people
don't really like Bix be on their phone
and a lot of people already have like an
Alexa or Google assistant in their home
already so it seems like it's gonna be a
little bit difficult for Samsung to be
able to penetrate people's homes the one
big interesting thing that we learned at
the Samsung developer conference is that
Samsung is opening up big speed to
developers so effectively people can
make their own apps and work with the
API to just develop things for the
Samsung Galaxy home as well as for Bixby
in general the Galaxy album can also do
things like make phone calls or find
your phone if you have a samsung galaxy
phone so that's pretty useful but
honestly Google assistant can already do
these things as well so it's gonna be a
little bit difficult for Samsung to
actually get people to want to use this
thing so we're really hoping that we
would get some sort of release day or
maybe price out of the conference here
but they haven't told us anything they
said that it was gonna be a 2018 product
but they haven't said that it's actually
going to launch it
so we're thinking it's probably gonna
get moved back to 2019 or if it even
launches at all so we'll make sure to
keep you updated as soon as we know
those things
but that's kind of been it for the same
Sun Galaxy home would you put Bixby in
your home or do you already have a lot
of Google home and Alexa enabled
speakers there let me know and stay
tuned to Android authority comm as soon
as we know any other updates on this
thing because of course we are your
source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
