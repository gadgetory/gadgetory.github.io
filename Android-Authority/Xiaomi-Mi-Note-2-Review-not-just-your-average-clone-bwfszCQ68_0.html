Authority and ever since the galaxy note
7 got discontinued a lot of people have
been searching for a good alternative
and this next one from Xiaomi might be
the closest you can get to the real deal
but is this all merely a carbon copy or
does it have a lot more to offer beneath
the surface let's find out what the
Xiaomi me Note 2 we've seen a lot of
really interesting devices coming out of
Chinese manufacturers as of late like
the honor magic and even Xiaomi zone
remix which was also announced alongside
the me Note 2 but something that Chinese
OEMs have been notoriously known for is
creating smartphone clones and the me
Note 2 is no exception we're pretty used
to this by now but this is probably the
first time we've seen a smartphone clone
of a phone that technically no longer
exists if you miss the note sevens
design this might actually be a good
thing because the Meno 2 copies the note
sevens design almost 280 the key word
here being almost the edges of the front
and back glass or curved or a xiaomi
likes to call it 3d glass and it's all
wrapped in a smooth and solid metal
frame the build quality is great and
it's a beautiful looking device if you
can manage to keep it clean from
fingerprints smudges and dusts that all
show up very easily especially on this
piano black version for the most part it
does feel very much like the note 7 in
the hand due to general shape and
material but there are some notable
differences the side bezels are much
thicker making them you know to a tad
wider and there's a much clearer and
sharper distinction with a way the glass
and metal meet along the side there's
also no s pen or stylus living at the
bottom of the device and instead all you
have is a microphone the USB type-c port
and it's single speaker the headphone
jack is on the opposite end at the top
along with the IR blaster for
controlling your TV or other peripherals
in your home on the right side you've
got the standard power and volume
buttons which are also made of metal so
they're very clicky and tactile and
finally on the left is the dual SIM card
slot there's no micro SD card slot but
there is plenty of internal storage with
the phone being offered in 64 and 128
gigabyte capacity the front of the
device features a home button and
capacitive keys for back and recent apps
that are denoted by dot which means you
can change the order of these buttons
within the settings to however you see
fit so you can have back on the left and
recent apps on the right or
vice versa at first glance the home
button may look like a solid state home
button because of how plus it is to the
glass but it is a real physical clicky
home button it does have capacitive
functionality so when the phone is
unlocked you can just slightly touch it
in order to go home and the only time
you have to physically press the button
down is when accessing Google now or
when using the home buttons integrated
fingerprint sensor to unlock the phone
the fingerprint sensor works just as
well as you would hope on a flagship
phone it's very fast and accurate own
lock and very rarely did it ever fail to
unlock on the first attempt being on the
front also makes it much easier to
unlock when it's sitting on a table or
desk the screen is an AMOLED display
measuring at 5.7 inches but unlike most
flagships that are featuring quad HD the
Mino - opts for 1080p instead but
honestly unless you plan on using this
phone for VR you probably won't even
notice to the naked eye the screen is
still plenty sharp and of course you
have all the inherent benefits of an
AMOLED screen like a deep blacks high
contrast and punchy colors there's also
some options within the settings to
adjust the color and contrast that make
the screen look how you want and the
reading modes make it easier on your
eyes at night if you like big screen
phones for a more comfortable media
experience you'll definitely enjoy this
one and Xiaomi did a great job of taking
advantage of the large size by giving
the Mino to a very high DPI that allows
you to see a lot more content on the
screen at one time the biggest benefit
of a 1080p panel is how much easier it
is on your phone's battery life and we
combine that 1080p panel with a massive
4070 milliamp hour battery you have a
recipe for some extremely good battery
life the Mino to easily last me all day
sometimes even a day and a half if my
usage is a little bit more casual but
regardless how many hours of YouTube
gaming social media or emails that I do
the phone always lasted me comfortably
into the late night hours of the day
aside from the design and screen size
let me note two similarities with the
note 7 pretty much ends there and you
don't have to dig very deep to see what
the differences are on the inside it's
got all the specs a we wanted on a
flagship all versions of the Mino to
come with these snap during a 21 shift
but the base model will come with 4
gigabytes of RAM while the Premium
Edition features 6 gigabytes of RAM the
Premium Edition will all become any
global version that supports a total of
37 band
including 22 LTE bands so this will be
the one to pick up for use anywhere
around the world or on GSM carriers here
in the states like t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T the
version we have for review is the
equally maxed out model with 6 gigabytes
of RAM and 128 gigs of storage and
performance has been nothing short of
expectation it's a very fast and fluid
experience with excellent touch response
it plays all the high-end games with no
lag or drop frame and with 60 bytes of
RAM jumping back and forth between
applications or multitasking is not a
problem for the Meno 2 at all but it
don't imagine that it would be an issue
on the 4 gigabyte of RAM version either
taking a look at the camera there's an 8
megapixel camera on the front and a 22
megapixel camera on the rear @f 2.0
unfortunately there's no optical image
stabilization but it does at the very
least have electronic image
stabilization the camera interface is
nothing out of the ordinary its
straightforward and simple and comes
with a handful of shooting modes like
panorama a group selfie mode beautify
and a manual mode for dialing in the
settings yourself while the camera
interface is simple and easy to use it
could use some improvement it's geared
more towards portrait orientation which
is fine if you take mostly portrait
photos but when shooting in landscape
only some UI elements rotate to
landscape while the good majority stay
locked in portrait of course none of
this matters if the picture quality
isn't any good but the Mito 2 is capable
of taking some great-looking photos that
way they are on par with other flagship
it stats and focus and capture photos
and the 22 megapixel shots provide
plenty of detail and you can really see
how sharp these images look when zooming
in and pixel peeping it does crush
shadows a little too much and under
exposes in certain situations but it's
nothing that can't be fixed by using HDR
even without optical image stabilization
it does decently well in low-light as
far as capturing details but it does
sometimes struggle with white balance
and there tends to be a flaring effect
with highlights it's also much slower to
capture photos in low light when using
HDR which makes it difficult to grab
shots that are in focus without using
some other form of stabilization like a
tripod the Mino 2 is running the latest
version of the UI with me UI version 8
on top of Android 6.0 marshmallow the UI
version 8 was introduced earlier last
year and it brings a host of new changes
to the interface there's a new clean
color palette that can be seen
throughout the entire interface
and inshallah me standard set of apps
and the font has been updated through a
font that Xiaomi claims is much easier
on the eyes even after several long
hours of reading the notifications panel
received a facelift with notifications
and toggles now being bundled into one
panel you can also get a convenient
weather widget integrated into the
notifications panel that will change
colors depending on the time of day
aside from the aesthetic changes me why
a also brings a lot of new and
interesting features one of them is
called dual app so with dual apps you
can run two instances of the same app
that are completely independent of one
another which I thought was pretty cool
and can be very useful on applications
that don't have multiple user login
support apps like Facebook and snapchat
would be prime examples but there's many
other apps that can take advantage of
this another feature that stands out on
me UI is the second space feature second
space basically lets you create a
secondary profile with its own home
screen and app that is completely
separate from your main profile if you
use your phone for both work and play
you could keep your main profile for
personal use and have your other for
business use and easily switch back
between the to me UI is still a far cry
from stock Android but shammies much
need to overhaul the interface has made
it more aesthetically pleasing and many
of the features actually add a fair
amount of value to the experience
without coming off at gimmicks the most
unfortunate part about the me no.2 is
that Xiaomi is only officially releasing
it in China you can still pick it up in
the US through resellers but it will
cost you a pretty penny ranging upwards
of $700 depending on the model but if
you're in the US and want proper band
support the global version is really
your only option there's certainly some
better deals out there but if you're
still on the hunt for a note 7
alternative the me note 2 will be your
best bet at least on the exterior but
when you get to know the phone inside
and out you'll realize that it's more
than just your average smartphone clone
