finally over
hey in Strasbourg our firm and Roy
thority what's going on everybody and
this is the HTC One m8 when it comes to
the look and feel the overall design
language stays the same with the new
edition sporting a more curvy design
especially when you look at the corners
and besides the all metal body sports a
brushed metal design that looks even
better than the original it's more
refined and very sophisticated and is
definitely a premium looking and feeling
smartphone but the main feat here was
being able to bring the brushed aluminum
wrapped around the sides without losing
any antenna fidelity comparatively
taller than a competition though it also
doesn't get that much wider thankfully
when you compare it to the original HTC
One m7 which makes it easier to hold due
to the curve on the back and the smooth
sides that are definitely an improvement
over the more rigid profile of the
original now of course there is still
that girth on top and at the bottom
mainly due to the boom sound speakers
and that HTC blackbar and it does make
reaching up and down the main handling
gripe when it comes to this phone but
overall it is still a pretty easy and
also very stylish experience when you
come to the display the very same Super
LCD 3 display that came in the original
HTC One gets a bump in size to 5 inches
with 441 pixels per inch we saw no
issues with the brightness the great
viewing angles and the sharp colors that
were exuding from the screen so while
this might be largely the same display
experience as the original HTC One only
somewhat beefed up it is still one of
the better ones out there when it comes
to the all-important bits underneath the
hood the current top-of-the-line
hardware in the 2.3 gigahertz Snapdragon
801 in the West or the 2.5 gigahertz
Snapdragon 801 in the East bring
performance that is as smooth as ever as
the sixth version of Sense moves very
smoothly through all of its elements
blinkfeed and all in response to a
growing consumer demand also the 16 or
32 gigabytes of on-board storage are now
bolstered by a micro SD card slot found
near the volume rocker the battery is
also bigger than its predecessor at 2600
milliamp hours and a Snapdragon 801
should be more powerful when it comes to
its battery consumption so battery
performance should be better this time
around
the sensors within the phone have also
been somewhat
Sallah dated in order to create a suite
of jesters that can be used to easily
open up a number of functions when any
motion similar to bringing the phone up
to your face is detected double tapping
the screen to turn it on or pressing the
volume down key while in a horizontal
position to open the camera name just a
couple of these functions now boom sound
returns and brings the front-facing dual
speaker setup that distinguished the
original from the rest in this iteration
the amplifiers have been even more
improved making them 25% louder and
capable of an even better soundstage
with better mids and lows the same goes
for the headphone jack performance which
has been given the same improved audio
treatment when you go to the camera you
get the same four ultrapixel camera that
might bring the same specifications but
the actual bits and pieces themselves
are new and updated to improve the
quality not only will you get the great
low-light performance but you'll also
get even better higher light performance
in that you won't get as many washed out
photos as before if you noticed dual LED
flash helps with getting a better skin
tone when using the flash as it can
detect ambient light in order to perform
under five different shades of the flash
in order for you to get the best out of
the situation as far as the software
goes
Zoe returns but not just in the form we
already know it as but also as an
upcoming app and network for enhanced
sharing with your peers other modes
included are consolidated in a very easy
to use an elegant mode selection screen
that can be bolstered by an array of
manual controls that you can find if you
delve in far enough selfie and video
chats over the phone get some importance
too with the five megapixel front camera
sporting in 88 degree wide angle lens
but of course the main story here is the
inclusion of a second camera unit whose
function is purely creative and actually
quite undeniable the dual camera as it
is called works in congruence with the
original in order to capture depth data
which then can be used to create real
DSLR level depth of field effects among
some other ones that are available as it
is a hardware based solution to a multi
focused capture and selection the long
processing time that generally plagues
other software based solutions is
eliminated it's a feature that in our
testing already worked incredibly well
and is probably the best implementation
of depth manipulation available now for
some real style in your photos
and finally in software sense 6.0 on top
of android 4.4 kitkat brings not
necessarily a full UI overhaul as
changes seem to be more under the hood
however while much of what you remember
may seem to return subtle changes helped
to consolidate the experience colors now
designate the experience that you're in
for example blinkfeed is green and media
apps are orange but these can be changed
with a number of themes that on one case
would it be able to bring back to full
muted black dark motif that you probably
remember from the original blinkfeed
does return and is now a full scroll
rather than a paginated layout of the
original adding content is largely the
same as it was before but integrations
with apps like the Fitbit fitness
tracking and also Foursquare peer
recommendations and help continue to add
to the experience and then apps like the
HTC Gallery and also HTC TV for taking
advantage of the infrared sensor up top
are also included and then as we
mentioned before the motion launch takes
advantage of the sensors within in order
to bring you an easy experience waking
up your phone for various functions you
can double tap to wake swipe left to go
to straight to the widgets panel swipe
right to go straight to the blink feed
and also put the phone in a horizontal
position and press the volume down
button in order to go straight to the
camera all in all sense is getting
better and better and in its sixth
iteration HTC further simplifies the
experience without losing any of the
features that really distinguish it at
the release of this video and
subsequently the announcement of the
phone itself the HTC One m8 it will be
available at Verizon stores and then
online shortly after to be followed by
store releases for the other major
carriers in a couple weeks so you can
get your hands on this phone about as
fast as you really need to and get your
hands on HTC sleights flagship that
brings a lot of enhancements to their
platform and so there you have it your
first look at the HTC One m8 stay tuned
for a full review coming quite soon as
the phone is already going to be
released and we're really excited to put
the camera through its paces and also
see how this phone deals with the daily
drive so keep it tuned to android
authority for all of the best coverage
