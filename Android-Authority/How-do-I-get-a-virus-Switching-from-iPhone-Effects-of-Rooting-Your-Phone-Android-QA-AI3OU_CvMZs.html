and today we answer your submitted
questions right from how to protect
yourself from Android viruses too when
the s4 will get 4.4 kitkat here we help
with the Florrick
calum asks is it possible to get a virus
just from browsing on my phone or
downloading an image yes but not in the
way that you mentioned you see some
people have you fearing like an evil
virus is waiting around every corner but
in reality viruses have not spread on
mobile devices the way they once did on
PCs largely because no one operating
system dominates the mobile devices like
they did in the PC era so calum you can
bravely enjoy your I Can Has Cheezburger
photos of kittens without fear but let's
talk about where some real dangers lie
shall we number one
sharing SD cards with your friends
that's like sharing heroin needles you
have no idea where that SD card has been
that SD card could have corrupted files
passed on to your phone big no-no don't
do it number 2 syncing your device with
someone else's computer or a public
computer similar to sharing SD cards
that's where corrupted files can be
easily transferred to your phone another
big no-no number 3 is the most common
way people corrupt their phones and that
is by downloading apps from illegitimate
sources so if you think you found a
great source to get Angry Birds for free
think again
don't do it you only want to download
apps from legitimate sources like the
Google Play Store the Amazon App Store
that kind of thing the best thing all of
you should do right now is go to the
Google Play Store and download the
look-out app it will scan your device
for corrupted of malware and get it out
of there it also protect against future
attacks good question
question number 2 came from Mike Mike
said do you think it's a good idea to
buy the HTC one now or wait for HTC to
release a new version of it I don't want
the one Mac's
Thanks are you really wedded to HTC as a
brand or do you just want the best
Android experience on a large screen if
it's the latter well you really want to
wait for the Nexus 5 that's gonna be a
significant Hardware bump and you get
vanilla Android and Vanilla's like
question number three came from Ollie
Ollie said I want to switch to Android
from my iPhone what phone should I buy
buy a Samsung Galaxy s4 wait for the s5
or buy a note three that really depends
on how you use your phone if user
experience as a priority for you I can't
really recommend Samsung here at all I
would recommend the Moto X they are far
kinder to the average user and it's been
a big hit but if you're a geek like me
and you lust after the s4 is four cores
then do yourself a favor and buy the s4
from the Google Play Store if your
country is eligible for it and save
yourself from Samsung's bloatware
question number four comes from Amelia
no Amelia no asks I've heard that
performance on a phone decreases after
rooting or by installing a custom ROM is
this correct first we should give a word
to the wise rooting your phone carries
with it real risks the biggest of which
is that you can brick your phone we say
brick your phone instead of break your
phone because if you fail at this that's
the only thing your phone will be good
for to be used as a brick so rooting is
for those of us who love to tinker a lot
to get a little bit of improvement fun
for some dangerous for many trust me I
know hello
grandma so Emiliano there is some truth
to this notion many people who root
their phones see a performance bump
right away
some see no change whatsoever but in
many cases the phone will decrease in
performance over time because rooting
your phone makes it more vulnerable to
malware attacks
so why root your phone at all you say
well because many of us like to tweak
and tinker and optimize our phones
what's right just for me the question
number five comes from Mateus Mateus
says will Samsung Galaxy s4 get Android
4.4 yes eventually TouchWiz is
considered such a top-heavy user
experience that it would greatly benefit
for a 4.4 KitKat
but hey 4.3 just dropped this week so we
have a lot of waiting to do thanks for
joining us today guys and if you want

provided below and I will get to your
question give me some hard ones some
