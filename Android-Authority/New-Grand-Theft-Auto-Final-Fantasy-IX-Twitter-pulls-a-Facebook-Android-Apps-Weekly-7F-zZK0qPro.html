weekly show is brought to you by
paraline hello again ladies and
gentlemen I'm Joe Hindy the android
authority app guy and welcome back to
android apps quickly this is episode
number 128 so let's get started facebook
Messenger is primed to get a huge
material design update in the near
future however that's not all that it's
getting testers of the application are
reporting that Facebook is also working
on multi account support as well as SMS
and MMS integration which is actually
kind of funny considering hangouts just
a band in that feature a few weeks ago
twitter is now trying out a new facebook
style algorithm that will show you
relevant tweets instead of a
chronological order so far the reaction
has been polarizing because some people
enjoy it while others really don't
however if you end up with it you can
easily disable it in the settings menu
so at least it can be turned off
Telltale Games announced this week that
they're going to be releasing a new
episodic adventure based around
Michonne's character from The Walking
Dead if it's anything like their prior
games based around the series then this
one is going to be flippin awesome the
release date is currently februari 25th
a 60 well-known sportswear company has
announced that they're going to buy
RunKeeper this follows in the footsteps
of other sports where companies such as
under armour acquiring endomondo and
adidas buying runtastic we don't know
how much they paid for the application
or what's going to happen to the app yet
it was rumored this week that opera
makers of the famous browser could be
bought by Chinese investors for 1.2
billion dollars this comes on the heels
of another announcement from opera about
an exclusive premium apps club where
subscription members can download all of
the applications they want for a single
price each month the service is kind of
awesome and we'll let you know more when
we find out for even more Android apps
and games news don't forget to check out
this week's newsletter which is linked
in the video description below there we
have well over two dozen stories that we
didn't get to do here today if you'd
like you can sign up for the Android
apps weekly newsletter using the form
that is in the written companion which
is also in the video description below
and we'll send it directly to you every
single Sunday okay folks let's take a
look at the absent games that made a big
splash this week as usual if you want to
check any of these apps
or games up you can find those links in
the video description below GTA liberty
city stories is the latest grand theft
auto game to hit the Google Play Store
and this one is one of the first that
was designed specifically for mobile it
plays more or less like your usual GTA
title except for this one has shorter
more streamlined missions along with
improved mobile controls from prior
games in the series to create a better
mobile experience overall it's suffering
from some release date bugs right now
but those will be fixed eventually it's
three dollars and ninety-nine cents
which is currently forty percent off the
chromer is a fun little application that
lets you use chrome custom tabs on
applications even if the developer
doesn't support it it's not necessarily
a new application but it received a huge
update this last week that added web
heads which opens links and bubbles
similar to Flinx and Link bubble the new
feature works really well and seems to
blend in well with the existing
functionality the application is free to
download and it's worth a shot if you're
looking for another bubble web browser
altos adventure is a new 2d infinite
runner with a simple premise you are to
ski down a mountainside collect llamas
and coins and perform awesome tricks of
course there are also obstacles that
you'll need to avoid it's a simple game
and most of your controls involve either
tapping or tapping and holding to get
the desired results it looks good and it
plays well which makes it worth checking
out it's free with in-app purchases just
like most infinite runners my shake is a
fun little application developed at the
University of Berkeley and it was built
to detect earthquakes it's true that
normal people will get next to no usage
from an application like this but if you
live in an area that is prone to
earthquakes it could be a good idea to
have something like this around it
measures shakes includes safety tips for
surviving an earthquake and it keeps a
log to see how many there have been it's
entirely free and it's really cool that
Android has an app like this Square Enix
continues their torrid pace of releasing
classic Final Fantasy games with the
release of final fantasy nine this game
takes you on the journey of Zidane and
garnet as they stop the evil queen who
is doing all kinds of terrible things it
features a 30 plus our experience with a
long story plenty of side quests and
some of the most lovable characters from
the Final Fantasy franchise it has some
release date issues but otherwise it
seems to work pretty well it has a steep
price tag at sixteen dollars and
ninety-nine
but at least there are no in-app
purchases this week's Android apps
weekly show is brought to you by
paraline paraline is a social media
style application that keeps things
really simple you can post various
things assign them a mood and then send
them into the aether for others to read
others will in turn send stuff out that
you can read you can show interest or
even message back if you want to make a
new friend the application has a simple
and colorful design that is both easy to
use and pleasing to look at it's a great
way to get some stuff off of your mind
or just write down whatever comes to you

what you say and your mood with similar
thoughts and moods if the application
