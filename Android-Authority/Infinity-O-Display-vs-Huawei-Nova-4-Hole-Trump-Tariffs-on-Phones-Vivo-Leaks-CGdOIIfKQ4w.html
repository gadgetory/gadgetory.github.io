may have seen this from Samsung and this
from hallway and I've always been
puzzled as to why this tends to trigger
people's rants about how one company has
copied another company because these
businesses are not in business for the
joy and pleasure of innovating they're
in business to make bank to make cheddar
so if Samsung makes a product that's new
that customers tend to like while ways
gonna copy that right away if you were
Huawei you would copy Samsung more times
than Apple says amazing amazing it's an
amazing amazing amazing great pretty
perfect amazing but Samsung does hope
that you will find this amazing an
alternative to the knotch Samsung teased
several new notch styles during a
keynote showing silhouettes of four
phones with new screens labeled infinity
u infinity V infinity oh and new
infinity as the name implies there is
simply a circular hole in the upper left
of the screen for a selfie camera the
screen covered glass though we may be
looking at a screen protector has curved
sides and rounded bezels that are
characteristic of the galaxy line
Chinese leaker ice universe predicts
that these screens will be used on the
upcoming samsung galaxy a8 as for the
release date ice universe speculates
that it could be as early as December in
order to counter Huawei's first whole
screen device now let's talk about
Huawei and their circular cutout Huawei
has posted a teaser of a phone with a
circular camera cutout on its way both
page with the camera island on the top
left-hand corner of the screen
the teaser image also seems to reference
the month of December Huawei has since
told the verge it would reveal more
information on Monday December 3rd we
don't know much else about this new
phone but the purported leaked photo
shows a device with the Alpher mention
camera cutout and a headphone jack
the Nova series is usually an upper
mid-range offering so we're expecting
either a cure in 980 or a cure in 710
chipset as well as a rear-facing dual
camera setup there's only one camera cut
out in the teaser image so we're not
expecting the Nova threes dual selfie
camera pairing now I know no one here
wants to get
political I get that but we got to talk
about the fact that Trump may be making
moves that will raise the prices of your
phones President Trump has threatened to
put a 10% tariff on mobile phones and
laptops coming from China a move that
could see prices rise significantly in
an interview with The Wall Street
Journal via Bloomberg Trump didn't seem
to be too worried about the possibility
of higher prices though saying and that
quote I can make it 10 percent and
people could stand that very easily
unquote now if you're thinking yeah I
could stand that very easily because I
ain't buying no Chinese phones no you
will
you see putting tariffs on phones coming
from China wouldn't only affect the
price of Chinese brands according to
counterpoint 74% of all phones and poor
day into the US and 2017 came from China
almost all phone manufacturers make
their phones or at least some of their
component parts of their phones in China
and then export them from China to the
US now that doesn't necessarily mean
that we'd see a big price hike right
away companies like Apple for example
who have big economies of scale and
large profit margins may choose to
absorb those costs to keep cost down but
how likely is that to last probably not
very long now let's get back to leaks
and rumors and talk about the fact that
this whole dual display thing might
actually be a thing recently kiddy owes
on Weibo claimed to reveal a necks too
that bears a strong resemblance to the
new Bo X the photos clearly depict a
vivo branded device with a large front
panel that looks a lot like the original
necks another screen graces the back of
the device with three cameras resting
above it including a second display
certainly eliminating the need for a
pop-up selfie camera however the first
gen next didn't exactly fare well in
terms of battery life during our review
adding a second screen will definitely
suck more juice all for the sake of
maintaining a notch free front the
original necks included a 4000 milliamp
hour battery but even that wasn't
sufficient to last into the evenings
with any heavy usage this really brings
up a fascinating topic about what is the
next big thing in technology everyone in
the smartphone industry is looking for
that next best thing whether it's
foldable displays dual screens augmented
reality what's it gonna be
if you look through history it tends to
be something often that you didn't
predict something completely out of
context that we had no frame of
reference for is it gonna be foldable
displays I don't know
feels kind of gimmicky cool but kind of
gimmicky I just want to give an example
how it applies to YouTube right for
years YouTube has been the 800-pound
gorilla when it comes to online video
and it's still very much is and people
I'm saying what is the next platform
that's gonna take over YouTube is it
gonna be Facebook is it gonna be
Instagram with new videos are gonna be
snapchat what's it gonna be and it turns
out there's really not any of those
things but YouTube is declining in views
and what is taking over well it's not
one platform it's the stream it's your
Facebook stream your Instagram stream
your Twitter stream its video that's
consumed in the stream that is I believe
the cause of YouTube's slight gradual
decline in dominance in the online video
space completely something that people
wouldn't have expected we were expecting
a YouTube competitor it wasn't that at
all so applying that to smartphone
technology is it gonna be foldable
displays or dual screens or could it be
something just completely out of our
frame of reference let me know what you
think in the comments below or on
Twitter you know what software starts to
do things it's not supposed to do who
solves those problems
