brought to you by netflix head to
netflix.com / android for a free 30-day
trial with Halloween around the corner I
thought I would do this edition in my
halloween costume what you can't tell
what I am I'm a ninja anyway let's get
on to the news 8 Joshua car from Android
thority what's going on everybody and
it's time for another dose of the week's
top Android news it's android weekly we
start off with some software news all of
which was thoroughly covered on Google
Play weekly a few great games have been
released into the google play store for
your enjoyment dead trigger 2 has been
my obsession for the past few days and
it comes with a proper storyline and
updated graphics x vs zombies 2 has
arrived just in time for Halloween and
is completely free to play though that
does mean some purchases have to be made
in game and finally for all of us PS
players out there call of duty strike
team brings a top down version of the
popular shooter to android devices but
perhaps the biggest release of the week
was likely BBM the messaging service by
blackberry that was the lifeline for
users like me who used to own
BlackBerry's now available for android
and iphone the release was originally
based on a wait list that you had to
wait to get to the front of once there
you could get into BBM grab your pin and
then try to find anyone who would want
to talk to you the app boasts group
messaging plenty of sharing and the
notifications for delivered or received
messages that us old-school BBM users
really appreciate it for a full look at
vb m or app got joe hindy has an
extensive review of it available here at
the channel and at android authority com
alright let's move on to some official
device releases even if they're not
really about android apple just
announced their brand new ipad
iterations the ipad air and the iPad
Mini now with Retina display at android
authority com we pit the ipad air
against some of the best tablets that
android had to offer putting the new
64-bit capable a 7 chip against the
likes of the snapdragon 800 like found
in the galaxy note 10.1 there were
definitely no blow outs in either camp
as the iPad air does boast a nice
resolution increase but of course the
matter of software is highly subjective
speaking of which we also have an open
thread on android authority com asking
you what you think of Apple's newest
product from a cursory glance it's
pretty clear that while many of you
actually do like the Apple hardware the
operating systems are what truly sway
you sound off your opinions here in the
comments below or over at the open
thread on our website now back at
Samsung's camp there's some unsettling
news regarding accessories apparently
the giant might be wanting to curtail
sales of third-party accessories while
we have her no official word from
Samsung on this matter a few different
reports state that a program to put ID
chips in both phones and official
accessories will keep third-party
products from working on samsung
smartphones or tablets allegedly this is
all a step towards Samsung opening up
its own proper division of accessories
but small businesses who make their own
products are understandably skeptical
while the quality of accessories for
Galaxy devices might increase due to
first party involvement it could also
make all of the prices go right up we'll
have more on this development as more
information becomes available it's not
all bad news for samsung however as CEO
JK shin decided to really combat all of
the speculation that samsung is not
selling as well as they want to
according to the man himself the galaxy
s4 has sold over 40 million devices
since its inception while it is possible
that Samsung had even higher numbers
projected this is still quite the
milestone definitely blowing away the
sales of the galaxy s3 around the same
time in its cycle heading on over to LG
the G flex smartphone has been found in
the wild and it appeared in the news in
Argentina the phone with a curved 6 inch
display was found in a picture gallery
and a small video that showcases its
features mainly the g2 esque button
layout found on the back we have yet to
see just how much a curved display will
really entice users but we're definitely
excited to go hands-on with the G flex
when the time comes
and finally we end on the ongoing saga
of Nexus 5 and Kit Kat rumors while we
were all expecting an announcement this
past week the days went by without so
much as a whimper October 24 came and
went and the apparent lack of reporting
from the press who were invited to the
event made it clear this isn't the
announcement we were hoping for but that
doesn't mean the rumor stopped even a
little bit it has been reported that Kit
Kat will bring a very enhanced TV user
interface not only will Android mesh
much better with your large TV but the
actual TV experience might be getting
very Android ified in this next
iteration we know that Google TV has
become Android TV so this may further be
a step in that direction and finally we
end on yet another hope for the
announcements we're all waiting for the
end of October is now won the Nexus 5
and Android KitKat will allegedly be
unleashed specifically by November first
now it's not the first time we've heard
that the new Nexus smartphone will come
around Halloween but we're still keeping
that grain of salt handy but hey we can
help right as always thank you guys very
much for watching if you want to see the
written companions for any of the
stories that were covered on this
edition of weekly they're all in links

andrew authority for all of the best
coverage including our weekly shows like
google play weekly and Q&amp;amp;A both hosted
by joe hindy but of course we also have
our reviews comparisons and future focus
