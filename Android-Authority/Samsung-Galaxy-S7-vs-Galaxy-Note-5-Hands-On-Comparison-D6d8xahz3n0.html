device seems to have made it into the
new galaxy s7 is Josh of regard from
Android authority what's going on
everybody and here's a quick look verses
between the galaxy s7 and the galaxy
note 5 the galaxy s6 marked a turning
point for Samsung it was the company's
first flagship smartphone to feature a
premium design language that employed
metal and glass dual glass panels and
after that yet the galaxy note 5 which
adopted it as well and put the curves on
the back area of the note 5 in order to
make it easier to handle and to make it
feel a little bit better overall that
very same design language has made it
onto the galaxy s7 the newest flagship
that Samsung has put out at MWC 2016 the
galaxy s7 now has made some improvements
on that very design with a 5.1 inch
screen that makes the overall device
smaller enough to be able to sit so
nicely in the hand that the back curves
actually improve the ergonomics overall
but the back camera hump has been
reduced as well and the front tactile
home button is also a little bit more
flush with the body everything is really
quite similar between these two devices
right down to all of the areas on the
bottom but of course the Galaxy Note 5
has its little trump card and that is of
course the S Pen which is very flush
with the body because it has that small
pop-out area on the top the clicky top
rather that goes right into the area on
the bottom Super AMOLED displays are
obviously going to be the name of the
game with these two devices and they
provide really great punched out colors
that make everything from media to
gaming to tags really enjoyable to read
and view and with the somewhat updated
TouchWiz interface all of the colors and
all the different shapes seem to come
through just very nicely on the galaxy
s7 now the main additions in the galaxy
s7 are features that people were wishing
were in the note 5 and the galaxy s6
before it and that is to start off water
and dust resistance now the galaxy s7 is
able to employ the same premium design
language while still being able to
protect it from the elements and that is
great to know because darn any extra
bits around either of these phones that
you would need to put in in order to
actually seal off the device but the
other feature that is incredibly
important to a lot of power users
finally return
in the galaxy s7 we have the sim tray
that can now house a microSD card and in
battery we actually have a bit of a tie
here but of course when we get the
galaxy s7 we will see if that is
actually true and that's because the
regular galaxy s7 that comes with the
smaller screen comes with a 3000
milliamp hour battery which is the size
that you get in the larger galaxy note5
so the galaxy s7 is actually available
for power users to have the type of
longevity that they want alongside that
expandable storage and it is a very nice
part about the new flagship it's
underneath the hood that the
improvements are where they need to be
the Snapdragon 820 is what you will find
in most of the phones but you'll also
get a variant that comes with the neck
ceno's 88-90 in the galaxy s7 the galaxy
note 5 on the other hand still has the
extremo 7420 processor which really
proved itself in terms of performance
and reliability and overall even though
we have a lot of features in both of
these devices we expect them to move
along quite swimmingly and with the note
5 that has certainly been the case in
the galaxy s7 there are some differences
in the operating system TouchWiz is
trying to streamline just that little
bit more but a lot of the features that
are still available in touch with
throughout the last couple of iterations
still return you just have to search for
them a little bit more because they're
not all up in your face things like the
multi window and the pop-out view are
still available and you are able to use
those for even better multitasking
across all of TouchWiz now the main
thing in software is that TouchWiz seems
to be moving along the trend that we
might be seeing this year of eliminating
the app drawer the feature under the
advanced features and then the galaxy
labs area allows you to move all of the
apps to the home screens effectively
eliminating the app drawer now we don't
know if this is going to be a actual
feature that will that will be there
moving forward but at least with the
note 5 if that update does happen then
you may need to know that the galaxy s7
is where that all started but in
software it really is the s-pen that is
the differentiator here as when you take
out the s-pen when the screen is
actually off you are able to jot down a
very quick memo in order to have a note
and S note so that is available for
safekeeping and inside of the interface
a pen command window will come up or
rather
and menu will come up that will allow
for the capture of the screen in a bunch
of different ways and the manipulation
of them or of course you could just use
the s-pen as a regular type of mouse so
that you don't necessarily have to use
your fingers in order to navigate across
all of TouchWiz the camera of the galaxy
s7 is a 12 megapixel camera with AF 1.7
aperture lens but it comes with larger
1.4 micron pixels this time around which
should allow the camera to take in much
more light now this is in contrast to
the note 5 s great 16 megapixel F 1.9
aperture camera that did a great job in
pretty much any situation that we put it
in and we did love the note 5 and the
galaxy s6 even before it for the cameras
that they were able to provide and it
should be even better this time around
also the auto focusing speed should be
much better on the galaxy s7 because
every one of those larger pixels are
able to do phase detection autofocus
which is something that allows it to
really autofocus as fast as possible
obviously we didn't have a whole lot of
time with a galaxy s7 to really put it
through its paces in terms of the camera
so you will have to wait for our full
review in order to see what those
pictures are like and if they are an
improvement going from 16 in the galaxy
note 5 to 12 megapixels in the galaxy s7
overall that's just a quick look between
these two phones there's a lot to be had
in terms of similarities between the
note line and the S line at this point
because last year the note 5 was able to
take the lead of the galaxy s6 and this
year the galaxy s7 continues that trend
while simultaneously bringing back some
features that users really wanted in the
phones from last year thankfully in the
galaxy s7 we have a return of those
particular features including the
expandable storage so power users can
probably look forward to having all of
these things in future note devices as
well and that in and of itself is pretty
exciting to know so keep it tuned to
Android Authority for more on the
Samsung Galaxy s7 as we put it through
its paces and we compare it to all of
the other flagships that are in the
market today and keep it tuned here for
even more from MWC 2016 because of
course we are your source for all things
