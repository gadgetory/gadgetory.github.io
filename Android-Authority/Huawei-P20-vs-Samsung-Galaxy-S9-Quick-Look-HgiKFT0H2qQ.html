where Samsung has recently just done
some work it's Joshua Vergara what's
going on everybody the camera game is
heating up in this comparison that
Huawei p20 Pro versus the Samsung Galaxy
S 9 plus before we get into the looking
glass the looks of these devices tell
very different stories Samsung has
brought some freshness with the lilac
purple color but much of the device is
still very familiar you still have a lot
of the elements in the same places
including the Bigsby button but the
fingerprint reader has been put in a
much easier to access place but overall
it's that purple color that we really
want because it is a little bit unique
unique color however has always been a
Forte of Huawei's as evidenced by their
previous partnership with Pantone but
the p20 takes it a step further not only
with some modernistic placement of
certain elements but by making a
two-tone device the Twilight Edition is
a gradient that smoothly transitions
from blue to purple we wouldn't blame
you for calling it something like
unicorn it also has a glass on glass
design but it's with these unique colors
that truly shines and when it comes to
some of the elements like those three
lenses which we do get into in our full
hands-on since all of those elements are
over on the side the color takes center
stage which makes it look a little bit
like a cool point-and-shoot camera what
does not break up the rear of the p20 is
a fingerprint reader which its placement
is different than that of the samsung
galaxy s 9 while we wanted to keep some
form of continuity so the finger per
meters up from Pitt can be used as a
navigation key for tap hold or swipe to
do pretty much anything that the soft
keys would do which you can turn off in
the settings all of these screens are
pretty high powered but the Huawei P 20
and P 20 pearl have full HD plus
resolution compared to the quad HD plus
resolutions of every Samsung Galaxy S 9
device but aside from resolutions the
story here is about that notch on the P
20 now there is one thing about the
notch it does take up just a small
portion of the top of the screen but you
are able to turn it off basically what
that means is the entire portion up top
where the notch already is located will
just become a black bar so it kind of
gives you an experience that is more
akin to non nagy devices but then again
Samsung has already been able to provide
full screen experiences without
resorting to things like a notch with
its infinity display on top of that the
galaxy s 9 does have the curves on the
side that infinity does
which affords it a few other features
like the edge UX it's really up to you
if the unique screen experiences can go
over the unique colorway of the p20
Twilight in terms of software you get
really full-featured operating systems
between these two the Samsung UI goes up
against the EMU eye and though they look
pretty vastly different only Samsung's
propensity for putting a ton of features
into their phones separates these
experiences emui is one of the more
full-featured Chinese Android interfaces
out there but plenty of options like
navigation Docs to do labs but on the
other hand Samsung's apps tend to go on
top of existing functionality that
Google has baked into Android Oreo
for example big speak but the
redundancies of Samsung's software is
always going to be a contentious point
for plenty of users under the hood these
phones benefit from the current release
cycles with the snapdragon 845
but Huawei keeps things in-house with
the ki-rin 970 which is already a
powerful processor in and of itself the
galaxy s 9 plus and the p20 pro both get
bumps up to six gigabytes of RAM and the
p20 line has bigger on-board storage
throughout with 128 gigabytes without
expansion but the Galaxy S 9 keeps it at
64 with the microSD card slot where the
p20 line definitely has the galaxy s 9 B
is in battery capacity the p20 pro has
four thousand milliamp hours in its
battery and the galaxy s nine plus can
only post 3500 but all of that finally
leads us to the cameras and there's a
lot to talk about here Samsung's camera
enhancements have been pretty well
documented here at Android authority
already so make sure you check out the
review and various camera tests aside
from an a megapixel front-facing shooter
the rear lens has been given an F 1.5
aperture and F 2.4 aperture because of
blades that literally give it eight dual
aperture mode that is already pretty
great and doesn't even take into account
the zoom lens featured on the galaxy s 9
plus that comes from the note 8 now we
know the camera quality of the galaxy s
9 is pretty great already especially in
low-light shots where it consistently
performs above its competitors but there
on top of that features like the super
slow-motion and AR emoji and this
cameras definitely want to beat Huawei
just might have done it though by
putting together quite literally every
resource at their disposal and making
them work in concert the smaller p20 has
a 12 megapixel RGB sensor on the rear
is backed by a 20 megapixel monochrome
sensor but just adding the zoom lens on
the p20 pro that 8 megapixel telephoto
is not the only addition going from the
p20 to the p20 pro the other two sensors
are basically super powered the
monochrome sensor still rocks that 20
megapixels but the main RGB sensor is a
whopping 40 megapixels and that doesn't
even take into account the fact that
that sensor is the biggest found on any
smartphone that sensor is even bigger
than that found on the galaxy s 9 so all
of these lenses work together to get the
best possible shots and just about any
situation thanks to a I assisted scene
detection and photo processing the P 20
and P 20 pearl are able to after about a
second figure out what scene you're
looking at and changed the settings
accordingly
like for example turning on the portrait
mode with bouquet effects if it detects
that there's a face on screen but the AI
assistance also helps in a critical way
for stabilization because of the high
megapixel counts and the different
lenses working together constant
cropping and warping are done to
pictures and video so in low-light
situations this all works very hard to
ensure that long exposures don't exactly
need a tripod it just needs a fairly
steady hand and it will crop the image
accordingly so you still get a good non
blurry photo that happens to have good
exposure because of that long exposure
you just did and that picture basically
had what is the equivalent of 50 1000
iso clearly all the talk from huawei
about their camera is a mouthful so just
remember to check out our hands-on and
we're going to do some deep dives into
this three camera setup that is
incredibly exciting and just might be
the thing that actually trumps the
galaxy s 9 and so there you have it our
first reactions on the P 20 the P 20 Pro
in relation to the galaxy s 9 plus we
were already fans of the high powered
and very capable galaxy s 9 including
great experiences inside the OS better
ergonomics outside and a good time with
the well-regarded camera package but
Huawei is finding ways to up the ante in
every one of those categories not only
with its Twilight Edition but also with
its camera package we're gonna do a full
comparison soon especially doing a deep
dive with the cameras and maybe Huawei's
unicorn could be the antithesis to
Samsung's current hit keep it tuned to
Android already for more on the Huawei
p20 and also stick around for more
and Rathore decom and all of our
