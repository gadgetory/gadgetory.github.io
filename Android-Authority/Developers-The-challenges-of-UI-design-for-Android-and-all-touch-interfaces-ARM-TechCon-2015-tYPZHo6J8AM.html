thority were armed tech 2015 here in
santa clara and i've met up with roland
from ICS hello Roland hi are you doing
I'm good thanks tell me about your job
here well I am the engineering director
for integrated computer solutions we are
a consulting and services firm and we
provide user experience development for
touchscreen devices okay right so we all
use using devices every day on our
phones microwave ovens even thermostats
what are some of the challenges to
designing a good user interface well the
greatest challenge is to take time and
incorporate the process of designing a
user interface early from the very
beginning in your development project
this is especially important if you are
under a very tight deadline in a very
short time frame user interface is
something that has to be done right up
front we say lead by design I will give
you an example for example we were
challenged at some point to create IV
Island vehicle infotainment prototype in
just nine week it's not just the design
it was the design plus the prototype
despite this very short time frame we
gave our UX engineers time to lead into
the project and to take time and
understand the challenges that they have
so essentially what we did is they came
out with a flow diagram of how the IV I
was supposed to work and then
incorporated ideas sketches that
resulted essentially into a user
interface diagram that then was
transitioned and translated into a
working prototype so this working
prototype was then implemented by our
engineering department within nine weeks
deadline we made the deadline and
deliver the prototype to our customer so
we'll have a look at that user interface
in a moment but the key is don't make
the user interface a secondary thing
it's a primary thing absolutely because
your product is going to be used by
human beings so you need the HMI the
human machine interface needs to be
needs to have a dominant role in your
process well after a few more iterations
and some additional time of course we
ended up with a very realistic in
vehicle infotainment system that I'm
showing here which has the typical
functionality that you find in modern
cars such as climate applications media
applications the phone integration or a
diagnostic step that can show you the
state of your vehicle in a very
appealing and graphically attractive
manner with transitions and animations
as needed so we're and tell me what tips
would you give to Android UI designers
well over the past few iterations and
releases of Android beginning from
KitKat but all the way up till now to
lollipop and marshmallow google has
invested a great deal of material and
into the user interface designer so the
biggest tip is read and understand about
material design try to unify your
applications follow the design
guidelines and try to understand what
you usually want to do with your
applications and make that as easy to do
as possible so that will give them
consistency with with other applications
and of course Google thought a lot about
these guidelines and what they mean for
a good user interface that's exactly
true and that's why they are there and
that's why you should follow them that's
as a developer you should familiarize
yourself with material design and the
possibilities that this gives you as a
developer to interact with your users in
a very straightforward and unified
manner now if any of our developers who
are watching this are struggling with UI
design you offer some services as a
company how could you help them
absolutely so we do offer a consulting
services we can help them with designing
and understanding the workflow of the
applications we come in house and we can
also work from remote understanding with
the promises that they struggle with we
can help with sketches with workflow
analysis with interview process of your
users
we can help with graphics design in the
end and we can help even with
implementation services and Android and
iOS that's a fantastic well thank you
for your time stay Roland thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
