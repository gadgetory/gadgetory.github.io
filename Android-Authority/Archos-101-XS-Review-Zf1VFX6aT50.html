Clayton Youngberg coming at you from
Android authority calm you're born
source for all things Android today
we've got a review of the brand-new
Arcos gen 10 this is the 10-1 XS the XS
stands for extra slim and our coats is
looking to change the game with this
tablet so you can see here doesn't look
much for a tablet as of yet and that's
because the unique cover board is on the
tablet now this is a magnetic keyboard
dock as well as a protective cover that
i've magnetically attaches to your
device protects it from dust scrapes
fall damage the whole nine yards and it
also has a micro USB here on bottom so
we'll check this out here in just a
little bit and actually get into what
this tablet has to offer as you can see
this is one of the slimmest tablets on
the market as of right now they're
really pushing for the dimensions of
this tablet to rival the slimmest
tablets on the market the cover board is
only 5 millimeters thick our tablets
only eight millimeters thick so it's
just really light it's built well you
can see we have aluminum bezel around
here we've got aluminum on the back and
then we have some nice white plastic
wrapping around the rest of the tablet
it's got Ice Cream Sandwich on board
upgradeable to jellybean in quarter 4 of
2012 and it's really blazing fast we'll
get into some more specs here in a
minute after we check out some more of
the tablet itself see here on the bottom
we have our nice docking pin it's a
proprietary connector and Argos is
actually coming out with a line of
accessories exclusive to the Gen 10
series
anyways over here we've got mini HDMI
we've also got the mini headphone or the
standard headphone excuse me we also
have the micro USB and the micro SD slot
now on this side is where we have our
volume rocker and our power key with a
nice little green light to notify us
that the tablet is charged and running
I've got a 1.3 megapixel camera on the
front of the device but no rear camera
so as you can see we'll go to our lock
screen here umm this is running an
unskilled version of Android 4.0.4
ice-creams
sandwich and it's got a blazing fast
processor humming away behind the
software got a TI OMAP 44 70 CPU we also
have a power VR SGX 544 GPU anyways
we'll go into our app tray here as you
can see we do have our usual Ice Cream
Sandwich native apps and we also have a
few our Coast native apps such as the
Archos remote we have our file manager
we have a media server suite we have the
office suite some news rep√∫blica apps
Netflix pre-loaded got some games like
fruit ninja pre-loaded we have our photo
frame viewer as well it takes all of our
recent images and kind of just brings
them across the screen and we can just
browse anyways I'll go ahead and go to
the next pane here we have the Spider
Man HD pre-loaded Naqada try some gaming
I added the thumb keyboard this does
have the nice stock Ice Cream Sandwich
tablet keyboard on deck you can see no
skins here just basically AOSP Android
click our status bar we've got our
airplane mode Wi-Fi auto rotate screen
we can enable or disable notifications
and go ahead and go into the settings
under Wi-Fi settings and even though
this is the AOSP Android we also have
our nice little tab here for repair and
formatting options
courtesy of our code so we have touch
screen calibration available
accelerometer calibration can reset our
multimedia library reset the ends or
legal information or model number we can
register our device as well Buchan
firmware version for dots
0.23 which is a little Arcos version but
this is unscanned as i've said and it's
android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich and
zoom back out go ahead and go back once
again we will go back to our settings
very quickly do have the data monitoring
the data usage but we don't have NFC in
this device because we've also got a
developer options with USB debugging all
of our Ice Cream Sandwich native
developer options as well got a recent
maps pane here go ahead and do a
quadrant standard test to show you how
fast this TI OMAP processor is it's
really blazing fast I'll go ahead and
set the tablet down for that it is just
incredible how fast this tablet is
CAIR quadrant is finished we'll go ahead
and see what we scored tilt this up our
device got thirty eight hundred and
sixteen which is just great I mean this
big 10.1 inch display with a resolution
of 1280 by 800 it's just really lots of
power so getting a quadrant score of
around thirty eight hundred to four
thousand is uh you know pretty dang
impressive we had a sixty five hundred
eighty-one or 6851 I'm sorry CPU score I
remember we had 3895 now the internal
storage on this device
this is sixteen gigabytes of flash
memory but the micro SD card is
expandable up to 64 gigabytes anyways
iOS core 4900 2ds a thousand and three D
is 2423 as I said this has a great GPU
on it so anyways let's check out this
awesome cover board that comes with the
Archos now with a suggested retail price
of 399 you've got to expect some pretty
good build quality and I will say that
this is fairly stable despite this
little flap you just pull up and then
simply open this flap as well it's very
stable it's made out of high quality
plastic you know it is a little flexible
but nothing nothing too much anyways
we'll slide a tablet in it is
magnetically glided you can see in the
back we can go ahead and zoom in check
out those connections got all of our
magnetic strips here and then the cover
board simply glides the Archos tablet
down and then holds it magnetically
pretty sturdy as you can see it doesn't
have a lot of give when you turn this
back around and check out some more
features of this cover board as you can
see it's full QWERTY keyboard
I accidentally press some buttons there
we also have our Android native
shortcuts we have the back the search
button our notifications button as well
home button recent apps and then we have
our menu button here all of our numbers
are media options here the play pause
now the proprietary media streaming
utilities on this tablet are very great
because Arcos was a multimedia
company basically before they got into
the tablet business so we'll go ahead
and go back here we do have our video
player we have some nice demo videos
here on the video player that we'll go
ahead and just show you here got our
demo video nice sound from our speaker
here I'm go ahead and turn our volume
rocker up this is a start demo video
anyways plays great video HD looks
awesome on this device as I said has a
very big resolution we also have a
proprietary music player comes from
Argos some angry load with a few songs
like some Daft Punk get loud enough for
volume control simply slide up and down
our 1.3 megapixel front-facing camera is
mostly going to be used for Skype calls
and stuff of that nature we'll go ahead
and give it a test button back and go
into our apps and we'll get to our
camera here
nice quality okay anyways uh go ahead
and go back does have all of the Ice
Cream Sandwich features doesn't have the
fast shutter like some of the other
tablets do while actually on tablets but
galaxy s3 and Ice Cream Sandwich device
guys don't forget to check out the
Archos 10-1 XS line of tablets they're
gonna be hitting stores August 22nd 2012
upgradeable the Ice Cream Sandwich got a
gigabyte of RAM in here expandable 64
gigabytes of storage 16 gigabytes
internal great 10.1 inch screen with an
awesome resolution as well don't forget
our cover board here simple protection
magnetically sealed
and then all of our different options as
far as the ports go this is this a
really great tablet I've enjoyed using
it for $399 you can't really go wrong
for something that comes with a keyboard
dock rivals the Transformer Pad Infinity
the Aces TF 300
as well with its keyboard docks and it
is just a little bit thinner so anyways
guys check out the brand new gen 10
tablet line from Park Oaks and thanks
