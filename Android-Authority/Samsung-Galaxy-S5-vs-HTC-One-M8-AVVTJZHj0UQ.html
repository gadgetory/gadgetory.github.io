age-old battle of metal versus plastic
but does the new crop of flagships from
Samsung and HTC have even more to offer
than just their materials well let's
find out because it's Josh regard from
Android 30 what's going on everybody and
you're looking at the vs. between the
Samsung Galaxy s5 and the HTC One m8
this should be the most obvious
comparison to make at first glance as I
already alluded to this being an age-old
battle of plastic versus metal one thing
we can say right away is that both of
these phones simply continue the
tradition of their predecessors the
Samsung Galaxy s5 comes with a signature
plastic build that users either believe
is very familiar or very played out
form-factor is largely the same with the
rounded corners keeping together a
pretty flat device all around and much
of what you expect from Samsung returns
here with the button layout this time
replacing menu with recent apps and the
same layout found on the sides the sides
are of a more rigid design but for the
most part it's still flat and that's the
experience is very much the same as you
remember the main changes in the
material of the back which is still
plastic but this time has a perforated
design it's probably the most polarizing
aspect of the design as many people seem
to find it a regression from even the
textured plastic found from the note
line move over to the HTC One m8 and
you'll find subtle but significant
changes to the aluminum build of the
original in this gray model it is a
hairline brushed feel on the back that
does scream good build quality it's just
going to turn heads with the metal build
that manages to look very executive
another change on the back is the second
camera unit up top the dual camera that
helps with capturing depth data the big
change with the aluminum is that it now
wraps around the sides of the phone
eliminating the polycarbonate that used
to be there and providing a very smooth
and rounded feel that personally I felt
was better than the rigid feel of the
original having the power button up top
might not be welcomed by all Android
users but nonetheless that aspect
returns here and finally up front to the
HTC One jumps into the 5-inch screen
game but also retains the great
performing boomsound speakers at the top
and bottom making for a taller device
all around
now while the HTC one is definitely the
taller device it is a small margin
narrower than the Galaxy s5 the result
is a good handling experience from left
to right in either device the five inch
form factor alone makes it difficult to
reach the top easily in one hand but at
least with the galaxy s5 it does get the
nod for being just a little bit easier
than on the HTC One m8 so with a good
handling experience possible on either
device it really comes down to what
material you prefer for your phone and I
know a lot of people out there do prefer
the metal over the plastic but I do have
to say that the Galaxy s5 does get some
credit for being a very familiar
handling device display technology has
come a long way in our smartphones and
we see just how far it has come in both
of these devices while in the Samsung
Galaxy s5 you get the classic Super
AMOLED display at 5.1 inches the Super
LCD 3 display of the HTC One is now 5
inches as well Super AMOLED brings the
signature high saturation with colors
that basically pop out of the screen and
punch you in the face you'll get some of
the most vivid experiences from the s5
hands-down
however the Super LCD 3 screen of the
HTC One was never a slouch and now it is
even better at a 5-inch size it also
presents great colors especially with
the new motifs found in sense if we were
being nitpicky we would say that the HTC
one seems to show a little better
contrast between colors upon closer
inspection but there is no doubt in our
minds that you will have a good time in
either display so just go ahead and fire
up some games and videos and have fun
performance is another instance where
either device will really give you a
great experience because both of them
come with the same required processing
package the Snapdragon 801 clocked in at
2.5 gigahertz for the Galaxy s5 and 2.3
for the western version of the HTC One
m8 both backed by the audrina 330 and
two gigabytes of RAM you'll have no
problem getting just about anything done
in either phone as it's just a matter of
which Avenue you want to tackle while we
might always hear that TouchWiz has some
lag issues or stutter the level of such
things seem to be at their lowest in
this new version found in the galaxy s5
it also comes with so many extra tools
to help you get more done sometimes all
at once
meanwhile the HTC One works with a
version of sense that has been
REME lines but doesn't provide as many
tools but it's an example of how when
you keep it simple
you keep it fast something that is
readily apparent in this snappy and
smooth version of HTC Sense certain key
elements that users usually want in
their smartphones are consistently
making it to flagship devices now and
it's a trend that actually helps put
these two phones a bit more even on the
scale in the Samsung Galaxy s5 the
removable cover allows you access to a
removable battery and the micro SD card
slot allowing for extra power and also
expandable storage over the amount
already built in in the name of
durability Samsung also put ip67
certification onto this phone meaning
that you'll have to make sure that that
back cover is secured for water and dust
resistance sensors throughout the phone
allow you to perform certain tasks with
this phone like making a pedometer move
across elements using air gestures or
even control your TV using a Smart
Remote application but the newest
additions and the hardware department
are definitely the heart rate monitor
and finger scanner now while the heart
rate monitor is able to give you a quick
snapshot of your health it's far from a
proper fitness companion and in the
finger scanner you'll be able to add a
layer of security to your phone so while
it is a nice addition it is far from a
game-changer and finally in battery life
I found the phone capable of handling
heavy usage for an easy 12 hour period
of time especially with power saving
features you'll be able to get through
over a day's worth of work and play with
this and then you can replace the
battery on the fly
if you need to the HTC One does not come
with a removable back but thankfully
there is a micro SD card slot found on
the right side next to the volume
rockers HTC put their own spin on the
sensor game actually making the phone
able to recognize when you bring the
phone up for usage and then register
touches or swipes to activate the phone
it's an elegant way of getting into the
phone without having to reach that power
button up top you are also able to
control your television and set-top
boxes with HTC one's own built-in remote
app now you might notice that I didn't
even mention the speaker of the galaxy
s5 the one unit found on the back of the
phone that provides a pretty
one-dimensional and very familiar sound
that's because it just pales in
comparison to the enhanced boomsound
speakers that get even louder than
before and provide a wider and
ultimately very pleasing soundstage
and finally in battery you'll find a
smaller 2600 milliamp hour unit in the
HTC one that is non removable but does
the job as far as getting you from
waking up to bed with no trouble at all
power saving features like HTC's own
version of the ultra power saving mode
are available as well
to help you out so really when it comes
to hardware the lines are starting to
get a little bit blurred between these
two devices we now have expandable
storage in one but we still have the
removable battery in the other as well
as ip67 certification but in the end
what you have here is a very good slew
of features in either phone that will
help you out depending on what style is
better for you HTC and Samsung go
head-to-head with their own versions and
philosophies of the camera experience
Samsung's new 16 megapixel ISO cell
camera hopes to use updated tech to make
picture taking better than ever the
result is a camera experience that
yields high quality vivid photos with
pretty good levels of detail in the app
samsung did away with the sheer amount
of modes and put in a couple key new
ones live HDR and selective focus while
live HDR is a good feature to have so
you can see how well HDR will enhance
your photo the selective focus requires
the taking of multiple pictures which
will then be processed together to give
you a customizable level of focus it
works well when executed properly which
definitely doesn't happen in every
instance unfortunately the camera app
allows you quite a bit of freedom to
tweak your smartphone camera experience
while bringing you a pretty consistent
level of quality to your pictures
HTC decided to keep the four ultra pixel
camera that was included in the original
but this time gave it a little friend
the dual camera is the obvious addition
and it allows for the capturing of depth
information in every shot that is taken
while it eliminates the amount of
processing time found in the galaxy s5
implementation it's just as much a hit
or miss situation as well plenty of
pictures will have an obvious area of
blur that the software just wasn't able
to correctly process making the line
between foreground and background fuzzy
to say the least
other modes include the zoe's which are
still pretty fun to use and are
available for anyone that wants to take
nice memories while taking this camera
out unfortunately there are limitations
to a low megapixel camera and it shows
when you zoom inside pretty much any
photo taking with the HTC One m8
as a level of grain is high in detail
can be rather low
not to mention pictures tended to be
washed out and lacked a dynamic range in
my testing it pretty much comes down to
this if you fancy yourself even a
somewhat serious photographer then the
sheer power and also the more consistent
performance of the ISO cell camera in
the Galaxy s5 is probably better for you
however the HTC One is also for those
people general users most likely that
just want to set it and forget it and
the picture that comes out will already
look pretty good and go straight onto
your social media networks and finally
we make it to software now this is an
interesting part of the comparison
because while one tries to always add to
the formula it seems that the other just
wants to continue optimizing what it
already has so which philosophy is
better we'll start with the Samsung
Galaxy s5 which you probably already
pegged as the first one
TouchWiz does add to the general
experience but that experience is
already pretty saturated with features
we already covered the heart rate
monitor and the finger scanner so let's
go to some new features the recent apps
screen is likely what you would expect
but that's why I like it a more classic
multitasking experience tucked into all
the other tools that Samsung makes
available a couple additions like the
toolbox or examples of these extra tools
and it is accessible from a newly
redesigned to power toggle that is the
same as the newly redesigned settings
screen both of which utilize circles
throughout now the biggest change is
probably the my magazine Samsung's
answer to blinkfeed essentially while it
does bring a colorful and neatly
presented news aggregation experience to
TouchWiz it's unfortunately not a very
robust system at all and piggy backs on
Flipboard which is itself powerful but
only pulls from a very limited list of
topics making it much weaker than the
program it tries to derive from and
after that TouchWiz is pretty much what
we remember
uber colorful though maybe not as
bloated as before with so many features
you may or may not use we do like the
optimization however as this is probably
the smoothest iteration of the UI yet
meanwhile in HTC's camp it's a matter of
building upon sense with sense 6 of
course that means some subtle changes
like adding colors to what was once a
very monochromatic interface though you
can always go back to that original look
if you wanted to blinkfeed has also been
changed a bit
opting for a perfect scroll
it's tiles as well as a much larger
library of sources to pull from
definitely much larger than the one
found in the my magazine after that
however it's a pretty familiar sense
experience that has been optimized and
thus provides a very smooth experience
one that we found very little to
complain about in terms of performance
in the end it comes down to a number of
different aspects those who really like
multitasking will enjoy the multi-window
the toolbox and even the newly added
recent apps screen in the Samsung Galaxy
s5 but those who are looking for maybe
just a little bit more style and a
little bit more simplicity can look to
the HTC One especially for it's much
better implemented second screen
experience found in blinkfeed so it
really comes down to the fact that you
users out there really need to know what
it is exactly that you want out of your
smartphone experience the Samsung Galaxy
s5 and the HTC One m8 will be available
on all the major carriers in the States
for the premium price on two-year
contracts normally around $1.99 and so
there you have it the samsung galaxy s5
and the HTC One m8 there's no doubt to
that both of these phones appeal to very
specific users and what it is that you
will really want will dictate which
phone is better for you do you want an
eye-catching phone well the HTC One will
probably have the better you factor do
you want a powerful camera experience
well then in that case the ISO cell
camera is a proper upgrade in the optics
department if you're a multitasker
then Samsung and its large bag of tricks
are ready for you if you want
performance and the ability to fly
through your tasks well either phone
will work very well though I will give
the HTC One the nod for a better media
experience due to its far and away
speaker experience what kind of category
do you fall in and how is it going to
