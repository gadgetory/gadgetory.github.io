in barcelona and Mobile World Congress
were just sending outside of Asus nice
little booth they've had critical fufill
today and they have not allowed us to
enter the booth where we will get inside
either way I was able to snap one of
these away from one of the public
relations people out of France so this
is actually a European specific model so
it doesn't actually have the rear
3-megapixel but everything else is the
same what we're looking at here is an
intel-powered 1.2 gigahertz is to z2420
great obviously by Intel the performance
seems to be quite robust on the rear
here we have a micro USB and a headphone
jack it has a really nice sort of
aluminium brushed aluminum finish and on
the top here what we're looking at
actually I can get it off as you will
see is that has dedica neck tivity now
this is basically the nexus 7 or the
memo pad as some of you might be
familiar with the 370 that we saw not
Lassie s with the CES before that never
got released has a micro-sim and microSD
and obviously all the various other
components that make it tick and worm so
for all intents and purposes it is the
same form factor as the nexus 7 now the
performance needs to be really quite
good even though it is powered by Intel
and has clocked at a much lower
frequency we had a problem running tempo
run on the front we're looking at one
point to make a pixel camera as well now
we've been told internationally that
we're going to be looking at around an
April release date that's what Johnny
Shea the CEO of ASA said the PR person
of the France hasn't been able to
confirm that they have doubts so it's
likely that it will go on sale later no
word on North American release yet but
you will be able to buy it
internationally and it will work with
hspa+ radios so for those of you that
like straight talk or ATT even t-mobile
it will be able to work but what makes
it interesting obviously is that it
represents asus is first form factor of
this size that is powered by Intel
alright so this is just the foam pad
we're here at Barcelona for Mobile World
Congress just outside s is booth my name
is Darcy la cuvee we're here with
Android 30 let us know what you think of
this guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
