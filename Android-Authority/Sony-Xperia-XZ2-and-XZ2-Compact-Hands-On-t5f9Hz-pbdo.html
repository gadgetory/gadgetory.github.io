authority and we're here at MWC 2018
taking a look at Sony's latest flagships
the Xperia XE 2 + XE 2 compact these are
the successors to the XE 1 and XC 1
compact and bring about some of the
biggest changes we've seen from the
company starting with the Xperia XE - it
still has a lot of the core elements of
a Sony design but there's some pretty
significant differences from previous
Sony phones that make this feel
refreshing and new it's much more curvy
and rounded which gives the design a lot
more style but also makes it more
ergonomic at the same time it's
fortified by a metal frame with Gorilla
Glass 5 on the front and back you'll
also notice that it's extremely
reflective Sony calls it ambient flow
because it's meant to look like water
and sort of blend in with whatever it's
surrounded by it's most likely going to
be a fingerprint magnet but I like the
direction Sony is headed in the only
thing I'm not a fan of is how thick the
phone looks and feels and despite how
thick it is sony decided to get rid of
the headphone jack this year sony is
adopting an 18 by 9 screen with small
bezels so the phone is much narrower and
you're getting a pretty large 5.7 inch
display it's still tending to P like
previous Sony flagships but the big
selling point here is its HDR
capabilities
it supports HDR 10 and is fully
supported by Netflix and Amazon or HDR
content and the screen is also capable
of upscaling standard videos to HDR to
complement the viewing experience you've
got dual front-facing stereo speakers
which we've seen from Sony before but
sony is promising that these are 20%
louder than the XZ one so they should
sound a lot better there's also a new
dynamic vibration system which is pretty
unique and the best way I can describe
this is it's like dual shock for your
phone the phone will vibrate to the
beats of a song or during certain parts
of a movie or video games like where the
action might get a little intense the
fingerprint sensor will finally work now
if you're in the US and Sony has
repositioned it to the back and I'm
usually a fan of rear-facing fingerprint
sensors but this one felt a little too
low and not as comfortable as other
phones with rear fingerprint sensors as
far as the rest of the hardware the xe2
is one of the first
flagships of 2018 to rock these
snapdragon 845 processor along with four
gigabytes of RAM it also has a thirty
180 milliamp hour battery inside with
support for qi wireless charging on the
backside is a 19 megapixel camera with
all the same capabilities as the
previous XE one like the 3d creator and
960 fps super slow-motion but now you
can record at 1080p whereas before you
were capped at 720 the xe2 will also be
the very first smartphone to record 4k
HDR video so not only are your videos
going to look incredibly sharp but
they're going to have much more color
and contrast and because the phone
screen natively supports HDR you'll be
able to enjoy the videos you record
right on your phone software of course
is android oreo out of the box and
there's no real surprises here it's your
typical stock like sony software that
we've seen on many Sony devices in
recent years now if you like what the XD
2 offers but one in a smaller size you
have the XE to compact and it makes very
few compromises it pretty much has
everything from the standard XE 2 but
it's in a plastic body doesn't have
wireless charging or the dynamic
vibration system but everything else
like the processor camera and software
is exactly the same obviously the screen
is going to be smaller but unlike
previous compact phones where the screen
was 720p the XE to compact will be the
first phone in the compact line that
keeps the same 1080p resolution you can
expect the Xperia XE 2 + XE to compact a
ship in late spring and come to the US
as an unlocked phone for more on the XE
2 and XE to compact check out our
website at Android 30.com and keep it
tuned here for more MWC 2018 coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
