the ground and we're looking at actually
a rather controversial piece of hardware
what we're looking at here is the ZTE
grand memo or memo depending on how
you'd like to pronounce it now initial
reports it indicated and some spokes for
people here they had told us that this
was packing the snapdragon 800 processor
processor that's supposed to be
extremely powerful that we haven't had a
chance to see yet but it turned out that
that wasn't the case then we were told
it was the 602 note that was in the case
the guys over at Android please who we
have a lot of respect for were able to
do some digging and some benchmarks and
found out that the specs were actually
only of the Snapdragon s4 pro and even
though it's stated that it had two gigs
of ram it only has one gig of ram so
they've updated everything now but it's
still a pretty impressive piece of
hardware excuse me packing a 5.7 inch
1280 p receiving 1280 by 720 display it
also on the rear has a 13-megapixel
camera it tends to kind of pop out a
little bit a headphone jack now there's
really no medal on this actually just a
sort of samsung cell plastic design and
for those of you that like big phones
etsy actually makes pretty decent
hardware thing is though is that at five
point seven inches is really really
large you'll see actually even bigger
than the Galaxy Note 2 so this is going
to be a device that is going to require
a 200 operation pretty much at all times
the performance isn't too too bad it
tends to lag a little bit here in their
app drawer but probably going to go on
the market here by middle of April and
it's gonna have a really aggressive
price point probably around seven five
hundred dollars anyway guys so this is
the grand memo from ZTE my name is Darcy
lack of a here we're with android
authority reporting live from Mobile
