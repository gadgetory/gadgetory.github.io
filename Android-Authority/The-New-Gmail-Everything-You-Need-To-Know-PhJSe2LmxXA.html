hindi the android authority app guy and
gmail has a fairly significant redesign
coming down the pipes right now and you
can check it out early here's everything
you need to know about the new Gmail
okay so let's start with how you can get
this new look for yourself in the top
right corner of the Gmail page there is
a good old fashioned gear icon click
that and then click the try new Gmail
option and win the page reloads you will
have the new Gmail look it's easy peasy
the new Gmail definitely looks more
attractive but the layout doesn't
actually change all that much you still
have the tabs across the top various
email categories on the left margin and
Google Hangouts integration in the
bottom left corner for the main page at
least everything is basically identical
to what it was before switching to the
new Gmail even keeps the same theme you
had before along with the same
advertisements the new compose button
also looks quite nice anyway the basic
navigation and layout are the same
compared to the old Gmail they just look
a lot nicer more colorful and more
modern you shouldn't have any problems
learning the new setup there are some
new elements to the main page the right
side of the screen now houses icons for
the new Gmail add-ons by default I had
Google keep Calendar and Google Tasks
there but there is an ad button where
you can add additional stuff like a
sauna Trello and a bunch of others
adding these add-ons through the website
as the icons to the right side for easy
access clicking any of these icons opens
a right margin with functionality
relative to the icon that you pressed
thus if you want to check your calendar
while typing an email you just hit the
calendar icon on the right side and you
can without switching tabs or anything
like that
there aren't a ton of add-ons just yet
but we imagine the selection will
improve over time we'll talk about one
final piece of the new looks in this
segment and they are these subject lines
in the default view attachments now show
up as big colorful icons below the
subject line complete with an icon and
part of the attachment name the icons
change based on what kind of file it is
you can click on open and download
attachments without actually opening the
email thus adding a bit of bergen AMA
goodness to the proceedings those who
don't like this can click the gear icon
and change the display density from
default to comfortable or compact and
that removes this functionality and
makes it look like the old Gmail along
with the new look came some new features
as well we've already talked about the
new add-ons in the right margin as well
as the new attachments thing in the
looks section so we won't talk about
them again here the first and probably
best change is the inclusion of quick
controls whenever you hover over a
subject line with your mouse four icons
will pop up on the right side those
buttons let you delete archive or snooze
emails and you can mark them as unread
this is vastly faster and not available
in the old Gmail while we're on the
topic snooze is a new feature as well
that lets you stash emails away until a
later time it works almost exactly like
the snooze button on an alarm clock or
most to-do list apps
it'll just notify you of the email later
on in the day when you might be able to
finally give it a look the mouse-over
feature also works with contacts when
you mouse over a contact it'll show
their information along with some action
buttons that let you quickly send an
email schedule something on your
calendar or get a hold of them on Google
Hangouts interesting that Google still
cares about hangouts in 2018 but it is
what it is don't worry Headley's email
is uncensored on purpose and yes I did
ask him first the last new feature is
the inclusion of better security
notifications Gmail does a much better
job of getting your attention when it
Flags something as being potentially
dangerous this includes a massive red
box that lets you know what a message
seems dangerous to Gmail you can't
possibly miss it and good on Google for
adding more security stuff okay so the
current gmail beta or whatever it is
isn't 100% complete yet and there are
some additional features coming down the
pipeline ostensibly before it actually
launches to the public in full the first
feature we'll talk about is called
nudging Gmail will start bugging you
about emails that you haven't responded
to after a period of time thankfully it
doesn't appear as though Gmail is gonna
be really annoying with it it'll likely
just be a small notification somewhere
on the subject line to remind you that
you haven't yet responded to that
particular message then there is the
confidential mode that you probably
heard about when you saw all of those
headlines about self-destructing emails
in Gmail confidential mode lets you send
emails with an expiration date and of
course the email will delete itself
after it reaches said expiration date it
also includes
with passcodes where Gmail automatically
sends SMS messages with the passcode to
the recipient we would love to show you
more but it is a feature still in
development so all I could find were
some screenshots the mode also includes
the ability to remove the right to do
some things for instance you can send an
email and remove the recipients right to
forward the email or even print it of
course a simple screen shot gets around
all that but at least Gmail is trying
finally Gmail plans to change how it
does email subscriptions and
notifications the new Gmail a I will
eventually occasionally recommend that
you drop an email subscription when it
thinks you aren't interested anymore
meanwhile high priority notifications
will alert you to emails less often
focusing on the ones it thinks are
important that one isn't really
necessarily new but it'll be slightly
different inside of Gmail oh and there
are plans to improve offline support as
well including the ability to write
respond to delete and archive up to 90
days of messages now it's important to
know that this is all new stuff we have
seen some comments and complaints about
some features being a little buggy such
as the snooze mode I didn't run into any
of those problems during my testing but
it is something to be aware of of course
you can always go back to the normal
Gmail at any time by clicking the gear
icon and choosing the option to go back
to the classic Gmail if you need to
otherwise what we have here is your
basic overhaul you have a few modern
features dotting a much nicer looking
landscape we'll also be paying attention
to the new Gmail add-on feature because
that should get pretty powerful over
time as always you can tell us what you
think in the comments below or let us
know if we missed anything also for
those who are worried Google did
expressly state that no big changes were
coming to the inbox by Gmail service
anytime soon aside from making them
iPhone 10 compatible and that about does
it for this one folks if you want to
learn more we do have the written
version linked up in the video
description below if you liked this
video you know what to do and if you
didn't well you still know what to do as
always thanks for watching everybody and
have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
