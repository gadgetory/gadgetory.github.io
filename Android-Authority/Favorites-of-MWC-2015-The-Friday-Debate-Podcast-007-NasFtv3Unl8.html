Friday debate podcast by android
authority discussing topics in android
every single week I'm of course your
host for the ftp Joshua Vergara from
android authority what's going on
everybody and we have another Monday
release for the Friday debate sorry
about that we did have late releases for
this and the previous podcast and I
apologize for that but that's just how
busy Mobile World Congress was in
barcelona spain this year we had last
week me trying to get the editing done
while covering some of the biggest
products that we had at the show and
then this past weekend all of us all
five of us in total who worked mwc we're
traveling back to our respective homes
after finishing the show we of course
were able to cover a lot of great
products at mwc and that is exactly what
the topic of this particular podcast is
I just want to give a quick shout out to
the five total people who we had at mwc
including myself we had Bogdan who is
one of our lead editors and he did a
great job at the helm making sure that
we had some great articles for you at
android authority calm we had a sh who
made the great history of nexus video
and we got to meet him for the first
time and see him at work it was a
wonderful to have him as a presence
there and he was able to get some
wonderful shots of not just the products
but of ourselves we were able to get
some nice b-roll from him for a real
that is upcoming then of course we have
lon who was able to split the work with
me and thus will we allow each other to
relax a little bit at what was a pretty
busy trade show and then finally we have
Darcy our editor-in-chief and co-founder
of android authority those last two lon
and Darcy are our guests for this friday
debate podcast as we crowded around the
microphone in the apartment that we
stayed at and i thought it was a nice
way to commemorate the place we stayed
at because well we rarely ever get to
stay at the same place twice when it
comes to these trade shows but we talked
about our favorite things let's say from
mwc and we also talked a little bit
about our lives you don't get to hear
from Darcy too often so it's nice to
hear how he feels about let's say video
games on how he doesn't really get them
right now our conversation gets off the
rails a couple of times but either way
we are able to talk about our favorite
things from the Mobile World Congress
2015 in barcelona spain and hope you get
to enjoy
I just want to get some housekeeping

going to jump into this the seventh
episode of the Friday debate podcast our
post Mobile World Congress conversation
with lon when and Darcy la cuvee
it's all good so Darcy's never been on a
podcast before it's really just talking
but obviously you know it's so much
matter yeah you know it's just a piece
of content to look so you have to think
about like you know what you're saying
obviously so before you talk no it's
gonna be a difference to it yeah exactly
yeah but it's nice you know when like
we're in such a good place yeah so in
our in our apartment and just yeah yeah
there's ladies recording that I would
imagine yeah I did yeah so you're gonna
mmm we're rolling yeah we're robbing my
thoughts s is how it is sounded more
mature yeah roll the punch yeah you got
wrong with it okay I'll be natural ality
really change the course of what's on my
mind AC it's like that's why I don't
like doing the candied rose anymore
that's exactly what i was saying cuz
then i spent about like a minute and a
half just saying all of the logistics
and all of the housekeeping and all
that's cool i mean are you i personally
you know the person who's been doing
this for last four years yeah you know
you always try and find things that are
going to get you excited ya doin rub the
scale out of honda there except trying
to get on door honda conquer the Hidatsa
nada i was talking to a runner reminder
please last night to dinner and you say
that they're sending him a honda center
for week to review nice house he meant
date Rob and I was like thank you for
your b roll unlike CNBC's dude yeah you
did ask thankfully it was yeah yeah I
didn't see it from the auto yeah from
our yeah Boni you bb double-team done I
was on national commission
I loved that baby that's one of my
favorite yeah we shot so clear it was so
cool never thought that was the one that
proved them I my new lens was really
good for interviews looks like speeding
but yeah you're b-roll shots on our yeah
also we had like three four angles going
yeah you're holding that one camera the
tripod and then I had the tripod back
there yeah this looked really dynamic
yeah exactly yeah that's why I was so
good to have like a share yeah you know
like regard sad she's probably like he
said he did not in the air anymore is he
he's probably back home by now oh he's
always going back to London yeah he gets
home by like nine o'clock nine o'clock
so Tessa oh yeah you see the area no
then yes I think London's time is a
haunting powder I just back one or two
hours yeah yeah maybe look 12 hours but
I'm terrible at geography so I always
has a search like the never on the
bottom like a marina well I was trying
to tell him like over new parents like
went to watch the live stream that was
just on like how it like an hour ago and
I had to google what time is it in
California when it's a p.m. in Barcelona
or something yeah this really great
website for that time be it allows you
to be as like a flexible meter and yes I
didn't even look at the google now Carla
so I should have done because I didn't
really happen but yeah oh I mean you
know it's just been a long day and I'm
happy that you on you got done you got
to kick it today and let go places I got
a lot of souvenirs and stuff yeah just
one for me and then mail queue for my
friends but I mean it's what you got
different from what you got for no one
else i got myself that hat oh there you
go there i'm taking it isn't gonna walk
around Kansas City like that's right
yeah you're one of a kind
I wore for a little bit like when we're
at catalunya but I was like man I don't
want to look like Torres the way you got
a little yeah I guess when you look
around you don't really see people
wearing stuff like that huh you know no
no nothing people from barcelona where
barcelona like sorry they don't look
please just be happy nobody reps their
own City okay then what I see people
weren't in California stuff in
California toys remember in Hong Kong we
went to california burger and it was
like an exact replica what they call
didn't know yeah exactly but the thing
is cali burger they do the one thing in
and out won't do and that's put bacon in
their burgers that's the only thing
that's missing it's so bad you ever been
to shake shack I love it there's one in
vegas now I mean all these case studies
are going out all the time you know but
why it's so much better and once it has
nothing to do with phones you know by
the spine I just been reading all about
it and i watch all these videos and it
looks epic and they have a secret menu
like in a note so Oh shake shake it's
great man hey what next every see yes we
should go there because i'm a new york
new york on man so i know i haven't
tried it yet yeah but this only it's
literally only in New York huh it's a
huge phenomena yeah seems a little price
here yeah exactly well yeah we're hoping
we're gonna get a nice bite to eat a
little bit later I believe oh yeah
Barcelona is really great for all the
food and everything but it's it can be
kind of tough to figure out where to go
because barcelona barcelona people is on
a bad people in barcelona don't like
Yelp or they don't do a lot of that
stuff I went to place from the first
night with my father and I was like
they'll take us somewhere nice and then
you know my dad was like why don't
attack see februari he would take his
wife and so he ended up taking us like
his favorite restaurant and they had
this menu then they just kept bringing
the seafood lobster and you know I mean
and this amounts to seafood and I know
you don't like crustaceans and stuff you
have to like music jackhammer open
safety stuff i like them but i don't
like working for them the one
exactly like when we were at a la prada
that day yesterday yeah I put the crimes
in front of you did like you're like no
no I don't want out no crap I mean
everything that we had was perfect cuz
yeah just yeah big thing is tuna gonna
say yeah but the lemon and yes always
read SMS and then something go Nicole
god bless her for mobile give she she
she was the one who basically picked
everything out yeah there she saw
everything she like razor clam yes oh
she's at one great tasting food I mean
she listened Taiwan yeah and they have
crazy good culinary scene there in
Taipei totally we've we've been very
blessed to be able to hang out with them
a lot during the show honestly like
that's that's the experience that I'm
always looking forward to having with
like you as anybody else that's around
you know it's like these be friends that
have friends in the industry because
it's so much fun to have them around it
is being every year you know I mean you
gotta be friends yeah and honestly
frankly like the work we do is so highly
specialized mm-hmm Nicole always reached
out to me looks like some complex thing
I mean in the beginning you know when
things got started I would always reach
out to them and they helped me so so
much you know they are like I've told
you already Nicole and Sasha are my
oldest friends in there yeah they really
are I guess we would have met first time
you want to met them first event was he
admitted we met at CES but we didn't we
didn't really connect until mwc yeah but
when I really when I really got to know
sasha was at i/o google i/o yeah he just
came up to me and he complimented me on
my ass for review and never started
talking about it so yeah that was a oh
man that was such a good time but yeah
we got to hang out with him a lot and
they obviously we all get to see all the
same stuff at the show so I once got
their own opinions about I know he's
drunk and I'm so late I got one year in
right now so don't worry i'll let you
know he's too bad what's not it's not
gonna be that don't what Sam it
show a sound board yeah all right I
separate note that just reminded me of
something so here I mean I love the s4
compared to the s5 but yeah but I didn't
know and I don't think a lot of people
know is that the product team that
designed the s6 was the same product
team that worked in the s4 I mean so
much done as he had the s5 team mm-hmm
he's working on the s7 and so what they
do is they kind of also in a kind of
populate talent but they move it around
a little bit but my point is that
there's such a long lead up you know
cycle yeah it takes so long to
manufacture and design these devices
that you know I just don't think a lot I
didn't know that yeah for example did
you I mean no I didn't know that about
it kind of makes sense though it's not
the same group of people every time
orest it's there's a core group and then
they just kind of switching yeah like
ammonia primary core group that's like
having so many different final fantasies
yeah it makes me think of call of duty
because there's like two separate
companies that may call of duty games
yeah so that affects what was the name
sorry what was the original modern
warfare was like treyarch yeah yeah it
was a little grating than one one strike
left then it just turned into what it
was we talked we didn't screw me yeah
but sure because like I would love to
have the time you know like PC hardware
when I was growing up 9 14 15 I started
in really exciting like even before you
guys time I got a 3d effects card um it
was a big deal because its first three
to accelerate GPU that's kind of what
beyond my passion with technology yeah
totally it was a really big deal you
know but video games the last thing we
got chance to play than I mean if they
were so more so you know I remember they
had finally designed to mention i think
was about it was battlefield bad company
they designed an engine that you could
actually don't blow up environments you
could build buildings with like a rocket
launcher those the first time but i know
that was like man six years ago XXX
years ago that's a long time six appeal
right but like what what is gaming like
now gaming like it so there's there's
there's this weird disconnect from what
used to be just all about creating an
experience that everybody would love and
then all of these artistic laid so i was
all about this artistic movement like
the order 1886 that just recently came
out it's not a great gameplay experience
but yeah but it's a great cinematic
experience it's like a moving movie like
it's an interactive movie but that's
their ones like that and then you have
erations like Call of Duty battlefield
Madden and yeah Finn isn't like 2018
yeah yeah so there's this disconnect now
from it because all video games used to
be like everyone had like this this
passion and this this drive to go in a
certain direction but now everyone has
the freedom to go wherever they want so
Danielle I mean but the velocity they
are very awesome because of the
technology that we have butter stove
pitfalls because sometimes the people
who create the video games they don't
realize they don't realize that they
were too maybe they do obviously they do
hmm but not everybody is going to like
every video game now yeah not the way
that we have nostalgia like stale
talking about you know Super Mario gt3 I
a nightmarish andreas yeah big deal yeah
for me my command you know I know your
old school tell they have modern Megaman
sir no I was like you could do so much
cool Capcom zillion capcom's doing
terrible things to megaman they don't do
it very often scam yeah kept my
stomach's oh yeah does that c sega right
we're talking to a girl like you know
there used to be abdominal hardware
company you know before we did the
interview with imagination the GPU was
in the dreamcast and i don't know if you
guys remember the dreamcast but it was
wrong oh yeah it was like right after
there was a big device after the SNES
her and no no it was around the time of
the ps1 oh yeah and they just got
destroyed by the PS wow yeah cuz it was
generation it was sort of yeah behind in
terms of hardware and yeah the graphics
weren't as good or whatever yeah there
was there despotism pitfalls or that and
you got a ps4 and you have like this e3
and z3 compact in the tablet yeah what's
it like gaming on it's pretty cool but
there's a bit of latency depending on
here enough so that you shouldn't be
playing things like Call of Duty because
you won't you will not be successful
yeah but things like a dragon age or
like a long-form story driven game yeah
yeah that would be a lot better yeah so
I don't know how to realize those
imagination and dreamcast yeah Madison
Dreamcast yeah maybe you have that
interview was just like I i I'm kind of
binge played games i like those uh tower
defense games because it makes me feel
like god
I'm just like you get to the point where
like there's so many things coming but
you're like oh like you keep building
back to the fat and then like the big do
so come along there like indestructible
yeah you lose cuz you're conceding book
like I guess sometimes yeah totally
don't know whole and getting presents
here at a hearing GDC happen the same
time as mwc yeah i'm like i was talking
to arm and their dual presence is going
on and I'd love to go to see that would
be like a treat and a half yeah see the
future gave me you see all those new
trailers in and they do a big um
unfortunately you know we can't clone
ourselves question what had their winter
clothes yeah but we see we see so much
about like putting ourselves and
somewhere somewhere different you know
like those those weird um trolley or
what is it like does the when it was a
term like it's a tablet on top of it
Segway oh yeah I don't know yours
everybody yeah yeah ah I don't know but
they do a like location independent
video conferencing yeah who knows maybe
they'll be the future Wow yeah there was
one on Kickstarter it was
android-powered and it was a robot that
had video conferencing capabilities it
was on wheels and it also had an arm
that you could articulate from your
phone and it was a quick spin went crazy
viral I don't really know or remember
the name for snack and look it up right
now yeah but uh yeah I mean it just
thought it was super cool anyway when I
assignment you're fine on the noise your
answer I'm your the gardasil podcast
coverage is crappy attention the rules I
well you know it's it's it's really nice
to see like where things are going at
the very least after doing this for a
little while now I mean it's good to
come to thing like mwc and see that you
still see progress happening you still
are excited for what's coming up because
sometimes it wouldn't really you might
you might not you might not have that
connection with what's happening I mean
blue on you and I we we've had our hands
on so many phones by this point yeah
it's something it's kind of crazy and
then it almost kind of like you see
these things and you almost feel a
little desensitized by it all cuz i
divert you see them and I don't know you
kind of expect your mind just be blown
but that that I've all it's just like
yours like
it was cool few buddies ask you what
phone nearby um yeah sometimes like my
roommate right now is he's been debating
like real hard about what to get he's
like should I wait or should I get the
nexus 6 or whatever and you actually
watched like you're like Nexus 6 vs
iphone 6 video cuz he's been debating
between those two phones and I'm like
the thing is I don't I don't make I
don't make a statement of you should
just buy yeah yeah so he probably was
like why did he and then I tell him I'm
like well I mean I don't want to tell
you what phone to get cuz I like you
ultimately have to make that decision
exactly like he loves the Android he's
always been an Android user but I told
him if if you can deal with the size of
the Nexus 6 then go to Nexus 6 if you
can put up with it I don't want to tell
him one way or another yeah that's
that's a good heart that's a good line
to to toe honestly yeah I think but you
know and good so now we were able to get
into the meat of the thing like um what
would you I'll frame it this way someone
asks you what phone of mwc to get what
would you what would you tell them but
basically it's me asking you what your
favorite thing here well wonder what was
your favorite mwc thing here man I mean
I i guess i have to go to the edge I
really like the Essex Angela Stockholm
is off yeah it is i agree yeah yeah it's
hard to pick between the two but I mean
I was really excited for the s6 in
general like before we got here because
I felt like Samsung really had a good a
good thing on their hands like they're
really gonna hit out the park and I
think they did even though you know like
a lot of people are feeling indifferent
or whatever about it because of all the
changes but going to lack thereof yeah
what it used to be like the wrong yea
it's going on rectangle
design was a slab within the limited
space yeah only you can only do so much
with what you have I think they hit it
out of the park yeah yeah tell me about
that well I mean you know as a
technology enthusiast you know I've
never really been to into software and I
know software is the magic that makes it
all work but like I follow the supply
line and research like I was reading
about the air for a mobile devices like
back in 2011 2010 because of course we
have data or five you know our GPUs and
our computers and everything but they
were not unable to kind of hit that
right power envelope but you know the
benchmark Eastern come out and it's more
than a two times to increase performance
/ gr three and it's the world's first
device and that's just one first second
first 40 nanometer has to see from a
casinos I mean they be Apple no apples
really kind of I wouldn't say in trouble
are you thinking in benchmark scores is
that what you're saying or no just in
terms of memory throw put on the memory
um it's just twice as much data and it
uses less power per bit so exactly you
know but the 40 nanometers to see like
Samson was supposed to do that same size
of soc for Apple for their a 9 but they
chose to actually keep it for themselves
and that's why apple's investing
billions of Allah Israel right now it's
the building their own boundary there
for the next so she lives with
imagination as well um oh yeah because
they do parody are exactly how they've
used as always you know for so so long
the camera is really interesting because
I know they spent billions on my advice
or so but that's what I'm saying like um
well is it possible that we have an iso
solve camera but with neither side yeah
right the dirt just not saying they make
a sixfold front-facing camera that's
gonna hit the market soon but Samson is
only your kind of like in the big battle
you know this one is phonies few
profitable arms is their image sensor
division we add they just can't do is
with I so so so mmm not general that
Jesus only sensor for it and I'm sure
it's gonna be awesome and like 0.7
seconds you know it's really fast
samsung knows our cameras anyway so yeah
and that's what that's what happened to
me the last couple days my one plus one
died while we were trying to figure our
way back here to this house and so yeah
I I had a bunch of phones on my in my
bag and I just was like okay I'll just
swap the sim out and I started using the
the Galaxy Note 4 and oh my goodness you
know right you often forget being who we
are how awesome certain phones are until
you come back to it one day like I still
I'm holding it right now I love the way
this feels it's a great executive look
no bamboo but whatever I didn't even get
a bamboo back I'm sure yeah I got
aftermarket stuff for that exactly i
just go out to Hong Kong or something
find it and that's actually really good
segue into a big point contention you
know which is you know one of the
critical features that people loved
about Samsung devices is my crusty and
then automatically got a lot of emails
from a lot of people about you know you
got to talk to Samson and make sure they
don't butcher the note by if they bring
over what they did it is it's up to
darcy come a bat phone you know no I
mean but what do you think are they
gonna bring over the design changes that
they did with us 62 the nose no I don't
actually I don't think they couldn't
lead a was saying if they did I think
they'll find a way to merge the two
because yeah we were making this point
before that the the note line is the
flagship line yeah yeah and the S line
is like the experimental line in a way
you know they change it up I call me see
the f6 now feels like a well thought out
fully put together phone but features
that people really want always end up on
the notes the notes of the 10 that all
the phones to be usually yeah yeah yeah
I just I don't know I kind of thought I
was thinking they might do the same
thing with the note line just because I
feel like if they don't there's going to
be an inconsistency in design like
there's you have this phone that's
unibody and then you have this phone
that's not unibody group revocable back
SD card slot whatever I just feel like
it's it's not you know cuz like usually
OEM is like to make their design
consistent across all devices and I feel
like they're gonna lose that consistency
if they if they don't do that with the
nose such a huge company with so many
limes though at this point you know cuz
after after this came out and then
people were like Lester had a lackluster
response to the s5 office of the Alpha
came out yeah they really saturated
freaking out the exact mass defection
has occurred which exam sound odd SCA
which is you know for those that don't
know they have the primary brain trust
in the states in Texas like a lot of
companies you know I'm you're walking
were there ZTE are there a lot of arm
operations are there and you know they
moved everyone up to New Jersey but kind
of the gossip from the sparkle industry
is that they sent over the whole
executive team to do an audit on samsung
in the States because they were unsure
why things were going so successfully
and they credited you know the success
of the galaxy franchise due to the
efforts of the US team and so there was
a lot of mistrust and you know a lot of
kind of thumb you know Harvard Business
Journal's and others who you know they
deal with operational an organizational
behavior they study kind of Korean
companies and its really tough to work
for Korean company they're only kind of
promote creams and this kind of that a
little bit of xenophobic I wouldn't say
racism but like kind of distrust you
know and so but a lot of good people you
know who work in this industry obviously
worked for Samson but there's been a lot
of change yeah you know that we've seen
in terms of people moving to different
companies and like when we were in China
remember Josh from Walley yeah exactly
saw that he was a veteran designer
that's all for so well yes IM since my
that's my voice Christ that was the
first time I ever ever ever like
witnessed at first hand was that like I
guess I don't want to say defection yeah
is the negative cost Robert you're like
leaving the matter me know maybe you're
a traitor well I mean I'm sure the
people at the original company view it
that way maybe yeah but to see someone
see the shuffling of people from one
place to the other and it's kind of odd
to see people want to be happy no they
want to being able to grow and I mean
let's look at the rise and fall of
giants like Nokia and we're like
blackberry you know you're only argue
argue people gonna argue I bet Nokia's
not really like falling I suppose it's
done they're just microsoft they're like
micro nokia saw
yeah Michael kia nice to have a two-door
car so the yeah it's interesting to see
that but you know somehow they've
they've nailed the design I'm talking
about the s6 we'll get to that later
obviously but so the edge really is your
favorite one yeah I like that it's a
little bit different it's not you know
how but how useful is it really gonna be
to you I don't I don't I don't think
it'd be useful at all there you go i
just i just like the curved edges cuz it
makes the swiping really seamless and it
just it's a different design like you
know every every foam basically all
looks the same but I don't know the edge
kind of adds a little bit of flair to it
and I don't know I kind of like it as a
design aesthetic is the people he's
spoken the demand is higher for in terms
of you two beautifully scientific the
people want the people are curious is
where do you member the note edge first
impressions you did they had 1.8 million
in like a month yeah a vastly exceeded
yeah i mean because biggest worry it's
okay just just point this out there no
on that this isn't a race between me and
lon it's a rihanna this is no racism
okay to that point we're neck and neck
i'm just saying but the curiosity I can
go ms guarantee you that the number of
people who looked at the edge videos did
not buy the edge yeah yeah that didn't
repeal them right exactly and while it
may be different for this s6 edge which
is the worst name because it's hard to
say without yes I do that success yeah
um thanks mister it's it's um they're
gonna be more people who buy it but you
know it's are still a lot of curiosity
behind it and i agree with you they
nailed the edges yeah that's obvious
they nailed the two sides in terms of
making it a AAA an attractive device
that still doesn't feel like a weird
thing to hold yet but no edge was that
was just weird but I I would rather I
say this all the time I would rather pay
for the features i'm going to use rather
than the features i want and that's why
I up until this point I have never
actually bought a samsung phone I've
never actually thought I would
but the yet but for me the s6 I'd buy
that thing man yeah I mean I I haven't
bought a samsung phone since the s2
because I loved s2 and I I still think
that the st was Sam Sam one of Samsung's
biggest phones neo this day and you know
every the s3 s4 s5 lost my attention and
yeah with the s6 and s6 edge that's how
they see over there right yeah they've
pulled me back in and I'm interested now
so I don't know like I just like I just
think the s6 edge is just a more unique
product and that's that's kind of what i
want i want something a little bit
different i don't want something that
feels the same it's such a funny
conversation to have just to say all
those edges look so cool now like what
do they do in your life who cares yeah
reassures me all right you watch the
orange thing go yeah you audio you watch
the older the the LED import tuner car
thing is on the bottom and the thing
that you know like I kind of like it you
know I I don't think Samsung would have
done this essex edge if they didn't
think it was going to succeed yeah
because the no he explained the note
edge I was just yeah the no image was
definitely an experiment okay but I
think if the note edge didn't do all
that well they wouldn't have done an s6
edge so I think I saw my curiosity in
the iterator okay yeah evolution not
revolution yeah that's a good way buddy
like I like that yet I could have been
saving that for a lot about a plane
right over like a week ago grandma
haikus man
but I will do something that I came
thinking about the edge is that it's
just gonna become a ticker a ticker tape
yeah it's gonna become a ticker tape
measures for advertisements yeah and I'm
saying I really did get a subsidized
phone man that's that yeah I mean look
at Google right i mean people i'm insane
tea with people use internet like if
something's free you're the product yeah
and always says nothing to do with
hardware but you know you look at models
like johnny and stuff like that you know
they're not making any money so 45
billion dollar company same with one
plus they're making know they're making
like five six dollars per unit you know
which is nothing it's not enough to
sustain your business so they were
talking last night at the dinner with
swiftkey that you know they were very
content you know invited for lovely
dinner they were talking about the
keyboard and there are the most
successful keyboard that's never paid
for installs or anything and they're
used by millions if not hundreds of
millions of people on a daily basis but
one place made the decision to push up
swiftkey on an OTA and it earned the ire
of like the most evangelist users to
like why you forced me to use a
particular keyboard and i don't know if
there's so it replaces of it it is a
soft keyboard yeah yeah they've made a
built-in yeah um and it would I you know
it's just software and information in
people like it's kind of it's a gray
area you know like the legal frameworks
aren't there yet and you know there's a
lot of you know like you go to a website
there's like for some of the more
advanced websites that crunch or
anything for mail box like they have 50
60 trackers on women they sell that data
back so hardware companies you know as
things become further commodified are
gonna have to do things like this you
know with data and it's a gray area yeah
anyway but does mean what what it does
yeah but wouldn't the yeah but doesn't
that make sense then that the edge one
day might just become a place of
advertiser yeah man that's where that's
do think when you turn on a game oh god
this is a nightmare scenario you turn on
a game and while you're playing it
because the edges away from your face it
da a perpetual ad
you know that you can hit X on but then
I'll keep appearing there in the ticker
tape that's what I keep thinking yeah so
it's terrifying you know there's already
there's already a case that makes me not
believe in the edge and that's when
you're trying to use the camera now I
got a lot of shade for saying that the
ergonomic some bait no annual ripped
apart I really but I don't like it there
I don't I really really don't you can
change the controls yeah that's Curt
isn't it than the edge it might be yeah
it's a lot more pronounced I mean you
have it over here somewhere but um yeah
I don't know dad's nothing I you know if
you're playing a game or something like
is it going they told me that the
paddles the exact same size they just
flex the panel I like 800 degrees to go
like that yeah yeah but I don't think it
will change operation no I won't change
operation that's just gonna be one of
the annoying bits are ya premium a space
to me yeah that's exactly what did
that's what I'm expecting the horse
thing onto a charge man you know there
have such a backlash time sings the most
high profile my back I guess although I
guess I'm a little cynical because I've
seen a lot of places like just all of a
sudden like this this ad in my face and
but I'm from ergonomical standpoint I
guess the only place that I won't be
really skeptical about as the camera but
I didn't get to look at the camera on
the s6 edge it wasn't on the edge yet no
no the UI was exactly the same as it was
on that oh thanks also the camera
shutter button is still right in middle
screen oh thank god I wish I should have
asked you that before because you're the
one that did the end yeah i'm sure i've
actually have a fire I remember it
clearly cuz i was playing around it a
lot yeah exactly he did not color
comparison yeah i did i did on the s-sex
but yeah so you saw you you you think
that they would so aside from just it
being different you everything that it
offers you what you would use on the
daily and you would pay for that on a
daily I mean I don't know if I'm gonna
use you know the people edge or that
little ticker on the daily but i don't
know i might have to see until I when I
actually have like one and i use it for
a while mmm it's kind of hard to say now
but I don't let people edge might be
useful especially for you know anybody
talked to a lot so yeah but i don't know
i usually I'm pretty old school and I
just search and
contacts app or something let's try it's
gonna take some getting used to because
any of these new features like you sort
of have to force yourself to want to use
them before you can even figure out if
they're useful because if you don't ever
try to use them you're just gonna be
like um there's whatever like yeah
they're not bad people edge at all it's
so cool i could just like whoop and then
someone's calling me i see the light
blah blah blah but then you realize that
no one calls me is the voice calls him
not really very rarely yeah I mean even
still there's text messages and stuff
there too well yeah um there's the one
thing I that that i noticed that i don't
think anybody's really talked about and
I kind of saw this one we were filming
some extra footage for you know
something i would sat with the samsung
seasonal workers just breathing down our
necks so happy like but the cool thing
is that I sort of saw with because you
get that one tab to slide over for the
people edge or you know the ticker how
about if you li the more tabs show up if
like you get a because you might be have
the five people and each tab will show
up depending on the person so like if
the first person at the top of your list
shows up you'll get a tab right there
and if so like you have a missed call or
text message from them that tab will
show up you just slide over and just go
right to the message or call them right
from there instead of pulling down the
notification shade and tapping that's
really I like that so initial tabs will
shut up which is which I thought was
kind of cool why can't it just be a
notification center then you know I
don't know I do not be pretty cool I
think that's our Samsung's way of
forcing you to use the edge more by
having your missed calls and texts from
your five favorite people show up on the
edge yeah also it kind of forces you to
use it that's not bad at all I said this
I don't think it's a bad thing it's just
something I wouldn't use and that's my
that's my point but you know this money
will go ahead of Darcy here and I
already noticed that he have so much
business talk to put out there were the
consumer guys and you know so much about
the inner workings of the industry you
know
and passion becomes an obsession and
becomes you know the means through which
one looks life you know yeah if my
livelihood our livelihoods are on the
line but it's not that extreme anymore
because you know we're very grateful I
have a big audience and all that but
it's just a matter of producing really
consistently excellent product yeah
automation product for people so they
can make you know objective decisions
and it all sounds like BS but I mean the
competition is fierce you know the tech
space like I was doing to even Business
Insider they're producing a spin-off
tech specific publication that's going
to launch in a few months now the
interest Wars technology is growing
technology is addictive it's redefining
disintermediated and disrupting so many
verticals financial sectors can
disappear legal professions medical and
we look at the oculus rift to look at
the HTC vive 55 sorry I've become an art
print but what I'm trying to say is
c'est la Viva no that's gonna have jobs
in the future so be like a robot yeah
just a robot doing that right there uh
yeah I had conversations with people
about that like what if what if whatever
what if a machine is able to do our jobs
cuz we have such create a job I wouldn't
even want to have like a terminator hand
Alexi 1000s verifier how are you so
terrified I just think it's really
interesting this is this is a refreshing
change of pace from like the consumer
driven talk so we always have on the
podcast so like given given that you
know cuz we did interviews I I filmed
you interviewing arm and imagine you
know you have talked with the number a
number of companies here about what I
don't wants a little but like what
enhancements they're bringing to the
fundamentals of the smartphone world in
a computing world in general um so with
that mind what's what's your mwc pic
what's your favorite thing here I mean
I'm obviously gonna have to say the
galaxy s6 line but in particular it's
not even the line itself is just the
hardware that they put in there like
Samsung is a massive company probably
the one of the largest world technology
companies in the world and they just
have so much incredible research and
development
you know most companies like they spend
six seven eight percent research and
development but Samsung is like probably
like 12 13 14 yeah and I mean they
produce SDC's for Apple they rise this
mark displays for Apple the same as LG
yeah I mean they have they produced the
largest container ships in the world
their whole heavy-duty equipment
division line is massive I mean there's
not really vertical that they don't
touch except for like financial services
and entertainment and they're trying to
get their milk video stuff off the line
but you know they're struggling quite a
bit because it's hard to create an
ecosystem but yeah I mean just that X
you notice SOC man I mean yeah they're
gonna use qualcomm videos for the states
yeah but i mean that's a massive
reduction going from 20 nanometer 40
nanometer that lowers the power
footprint by third worse and with the
same processing but what explains why
Samsung was able to achieve a 40
nanometer we have a company like
Qualcomm's we're doing this for so long
hmm and they haven't they they've been
they're not the ones who have that buzz
word now I mean so the reason I like
talk to our man in a nation you know
nobody really cares about them you know
in terms of consumers is that they
create the intellectual property that
companies license out and Qualcomm is a
obviously the leading partner of our
they pay a lot of money to be able to
get early access to those reference
designs to produce their Snapdragon
series yeah the soda zexion listen sort
of Samsung it's the thing that
differentiates Qualcomm and Samsung is
that Samsung actually has their own
boundaries holcomb doesn't it wasn't
just producers like designs yeah and
just like an autocad that they like
email they're like hey yo can you print
this man you know the bill comes to
psych they'll be 14 billion dollars but
I don't like a billion dollars yeah but
um yeah so I mean ddr4 and you know the
display 600 nits you know the sub down
my pics for matron for that amyloid like
you know 570 ppi that's the highest or
577 anything five types of highest in
the industry it's a bit ridiculous but
we know when I look at the margin of
error you could say 575 and still be
right you know I don't know I saw pixels
when I tried the new I don't you could
see them when we tried the new gear VR I
could see the pickle yeah I get I guess
I guess I could say that I solved two
but I mean the screens like two inches
from your face I could see this is what
being blown up to you yeah giant 3d
world so it's yeah and of course you're
gonna see something but
I look good in me though it was my first
time yeah I use the galaxy s6 for that
too yeah they do no yeah we really
immersing I mean obviously pr's can be
absolutely massive and it's gonna ruin
people in terms of you know social
behaviors so for so for you so for you I
mean I give the yard updated too yeah
take the s-sex obviously that's great
yeah but yeah but for you it's the s6
line in terms of what puts it together
he's the unsung heroes yeah you know
which of the eggheads and the Nerds you
know who are the geniuses you know the
research that comes from universities
that eventually translates into the
experiences that were all very fortunate
to have but I mean there's so many
industry-first packed into one device as
all unbeautiful form factor that shows
Samsung finally listened to consumers
yeah and like they've been slapped
around by the back end of God which is
you know angry consumers who will expect
you something better and a corollary
note that I think is really interesting
having studied like the analytic
symmetrix which we have to you know so
that we can continue to keep the lights
on um is that year after year I continue
to see less demand for this information
you know and we have command like a very
fortunate ranking position on youtube
and you know I study everything but like
we know the note for launch like those
videos they have beyond a million in
very short period of time I can't say
exactly but I remember for the s5 like
it all I'm trying to say is that there's
just a little bit less demand every year
it's probably ten fifty percent but it
compounds over time you know and it
peaks with the s3 and now it's just yeah
it's just burning down but it's still
huge you know but I just think consumers
like the experiences are also good you
know that they don't necessarily and all
that but like what 1 plus did with
disrupting you know how people perceive
they can get a great device for a sub 2
novella price point ya know so
manufacturers aren't a lot of pressure
you know to differentiate themselves and
I kind of feel bad for a she seeing
Elaine a lot of cut you know tech media
talking about how HTC standard was
completely stolen by Samsung oh I
wouldn't move see that's where that's
where I come in because I would actually
think that while not necessarily in the
mobile space HTC found a way to to bring
back all of the talk to them because in
soon yes how's that because
of the live oh yeah absolutely yeah good
plan so HTC they brought out the one m9
which I spent a lot of time with them
the analyses and it's an inner it's an
inner it's a incremental iteration
obviously well much like a lot of these
phones are which is why the galaxy s6
got such play because it actually felt
very different from what we're used to
or let's just say expected from from
Samsung you know that's that's the sort
of great way to put it um but with hcc
they came out with a wearable and like
it was it was it's it's a band as a
fitness band you know in a lot of ways
it's not really something that the
masses are going to flock to because it
requires a very specific person who
needs something like that come with
exercises probably you know someone who
just wants to know how many steps that
they oh yeah but you know their
partnership would under armour is what's
most interesting button and then they
the one that the one m9 is again
incremental but went in the right
direction we have to reserve our camera
opinions until the software's yeah
flashed out heroin same thing yeah and
but otherwise it's it's a good it's the
phone that a lot of people if you've
already liked HTC in the past and you're
like oh yeah I love the m 98 I do you
like HTC I love HTC I love I have a lot
of memories with HTC's but that way and
yes you're right being able to market
properly is something that they haven't
always hit the mark they almost have
never hit the market this in this most
recent like string of flagship
smartphones obviously but what did what
I give a sh you see a lot of credit for
and if I have to put it out this way I
give HTC my pick of the show because um
by branching out yeah not necessarily
putting all their eggs and just
smartphone that so how did we not give
the be it's not Android but that's all
you see there's no access see that's
enough see that's the kicker yeah we
what is it running it's not you know
it's running off a pc oh yeah turning
off a pc so it's a standalone virtual
reality system see that's the thing
that's what makes see HTC made it happen
we tell you that it's not even about
Android but we're talking about them so
much now hmm because of the vibe yeah
but the price point you're done with 23
kindness well I mean that's not that's
not that's like that speculation that
speculation there's there's no no one
has said that there's no price know what
so that's just from you yeah that's just
what we were saying on the livestream
like you know it's probably gonna be
something like that like the overhead
costs for everything it's probably going
to be very high and sasha was one who
said 23 grand or something like that ok
yeah I don't think Soviet maybe with the
pc yeah yeah oh yeah that's true yeah oh
yeah that might be a little that spc I'm
sure they'll have some nvidia its steam
right yep steam see also steaming in
beta how that connection yeah it's got a
piggyback off of a system you already
have but that's my point is that we're
talking so much about it and everyone
who has tried this thing including
myself hmm or blown away yeah absolutely
are does that to you you know Ben I know
this is taking br2 enough you know
everybody sing like that they're way
ahead oculus because they have that you
know verticality they have all the java
sensors and lasers to be able to detect
the sides of your room yeah but I always
noticed like I remember seeing prl al q
lessly had demos to see us where people
actually had to move you know they were
on like one of those stations where the
ground moves as you all know yeah but
it's like a 3d you look at how
ridiculous start running and then
they're like I'm running yeah no no crap
you're running like you are physically
running right now we write like I mean
that was exhausting yeah I want to sit
down get back just something I want to
move so how do you how do you feel of
your blog see this is the thing like yes
it's me reunion we do that g3 thing we
have that plastic oh sure it happened on
oh sure but it's interestingly Gordon
this is not an Android iteration in
terms of the five but it's something
that we have to talk about because HTC
is at the helm and that's something we
know that we never really expect me they
can be at the helm but like you know
whether or not it actually turns into a
legitimate product that people buy it's
a different question I really think but
the thing is I have the ecosystem of
steam would almost up there was the hard
part I mean like Asus used to make dell
computers under the pegatron brand and
they learn from that woody em expertise
in the late 80s and early 90s that they
can make really good computers too and
they could cut out
yeah and then del star used somebody
else in garage that suits right yeah I
oh say there's nothing more there's
nothing more of that HTC can do but
benefit from what might be a
breakthrough product yes I you know they
could shop it around too and they could
lower the price the hardware and they
can use other partners to that can make
it yeah how do you feel like viola I
mean I think I I hope it I hope it takes
off like it actually becomes like a
thing work because it's really awesome
technology but um i don't know i think
for consumers to really want to hone in
on it like its gonna have to get smaller
like I think I'm everything is still a
little bit too big and a little bit too
clunky looking and then like like when
we're playing with like the gear VR like
I just don't understand like why the
straps have to be like you have to have
one of the top I didn't wanna go right
here and like my biggest complaint was
that's not hair compatible yes I cumin I
just want the backstrap I don't need
this whole weekend ahead you're gonna
get out you're gonna need to have like a
reverse mohawk just not yet just to have
space for the shade in the middle I
think if exec can get it down to like
the size of like ski goggles or
something yeah I think people would be
like context just so much going on
though that's the point yeah that's true
the five is humongous the reason why is
because it's communicating with all
those lasers that are basically shooting
through your body and give you a
radiation I'm just kidding but but yeah
everyone I've wish that you had a chance
to try it but they're they're scheduling
for their demos was so yes was so
concise and packed and then it condemns
thank you yeah that you know it was
really tough like the guy who's doing
the demo is in there saying the same
thing every half hour that's basically
how a war ii was looking old yeah so you
know and God bless them for going
through all of that but the thing is you
could tell that they're really they're
really excited to see how people react
to something like that Nestor he's going
to give them so much credit is because
this partnership has now revitalized the
people who work at HTC yeah you know not
to say that they were deflated at before
but it just seems like there's this
great energy from them because of this
particular product and if it if it
realises their entire company more power
to them absolutely
yeah i'll buy rebuy leave ah I see I
mean it definitely looks like they have
a good product on their hands because I
mean I obviously haven't tried it but
everything that I've seen on it like all
the videos and all the posts appealed
and writing about it it's nothing but
positive can I can I tell you how all
about it can I tell you yeah oh my god
okay so you get into this like sterile
room and there's something but like a
chair in the middle and the chairs just
there for a reference point and they
take the chair away once you put it on
so that you know you're just in the room
but what happens is there are two laser
sensors on opposite sides of the room or
somewhere adjacent one at times there
have to be perfectly opposite but just
enough to sort of bear down and create
the space that you will that that will
communicate with the five and then you
then you give in to controllers which
will be Wireless in the final iteration
but these two controllers are the way
that you interact with the world and it
began when you put it on they put these
headphones on you and you're just the
world is gone like the real world is no
longer a thing once you put it on you
are no longer where you are and this
world came up it was a white just this
white background and you you solve the
room like what was once a sterile like
beige room became this steam-powered
place with hexagons going in and out of
the floor and all this and it said and
now granted actually it's funny you
mentioned the whole GDC thing earlier
noisy yeah the presentation title said
GDC demo oh really yeah so did they have
it at GDC too yeah they had a GDC I mean
you know what the fact that it wasn't
even leaked you know yeah that's pretty
impressive cuz they she see us a lot of
problems with leaks you know I mean the
honest you know they weren't really
considered to be a tier 1 purchaser of a
lot of these technologies but I think
yeah you totally righteous about the
branding about the awareness to the
words the company yeah and so okay yeah
so yeah that came up was a GCC demo one
and then the text is run is floating in
the air like to show you you stay tell
you the guy the guys actually talking to
you through the headphones and it says
walk forward two steps you see that grid
there's this mesh grid that appeared on
your face and says that is the boundary
don't i don't know you touch it play
what would mean you can move your hand
for it and yes the the the VR will will
know where the controllers are so you
basically know where your hands are in
the space so what's like what are the
units like it is the directional like
wiimotes okay yeah we look like about
the million of like the kind of like we
have buttons or trigger on it or trigger
yeah thumb button and the grips have you
can you can hit the the sides of the
grapes so okay okay I like joysticks in
a way like they're joystick but there
but they're not made for moving because
you're the one moving around up and down
all around yeah and you're little and it
moves everywhere you go ends really
would expect fluid as heck and it's
because the processing from that that pc
yeah the one that's doing here can you
see the edges of the display no so
you're just completely nude yeah the
world is young you've tried oculus yeah
I have for like a minute cuz i actually
got a little nauseous off of it but this
didn't make you know no it did help
comes I don't know why maybe I was in a
better place is super yeah maybe oh yeah
yeah that's the whole sir I mean what
was the resolution like was a super
sharp and no I wasn't it was it
definitely wasn't a super sharp display
but the latency was like like zero
completely zero and all the movements
when when you moved your hands forward
and the controllers were being
recognized by the display you could see
yourself you can see you can see the
these floating controllers in virtual
space and that was how you're going to
interact with the world so that mess
your hand no use your hands you just see
the controllers but in space based upon
where your hands on it so it attracts
the controller it tracks everything for
me how many different types of worlds
like so then yes like six worlds right
so a 65 but anyway the first world was
they said this these are the boundaries
so feel free to walk around here for a
little bit and notice when the mesh
comes up and you'll know that you should
be going past a certain point so and
you'll know in these worlds that you
can't go past a certain point because
obviously we're going to create that
boundary for it was like okay that's
cool so we he said ok here we go into
the first world and it was an underwater
in like deep-sea shipwreck and you're
walking on the deck of this bro of this
like ship wrecked boat and all these
fish they're floating around you and if
you hit the trigger button on on the
controllers and move your hands around
you actually like you know shoe the fish
away and then you're looking at what's
on the ship and you're noticing those
things and they go out turn around you
turn around this big way all right and
it's right in your face like you could
you feel I could you feel like you could
touch it you literally do the next world
after that was a cooking thing and it
gave you instructions I cooking mama
almost and you were in a kitchen and
they're all these ingredients on the
table and you could and when the
controller the controller recognized
ations regular controllers being
recognized were turned into hands up and
the triggers when you not picking things
up yeah and he created a soup you
chopped up stuff I picked up a plane I
threw it at the wall and it was bloody
boy it was really fun they said yeah
just go nuts in the in the in the
kitchen and after that was this is
probably the one that was really great
for a lot of people to realize what the
utility of VR is was it was it was it
was a grid like a like a square and you
could move around was like a black room
and it was light art so your controllers
became light heart you had on the left
he had on the Left controller the
ability to rotate your wrist and see
three different swatches to change what
brush you were using or one color and
one is what kind of was in your right
hand was the brush and the wishes weight
and it was it was one to one it was
incredible now you when you're looking
at your left wrist and they're like okay
I want that color blue and then these
these these virtual reality grins are
just kind of rotating around your wrist
and you're just picking things and then
then the one that everyone just were
blue a blown away from by brother the
final demo was you being a repairman for
a portal robot from an average are you
in Portal to portal world yeah and it
looked just like you could tell us if
valve created just for this and the the
you're trying to repair a robot but you
know you're doomed to fail because you
don't know what to do to repair it and
and then the wall caves in and GLaDOS
the the enemy from from Portal yeah
comes in and when he went when she came
in that that robot it's huge yeah I was
terrified real
I was immersed in this world and seeing
GLaDOS in front see actually talking to
me and and and telling me that she's
gonna kill me basically yeah oh my god I
was terrified see they said at the
beginning of the demo if you feel
nauseous or if you feel like you don't
really you know feel comfortable anymore
close your eyes and let us know and we
will take off the unit but what was what
was crazy about it was that wasn't the
problem the problem was I actually lost
myself in this world and when I felt
terrified it was because of what was
happening hey um except Florida gives
out under you and only your panel is
open so you look over down to what could
be your death and you literally feel
like that's what's happening I don't
really what about like moving upwards
and downwards yes there it in crouch and
you can see things you could pick up
stuff off the floor I mean like let's
say you're in like the scenario where
you have water can you go down into the
water well it'sit's or is that something
they have in the future that's something
they might have in the future but
obviously it has to do with your
movement so you know you're not
necessarily going to be jumping past the
plane of the floor yeah I guess that
makes sense so you feel as water you be
Jesus you'd be walking but yeah you know
there were times when I would be able to
go underneath a virtual table hmm and
find something underneath the table and
then be able to pick it up it was just
incredible and everyone is talking about
it I was so skeptical about VR and and
and all that and all of a sudden now I'm
a believer but this iteration of it
where the world is you're always stirred
literally not literally but for
consumers though I mean you talk even if
it is a thousand bucks like it just
gonna be a lot cheaper for people to use
their smartphone you know and oculus and
those guys they're saying that Samsung
has been an awesome partner you know
they got the financing Facebook and
everything I don't necessarily think
this should be vaporware but I also
wanted to like is it within our bound
that we could come from here I mean
we're android authority sure but like
obviously the future of entertainment
and of interaction with technology is
not necessarily smart phones you know so
you don't I would even ask the audience
like would you like us to cover VR like
is that okay and I'm sure the answer is
going to be yes I know when we have it
we have an in though because it's it's
the phone companies that are making this
yeah I just you know I think that you
know there's already left 1.2 1.3
billion android phones there will be
more you know in the future it just
seems like a easier path to entry for a
lot of people if they have a great phone
that they can get a plastic google
cardboard device you know like Google's
really gonna develop the ecosystems and
thinking laterally and enabling partners
right mmm um that's not to say like I
mean doctors guys remember like they're
saying like it'll be like an AK display
maybe a 16g to school in the future you
know pc hardware have they have bet they
want us to go into mental part to see
their AK they have an AK panel and it's
just supposed to be insane yeah it's
connected some really badass hardware
probably for GPU is running like really
advanced humming yeah you know but I
don't know you know I mean like I you
know I totally agree and I like I said
before I we have an in because you know
it is the phone companies manufacturers
that are working on all this stuff and
that's great you know that gives us the
ability to say let's see what I'm still
working on you know and that's that's
why I like this like you know
imagination and arm and stuff because
you know they have a low-power you know
they were working really hard like
either demos we sought imagination that
we're running I mean it looks super good
you know I just don't know that's just
where I come from oh sure into your
point about like smartphones being the
entry point of VR they all have their
segments in the category but this is
that this is definitely something that's
farm beyond such as the premiums like a
prism cytopenias de laser-guided lab
exchange with you you know whatever
worry where would you rank the five in
terms of other VR headsets like oculus
and Morpheus well the thing is oculus
Morpheus gear even gear VR and you know
they already have k scenarios they're
already here it remains to be seen what
the main case scenarios are going to be
for an entertainment system that is
essentially going to be relegated to a
corner of your living room that you get
to walk around you know it's different
it's I'm viewing I'm viewing the HTC
vive as an extension to this to the
future steam console that's what I'm
doing it as because it's going to be
about entertainment that's what agency
called it is this is connected
entertainment that's what they called it
and you know I well given that steam has
steam is has so much steam they have so
much content
that if it gets converted over to this
platform it's gonna be baying Buster's
man it's just gonna be so great and gang
busters women and bang bus i'm just
gonna say thank i want some bangbus gear
VR oh my god would you know what
something I was talking to some down the
rabbit hole it's a show as you're
talking about what if what if stuff like
porn was was the future see this video I
always always push the industry for one
push cable modems you know important
push VHS to DVD mm you know porn was the
first stood up for Cain 3d porn is gonna
be huge on PR and it kind of sounds
weird but like you know but it's true
there's two things people like to do is
you know uh-huh communicate and copulate
yeah and you know that those are just
too fun my designers and often though
they to work in tandem you need to keep
me k before you can calculate what's
great design that wasn't even really
that means look I can do this motion for
you most greater than all of that was
great is that all of that is still
relevant it wasn't a tangent but it's
cuz it's still relevant to what we're
talking about i can't wait to get some
PR point i'm not for real man or even
like you know like a chola road all the
time you know and i'd like to be able to
connect with my loved one then well
that's that's that's a case scenario
that might like communication using a VR
thing you know for whether or not it's
for that kind of purpose you know that's
not something that we've seen yet you
know to be able to actually see someone
in the mead space in a virtual space and
you know it's a it's crazy i don't know
what's going to happen well you know
you're going to have to relegate an
actual section of your room in order to
have this thing and I'm perfectly fine
with that because it's basically the
space in front of your game console
mm-hmm you know and I think that's
actually okay but this is the point that
I put out on the live stream and I felt
so proud of myself i said this mean
there's a reason why we haven't seen
half life 3 in a long time it is because
this is the way they want namely that's
gonna be bad asses the way but i would
argus is obvi so you know people will
want to be sitting down you know because
you can't really see so it's a little
bit terrifying they were just trying to
show proof of concept it's amazing but
you know the next generation of families
that are you know you're going to be
getting together and looking for
entertain at home you know 15 10 years
from now people will strap these things
on but they'll want to be connected to
see each other when they look at them
yeah and they're going to be able to
like download an experience you know
where they are you know I don't know
parasailing you know over Australia or
whatever and you know if you can if you
can let go of the real world you the
sensations of the real world and be in
that world that is in the vibe let's say
yeah that's perfectly possible i imagine
having that imagine having a larger grid
of lasers and you have like four people
in one place and of course since they're
being tracked also you will be able to
see that in the world yeah people want
to be connected by this van I wonder
what the social implications you know
like children these days you know they
don't really have the comportment you
know face-to-face communications that a
lot of anxiety and social problems that
are created through technology but I
would hope that we can kind of bring it
back even though it's an amazing
experience and it's so immersive we
still need to be doing it together true
and i will i will say this also i am
also i am a little bit worried that the
world that is created in something like
the vibe is so amazing that you know
like we don't have to talk about this at
length I just want to put this idea out
there that maybe it's because I don't
want a childhood but I want to say like
in general depression becomes a big
thing because you just want to be there
rather than where you are and you know
that you know this the whole social
aspect does get a disconnect if you are
doing it singularly on yeah so I do it I
do imagine that like dude can you if the
water I michael fisher over park now he
was saying that when he took that thing
off he didn't want to because he wanted
to be there yeah yeah I could talk wait
to get addicted yeah do you think you
would ever get get to though oh yeah
Hammett I mean I think it could cuz I
mean it's like you know even like a
video game can kind of make you like
that sometimes no saber like yeah the
sims is so they're even just like games
like Call of Duty cuz like you'll see
people like put like tweets out or
facebook statuses saying don't talk to
me I'll be gone for the next three
months like Call of Duty or whatever
it's like I think VR could totally do
that too so it's just a much more
profound way
it's almost like a drink people might
lose themselves I don't even know what's
like reality anymore it's gonna be
lessened it'll be like me inception or
something where like yeah they don't
know the difference between the real
world and what's with reopen Speights an
incredibly real fear like I i hadn't i
had an expression until just now but
that thought came to mind like a mansion
like your grandma right there's someone
who like my grandma can acquire got her
computer and i set facebook up in this
on her like countertop in the kitchen so
i created a profile everyone can
interact with her but she just doesn't
use it but imagine putting vr onto a
person from previous generations even
our parents right they would just be I
didn't know what they would react like
probably probably think it's just like
magic you know true man it's it will
have an equal amount of wow and an equal
amount of danger this is terrifying yeah
as too much um the the the gentleman who
was performing the demo for me he told
me afterwards that you know he was
actually proud of me because he said
like you really get it like you do get
it like you you already started so there
was this really funny thing when I first
when I first put it on you press a
button on the right controller and this
balloon all of a sudden like inflates
and her peers and nurses slowly float up
and he goes you can actually touch the
balloon and so I put the other
controller in my head and my real hand I
tried to swat at the air to see if I can
hit the balloon after stupid but but
then all we have sure you know and but
then once I remembered oh I'm in a
virtual world I hit it with the
controller yeah any here uh-huh and it
goes out oh sure oh man I'm gonna be ice
on that is so he said you know he said
people get it Fiedler's through people
who get it and then there are people who
have this disconnect because yeah they
just kind of they want they let the
virtual world watch over them rather
than becoming a part of it hmm so
they're standing in one place not really
realizing that they could walk around
actually see things actually experience
the world but yeah that was just you
know we ended I ended up talking about
the vibe again I've been talking about
all day ever since we made it up in
the fira this morning on like 10 days or
something like that no there wasn't like
any sort of audio with it right the
headphones okay it wasn't immersive I
did not I did not know Admiral enough I
no longer I don't know I I did not know
that I was in that room anymore was it
binaural or was it like just regular
stereo audio like how it is that's all
my question I didn't I don't know but it
definitely had a lot of depth to it so I
could hear things that were happening
like uh to the back right of my head you
know I hear something coming and it was
it was incredible it was absolutely
incredible I would have to give it's a
little bit controversial for me to give
a topic to an on Android device usually
so I will give it to the company that's
making it they have brought back the
talk today I mean you know but oculus
and all those guys you know they laid
the foundation for this and I mean
they're to be credited yeah yeah and I'm
frankly like I think that oculus has a
better go to market strategy especially
with Facebook's on them macc does no you
find total moon shoot for them but like
I want to saying earlier all the people
who play steam which is close to a
billion people a half of which are
active every single day yeah they
they're gonna be the first ones to buy
it and that's a lot of my he will have
sold so much already they put put put
have 53 is a launch game oh you're done
you are done but yeah you wanna say like
yeah I was just gonna say like if vr
really does take off within the next you
know 10 years or so which will get like
you know within that time frame will get
the next gen consoles like if it does
take off we could see these you know
even consoles having like it like a VR
headset bundled in with those consoles
he would be just insane I think Morris
think it was the Gameboy fast but it was
the one that had for trouble yeah the
monochromatic red yeah
that one I was like nine I got so
cross-eyed I rented it you know me back
when you could rant video game consoles
yeah and I couldn't deck and deal with
it but this is on obviously doctors that
was like 40 years ago but think about
where we've come in all this time that's
that's crazy then shows like this and
this reason why I have I am so over the
moon about this thing is because for the
first time in a while for the first time
since I first started working here at a
I was actually really excited about
something at a show and I think that's
there for people like us it takes a lot
for a solo right yeah cuz we're just so
jaded and desensitized by everything I
like these sensitize more than jaded
because I can still be excited about a
phone but it's not going to make me like
it's not gonna change my demeanor it's
not gonna change the way that I actually
act but once I came out of that room
Darcy saw me man i was like I was
thinking I could going with you and he's
like nope that's what I'm not yeah I
thought you were coming in with me and
then and then the gentleman has a one
unit right yeah I can plus that whole
experience you need to have come out of
the room it was a small room yeah was
you know like those little terrifying
walking in like okay what am I about to
get into here but I'm still excited
about it I'm still react yeah sweet as
you know people who are inundated with
new technology you have to find reasons
to be excited not necessarily just a
hype stuff up but because you know we're
just kind of at the Nexus you know the
reception of the best-in-class
technology for smartphones and tablets
and all and you know when you see a game
changer like this like it reinvigorates
you know and it makes me want to revisit
the gear VR and all that so you find the
use cases for it see if it's really
something that is a viable solution for
a lot of what we hope will be the future
you know maybe it's bad that I'm that my
experience is mostly now with the vibe
compared to others you know maybe I was
gonna be yeah but but i do want to
revisit it but bottom line there's a lot
to be excited for it this show you know
you had the s6 edge we talked about the
m9 for a little bit s6 to me is still
the the one that I would get over the
edge and then we had the vibe and HTC
finally pulling off something that we
haven't seen them doing a little while
and that's make buzz
make a massive amount of noise oh yeah
but ultimately but this was a good time
oh hell yeah you want the best events I
think dine alone Yeah right CS was like
man even if it was pretty cool i give
some love you I think gave us great
I heard a whole bunch of oldies you know
and by old examining like people who've
been doing tech reporting for like 20
years they were like the gentleman
ponytail I was overhearing and they were
talking about how they believe there's
going to be resurgence in interest
towards computex in Taiwan yeah you know
because that's where like all the
technologies made you know tell us like
the economic tiger of Asia man you got
so many great companies including HTC
name of the suisun Nvidia and other
centers that's their segment that's what
they are I mean the owner of Foxconn
seventies and anyway my point is just
like maybe it's worthwhile for us to go
because these guys are on to the VR in a
way that we don't even know so I'll dig
deeper I mean maybe maybe you'll be
seeing some coverage from us guys yeah
in June that was pretty cool yeah if you
don't like topless brother and I was
like a bit small hahaha tell you what
this is this is a great way for us to
commemorate what's the end of our show
you know and obviously there's more
content to be put out but this is this
is like our cap this is not cap rate
there's one thing though that I think
deserves mentioning which is look you
know I always think it's in terms of you
know people I always think it's
interesting when you pay attention to
what's not set and look what we didn't
talk about no we didn't who didn't we
talk about what products didn't we talk
about Hey oh they're plenty yeah a lot
was because the walking to be fair this
is this is the format of this particular
podcast is what was your favorite yeah
so for that but I'm just saying you know
that it's just an interesting thought
point of course yeah and put these
companies that we didn't talk about
which we don't have to talk about
because I'm not gonna tackle they are
also in a position to be able to do
really crazy stuff too and they are you
think so honestly there are a lot of
great things happening in the mid-range
market and there are a lot of great
things happening out of even companies I
haven't told us that there one in
particular sony Sony telling us that
they didn't really want to do or there
dialing it back a little bit on the
mobile space you know it's not the big
part of their
but you know what they still came up
with a pretty good-looking portfolio of
things this year yeah great show good
cydia how blonde you enjoyed yourself
your boss oh yeah and how that I mean
did we treat you right and some verses
brother haha Darcy drove me like a slave
hahaha you should see the scarfs
inspector oh that's terrible well now
it's time for us to grab a bite see so
thanks thanks a lot to all of you for
listening to us you can find as I will
have already said going back in time i'm
going to be doing the inch the intro
after the fact that we are recording the
crux of the body of this podcast i hope
you guys can find us all on twitter and
instagram and google+ and everywhere
fine android authority all over the
internet on YouTube in our forums and at
android authority calm guys we're gonna
do our ultra as we always do do you say
with me guys thank you guys so much for
listening to the Friday debate podcast a
special edition us being able to sit in
front of my conscious r if I was a lot
of fun maybe a couple things you know
Darcy's on as an untethered man so okay
don't worry very enjoyable everything is
fine um the Friday did a podcast
discussing topics in android every week
this week we had mwc and we were
reporting to you or rather doing this
podcast live from our apartment we never
stay at the same place twice no yeah so
that's impossible together symptom
exactly so we we I like to have these
moments where we get into sort
