it hard not to compare the new official
Google device to its predecessor the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus however in this
comparison we're going to be taking a
look at the similarities and the
differences between Nexus past and Nexus
present so this is Joshua Carter
mandroid authority what's going on
everybody and this is the Galaxy Nexus
versus the Nexus 4 there's one thing you
can't deny the Nexus 4 by LG looks a lot
like the Samsung Galaxy Nexus you have
the same features on the front with the
large 4.7 inch screen the front facing
camera in essentially the same place and
even the notification light found near
the bottom the button layout is exactly
the same with the power button on the
right and the volume rockers opposite it
the differences start with LG's own
modifications with the design the
headphone jack is actually found on top
this time and the bottom houses the
charging port surrounded by the two Torx
screws which seem to have become LG's
distinctive trait it's like a focal
point where the construction of the
phone begins and ends
imagine this gorgeous glass encased
phone being constructed and when it's
all put together these Torx screws
complete the process the back shows yet
another change the Nexus 4 introduces in
which the carrier or phone manufacturer
name is done away with and is replaced
with Nexus LG's Nexus 4 also does away
with the gray plastic back of the Galaxy
Nexus and puts a sleek glass panel
covering the crystal reflection design
the result is a sleek looking black slab
that does away with the curved design of
the Galaxy Nexus to deliver a beautiful
looking phone that feels great in the
hand glass makes this phone feel like a
truly luxurious device okay yes this is
a pretty fragile phone a number of users
have reported that even a small drop has
broke in either the front or the back
panels nonetheless given its affordable
price tag the Nexus 4 is still one of
the best-looking phones out there right
now just take some care with it the
Galaxy Nexus was one of the phones of
its time able to support the previously
hard-to-find Super AMOLED display that
helped to bring a great viewing
experience it was certainly one of the
first phones to get the constant dang
look how big that screen is and it
solidified that having a screen over 4.5
inches was not only OK for a smartphone
it was going to become a standard LG
then needed to up the ante by providing
their own screed technology in the Nexus
4 covered in Corning Gorilla Glass the
true HD IPS display has a resolution of
1280 by 768 and is able to bring in 320
PPI pixel density to be fair the
official measurement of the nexus 4
screen is indeed bigger than that of the
Galaxy Nexus even if it is just by point
0 5 inches however the real story here
is the zero gap technology while the
true effectiveness of it has been
somewhat contested I personally believe
it works zero gap takes all the layers
typically found between the protective
and display layers and removes them
completely
the result is an even crisper and vivid
viewing experience also as LG claims it
allows for better screen responsiveness
I personally found all of this to be
true on both the Nexus 4 and the Optimus
G it's fraternal twin so I would have to
definitely give it to the newer device
for truly improving on the already great
display capabilities of its predecessor
the camera comparison further adds to
the Nexus fours lead as the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus honestly didn't bring great
quality to begin with already brought
down by 2 megapixel count at only 5 the
picture quality in the Galaxy Nexus was
not on par with most of its competition
and despite quick shutter to picture
speeds it really didn't set the bar very
high which was good for LG as it was
able to learn from this and add in not
only the adequate camera that a
smartphone of this caliber needs but one
with enough extra features to go the
extra mile as a megapixels seems to be
the standard count for high-end
smartphones now that's exactly what you
get with the Nexus 4 however the quality
of the camera is impressive it is a very
solid performer that creates usable and
ultimately very pleasing photos the new
features are due to the inclusion of the
newest Android operating system jelly
bean 4.2 the camera app interface has
been revamped in order to introduce a
touch and swipe dynamic that does away
with traditional menus it really is a
great way of controlling the settings of
the camera and it feels very fresh other
than that the inclusion of photosphere
is a nice addition albeit ultimately
just a novelty all in all the camera on
the Nexus 4 is a vast improvement from
the Galaxy Nexus and it leaves its
predecessor in the dust as far as
performance goes the Samsung Galaxy
Nexus packed a dual-core TI OMAP that
clocked in at 1.2 gigahertz but the
power VR s
GX 540 graphics processor what that
means is that the experience of the
phone was exemplary for its time and it
still remains as one of the nicest
experiences in a phone to date good
memories are bound with the Galaxy Nexus
and the enjoyment was only further
enhanced if he ever put a custom ROM on
it further optimization would be
achieved and the phone would continue to
feel relevant even after an entire year
of having it I certainly take advantage
of what seems to be a processing package
made to go the distance which is what
makes the Nexus 4 zone performance feel
like such a feat the quad-core
Snapdragon s4 pro processor at 1.5
gigahertz and the Adreno 320 graphics
processor really make this phone fly it
is hard to deny just how awesome the
performance and perceived experience of
the Nexus 4 fields in side-by-side
comparisons with my Galaxy Nexus the
Nexus 4 was simply just able to open its
apps quicker and load content faster
this comparison just couldn't be
one-sided though as I said before the
torque screws found on the bottom of the
Nexus 4 seemed to be the start and end
of the phone's general construction as
such the battery is not replaceable
honestly this comes as a disappointment
to me as I have become very used to
having a spare battery with my verizon
Galaxy Nexus 4G LTE takes up a ton of
battery and even on days when I have
forgotten to charge my phone the extra
battery was definitely a lifesaver the
battery in the Nexus 4 is larger than
the one originally found in my Galaxy
Nexus but even if it can typically last
a day having the charging cable on hand
will have to become a new habit the
connectivity of the Nexus 4 compared to
its predecessor was perhaps the part of
the in-depth review that actually did
feel like a comparison and this is for a
good reason the Nexus 4 is lack of full
support of 4G LTE is already
well-documented and I was definitely
curious to see how it would really
affect the network experience now I am a
seasoned Verizon LTE user and since my
area is covered well by the phone
company's mobile internet coverage
I'm definitely used to very fast speeds
it really does spoil you a little bit
which is why the Nexus 4 with its HSPA+
support does indeed feel slow again my
test using a borrowed t-mobile SIM card
yielded the following results with the
Nexus 4 running at full signal strength
its internet was able to keep up with my
verizon Galaxy Nexus running only at
half reception strength I honestly can't
deny the difference and to be fair I am
too used to my LTE speeds by now and
finally we have the software since these
are Nexus devices this is essentially
leaving the most important part for last
this is because being a Nexus device
means that users are getting the latest
and greatest that the Android OS has to
offer
updates will also come to Nexus phones
and tablets before all others the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus was the first
device to come with Android 4.0.4
designated Ice Cream Sandwich if a new
device was an update to ICS it was
easier to disregard this was not the
only important aspect of the Galaxy
Nexus as its support for developers
spawned a community of Reuters and
customizers who took the Android OS and
tweaked it to its own delight this was
true for the Nexus One and the Nexus S
and now for the Galaxy Nexus
the residue mand from a multitude of
users who wanted their phones to have
some features not really found in the
stock experience and to this day the
Galaxy Nexus root and ROM community is
going very strong and I suspect all of
this to be the same with the Nexus for
that same community of enthusiastic
software adventurers will likely flock
to the newest and so far greatest a
Nexus device yet and make it their own
but with the Nexus 4's included jelly
bean 4.2 comes its own revolution that
with its new features it is now clear
that google has been paying attention to
the routing community now features like
power widgets in the notification
drop-down of custom roms are found in a
new page that Google put in itself it's
getting easier and easier to choose the
stock OS over community-created custom
roms and that is a true testament to the
Nexus 4 it brings the latest OS will
always be updated and if you are so
inclined to take advantage of how easily
it can be routed and the community
responsible for doing it you're getting
a great deal of freedom with Google's
newest official device
and so there you have it the Nexus 4 is
not just a giant leap forward for the
Google Nexus line it truly represents
the roots and the legacy of its
predecessors the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
was and still is one of the best phones
on the Android platform and the Nexus 4
not only brought the best parts of its
past along it lays down the groundwork
for the future as such the Nexus 4 is a
stellar improvement to Google's previous
official device and is likely to remain
so for quite a while killer specs a
great form factor a wonderful screen
first dibs on Google updates and perhaps
most importantly for some the freedom to
modify it to your heart's content
these are all things you can use to
describe both of these phones upon
release the Nexus 4 is out now and is
one of the hottest selling phones on the
market and why shouldn't it be it has
succeeded in filling some pretty big
shoes for my full written comparison
