Clayton over to android authority calm
today i'm bringing you a head-to-head
comparison of the adapt x keyboard the
slideit keyboard the swiftkey x keyboard
and then i'm throwing in the Ice Cream
Sandwich stock keyboard so without
further ado let's just check out some of
the user interface of these keyboard on
my LG optimus 4x i am running the adapt
x keyboard as you can see here we've got
our clean user interface throw
suggestion bar at top you can check out
a review on the website of this keyboard
and then on the Galaxy Nexus i'm running
the slideit keyboard if we compare the
two user interfaces um you can see that
there's like more of a clean user
interface here on the adapt x keyboard
and then i'll be slided there's like
this 3d thing going on but of course we
can change the themes on each of these
so i'll just go through the themes of
both ok so first off we'll just go to
the settings on both of these phones you
can see we have the settings open on the
slideit keyboard and we're just going to
open the settings on the adapt X now we
have the dictionaries for both the look
and feel for both but we'll go to the
look and feel for the slide it you can
see that we have to slide it 3d and then
we got the classic skin but i'll apply
the classic skin will use that we have
the themes here for the adapt x and i
will change that actually I'm going to
keep that on the dark theme the light
ones kind of cool but you can see what
was going on there we have our automatic
text replacement on the adapt X and we
don't have that on the slide it but
we're just going to go back and compare
the user interface right now anyways on
our adapt X you see here we have our
clean black user interface with our
suggestion bar here at the top and then
on our slide it you have a nice white
user interface with some black buttons
and we can either choose slide it or ABC
where we cannot slide because sliding is
not allowed in ABC mode but anyways the
two main features going for each of
these the adapt texts are a word
prediction and our automatic text
replacement then our slider is our ease
of use and a speed of typing by sliding
the keyboard so let's just do a practice
sentence with each and we'll compare if
I can actually get one off faster on the
sliding keyboard Iran the adapt X using
the prediction so for our sentence i
will put
of android authority and I type that
pretty sloppily but as you can see it's
still a god I love android authority on
there and that was a pretty quick time
you know like I didn't really have to
use the tech suggestion or the auto
prediction on their kind of knew what I
was going to type because I imported my
dictionary from facebook and from my
android dictionary but will kind of do
the same thing here on the Galaxy Nexus
running the slide keyboard right now
lock open it up and we will use the
slide I love android authority oh and it
didn't even get the last one and it
actually spelled live so maybe I was
going a little fast on the sliding
keyboard but we will try it again right
now just to see if I can do it I'll take
my time a little more now so and it
automatically puts the spaces in after i
press I so I love Android and it didn't
get authority again slideit keyboard
took a little more time than the adapt
text keyboard anyways the slide it can
be very useful and you know you can even
get sentences off pretty quickly using
the slider keyboard we'll just compare a
few of the other functionalities now
anyways on the adapt ex keyboard we have
our numbers and punctuation button which
when we press we have two options of
menus to go through where we have our
punctuation in a few emoticons and then
on the slide that we have the same on
numbers and punctuation but we have four
different panels and the numbers stay
constant but we do have four different
panels including some arrow keys on
there and then anyways on the slideit
keyboard we do have our setting this cut
copy and paste so that's pretty
convenient and then we can actually pin
to our clipboard and whatnot but uh you
know kadapa ticks on the slide it comes
down to preference if you prefer the
automatic text replacement and the text
prediction of the adapt x over the speed
and ease of use if you slide it keyboard
you know it's just all your choice so
that's those already so next we've got
our adapt text keyboard versus the
swiftkey x keyboard now these are both
more similar this time and we type on
the swiftkey x we actually get a few
you know predictions they're like we do
on the adapt X keyboard so these are
more similar than the same ballpark as
opposed to the slideit keyboard versus
the adapt text but anyways we can go
ahead and check our numbers and
punctuation buttons and we press that on
the swiftkey X we get our numbers that
we can easily hit with our left finger
pretty easily get our numbers in there
and everything them in our punctuation
is there on the right and then we have
our most cons there anyways when we
press that on the adapt X of course we
have our two pages of text and we can go
to our settings on each actually that
would be this key and when we are in our
settings on the adapt X as we previously
saw we have our themes the auto
correction and all that and on the
swiftkey X we have our personalization
and our themes of course and then we
have our swiftkey at stats which are
pretty cool because it shows us how much
more efficient we are just by using the
swiftkey keyboard anyways let's do some
typing tests on this one and same with
the adapt X keyboard we'll see if our
prediction is better on the swiftkey X
or on the adapt X so I'll just go ahead
and type a sentence in on the Galaxy
Nexus running the swiftkey and we will
put the auto prediction on this keyboard
is great now oh my god most of them it
did say predictions instead of
prediction and bhutto instead of auto
but I was typing pretty sloppily but I'm
kind of trying to do that just to see
how well I cannot predict a word from
something that it's not anyways we'll
try that on the adapt text the auto
predictions on this keyboard is great
so um I kind of did that one sloppy
again but it says thaw auto prediction
on this keyboard mistreat now i don't
know if i was typing too sloppy but it
would seem that the swiftkey got it a
little better than the adapt x keyboard
now i was typing pretty sloppy but then
again i was doing that on purpose to try
and you know basically say oh well these
two keyboards can create words based on
their context and whatnot but anyways it
does look like the swiftkey was a little
bit better than the adapt text so uh you
know it's all preference again you guys
all right guys to last but not least we
have our adapt X beta keyboard versus
the stock Android Ice Cream Sandwich
keyboard that comes on phones like the
Galaxy Nexus anyways when we compared
the user interfaces of these two we can
see that the stock keyboard is lacking
the secondary you know numbers and
punctuation above these letters that you
can get while you long press on the
Adept X keyboard but it does not lack a
auto text prediction and you know the
learning of words that you type anyways
we have our number 123 ABC where we can
go to our pages of punctuation and
characters and whatnot just like we can
on the adapt text keyboard and both of
them work pretty nicely you know when
you're typing they have a good
prediction on both and you know they're
both solid keyboards we'll just do a
quick typing test and this we will put
let's see if the stock keyboard can
stand up well type perfectly no errors
and it was a moderately fast pace you
know about as fast as i can go
accurately and we will type the same
thing on the adapt x keyboard let's see
if the stock keyboard
up it timed it perfectly there and I
think I you know I tried to go a little
bit fast around the adapt X keyboard
anyways but so yeah it typed it on the
adapt X keyboard perfectly and it also
typed it on the stock keyboard perfectly
too so when it comes down to it you know
you're basically just going to have to
choose your own personal preference a
lot of the keyboards we've seen today
are great keyboards and the adapt X
keyboard can run with the pack and all
the other ones can run with the pack so
you know it really does come down to
preference you guys but that was our
