buds are good ear buds right not quite
if you want to make volume changes skip
tracks or make and receive calls you
want to make sure you have the right
pair of ear buds for your device that's
why today we're looking at the clips
image s for a and s for eye ear buds
before we get into the rest of the
review let's take a look what the
difference is between the image s for a
s and the image s for eyes you might
have guessed already but the s for s are
designed for Android devices and the s
for eyes are designed for iOS devices
besides what kind of advice they'll
control they're identical when it comes
to everything else as soon as you open
the box you'll notice the ear buds
nicely packaged in a plastic backing the
only other thing you'll see at first is
the carrying case which is more of a
pouch open this up and you'll find the
rest of the rubber tips for a total of
four pairs of tips and a clip to attach
the mic and button to your clothes if
you look at the highest end clip ear
buds you'll see a bunch of crazy
materials used but the image S for a and
s for I use plain old plastic still the
build quality is pretty good I didn't
notice the flimsy feeling that you do
notice in Cheaper pairs of earbuds not
that this should be here anyway for the
price the style is always going to be
more of a personal thing but I like the
black and silver styling it's much more
striking than the usual one color scheme
you see in a lot of earbuds the images
also sit pretty flush with your ear so
they don't stick out as far as a lot of
pairs do you're never going to lay on
one side of your head on a pillow
comfortably but I've never noticed a
pair of ear buds that let me do this
anyway while the s4 eyes will work with
any iOS device out of the box the s4 A's
seem to have trouble with full
functionality on a lot of Android
devices
klipsch recommends using the clipped
control app to provide functionality for
a lot of phones it doesn't seem
necessary always the functionality is
the same either way there is only one
button here and it controls everything a
single click plays or pauses music
and it will also answer a phone call and
view or unmute the mic during a call
double clicking skips the music to the
next track these functions worked fine
the rest well didn't you're supposed to
be able to triple click the button to
skip to the previous song but am i
testing this always called the last
person I had talked to a long press is
supposed to control volume but this
always pulled up Google now or Google
search looking at the Play Store I can
tell I'm not alone clips had said
they're looking into a fix but I
wouldn't count on it
call quality was good when using the s4
A's for hands-free calling the incoming
audio sounded as good as a phone call
can an outgoing audio was the same well
I did test the headphones using a high
quality audio interface and headphone
amp most people are going to use these
with a phone or similar device so that's
what I did for most of my testing too I
didn't have EQ or anything similar
enabled either
these earbuds use a fairly high powered
driver so the low-end reproduction was
very solid and accurate you hear what's
in the song and that's it I like this
but if you want more bass you're
probably going to want to use your
devices EQ to bump it up the mids are
similar solid accurate and not boxy
sounding know overly wolfy sounding
lower mids and no high harsh mids unless
they're in the song already the high end
is very clear and open sounding it's not
muffled or muddy but it also isn't harsh
or irritating this is one area I think
everybody will agree this is a good
thing both the s4 a and that's for I
used to go for about 99 bucks now you
can find them online for a closer to 40
or 50 bucks for that price they're
definitely worth it for this sound alone
on the other hand if you use Android and
really need these inline controls you
might want to look at another pair and
that's it for this one guys if you want
some more details there's a link to the
accompanying article in the video
description down below while you're down
there you can find social media links to

authority crew now if you haven't yet
