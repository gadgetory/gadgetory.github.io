since the Nexus 6 was announced last
year it's been one of the most
polarizing Android smartphones pretty
much ever it's big it comes with some of
the best specifications you can find on
a phone anywhere and it has one of the
best experiences we've ever seen on
Android but there are a lot of things
that not everyone knows about the Nexus
6 and a lot of things omitted from the
spec sheets when it was first released
so here are some Nexus 6 tips and tricks
first things first this film comes
unlocked from Google which is standard
for most Nexus devices but unlike most
unlike smartphones this phone in
particular will work on pretty much any
carrier here in the US so there are two
separate SKU models one is for the US
only and the other is for the rest of
the world if you get the US only model
of this phone you're looking at GSM
support for 850 900 1800 and 1900 as
well as CDMA bands 0 1 and 10 that's
already a lot of support there but
you're also getting WCDMA bands for one
two four five and eight as well as
practically all LTE bands basically this
means that you could get the unlocked
version like this one here straight from
Google and put a Verizon SIM card in and
it gets CDMA support LTE support make
calls and have a fully functional phone
and theoretically if you can get a phone
from Verizon and have it unlocked you
could also take that to another carrier
if that carrier permits so it all is in
the hands of the carrier not the phone
the phone is capable and it's just up to
the carrier to actually allow that but
when you get a big smart phone like this
which has an awesome display really loud
speakers and practically caters towards
multimedia consumption you're also going
to want to keep an eye on your data
consumption because you can blow through
your data cap very very quickly the
easiest way to do that is to pull down
your notification shade and long press
on your mobile network settings that's
immediately going to shoot you over to a
quick overview of your data consumption
and then from there you can go into your
data settings you can set your limit
other things there but that's a quick
way to check your data consumption for
the month this smartphone may also come
with a large battery in comparison to
other smart phones it has a 30 to 20
milliamp hour battery
but despite the proclaimed one day
battery life many users struggle to make
an entire day on this phone even though
it does have a pretty large battery
fortunately there are some ways to
combat that one way is by turning off
the ambient display mode which
also the screen with notifications as
they come in not totally unlike
Motorola's own active or attentive
display features on both Moto X's
personally I really find the ambient
display feature really helpful but if
you turn it off google claims you will
get an extra 80 hours of standby time so
that's a pretty significant difference
and if you want to improve the battery
life on your Nexus 6 you might want to
consider turning that feature off if you
decide not to turn off that feature you
may want to consider bringing this guy
along with you this is the turbo charger
which comes in the box with the Nexus 6
and it supplies a whopping 15 watts of
the charge that's a lot more than what
most other charger supply and with as
little as a 15 minute charge google
claims you can get another 6 hours of
use out of the Nexus 6 now I don't know
how close to that six hour figure I get
with the Nexus 6 when I use the turbo
charger but I can definitely say it
charges a lot faster with this thing
than the other charges I have despite
having higher amperages the turbo
charger definitely works and if you have
another $35 laying around it's worth
getting a second one unlike its smaller
sibling the Moto X the Nexus 6 actually
comes with qi wireless charging and that
was actually something that was not
mentioned on the spec sheets when this
phone was originally announced it
definitely has it in there and if you
place this on a Qi charger it will
definitely charge and now it's actually
listed on the spec sheets on both
motorola and google sites but originally
it wasn't it's a really easy way to get
a supplementary charge just drop it in
the charger when you're not using it and
when you pick it up later you'll have a
little extra juice some people don't
care for wireless charging it doesn't
hurt to have it there personally I
prefer it another feature not originally
announced alongside the Nexus 6 is it's
resistant to the elements like the Moto
X it is water-resistant and it doesn't
necessarily come with an IP rating or an
ingress protection rating so I don't
exactly know how protected it is against
the elements but it definitely is
because it has a nano coating just like
the Moto X the 13 megapixel camera
around back not only means you can take
high-res pictures but also high-res
video it's not enabled by default but if
you go into the camera go to settings
and choose your video resolution you can
actually choose Ultra HD or 4k that's
right
this thing will also shoot in 4k and
it's optically stabilized which is very
very helpful lollypops new sound and
notification settings might take some
getting used to but they also come with
a very very helpful feature called
downtime downtime is basically a do not
disturb mode which you can set on a
schedule simply go to settings sound and
notifications interruptions and scroll
to the bottom there you can set the days
of the week and start and end times for
downtime another lesser-known fact about
the Nexus 6 it has a notification LED
but where it's actually right below the
speaker on the front the earpiece
speaker at the top there's an LED
notification hit just underneath that
just like with the first moto X it's not
in use though and you can't use it
unless you root so it's there it's for
the taking but you have to be able to
root and unlock your bootloader to take
advantage of it finally because this
thing has such a large display it's
really nice to be able to take advantage
of different keyboards now of course you
can go to google play and download a
third-party keyboard like swift key or
swipe or any of those third-party
keyboards but there's actually a
built-in keyboard from Google which will
actually allow you to take advantage of
the extra space the next time you have
your keyboard open long press on the
comma and go to keyboard settings from
there go to appearance and layouts
custom input style and create a new
keyboard choose your language of
preference and then scroll down and
select PC the next time you open your
keyboard hit the globe key and you
should have a dedicated number row
alongside some dedicated symbols buttons
going back to your old keyboard as as
simple as hitting the globe key once
more but that is going to do it for the
Nexus 6 tips and tricks if you enjoyed
