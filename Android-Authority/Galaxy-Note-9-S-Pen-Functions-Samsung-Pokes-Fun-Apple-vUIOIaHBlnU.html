Samsung poking fun at Apple some of my
guys at Android Authority think they are
cringe-worthy I think they're pretty
funny but I'm also into dad jokes so
what do you call a B that gives milk a
boo be like when one customer asks why
the iPhone 10 doesn't have microSD
expansion support forget this guy buy
this guy or when another customer
confirms that the Galaxy S nine has a
faster download speed than the iPhone 10
the Genius Bar person can only say the
download speeds aren't faster than the
Galaxy S 9 smartphone of the future but
unlike my coworker all over an android
authority who wrote this article I do
not think these videos are cringe-worthy
I think they're hilarious
but I'm 45 years old and may have a
different taste than you do however the
big point here is that the vast majority
of iOS devotees do not care about the
speck bumps on the Galaxy S 9 they don't
they're like my 16 year old daughter if
it's not an iPhone it doesn't matter she
doesn't want it she doesn't care that
the cameras better she doesn't care that
it's faster she doesn't care that has
expandable storage she doesn't care what
she wants is that little Apple logo on
her phone
moving on to news regarding the s-pen
from the galaxy note 9 it could have
some funky features new renders of the
galaxy note 9 in purple and blue have
surfaced online but we've also seen
leaks of a new Samsung wireless charger
that will be able to simultaneously
charge the Galaxy Note 9 and the
upcoming Galaxy watch the leaked image
comes from Roland quant on Twitter who
shows off the product in retail
packaging new information about the
s-pen for the galaxy note 9 and its
remote functionality has been discovered
xda-developers dug into the air command
app located in the leaked Samsung Tab s
for firmware inside they found several
codes
that hint at some of the stylists remote
functionality here are some of the
claimed features of the upcoming s-pen
control music by pressing the S pen's
sole button remote camera shutter button
ability to turn on the note 9s display
and unlock the handset as long as the S
Pen was removed from the phone before it
was locked
an option for third-party app
integration long pressed the S pen's
button for launching a specific app and
potentially customizable actions for
single and double presses of the S pen's
button those are all things that power
users are going to love and that phone
is really about power users let me know
what you think about the S pen's
features in the comments below wait wait
wait wait I got another one no you can't
you can't tell jokes I put a woman's PMS
period one more thing before we go guys
I wanted to give a heartfelt shout out
to our number-one fan Christian Pro Dan
Christian I'm gonna send you one of
these I don't know if it's gonna look
exactly this but I'm sending you a
t-shirt
take care
