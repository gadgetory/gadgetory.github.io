app guy here and in this quick look
video we're going to check out seat geek
version 2.0 let's get started okay for
those who have never used seat geek
before here's how the application works
it allows you to search for events in
your area based on performer or by venue
and then you can browse and purchase
tickets that core functionality is still
there in the latest update so current
users shouldn't see too much of a
difference in terms of sheer
functionality the update does bring
three new features the first is the
ability to save and track performers so
if there's a sports team or an artist
you really like you can save them as
favorites and then get updates when they
do shows or have live events in your
area similarly you can also track
specific events it is insanely easy to
do and once you get everything set up
it's also really helpful no need to wait
to hear about the events on the local
radio station the second big feature is
notifications once you have gone through
and selected your favorite performers
and started tracking events you'll get
notifications about those events and
performers when something new happens
maybe a musician announces new tour
dates or something similar these sorts
of things will now show up as
notifications so you'll know what's
going on the third big feature is
curated browsing it doesn't look
altogether different from normal
browsing but if you follow a lot of
performers or a lot of events then this
feature can help you search for what
you're looking for without all of the
other random stuff there really isn't
much else to say the new features are
integrated beautifully into the main
application and current users should
have no trouble integrating these new
features into their experience the UI
looks really good and it's your classic
holo with a little material design
thrown in there is nothing difficult
about this application it looks really
good and we really liked all of that
we're sure there are some small things
here and there that aren't totally
perfect and a few bugs but overall this
application is fantastic and anyone who
likes going to live events should have
this it's free in the Google Play Store
and we'll have a link posted in the
video description below along with the
written version of this video and that
about does it for this video don't
forget to subscribe to the Android
Authority YouTube channel if you haven't

everybody and have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
