original android hangout show on google+
I'm dare cross and I'm Scott Anderson in
this week unfortunately we are joined by
we're joined by Dan Charlton are
returning special guest that is in
charge of developing many many roms roms
well or Kirk kernels for team it thanks
I think uh yeah well so so Scott what do
we got on the agenda this evening well
we got a lot of app updates on maps
chameleon and a lot more some new eps
and a lot of updates we also have some
carrier news from verizon and basically
basically making all the things LTE
we're also gonna be talking about some
device updates we have some new phones
tablets in some notes plural we're going
to go into some root and ramen uh s she
has three got some news about that and
also some cm10 90s and then we got some
this week towards the end of the week we
got a lot of Google Play Store updates
and some pretty exciting stuff rolling
around that and then to wrap up we're
gonna be talking about patent wars and
motorola's new filing also Samsung and
Apple as it as they go into their final
words on Tuesday all right so let's talk
about some app updates everyone's
favorite Kickstarter launcher we've
actually had exclusive interview with
them a few weeks ago chameleon had a
major update this week a lot of people
wanted the ability to add custom
wallpapers the developers heard about it
and now we have that ability with
chameleon so you can going to install
your own custom wallpapers you no longer
need an internet connection as well when
first launching chameleon and what it
did is it basically made sure that you
were authorized to actually have
chameleon so that they remove that
requirement and Internet
action is no longer needed and more
importantly users no longer need to
enter their people play password for
verification when you first install the
app so that that's very nice um they
fixed a couple issues such as app tray
icons were being duplicated when getting
the app information they improved home
screen na manager interface they
improved widgets and wallpaper icons and
they implemented some widget API is in
preparation for their own upcoming
widget edition because we know that it's
lacking some widgets right now there's
only a few available and also those
widget api's will be able to be used by
third-party developers in the near
future and as is Dan Terrapin says needs
more widgets now and it does it has a
lot of potential um oh it definitely has
potential I think it's a very neat
launcher it I think the intense the
ability to yeah I have based on your
location your we know the time of day
and so forth to have that be your
starting your default launcher or you
default home screen that's the coolest
thing about it in my opinion um the
widgets will make it golden it's just
not there yet but you know they're
making progress they're releasing
updates and that's great now I'm happy
to see them continuing you know to to
develop it and continue to add what we
need what we want and just a note on
that and how dedicated they are to this
launcher when we did our interview with
them they stayed on and we talked to
them for about two and a half hours
about very specific things and how they
want to go forward we put in some of our
suggestions and they were jacked up
about it so they seem they really
excited very eager they seem really
excited and very eager to bring the best
product possible to people I was ever
with that said a lot of our viewers are
in Turing and rom and running custom
roms right now their main focus is to
make sure it works on official releases
only yeah and that was actually part of
the recent change log as well so
Oh will will keep you updated anything
changes in the future but we did
exclusively talk to them about wanting
to have a root support and and wrong see
a custom rom support so hopefully if
those issues are resolved in the future
as you know does jelly bean ROM future
and so forth we'll we'll keep talking
with them and hopefully those issues get
resolved so let's talk about another
big-ass Pinterest Pinterest for Android
just got released it was very highly
anticipated it's a fast growing social
network for sharing pinning things that
interest you yet imagens male um that's
cool if you use it if you use Pinterest
it's too it's a great social app really
in terms of just the Apple own the
picture staff is very nice for its first
release I mean it has a lot of
functionality it's very smooth um it has
nice you know editing for Ted at your
own profile to go ahead pin items to add
a pins and to search popular posts as
well as you know the categories and so
forth it's a very nicely designed app
it's very clean and you know it is
pretty high I don't use Pinterest but I
like the app it's very neat up I don't
know how much I don't think it's going
to make me start using Pinterest but for
those of you that do use Pinterest I I
think that you know get the app
definitely it's as much medium is it's
nice so so Dan do you use Pinterest of
all know I really don't have any idea
what it is or what it does oh you've got
you use Pinterest um I initially signed
up for it and I thought it was a very
very interesting concept um but I i find
myself just kind of centering myself
around google+ and i think that's enough
or yeah it's very hard to manage
multiple social network special time job
to do that yeah but i do like the fact
that I can you know categorize all of my
favorite things into different
categories if google+ had that I just
really categorize all the things
categorizing all the things that should
be the most circling
the things yeah you know what I keep
hearing it that Pinterest is for women
women it's a has a very large presence
on on pinterest a ghost single men head
over to pinterest um good to know yes a
good but uh I'm curious knowing any of
our women viewers think of Pinterest
since it's a has a high high amount of
women on that network let us know what
you think I'm curious if you're using
the app so moving on to more apps Google
Maps was updated this week and its
biggest thing in my opinion was the new
icon I'm just kidding um it did have a
new icon and the new icon has the g on a
map it's neat looking but the biggest
thing is that has over 1,000,000 public
transit stops so hey it's focusing on
public transportation at the the new
transportation layer adds the ability to
browse by mode of transportation and so
forth so it's very cool you can use it
to get around die if I lived in an area
that had more public transportation I
would use it more that's very cold oh
you can also you mean you can always do
some limited sort of mode of
transportation right like you could
select public transit or car or walking
but now you can drill down a little
further especially for for metropolitan
areas that have multiple forms of public
transit and you can get just bus or just
subway metro rail whatever you have
locally yeah I think you can get a lot
more specific just within public transit
yeah since I got my new job a month ago
I took the bus just because it's cheaper
and I've been using it and this update
is frickin awesome you get to see all
the bus routes where they go x 2 does it
yeah using the times what times they
arrive it is very very uh huh and I just
want to say hats off to Google because
it's really really nice yeah i mean i
don't use public transit
I don't really live in an area that has
it to get from where I am where I need
to go but yeah like in in places where I
did that would have been extremely
helpful to have that on hand and if you
ever need to in the future arm it's very
very simple to learn just with the
Google Maps app like literally it's so
easy so um another couple features the
borders of cities postal codes and more
now highlighted in surveys and you can
browse by day to day display of where
you've been in your location history so
just a few location history my place is
so forth updates which is nice so when
you want to know when you want to stalk
yourself yes it's great I I checked it
out kukula you know I was able to see
you I recently was on vacation so I
would have think I would be kind of neat
if that feature was available then
another thing that was really cool is
the fact that it actually saves your
home and work address so when you go to
my places on the top and this second so
the person the second slots are home and
then work which is awesome because those
are the ones that you use the most yep
now home and work our new they've always
been there um but having them show up is
a place though and your rent rather than
a star well under location history
you've always been able to set your home
yeah no no I understand that you be able
to set it but in my places instead of
just a star on the address it would be
home and work which is really nice let's
talk about Instagram you know I loved
Instagram for that first month it was
out I was honestly I became a
professional photographer for about a
month I'm not gonna lie it's a good mean
for you then instagram made me a
professional photographer for a month um
so the latest version of instagram
version 3.0 came out this week it
introduced photo/matt which is cool so
you can see where you're taking photos
where photos are at it's a nice way of
browsing photos on a mat um they having
of the slightly new design for user
profiles
not a parts of the instagram app user
profiles looks nice and it's all so now
you have the ability to write longer
captions on photos when you're when
you're sharing them you're the small
character limit isn't there so the
biggest thing on this is longer captions
and photo/matt photo maps your kind of
cool wife I actually reinstalled the app
and played around the photo maps are
very nice if you're an Instagram user /
professional photographer you know
because Instagram makes you the
professional photographer least that's
what hipsters think so check it out it's
very cool the maps feature is your name
iphone users I'm so you know what iphone
users don't like the fact that US
Android uses her on Instagram remember
that bit I want to feel like to yet I
believe that we're talking about that on
Twitter yeah I think so it was i was at
hashtag they were using oh I forget
wasn't it something like a few Android
he was so nasty all I know is really
deeply basically all they said was all
the poor people were here now you know
like soleta yeah buddy android users
report android phones cost add we're
gonna go off on a rant exact same about
that if you didn't rustins but that's
another show topic i took on contract
that cost us in fact apps here so
instead of new apps an app actually died
this week flash that's a combination you
can no longer install flash off from the
place from the Play Store yeah so if you
have it on your device you're cool it's
going to stay there it's not gonna
disappear overnight but if you get a new
device you for map of a blah you can't
install from the Play Store now you can
still install it you know side loaded
you can still download the apk from an
alternate location and manually install
and that's fine it's gonna work great
but remember chrome is the new big boy
on the next seven in chrome no matter
what you're going to do Chrome will not
support um flash that's just how this
adobe isn't going to support it because
adobe said that six months of hano six
months plus the other they're not doing
that actually i think they said back in
december actually they said they're not
going to support anything else you on
what stock ICS came with so good
yeah so you can go and install it you
can find in various places on the web
and even Paul Brian actually from Monaco
publish a nap on the Play Store I don't
member the exact name something like
flash installer yadda yadda you download
that install the app what it does is out
there installs the flash app for you so
if you need if you use the old browser
you need to use flash there you go you
can you can still do it there's a way or
two around it for the time being but
remember flash is one of those
applications that every month has new
vulnerability and it's not going to be
patched anymore so you know be where
you've got your own risk so long google+
good updated didn't Scott yeah google
post got updated um kind of a big update
for hangouts on air which is kind of
nice mobile devices can participate and
watch hangouts on air which is awesome
um I used okay they can water Balz know
to watch you can join now yep Washington
participate that's what I meant by
participating um and then also uh teens
are now able to join hang outs from
their mobile devices you know what and
if I was a teenager Woodrow Claire not
but that that would be cool you know I
mean I many teens are something that can
strive to build protecting and so forth
and to give them the ability to call one
another up and do a big teeny bopper
chat that's cool if I was a teenager if
I had an LTE connection in my school and
all my friends at LT might line your
school's probably good Wi-Fi now uh yeah
okay well a it's been a while since I've
been schools schools nowadays have Wi-Fi
it's crossing years ago what were you
were senior two years ago you didn't
have Wi-Fi I was fourteen yesterday I
just turned fifteen so no I I mean
middle school didn't have it his high
school will I hang out during class
would be friggin awesome just chillaxin
you know if you're taking attack
pretty sure teachers would be rather
upset with that idea but you know
whatever yeah that's cool yawns don't
hang out in class we think about it get
some sort of more practical you can do a
hangout that's what a practical uses
let's say you're sick you get to take
notes from your teacher that's actually
a practical use for teachers would
brought just apply serene absolutely if
a teenager's wanted in colleges be
broadcast their classes on the YouTube
yeah I want you teenagers that are
watching and listening to this I want
you to go up to your teacher and tell
them that you now have the ability to
lay in bed at home and remotely do go to
close their class all that need to do is
create for Scott Anderson Philippe like
I do go ahead and do it he thinks it's
gonna work I don't good I have no ok so
talking about LTE um let's move on
superior news verizon released 30 for
new markets and um it was a huge roll
out um 34 markets and seventy-five
percent of the population yeah it is
ridiculous on health they say that they
are ahead of schedule so I'm excited to
see where they're going to be at the end
of the year I think that they are going
to surpass their goal just to kind of
say hey we're moving a lot faster than
you and I think it'll be really cool and
I'm happy with the progress and 174
markets I believe are 400 they want to
have by the end of this year yeah I uh
Derek a big coyote and where you are not
you know what's got pretty last a list
yeah and I have the 400-ton listen as I
Brockovich depart 832 for sale out of
the four hundred listed markets
huntingdon PA is number 498 thank you
know be really interesting if they did a
list of all the networks or the the
markets that they're currently working
on or in development any kind of cool
it'd be a good teaser yeah I think it'd
be cool
you know what up to i'll tell you what
I've it it would be nice to to have it
here I i'm at work you know 10 hours of
nine hours a day i have it at work I
Wi-Fi work too so don't really matter so
you know and in lemon hill Momo Wi-Fi
when I go out and about it be nice to
have 4g but I can wait a little bit
longer I'm okay right now but I
definitely don't want to be last on the
list you so if you're listening to
verizon honeyed in Pennsylvania read
some need some LTE lovin I'm sorry but
you can you stop calling it for cheap it
just annoys me is LTE LT yeah my area is
blanketed in the hspa+ yeah great the
other plus I don't get it is inside my
office I don't get any reception
whatsoever inside by my area as verizon
up the ying-yang it's all over oh
there's verizon everywhere too but the
t-mobile is very good here yeah so also
it won't look so we've got your phone as
well let's move on to uh well Daniel
actually won't talk about this one the
direct yet yeah a little more carrier
news up dan was talking about it earlier
something about direct TV and wireless
yeah they're planning to they've been
sitting on sort of a large chunk of
spectrum for a while they are planning
to use it to roll out it some kind of a
satellite network nationwide miners
rights BP is going to roll out
nationwide wireless yep like mobile
broadband via satellite interesting i
wonder if a lot of cable providers will
try to get into this cellular network
space well a bunch of cable providers
just sold out a bunch of spectrum to
verizon so they're kind of getting out
of the mobile providing space because
they bought up a huge chunk of spectrum
very publicly we're very big about that
we're going to offer the hole-in-one
services and then didn't do anything
with it and I wonder or not but I wonder
if wired services
just like with ethernet and all that
stuff is going bye-bye I wonder if cable
might do the same thing we don't I don't
know but I'm just saying they're all
they're putting all our cookies in one
jar and I think it's realistic to assume
that cable will get replaced with TV of
via IP wait like you just get an
internet connection and now they also
pay for a TV subscription of some kind
and then you have a data cap that allows
you to watch 50 hours a week and that's
it Yeah right right like yes there are
other problems with that but it's gonna
being like a just ip-based rightly just
like phones are dying to ip-based phones
you know so I don't know that hard line
is going to disappear I mean verizon is
pushing hard their LTE as the
replacement to verizon's dsl you know
but realistically that's just not
practical LTE disappears once a month or
more from verizon like well lit area has
LT on any issues and then they have like
10 of them in a week but verizon's LTE
is still typically slower than a hard
line broadband connection what are you
talking about I a week ago when I drove
through New York City i was getting 20
when i get my 23 down or something like
that that's what i get on hardline
connection i paid a lot less per month
for online connection for more data than
you do for the wireless if you like to
drive back here but that because so
directs you to want it directv's coming
out with a wireless broadband type thing
it's in the works let's move on the next
good explanation lovely but let's put
haunted device updates so we got some
milk to rumors of basically lots of fake
pictures um pictures but be the aluminum
picture no that one's fake but here's
this one's real oh no that one's me to
know what was neat about the note to
rumors was a guy on twitter posted his
own personally designed Makka
yeah and then everybody in the brother
said oh my God look at the moon right
every major new news the site you know
what and I would have done it too so I'm
not better than any of you I would go
into I felt I would have fallen for it
and I would have posted them and said
the exact same thing oh my God look at
these leaks but this would come on I
think they're gonna say look at these
renders somebody potential images
somebody followed the trail and realized
it was just a guy posting his own
personal mock-ups right that's why you
follow the trail before you open your
mouth when you're good it's all about
link bait and clicked in no it's about
holistic anything about journalistic
resources before I go blabbing about
stuff that's not necessarily true you're
not a tabloid oh but tabloids nacelles
yeah really just use National Enquirer
do we just use the tabloid word on enter
30 why alright so moving on no no and
then um so the note 10.1 released and
kind of lackluster kind of hit or miss
reviews I mean it's what do you guys
think it's yeah dan go sorry what was
this happen no then this is one of those
topics where you're going to be strongly
opinionated I know it go TenPoint the
note 10.1 oh it can't lukewarm reviews I
i I'm not particularly impressed ronik
you make an alternate dance okay so I
don't find it impressive I find it
founders blue form as the reviews of bed
I don't want one but that doesn't mean
that other people want I think it has a
specific market I do the eyes I think
that people that want to use you want to
style us you want a stylist you want the
s-pen maybe you're an artist maybe
you're a note taker maybe you use it for
one of those functions or something else
that I can't think I'll thought my head
then yes it might be for you but I I
don't think it's a tab that everybody
their brother wants its has a specific
market
and those of you that have the galaxy
note the phone and absolutely love it
those type of people will be interested
in that happen not necessarily because I
think a decent amount of note people
just bought it because of the screen
real estate as opposed to the 10.1
having the same amount of real estate so
I think it's more about the S Pen oh
yeah well then that's why I Samsung's
putting out the 10.1 to in like another
month that's pretty much identical minus
the S Pen they are just shoving our
devices right now it's got in its easy
to get market share when you're selling
a good bajillion devices that's not a
number exactly well you know what I have
lost count of how many devices Samsung
is released in the last 16 months yeah
but dan when you're the number one phone
tablet no no no is the chicken in the
egg scenario we're doing it because
their number one I'm suggesting that
they're spewing out enough devices that
they're just falling around enough to
make them number one you don't know I
don't think they're doing that I think
when your vices as you want as many
different form factors and styles and
try to find which one works when you're
top dog yeah you have tons of money to
blow that's a glutton figure out what
works yeah that's exactly what they're
doing the cash they weren't number one
they got number one by littering the
market with a gajillion devices you got
to spend money to make money and they're
trying to figure out what they are a
large electronics company yeah oh yeah
what PBGC is pretty much just a
smartphone maker right yes as long as
not they have a lot of outside outsides
manuel de peligro edit to find something
that'll stick HTC can't do that well say
I'll tell you what Samsung has to be
doing something right no matter for what
the reason they're doing it if it's to
blanket all the things and hopefully one
thing works or if it's to litter the
market and get market share that way
either way they're doing something right
because they keep producing record sales
yeah definitely I let's move on to the
tab 7 point
zero plus don't you just look okay to
have several fighter those are there now
can we talk about this last week android
device named Martha Graham there they're
very grand I have nothing to say about
it Galaxy Tab 7.0 number 4 I think
they're a stray away from the galaxy tab
but in 18 months no to you so good so
the tab 7 point of + Madrid for got ICS
so if you have our ICS is rolling out in
phases from the droid 4 but the tab 7
point of plus got its ICS update thank
God the only been out for ten eleven
months oh but wait boy the galaxy tab
7.0 L 2 LTE Azure and new Galaxy Tab 7.2
in this one's shiny but it's a 7-inch it
comes with three hundred and fifty
dollars at 350 contract won't know but
there's a specific market for that
people that want to have mobile data
wherever they get it's called I pay two
hundred dollars and then pay 50 for a
mobile LTE Wi-Fi from verizon mold no I
wouldn't get my I just used my phone
because we're that semi-legal to you
guys later no this isn't this is a I'm
blowing an extra hundred and fifty
dollars on something that could cost me
25 to 50 because I feel like blowing
next one hundred and fifty dollars
because it has LTE yeah it has more geez
that is true okay and speaking of black
things the samsung galaxy s3 is coming
out in black didn't that wasn't there a
UK carrier that had a like a promo for a
black one that was 64 gigabytes yeah
exactly 64 gig on your phone the so
those of you that don't think you have
enough storage on your mobile device
Samsung has your back that's 64 with
expansion slot that will fit in other 64
yes so it's great you need 128 gig in
your in your pocket Samsung has your
back I think that's what a run actually
see 128 there just aren't chips that do
128 if you want to run a business server
okay I mean I'm here for your phone it
and I'll possum at samsung galaxy s3
black you are better marketing thing run
your entire business 128 gig we have 4g
LTE dual core or quad core two gigs of
ram basically you can have a server in
your pocket it's a business in your time
and it doesn't have the LTE you know
what all you gotta do is install andrew
uh you know an apache web server on
there what's that yeah you're good to go
right I don't know if there is an Apache
for Android interesting yeah hey okay so
we've got another device that pass
through the FCC are the issues TF 500t
so a lot of it is kind of unknown um but
what do you guys think it is it's
probably a tablet it clearly passed on a
sec yeah it's a tablet but what's
interesting is you know people are
calling it the transformer prime 21
thought that's what the transformer
infinity was the transformer prime to
school it was our sauce they've just
been spitting out tablets this year we
want to go tablets though when you can
without like I don't I don't you're
doing well like asus is throwout talents
and see what people buy you have the
market you have money for it I just like
that they're spewing out very high
quality product no they're all great I'm
not knocking the quality of their
products i'm just saying they put out
the transformer and then a year later
they put out the transformer prime and
then three months later they put out the
transformer 300 tea and then three
months later they put that transformer
700t and then three months later you've
got the 500 t like what the s hey god
did do it well I'm God when I can I rub
dirt do you see John's comments on our
post
john curley oh no oh is that a server in
your pocket if he's happy to see me
stunning oh man that's great I'm
renaming the show that those great we
publish this later on YouTube institue
in the itunes and everything dad is
going to be our show topic alright
Darren Romick all right so rude and Rana
night so we have a lot of views this
week those of you that have a samsung
galaxy s3 and one of the most popular
phones out there now you'll be happy to
know that there's a rumor saying in
about two weeks you're going to get
jelly bean in to back up that rumor a
leaked rom for the samsung galaxy s3 was
found on the interwebs it's a preview
version a test build it's not a hundred
percent working some things are kind of
iffy but it is a leaked realm of jelly
bean for your Galaxy s3 so so right now
um the ICS are sorry v.v launcher is not
the jelly bean launcher um icons and
widgets don't move around whenever
you're putting a new widget a new icon
do they don't they don't move out of the
way as they do in jelly bean so that
functionality isn't built into the
TouchWiz launcher yet uncle your tummy
it still looks like gingerbread yeah it
looks like gingerbread um the ICS search
widget is not a new updated jellybean
looking one but Google now does work so
you know Google now those work from it
uh what's kind of interesting is
remember when s being came out s beam
was very cool because it was a front end
for uh for Wi-Fi direct and then an
Android 4.1 jelly bean basically came
out with a similar function where now
Android Beam sets of a Bluetooth
connection to share images and videos
and so forth and those two are fighting
right now basically TouchWiz is trying
to use
some software it's trying to do s beam
to regular devices so they're fighting a
little bit right now but this is a test
build so that's going to be resolved in
the very near future I would assume so
we have one with hope so that's cool now
now speaking about the galaxy s3 verizon
users remember you guys have been
screwed for a while that want to read
wrong your galaxy s3 when you see you
guys your verizon user but i'll have a
galaxy s3 yeah very true continue so so
anyways before I was really interrupted
um the the galaxy s3 bootloader it is
locked you know and there's all sorts of
crazy methods out there to get around
that but it doesn't know fully allow you
to customize the button the device until
this week somebody elite a in secure
boot loader for the galaxy s3 on the web
and it just so happens to work
wonderfully on the verizon galaxy s3 so
whoever leaked that thank you very much
the community loves you and developers
did their thing they turn it into a
flashable package with Odin and that was
okay for the first day but because the
Android developers are are awesome they
decided to turn it into an app and put
it on the Play Store so right now if
you're a Verizon Galaxy s3 owner and
you're rooted all you gotta do is search
the Play Store for easy unlock and
download the app install it and then tap
screen once and it unlocks your
bootloader for you it's amazing it's a
one click unlock now at this time it
will not relock the device they are
looking into that functionality there's
no word if that is going to work in the
future but they are looking into it so
11 click one tap unlock for the galaxy
s3 that's great news and following the
unlock a little bit earlier this evening
samsara motorola had some interesting
unlock
news the motorola device unlocked page
is now live on the west it's similar to
HTC devs this website where you go there
you select your device and so forth and
you figure out how to unlock it via the
website right now the new sprint photon
q 4g LTE is listed as a supported device
and then previous supported devices such
as yeah the zoom the zoom Wi-Fi and if
we're in their verizon razor developer
edition are listed of course because
they're already previously unlocked but
the website is live so the exactly said
but it that's a good sign things thing a
good this your progress its progress oh
we have a positive influence yeah you
know this is this is Google's Motorola
this is good news this is very good news
following the good android news of the
week cm10 sometime tonight maybe even
right now is going to start going to
start night least on the first batch of
devices to get nightlies for cm10
jellybean will be all variants of the US
samsung galaxy s3 sony on Verizon Sprint
t-mobile so for that up all home as well
as the international version of the
galaxy nexus variants so the sprint
version the verizon version the gsm
version the nexus 7 as well as all
variants of the nexus s transformer the
transformer prime the SGS one and it's
variants that you have the vibrant the
captivate international in the i9000 me
they're all getting cm10 the sgs2
samsung galaxy s2 the i 9100 g is
getting a cm10 nightly build tonight as
well as the Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9 and
10.1 so the which is the p3 2 p-5 so if
you own a those devices you waiting for
a nightly build of cm10 cyanogenmod has
you covered in some time this evening
they're going to be available progress
is great i'm sure they're going to start
adding on more devices for night
in the near future you can go to get cm
to check them out whenever available on
download and started start your flashing
pleasure um as a quick note here the
u.s. verizon galaxy s3 will need to have
its bootloader unlocked as we just
talked about for the cm10 bill to make
sure you do it obviously with your own
discretion but you need to have your
bootloader unlock 22 installed cm10 on
that that's about it for Rueter on this
week we had I mean cm10 is great news
and unlocking boot loaders on your lock
devices is great news so we had some uh
android / google updates this week yeah
actually a lot arm the google play store
got an update to version 3.5 points118
and basically what was in it or no
three-point 8.15 my no that's not right
it is it is yeah oh I switched on my 8th
my 15 sorry about that um celexa clutch
base but basically what what this new
update brings is get cards and that's
also that doesn't actually bring the
gift cards or is it I thought that was
just in the code right like it's it's
your support is coming and that's shown
in this but it doesn't actually like
they don't actually exist yet yeah but
basically everything was kind of under
the blanket in the code added for future
use um so gift cards um with redeem and
wish lists so wish list is pretty
interesting I'm excited for that gift
cards are great because you can get that
Leland card to something right now
there's ten dollar and $25 gift cards in
that's pretty cool if you want to check
it out or you want to redeem something
Play Store calm / right
also google enabled the smart app update
that they were talking about at google
io 2012 basically what this does is it
takes the app and
imagine additional but the changes yeah
yep does it really sucks it's it's it's
basically overriding everything that
gets changed and adding everything
that's new and deleting anything deleted
you know ultimately what this does is
the app updates the data that you need
to use is significantly less now for
example the Instagram update that was
with the location photo sharing the app
is normally about 13 megabytes and
normally if you were to update that app
you'd have to redownload 13 megabytes
because that's how big the APK is you'd
have to rewrite the whole thing but the
app update was just 3 megabytes that's
significantly less I think the carriers
are saying hey thank you google you're
putting less wear and tear and less
server load on our networks that are
completely congested so I think that's
cool and I think it's way more if it
consumers are gonna be happy too because
that's less data caps exactly um and
then also more news motorola slashes
twenty percent of their their workers
basically they're gonna focus on fewer
devices and make fewer devices better so
i like the fact that their day focusing
us making 14 razors yeah hey I mean that
is just one device i guess but every
month or so they add one more feature
and release it again and colors they're
not going to release 800 colors that are
really yet every month or so you can re
release it in a new color too yeah so I
like this focus on fewer devices and I'm
excited to see what they call it yeah
hopefully things get better there so
let's move on to some patent news i know
that a samsung reverse apple has been
chugging along that's definitely the big
thing in the news but the the more
recent thing i want to touch on first is
the this new motorola suit apparently
motorola since being owned by google so
this is essentially a google sanction
action has filed suit against apple for
patent infringement
and they're using pretty much almost
verbatim the same kind of rhetoric that
Apple does of thee well we're just
protecting our IP exactly it's you know
honey pie all right to pursue anybody
that's emerging on our blah blah blah
blah yeah the exact same stuff that
apple says and they're they're fighting
back so it's it's seven patents that's
about all we know about it we don't know
what the patents are what exactly the
infringement claims are but it's against
the iPhone the iPad all of the iphones
all of the iPads and some of the mac
computers so and they want to import ban
them yet they want an import ban that
these are the extents of the details we
know that we don't really know what
patents are at stake it's at the ITC I
think so the process is pretty
convoluted and takes pretty long times
with this isn't like tomorrow those
devices are going to disappear but
hopefully tomorrow we'll know a little
bit more about what this the suit is the
the Apple Samsung case is definitely the
bigger one for the week though between
judge Cote basically telling Apple that
they must be smoking crack if they think
that she's going to read all of this
paperwork and in the same day yelling at
Samsung for choosing to not waste time
cross-examining apples not particularly
important witnesses because they wanted
to conserve their time for their own
uses right like she's placed these
ridiculous time constraints on them and
then she yelled at Samsung for
conserving their time so she's been
she's been all over the place I mean I
know the smoking crack comma got a lot
of press but really like her rulings and
her attitude throughout this entire
trial have just been very unprofessional
she very much seems like somebody who's
looking for the limelight for herself
and no longer actually cares about being
a reasonable judge in the trial and the
final words are going to be on Tuesday I
believe Joe i if you base that they have
their final i believe closing statements
yep well what they have left is Samsung
has about half an hour left and apple
has i believe about 16 minutes left or
yeah cross exams exactly and that will
be held tomorrow um yeah but then once
they do that then until tuesday is
closing so close they own their
arguments yeah so if you guys are no
going to listen to news or have
something going on Tuesday and you
really want to know what happens and I
suggest I'm going to be watching my my
phone my tablet all day long I kind of
doubt the jury will come back on Tuesday
yeah but I I think that it'll be
interesting what they're closing
statements are and what kind of for sure
and what kind of foot they leave
themselves on with the jury yes yes I
don't think the jury will come back for
probably not until at least wednesday
probably thursday or maybe friday i'm
gonna say fri I think legitimately it'll
take them awhile to deliberate like
there are legitimately a lot of of
reasonable questions to be asked and a
lot of really detailed crap that they
have to read over like this isn't an
easy case this was over a layperson
right like we know a lot about these
devices because we attend Shinto it but
just somebody off the street doesn't
really know would Android device from an
iphone from any other device because I
don't care about those sorts of things
yeah even though Samsung god I think it
was two or three of their supposedly
infringing devices thrown out of the
case um they still have how many more
it's like I seats like five or six yeah
i mean that's still a lot of advice
really big deal is they got the
international sgs2 removed which on the
one hand i'm surprised that it was ever
included in the first place Apple has no
jurisdiction to sue over that device in
this country it also get imported in any
like commercial way there are people who
privately import them but like Samsung
doesn't have any kind of control over
that yep very true like that device
never should have been on the docket in
the first place now I mean that's really
the big seller out of the sgs2 line is
the
national one the u.s. ones were several
different name devices some of which
aren't even part of this case because
they look significantly different from
the iphone yeah I mean if you guys
haven't been listening to this trial or
reading about this trial and it's very
interesting to see what how they try to
defend their their sides and some of
it's laughable and some of them twice oh
yeah they definitely have a ballot point
thanks very interesting if you're into
that type of stuff but yeah Oh on other
news in kind of are starting to wrap up
got my nexus 7 so so Scott I want to
know right now are you gonna read it
I'll read it yeah Jesus Christ and only
thing I say it's just it's a Wi-Fi only
there's less stuff so I I thought
Anderson is going to root his first
android device and i'll tell you what
i'll be damned if you are doing it wanna
hangout on air oh oh yeah we should do
that we will we will read your first
device on a hangout on man with us oh
yeah yeah whoever up also has a nexus 7
and wants to follow along we'll set a
day for that um maybe next week um if
all timing works out yeah I'm over that
um before sadly after eight one as well
also uh to our viewers if you want to
suggest a nap I take the bus in the
morning and I want to use my nexus 7 to
read news what is the best app for me to
cash all the news before and then read
on the bus before I go to work for after
my suggestion was people currents
because that's I had currently that I
said the same thing so if anybody out
there had any other ideas yeah give us
another idea Scott Scott's look into
maximizes nexus 7 News I said we have
one vote or two votes for current so far
now the thing that really sucks as I
can't connect to the Wi-Fi my work why
not it has a special token that I need
to talk to the ID
IT department in order to get those IT
guy agent your address I'm gonna find an
IT guy and I'm gonna talk to him about a
month and then I asked the question well
you know what speaking from an IT guy we
are in an error bring your own device to
work you want to get on the Wi-Fi should
not be more receptive to that but at the
same time depending on your career
environment yeah policies and so forth a
lot of times you don't want to put
personal devices on a corporate you know
Wi-Fi network so you didn't you know
it's a toss-up depending on what your
policies are where you work at but
speaking of things not related to the
Nexus 7 um I'll a real quick mention the
vizio co-star it started shipping on the
fourteenth just a few days of driving
number I did get a tracking number mine
is on its way here other people started
getting there's actually today many of
you actually may even have it today so
start posting your screenshots your
unboxing videos your walkthroughs
everything I can't wait to see it and
next week we'll do an extensive review
on it because chances are probably one
Monday look it looks by the tracking
number we do have a half shell Vizio
half routing and then a little bit of
news in the between that's not on sale
in general no no because it'll be worse
stock if the viewers like that idea um
let us know um if you want to structure
for next week make the structure for
next week and will follow suit whatever
is the most popular um I'm excited for
it we're pretty excited all right Scott
uh so you know Derek more actually made
a comment Derek NORs a previous show
guests and a friend of ours he actually
asked why not just tether your phone
tether your Galaxy Nexus on the way to
work oh we don't have neck that you got
a root user no I can over the issue iris
he told us before the show he doesn't
get any service on his bus ride to work
if I perfect service I can
they're just fine without rooting jimmy
fox five that is correct okay so so I
mean I I would have no problem good uh
tethering it's just the fact that I get
no service I do get service at work so i
might implement that at work but I still
just mostly the bus run out using a
whole bunch at work just during lunch so
I feel like I'm a what intelr it at work
to catch your bus right at home all
we're getting some feedback on the
routing show apparently Chris thinks
that a routing show is not going to be
that exciting but Chris I guarantee we
will do everything in our power to not
just show a wall of texting commands
well we all do the whip test type tote
tote yeah yeah that's that's pretty
boring yeah well uh we'll do news while
Scott's failing and typing his commands
and it won't just yeah it won't be about
a big DK just to interject in the middle
oh my god i bricked it I'll tell what
we'll we'll add some stuff to it it'll
be fun yeah it'll be a good time alright
guys so so uh next week possible Scott's
first android root no not possible it
will happen okay when will happen okay
good to know and all sorts of co-star
the next generation of google TV

in people's phones today and just to let

this evening it was uh it was great and
