Jace and today we cover things like what
are your best mid-range tablets - how
big can a phablet get before it's too
big and you just look like a douche bag
hello yeah but it's not just the place
where you come to get your Android
questions answered it's the place where
we help you help other less tech-savvy
people amongst us the tech challenge
shall we say I have a little bit of
experience with this mother this
Nigerian prince who emailed you does not
love you he's not real do not send him
money first up Sam asks what is the best
mid-range tablet well right at the top
of that list Sam has got to be the Nexus
7 no it does not have a stellar camera
or a microSD slot but for the price
point it is fantastic you get stock
Android you get updates almost as soon
as Google has them up and from a
day-to-day performance perspective it's
not that far behind more expensive
tablets next up is the Kindle Fire HDX
and although many other Kindle Fires
were considered underpowered and they
really do use a forked version of
Android this tablet has power to spare
if your primary use for this tablet is
media consumption or you're considering
buying this as a gift for a less
tech-savvy user then this device
deserves serious consideration in
addition the Mayday support has been
receiving very positive reviews thus far
and finally we have the Samsung Galaxy
Note 8 and although it does have poor
battery life as has been tested here an
Android authority by Josh it has been by
some been referred to as the Swiss Army
knife of Android tablets because it does
so many things reasonably well and if
you're a fan of the TouchWiz add-ons and
the s-pen provided by Samsung this may
be the tablet for you alright second
question came from be godly and be godly
was experiencing a little bit of buyer's
remorse after leaving his iPhone for a
new Android phone and it was a little
bit of a steep learning hey hey hey hey
hey hey hey no need for that he is not a
sheep you are neo you have taken the red
pill and gone down the rabbit hole to
the Wonderland of Android but you do
need some help so I provided some links
below your name is now neo be godlie neo
there is some links in the show makes
the show notes below for you the first
one is a video series and
for beginners it's going to just walk
you through basic Android operating
system and the second one is a video
series on an app called tasker and
Tasker is an extremely popular app on my
android users you mentioned some tasks
problems within your comments
good luck neo the third question that
came in was when will my note to get
KitKat well you should know the note two
just got jellybean back in April and
that means that the s4 and the note
three have to get kicked out before you
you were like two stages behind
realistically spring if we're you know
that's a optimistic view maybe even the
summer it really depends I mean I it was
announced that my Galaxy Note was gonna
get jellybean last December and it took
till May to get it so you never really
know and the final question that came in
was with regards to phablets how big can
a phablet get before it's just too big
good question I have some personal
experience with this I think the
question is not just how big is too big
but what other devices do I use on a
regular basis so for example when I left
the iPhone a couple years ago and came
to Android I got this and I got this
it was the note was the biggest you know
Android phone you could get at the time
because it was my primary device I mean
this is the only thing I had it didn't
have a tablet and so this was acting as
a tablet and a phone I was reading on it
for long period of time gaming that's
great science or two thumb gaming you
know watching movies for an extended
period of time and as a phone it was
everything but then I got this and this
became my primary media device I did
everything I still do everything on this
I read watch movies you name it I go
everywhere with it and this is regulated
just two things phone calls and
navigation when I'm driving GPS because
this doesn't have GPS if is how GPS I
might use this so I would be better
served to get something smaller and
nimble now I have above-average hands
right I can use this with one hand but
it's it's a stretch I have to strain a
little bit and my hands are a little bit
of average for you know man of my size
I'm almost 6 foot so I think the
question is not how big is too big but
how many devices have you have if I only
had this yes
stick with this it's fantastic
I loved it but if you do have tablets
and I suspect many of you do get the
small phone and nimble and use it as a
phone and this is your media device
thanks so guys one last thing before we
go I read all the comments thank you
very much but one of the most common
questions is something like when does my
version of my phone get KitKat and I
think we might do well to go deep into
the idea of why Android is as fragmented
as it is why manufacturers can't update
all at the same time like Google does
how and why does that happen if you'd
like to go into detail that let me know
in the comments below that might be an
interesting video to do I shall see you
next week on the next Q&amp;amp;A this thing on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
