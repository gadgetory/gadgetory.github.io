Jace and today we cover things like what
are your best mid-range tablets too how
big can a phablet get before it's too
big and you just look like a douche bag
hello yeah but it's not just the place
where you come to get your Android
questions answered it's a place where we
help you help other less tech-savvy
people amongst us the tech challenge
shall we say I have a little bit of
experience with this mother this
Nigerian prince who emailed you does not
love you he's not real do not send him
money first up sam asks what is the best
mid-range tablet well right at the top
of that list Sam has got to be the nexus
7 no it does not have a stellar camera
or a microSD slot but for the price
point it is fantastic you get stock
Android you get updates almost as soon
as Google has them up and from a
day-to-day performance perspective it's
not that far behind more expensive
tablets next up is the kindle fire HDX
and although many other kindle fires
were considered underpowered and they
really do use a forked version of
android this tablet has power to spare
if your primary use for this tablet is
media consumption or you're considering
buying this as a gift for a less
tech-savvy user then this device
deserves serious consideration in
addition the Mayday support has been
receiving very positive reviews thus far
and finally we have the Samsung Galaxy
Note 8 and although it does have poor
battered life as has been tested here on
android authority by Josh it has been by
some been referred to as the Swiss Army
knife of Android tablets because it does
so many things reasonably well and if
you're a fan of the TouchWiz add-ons and
the s-pen provided by Samsung this may
be the tablet for you alright second
question came from be godly and be godly
was experiencing a little bit of buyer's
remorse after leaving his iphone for a
new android phone and it was a little
bit of a steep learning hey hey hey hey
hey hey hey no need for that he is not I
sheep you Arnie oh you have taken the
red pill and gone down the rabbit hole
to the Wonderland of Android but you do
need some help so I provided some links
below your name is now neo be godly neo
there is some links in the show links
the show notes below for you the first
one is a video series and
for beginners it's going to just walk
you through basic android operating
system and the second one is a video
series on an app called tasker and
tasker is an extremely popular app on my
android users you mentioned some tasks
problems within your comments good luck
neo the third question that came in was
when will my note to get KitKat well you
should know the note 2 just got jelly
bean back in April and that means that
the s4 and the note 3 have to get kick
out before you you're like two stages
behind realistically spring if we r you
know that's a optimistic view maybe even
the summer it really depends I mean I it
was announced that my galaxy note was
going to get jelly bean last December
and it took till May to get it so you
never really know and the final question
that came in was with regards to
phablets how big can a phablet get
before it's just too big good question i
have some personal experience with this
i think the question is not just how big
is too big but what other devices do i
use in a regular basis so for example
when i left the iphone a couple years
ago and came to android i got this and i
got this it was the note was the biggest
you know android phone you could get at
the time because it was my primary
device i mean this is the only thing i
had i didn't have a tablet and so this
was acting as a tablet and a phone i was
reading on it for long period of time
gaming that's great size for two thumb
gaming you know watching movies for an
extended period of time and as a phone
it was everything but then i got this
and this became my primary media device
I did everything I still do everything
on this I read watch movies you name it
I go everywhere with it and this is
regulated just two things phone calls
and navigation when I'm driving GPS
because this doesn't have gps if is how
gps i might use this so i would be a
better serve to get something smaller
and nimble now i have above-average
hands right I can use this with one hand
but it's it's a stretch i have to strain
a little bit and my hands are a little
bit of average for you know man of my
size i'm almost six foot so i think the
question is not how big is too big but
how many devices if you have if i only
had this yes stick with this it's
fantastic
I loved it but if you do have tablets
and I suspect many of you do get the
small phone and nimble and use it as a
phone and this is your media device
thanks so guys one last thing before we
go I read all the comments thank you
very much but one of the most common
questions is something like when does my
version of my phone get Kit Kat and I
think we might do well to go deep into
the idea of why Android is as fragmented
as it is why manufacturers can't update
all at the same time like Google does
how and why does that happen if you'd
like to go into detail that let me know
in the comments below that might be an
interesting video to do I shall see you
next week on the next Q&amp;amp;A this thing on
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
