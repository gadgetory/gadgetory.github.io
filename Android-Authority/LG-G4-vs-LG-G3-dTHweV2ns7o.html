past a little bit different from the
competition in a number of very key
areas but is LG's newest flagship now
available on all carriers in the States
enough of an upgrade from the previous
one what we're about to find out because
it's Joshua Vergara from Android
Authority what's going on everybody and
this is the LG g4 versus the LG g3 LG
made it clear that the large form factor
device was here to stay and started in
the g3 to keep the 5.5 inch general
screen size the g3 brought the first
quad HD displayed to the forefront
without any buttons on its face or on
its sides because the signature back
button layout returned from the g2 with
power button flanked by the volume
rocker this design cube became
quintessentially LG and is still one of
its most distinguishing features but the
back also had a brushed plastic design
that gave the phone a sleek and stylish
profile with some of it bleeding into
the bezel on the front that being said
the bezels are pretty respectable so
handling is mostly dictated by the
larger form factor in the screen and the
back cover was removable allowing access
to the battery and the card slots the g4
on the other hand keeps the larger size
but adds in curves not only for
durability but also for handling the
curve is most pronounced on the back so
the phone sets very well in the hand but
the very subtle curve on the front
affords the smartphone a bit more
durability than any typical flat
competitor back buttons return once
again as expected but this time around
the power button is a little thinner and
is not as easy to feel as the larger
circle from the g3 and despite it being
just a bit narrower the g4 is actually
noticeably taller but thankfully the
curve tries to even this out in the
handling Department the finished plastic
backing doesn't quite have the clean
look of the brushed g3 as the subtle
grid pattern seems just a bit
aughter to us in this design cube but
the main story in design for the g4 of
course are the leather backings which
are a big change to the aesthetic
sourced from actual cows and vegetable
tanned these leather backings provide
much more grip and gives the profile
more of a unique look than last year's
offering which we think was the main
point of this change so ultimately
handling is largely the same between
these two but we mostly enjoy the curves
of the g4 LG definitely learned from
their releases in the Flex line and put
the aspects into their newest flagship
the g3 is a bit simpler in its design
philosophy without getting too generic
so the changes in the G form might seem
like they are reaching a little bit
still these are two of the more unique
offerings from their respective release
years because LG has stuck to their
signature design language in creating an
attractive but still accessible line of
devices considering their larger screen
sizes and it's precisely because of the
screen sizes that last year LG brought
out the first widely available quad HD
display while it is still debatable if
this kind of resolution is ultimately
useful for daily usage quad HD is
basically considered a requirement in
the high-end flagship these days
the g3 then was a pioneer in this sense
but the display did not come without its
quirks sure the higher resolution
brought much pixel density but LG made
compromises and how the elements were
displayed on the screen a smoothing was
noticeable especially when scrolling
through heavy text areas and admittedly
colors did like a little bit of punch
despite the LG UI exacerbating this with
its lighter and warmer tones nonetheless
having a larger screen with this kind of
resolution turned out pretty fun for
both work and play
these nuances were not heavy offenders
it was just what we tended to notice
from time to time which is why the g4
needed to improve on the quad HD display
and they certainly did with what is now
called the quantum display science aside
the point of this new version of LG's
IPS panel was to meet a standardized
level of quality the DCI film standard
boosts underneath the surface bring the
kind of saturation that we did miss in
last year's phone but it remains within
the DCI levels of color rather than
going over it like Samsung does
apparently what they're super amyloids
though I did notice some of the
smoothening still happening it was
definitely lower than it was from last
year and because of the better color
output so this is definitely easier to
excuse this year it shouldn't be any
surprise that the g4 screen is an
improvement from last year but in this
comparison it did feel necessary the
enhancements make this a proper flagship
offering for this year and for either of
these devices the larger screen size
should still please anyone that wants a
little more real estate for work and
play LG continues to rep Qualcomm though
this year this may be more true than
ever and to good effect last year's LG
smartphone brought the Snapdragon 801
and the audrina 330 with RAM capacity
depending on how much storage you had
the 800 line
really came out with some speedy
performance around this time last year
and the g3 despite some really feature
pack software was able to move along
without many problems the generally few
instances of stutter were usually the
results of any software presentation
holes and multitasking via the recent
apps screen or via the dual window
allowed for the power user to get done
what they wanted even sometimes all at
once but last year was last year and
performance has taken quite the leap in
this crop of flagship smartphones this
year the g4 fits squarely in with the
best here but not because of really
stripped-down software or even in house
created processors like with Samsung
rather it does the work of a real
optimization that makes this Android
iteration really snappy instead of going
far into the power departments the
Snapdragon 808 with 3 gigabytes of RAM
rounds out the g4 but LG worked very
closely with Qualcomm to ensure the
software was catered to the power of the
processor and vice versa
as a result fluidity and easy navigation
are the cornerstones of this LG UX which
got a few more features from last year's
iteration without sacrificing daily use
speed despite not really fulfilling the
desires of perhaps the overly spec
hungry even power users should get the
kind of performance from the g4 that
they really need so another improvement
arrives in the g4 from the g3 not just
arbitrarily but because some real
thought was actually put into how the
usage of this smart phone could actually
be felt despite changes on the outside
subtle or otherwise much of what comes
underneath the shell remains the same
and that matters more now than it did a
year ago this is because LG finds itself
in a landscape where plenty of other
manufacturers are omitting certain
features that many users view as
essential and in both of these devices
they are found under those removable
covers a replaceable battery and
expandable storage expandable storage is
probably most important considering this
space grabbing rock capture in the
camera of the g4 but otherwise it is
nice to still have that buffer on space
the g3 was our first example of how a
higher resolution screen might blunts
battery life and that meant a solid
day's work might be a little bit tough
to get and though the battery capacity
remains the same this year as it did
last year the LG g4 optimization still
keeps longevity where it should be with
a bit more moderate usage and perhaps
some work to keep the
background apps from running all the
time users can stretch battery life past
the day-and-a-half mark with a little
bit of frugality though it might not
have been particularly important last
year having a removable backing with
everything that it entails flies in the
face of the other manufacturers this
year that have decided not to go that
route and it's a feather in LG and the
g-force cap for this year LG has not
been tried to roll out new ideas and in
the camera that was true for the g3 in
continuing their pursuit of optical
image stabilization the g3 also came
with a laser guided autofocus this was
the main story of the g3 camera as it
thus benefited from one of the fastest
camera experiences available at the time
just type your subject focusing in no
time and get the shot as a result of the
app got simpler focusing on whether you
wanted HDR or the focus and then
shooting the photo or the video with
just a few extra modes rounding out
those features last year we only really
dot down the g3 Ford's noise reduction
and post-processing but it still brought
otherwise detailed and mostly well
colored photos that could be enhanced by
HDR but this year LG bolstered the g4 by
upping the megapixels from 13 to 16 and
lowering the aperture to 1.8 the
front-facing camera was also
strengthened for the selfie generation
with a wide enough angle and eight
megapixels controlled by a number of
gestures most notably the ability to
check the picture by simply bringing the
device down after the shot but along
with the laser autofocus and the larger
sensor comes the color spectrum sensor a
beefed up IR that analysis the scene in
order to achieve proper white balance
levels and dust more accurate colors in
the photo and in the app a manual mode
was added to contrast to the fast and
easy simple and auto modes you can use a
histogram a leveler and change in minut
values everything from the shutter speed
to the ISO to even the Kelvin levels in
the white balance not to mention the
ability to shoot RAW simultaneously so
you can put your own post-production on
those photos and it's that
post-processing that is really the g4
it's only misstep again this year as the
smudgy noise reduction takes away from
what our otherwise really great photos a
better depth of field is observed in
this lower aperture camera and the
colors do definitely get a little bit
more of a boost this time around the
lower aperture also somewhat helps
low-light situations though the larger
sensor can get a bit of this quite
as well again we shouldn't be surprised
that the g4 is an improvement from the
g3 here but what is important to note is
that this year's high quality offering
set the bar pretty high and the g4 stays
with the pack providing a package that
is great for common users as it is just
as good for experienced shutter bugs
finally in software we won't be seeing
quite as much in terms of additions but
improvements have been made to keep the
g4 feeling fresh the LG UX often gets
slammed by users because there are too
many features that bog down the system
and in the g3 that was somewhat the case
plenty of features end up not getting
too much play particularly the qslide
apps that can take up quite a lot of
space in the quick settings but this was
remedied with the release of the
lollipop powered UX which also cleaned
up a little bit of that clutter
unfortunately my g3 hasn't gotten that
update just yet otherwise the new NOC
code rounded out the features that
included the dual window functionality
for multitasking but if you are update
to lollipop much of what you see in the
g3 comes out of the box in the g4 with a
couple of main additions namely the
beefed up calendar that can save just
about anything to the dates and then the
more powerful gallery app that
categorizes pictures and videos in
better ways the smart notice from the
most recent G flex device is here now
too though it now gives even nicer
weather notifications and warnings about
battery draining background applications
but like mentioned before and often it's
LG's commitment to optimizing the UX
with the Snapdragon 808 that yielded a
very snappy and smooth Android iteration
this time around jumping in and out of
recent apps dual windowing and just
about anything else move along with that
much stutter which is important for this
year's crop of flagships and the g4
thankfully keeps to that standard so if
you want fast yet reliable performance
the updates of the g3 help keep it from
falling too far behind but the g4 is
definitely the fuller example of what LG
software can feel like out of the box
though the g3 is increasingly becoming
available for lower prices you will be
buying a previous year's phone though
updates keep it from feeling like a
fossil the g3 is still a great value
especially at those lower prices with a
still solid camera a good daily driver
speed and one of the first quad HD
displays we saw in the world of Android
but for the expected premium price you
will still get the definite premium in
the g4 with improvements across the
board that may
worth the extra dough the camera is even
better than before and is more robust
than ever the user experience is as
smooth as it should be at this point in
the game and the signature LG style
keeps the G line as one of the more
unique offerings especially when you
factor in the leather backings for me
personally I would really like the black
leather backing save some money or don't
that's what it really comes down to but
if you do go for the g3 you might feel
like you're missing out just a little
bit on the latest and greatest that LG
has to offer as always thank you guys
very much for watching and hope you got
something out of this versus between the
LG g4 and the g3 LG's flagships
especially in the most recent past have
been some of the best available during
their years and the g3 as one of the
best from last year is still a great
experience to have now so if you're
looking to save a little bit of money
the g3 is probably a better bet
but the g4 does come with some
enhancements that make it the worthy
upgrade to the flagship and with those
leather backings you might just want a
more unique offering this time around
and also compared to the other flagships
that are available this year the g4 does
provide some features that are missing
in the rest so really it take your pick
but also know your budget and between
these two you're going to get pretty
much what you would expect from an LG
flagship and it is pretty great
so keep it tuned to you for even more
