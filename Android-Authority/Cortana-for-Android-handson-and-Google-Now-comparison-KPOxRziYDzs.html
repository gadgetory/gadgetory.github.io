Authority and yes infront of us here is
Cortana which is much choice assistant
and their answer to Google now on
Android and Siri on the Apple iPhone if
you've been following Android Authority
calm you'll have read that Cortana is
coming to Android and today we've
actually had a first look at Cortana
found with thanks to the leak now in
front of us here is a galaxy s6 edge
we've got Microsoft Cortana running on
it it's not the official version of the
app so there may be some bugs and they
may not have the smooth performs that we
expect from the final app but yeah
Cortana Phandroid is here or be an elite
form so we thought we'd bring you a
quick hands-on and also look at how it
compares to Google now right so we'll
kick things off with Cortana itself on
the Galaxy s6 edge so when you first
install Cortana for Android it asks you
to sign in with your Microsoft account
which is your hotmail account joining
the other ik emerges you've got
registered with my with the Microsoft
account but also ask you your name and
we'll touch on that later on let's first
give you a look at the app itself when
you do launch Cortana you'll see it's
got very Google now like interface it
gives you cards so here we've got
today's trending topics recommended news
top stories and the latest in health
news we've got the weather and there's a
lot more and what you'll see here is a
lot of this is all powered by being
whilst obviously Google now is whilst
obviously Google powers Google now you'd
make sense of Microsoft my Cortana
is powered by Bing from the app you can
customize all of this as well which will
touch on now first let's swipe in from
the left and you can see here we've got
an interface so you see we've got
options for home notebook reminders and
feedback and obviously a big tag that
says that reminds you that actually
Cortana is still in beta mode let's go
into the notebook because everyone has
one of these and it's actually what
really makes Cortana unique the notebook
allows you to tell Cortana more about
yourself and by doing so it gives
Cortana more information to make itself
more useful for you I think that sounds
just about simple enough I'll show you
what I mean
if we're going to eat and drink it tells
you would you like to leave the eat and
drink cards on
would you like top recommendation from
foursquare restaurant recommendations
but it also asks you more information
about your preferences so in this case
how far are you willing to go well I'm
only willing to go within driving
distance go back tap add and then it
knows it'll only recommend places out
within driving distance what type of
atmosphere do r1 and why after a
romantic night now or am after a bit
more of a kid-friendly night out well I
will tell you now that I would much
rather have romantic my app so we're hip
ad there as well next it tells you a
preference or price range now this is
really useful because if you're working
with a limited budget the last thing you
want is a bunch of recommendation for
restaurants that might take up an entire
week's salary for me I'm willing to go
with either but I tell you what the
average person's either gonna know price
or mid range will go in mid range again
once you select one you do have to press
add good thing is say I'm actually gone
actually I want more I want us to change
this is that I can tap back on it tap
this and it lets me change which type of
range I want and then hit save or you
can delete the preferences as well now
asked me about cuisine I mean what type
of thing do you want do you want to go
out to a bar and grilled you want to go
to a barbecue
are you a buffet kind of person Chinese
delicatessen diner French Greek Indian
Italian Japanese Korean latin-american
Mediterranean Mexican and so on there's
quite a lot of options here with enough
to suit anyone I'm Indian
and I am partial to an Indian food but
actually do you know what I also really
like is I actually really like Chinese
food and sometimes I'm partial to just
go into a bar and grow well you can have
a nice meal and have a bit of them a
drink up at the same time now it tells
me obviously what how far atmosphere now
frequency how often am I really likely
to go out well I do go out quite a bit
so I'm not going to choose never because
well it would never give me any
recommendations
I could choose occasionally or rarely
I'll go with the case tree if you're
someone who goes out a lot and need to
have a lot choose frequently now we hit
save so
it's just my settings for eating and
drinking cause Hannah's about more than
just eating and drinking
it makes me specify things like events
finance
getting around getting around is really
useful because this lets you change
everything to your customers needs
there's no point giving you traffic
updates if you're not a driver and the
good thing is you can specify it to tell
you when it's time to leave which is
something that Google now does as well
but remember Cortana and be allowed to
have this option available already is
actually a really really good thing next
we've got traffic updates to my favorite
places homework etc notifying me when
it's time to go to work or head home
really useful because you know if you're
at work who doesn't want to know when
it's time to go home then the question
should be better if you're at work and
your phones telling you it's time to go
home why have you not left already
moving on when using public transport
tells you would you like transit update
sync transit updates to your calendar
event notify me when it's time to go to
my calendar events this useful
this footage features really really
useful because you may have it set that
I have got half an hour to get somewhere
but what traffic of massive traffic so
it means it's gonna take you an hour you
would have no way of knowing that but
actually with Cortana and obviously
Google now say you do know then it also
has trans updates my favorite places
know if I'm yours time to go to work
we'll head home again when using public
transport versus driving obviously
that's the key difference in I obviously
do a lot of driving well I do have a car
an hour drive so I have all this taken I
don't use a lot of public transport but
if you have public transport you might
want to change those options and at the
bottom here you can tap on the driving
and say I prefer to drive or transit and
that will affect your settings within
Cortana press save let's go back don't
in the notebook I look to some more
options so the other options include
movies and TV music news sports I'm a
sports fan all sports car medications
sure score updates for your team's why
not and show up Kim games a match it
definitely add a team that's the main
thing now let's look at what teams are
available if I search for Manchester
United which is a big team and she
started EPO Hey
what about if I go for something a
little bit smaller how about my local
team northward no it's not available so
we're only looking at big teams here
obviously we'll turn type in the
Jacksonville Jaguars I know that team
and let's be honest everybody wherever
you are in the world hazard of the New
York Yankees which aren't there but
we'll choose the Giants whoops my bad
moving back hit save and that gives you
sports updates now if I go back to the
home screen of Cortana what you'll see
here is it says what can I do to help
you now
today's trending stories I have an
upcoming reminder which I've set which
I'll show you afterwards today's
trending stories today's recommended
news today's top headlines place and
health use weather right now pretty
Bank's bog-standard but obviously once
you get to use Cortana a bit more it
knows more about you once you really dig
down and customize everything to exactly
how you want it to be that's exactly
what you kind of need especially where
the fog are back into travel you can add
flights trip plans and all of that as
well and the best thing is caught on
will give you up-to-date flight status
which is really really useful the other
side the Cortana is just like Siri and
Google now voice searching using your
voice to control the app I can to do
things for you ask you to look up things
for you I could show you Cortana of the
same but we're gonna give you a quick
comparison how it compares in a real
world test although it's in beta against
Google now which has probably been doing
this a lot longer I can I say and I'm
back and on the right here we've got the
Galaxy s6 edge with Cortana like we had
a few seconds ago but on the left its
joined by the Vodafone Smart Auto six
which you'll see a review very very
shortly but I really really like which
is running Google now listen the latest
version of Google now we could give you
some demos but the simplest way is we're
gonna hit the voice button on each of
these and then see how they handle with
our various restore tasks I've got a
bunch of questions you can do this on
the fly let's see what happens
what's the weather in New York okay not
bad now they're both connected to 4G
interestingly the Smart Water six is
actually a slightly slower Network and
yet it seems to be a lot quicker again
it's worth remembering Cortana is in
beta and it's doing surprisingly well
for things just in via that Microsoft
probably aren't expecting anyone to
actually go and test at this present
time anyway what's the next question
who's the First Lady of the United
States and there you see on the Left
we've got Google now which went to give
me the entire Wikipedia description
which I probably didn't actually need
hey Cortana it just said United States
first lady is Michelle Obama with a link
the Tobruk a video which is probably the
better implementation least in my
opinion the next question we've got and
this is one I've already tested but
there's one have tested before and
there's a reason I tested this but I'll
show you this afterwards when was the
Magna Carta
right there is a reason I asked this
question and that is because I've done
some testing of Cortana previously and
my testing was with Cortana on Windows
Phone now when you ask Cortana on
Windows Phone when the Magna Carta was
signed
you get June 19th 2012 15 which is
technically the correct answer as well
as June 15th but that's the entire
different story the reason I chose this
is because obviously I've done some
testing of course on it before I bought
you this video and the biggest thing
I've noticed is the number of voice
responses on Cortana for Android is a
lot lower than the voice response is
available when you use the same searches
and Cortana for Windows Phone again it's
worth remembering
Cortana for Android is in beta mode
which makes a huge difference to all of
this let's move on what's another
question what time is it in Venezuela
really quick both are really simple but
you can do things about that next up
where's the nearest Costco now in fact I
think they both give us the exact same
answers pretty much what is very simp
interesting though is that Cortana
brings in Yelp reviews not so useful
with Costco because let's be honest
you're pretty much gonna get roughly
similar experience and most Costco's
what it does gonna be interesting for is
restaurants where we Google will give
you reviews when you go into it in a bit
more detail Cortana tells you they're in
a heartbeat with stars what the reviews
are in this case the Costco in Watford
is got four out of five stars
thanks to 14 Yelp reviews we've got
another one for you when I need an
umbrella tomorrow
no rain is not expected tomorrow in
Pinner the forecast is 24 degrees and
mostly sunny
okay Cortana that's very strange
you've definitely recognized why I asked
well ask Cortana again will I need an
umbrella tomorrow okay so that's why
interesting we had to ask the question
again but really strange but then we'll
come up with another thing they Google
is no you do not need an umbrella why
would you ask such an absurd question
where it's called honest like it's hard
to say what you might have just heard is
Cortana roof spoke to me by my name
well there's not narrate there a bit
nearer but hey I can forgive the fact
that you at least pronounced it as near
even not some of the other stuff which
one of them includes near RB which a lot
of people seem to do moving on the last
question I've got for these two ears
what is the stock price of Microsoft
okay so there's a bit of a crossover
there with the responses but pretty much
they gave us the exact same information
in fact they did accept Microsoft said
Google now said it it closed a forty six
point six two sorry closed down 0.09
percent of forty six point six to a Mike
and Cortana when he closed at forty six
point six two which is down zero point
nine percent or something like that
anyway you can see that giving us should
give you the same amount of information
so there you have what would meant to be
a quick look at Cortana on Android in
its first early asleep form but actually
turned into quite a long video let's be
honest hopefully you found this
enjoyable a little bit entertaining I do
try even if it may not always get it
right
and informative but the main thing to do
was to show you that actually Cortana
forehand point it's really not very bad
we'd expect that the final release
version is gonna be a little bit more
stable a little bit better than this but
overall
Microsoft
really well with their first beat around
normally see me be rats that crash and
although it has crashed once performance
is pretty stable
sure Cortana for Android isn't as good
right now as it is for Windows but
that's probably to be expected hopefully
this will change as it nears release and
eventually does get released but overall
I'm really quite impressed would I use
Cortana over Google now
well it's quite difficult to say and
main reason is Google now is easily a
lot more easily accessible than Cortana
is however it's not it's not saying that
I don't want opening an app to ask for
time or questions and even just have a
conversation because you can do things
like this Cortana will you marry me
rejection from a computer with fast like
that what more could you need thanks for
