ground here at Mobile World Congress
attending pep comms event and we're
gonna take a closer look at the Galaxy
Note 8 a device that was just announced
today versus that everyone's favorite
7-inch tablet was a pure Android
experience the Google Nexus 7 now not
really the fairest comparison as this
only has a 7-inch display
whereas this has an 8 inch display but
you'll find actually that both contain a
1280 by 800 LCD display so we're looking
at a higher pixel count actually a
little bit quite a bit higher of 216 PPI
on the Google Nexus 7 versus only 189
PPI on the Google Nexus 8 now in terms
of the specs pretty different we're
looking at a core 3 here it's obviously
a quad core a 9 and on the Galaxy Note 8
we're looking at a ARM Cortex a9 x
cenotes clock to 1.6 gigahertz now in
terms of the way it's very very
comfortable for the Nexus 7 we're
looking at 347 grams and it's actually
not really heavy at all it's about
three-quarters of a pound whereas on the
Google excuse me the Galaxy Note 8 we're
looking at 338 grams so very very
comparable and a little bit lighter
actually which is impressive considering
it has a bigger battery and it actually
has a larger display as well now on the
rear we're not looking because this is
only a $1.99 price tablet and remember
guys this was really really one of the
best bang for buck 7-inch tablets on the
market but it has no rear facing camera
but we all know what it's like to take
pictures on a camera on a tablet after
all but on the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 we
do actually have a 5 megapixel camera
you know so maybe it's helpful for some
situations but I think most of us would
opt to use our smartphone or an SLR
instead in terms of the battery we're
looking at a 4000 and 325 milliamp hour
battery on the Google Nexus 7 whereas on
the Galaxy Note 8 we're looking at a
4600 milliamp battery battery now this
particular variant that we're looking at
here is kind of cool
because it has an infrared blaster it
has s-pen obviously and it also features
a expandable memory slot and SIM now
they've already told us up for North
American markets we're not going to be
having a launch for this particular
model but it will be available
internationally
it will only be a Wi-Fi model that is
released and a special little friend
named Jess from Samsung here just told
me that the S Pen actually will work for
the contextual menu here and the back
button now and you can physically press
the home button if you so choose to do
so no word on pricing sadly but I have a
feeling I is gonna be priced
competitively the performance is really
really good with TouchWiz is very very
fluid they have incorporated a little
bit more of advanced version of with the
S Pen so we have a reading mode here
which they claim will alter the contrast
ratios and the vibrancy to make it
really really emulate what it looks like
to actually read a real book another
thing to a first for Android they've
included a note a note HD an app that
was really popular on iOS so for all you
guys who like to make notes and to use
the s-pen this will actually be very
very productive for you so obviously
these are two heavyweights in the room
you guys let us know which one you think
is better we have the
soon-to-be-released on the international
stage and in North America the Galaxy
Note 8 versus Google Nexus 7 thanks for
checking us out guys let us know what
you think of the Samsung Galaxy Note 8
and the Google Nexus 7 which one you
think is better and if you like our
videos don't forget to subscribe it's
