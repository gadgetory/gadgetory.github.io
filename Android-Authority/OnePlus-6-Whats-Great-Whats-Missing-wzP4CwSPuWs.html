design a tall 19 by 9 aspect ratio
screen complete with a notch and an
improved camera experience so there's a
lot of things that the one plus six gets
right but we can't help but feel that
they could have done more so here are
three things that we really like about
the one plus six and three things that
one plus could have added to take the
one plus six to the next level so let's
start off with the three things that we
liked first one is the price and even
though oneplus phones have gone up in
price over the years they're still very
competitive and affordable when you look
at it next to the competition such as
Samsung Apple or even Huawei and the
base model of the oneplus six starts at
five hundred and twenty nine dollars and
they completely maxed out one plus six
will run you six hundred and twenty nine
dollars which may sound like a lot of
money but it's still a very competitive
price and you're actually getting a lot
for that money you're getting eight
gigabytes of RAM and 256 gigabytes of
internal storage so the bang for the
buck is definitely still there with the
one plus six number two is the software
experience so while the software hasn't
really changed all that much from the 5
T that's actually kind of a good thing
because it's still very close to stock
and oxygen OS offers a lot of great
customization options and it's probably
the best closest doc experience you can
get outside of a pixel and what the
oneplus 6 you're also going to have the
option of running the Android P beta
when the phone launches which is
something that you can't say about other
flagship Android smartphones
number three is some of the refinement
features that oneplus has added to make
the experience even better on the 1 + 6
so for example the camera now has
optical image stabilization
it also has bigger pixels so it should
be better in low light they've also
added 4k recording at 60fps
and they've also improved the portrait
mode by adding additional bokeh effects
and they also plan on bringing portrait
mode to the front-facing camera with a
software update my favorite enhancement
that they've made is Moo
the Notification slider to the right
side which is much more ergonomic and
easier to reach with your thumb instead
of using your middle or index finger so
I like that change a lot and their focus
on refinement is really what makes the
experience on the oneplus 6 even better
now with that being said here are a few
features that oneplus could have added
to take the experience to the next level
one is wireless charging and while I
don't use wireless charging all the time
I do find the feature to be useful and
it does come in handy when it's there
and a lot of flagship phones nowadays do
have wireless charging the LG G 7th in
cue the Samsung Galaxy S 9 and even the
iPhone 10 have wireless charging and
what the glass back on the 1 plus 6 it
sort of feels like a little bit of an
oversight for oneplus 2 not add this
feature in number 2 is official
certification against water and dust
again this is another feature that a lot
of flagship smartphones have now Samsung
LG Apple you name it they're all IP
certified and oneplus says that the
oneplus 6 does have some sort of water
resistance but it still would be nice to
have that peace of mind and know that
this phone is IP certified so that if
you were to use it in the rain or drop
it in a puddle it's going to survive now
the thing that's really missing from the
1 plus 6 is a standout feature or an X
Factor type feature so the Galaxy S 9
has the mechanical aperture the LG G 7th
in queue has the boombox speaker and the
quad DAC and all the other audio
capabilities and then you have the
Huawei P 20 pro with the triple camera
setup they all have some sort of feature
that really defines them and makes them
stand out from the rest of the
competition and the 1 plus 6 while it's
a really solid smartphone it has a lot
of great features it doesn't have
anything that really makes it stand out
from the crowd so that is really what's
missing here I think oneplus could use
something like that some sort of
x-factor feature that makes people
really interested and compelled to buy
it and if they can figure out what that
is this would be an even better smart
phone but that's pretty much gonna do it
for this video what do you guys think
about the oneplus 6 do you think it's
missing any features or do you think
it's perfect the way that it is let us
