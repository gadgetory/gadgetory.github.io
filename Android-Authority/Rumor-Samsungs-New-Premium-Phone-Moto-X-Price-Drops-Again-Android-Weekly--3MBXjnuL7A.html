is Jace and we talk android news in
these parts and do we have some good
android news for you regarding some sexy
new phones coming down the pike but and
it's a really big but no i'm not talking
about that type of bot i am talking
about the caveat that a shiny sexy new
phone is not going to make you happy
it's going to make your wife poor
smoocher get enough money for a
smartphone but it doesn't have enough
money to buy me off spa day so if you
suffer like i do motorola is trying to
come to our rescue and satisfying the
needs of both wife and geek in a manner
that we hope becomes an industry
standard motorola is bringing in the new
year by slashing down the price of the
16 gigabyte Moto X 2 just 3 99 and 449
for the 32 gigabyte model this includes
both customized moto maker handsets and
even the developer edition at 449 now
for those of you want a wood back model
that would still be an additional
hundred dollars moving on to news about
a google audi partnership the latest car
maker to put android and its vehicles is
audi according to The Wall Street
Journal audi and Google are set to
announce the development of an android
based in car entertainment and
information system now many of you will
want to know the biggest difference
between apple and Google's approach to
these car or vehicle information systems
and the primary difference is that
whereas Apple is trying to use the
iphone as the base to integrate with the
cars information and entertainment
system google wants to integrate android
right into the vehicles hardware so
we'll see how that turns out the
following year now some really
interesting news about a whole new line
of premium phones from Samsung eTnews
that of South Korea is reporting that
samsung will begin producing a new
premium lineup of smartphones starting
this year the devices which currently
assume the code name project F will be
coming to retail as of March 2014
according to a Japanese blog are be men
the devices which are said to be the
next iteration of the galaxy s4 and note
line of devices will not only ante up on
specs but make a radical departure in
regards to Samsung's tried and true
quality now although it's rumored that
the phone will have a metal chasis like
the HTC One will have a 5-inch screen
and a 16 megapixel camera it should be
clarified that this is meant to be a new
line or new family of phones so it's not
an extension of the galaxy or Note
series but it be its own line of premium
smartphones that sounds exciting now so
some very interesting news came directly
from Samsung via an off-the-record
discussion with Samsung's VP head of
design and strategy where he said that
the new samsung galaxy 5 would be made
of new material now many of you were to
assume that new material must be metal
with all those rumors about on metal
chasis for the samsung galaxy s5 it must
be metal not necessarily so there are
many different types of plastic and
again this could all just be a rumor
that's planted by Samsung to get people
I gots to talk about it we'll wait and
see well android army i have to ask you
to kindly not just like and subscribe
and comment on the show but to help me
spread some android love by sharing this
show with your friends so no not that i
can afford to buy in his phone so that i
can afford to buy any puppy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
