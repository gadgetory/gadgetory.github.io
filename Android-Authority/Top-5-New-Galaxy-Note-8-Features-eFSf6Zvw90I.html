authority and the Samsung Galaxy Note 8
is now official and each and every year
Samsung likes to add some new and
interesting features to keep things
exciting so let's take a look at the top
5 new features of the Samsung Galaxy
Note 8
so aside from Catching Fire I think one
of the biggest complaints about last
year's Galaxy Note 7 was that it was
basically an s7 edge with an S Pen
whereas previous Galaxy Notes had
features that truly differentiate itself
from the Galaxy S line I think this year
Samsung did a really great job of
addressing some of those concerns by
making the Galaxy Note 8 still feel like
a brother to the Galaxy S but at the
same time it's a completely different
product that leads me into feature
number one which is the dual cameras
which is becoming extremely popular on
flagship smartphones right now and
Samsung's Galaxy Note 8 is the first
Samsung smartphone to feature dual
cameras and on paper it has the
potential to be the best dual camera
setup we've seen on a smartphone to date
so what you have here is two 12
megapixel sensors with the main sensor
being a wide-angle lens with Samsung's
superfast dual pixel autofocus and F 1.7
aperture the secondary sensor on the
other hand is a telephoto lens at F 2.4
and allows you to get up to 2 times
optical zoom the real kicker here is
both sensors feature optical image
stabilization which is totally awesome
and something we've never seen before on
a dual camera smartphone the second
sensor will also allow you to create a
depth effect similar to what we've seen
on other phones with dual cameras like
the iPhone one plus five or z24 and you
also have the ability to adjust the
depth effect after the fact what I
really love about this new dual camera
setup is that you have the ability to
dual capture so instead of switching
between lenses to capture both a wide
and telephoto shot you can simply
capture both images simultaneously with
a single press of the shutter button
ultimately saving you a ton of time in
the long run
feature number two is the addition of 6
gigabytes of RAM which is also another
first or Samsung ok time out for a
second so as I'm editing this video I
felt like this point needed a little bit
of clarification technically Samsung has
released smartphones with 6 gigs of RAM
before but they've always been region
exclusive that no 8 will be the first
smartphone from
with 16 bytes of RAM that's going to be
available globally so it's going to be
the standard model and everybody is
going to be able to get their hands on
it I just thought I'd make that clear
just so there's no confusion on what it
is that I said anyways back to the rest
of the video and is another way that
Samsung is differentiating the Galaxy
Note line from the Galaxy S and six
gigabytes of RAM isn't exactly new but
it hasn't necessarily gone mainstream so
it's really exciting to see on a more
mainstream smartphone like the note
especially for a phone that's supposed
be a multimedia / productivity
powerhouse and six gigabytes of RAM
should definitely help it do that and I
think a lot of people are going to be
more happy that Samsung isn't just
taking the guts from the Galaxy S and
putting them into the note which is
exactly what they did last year next up
on the list is a new feature called app
pairing and if you love split screen
multitasking you'll definitely love app
pairing a pairing basically lets you
pair two apps together that can either
be placed on the apps edge or on your
home screen and this will open the two
apps that you have pair together
simultaneously in multi window view this
will not only save you a ton of time but
ultimately make your life easier
especially if you have a particular of
apps that you open in multi window quite
frequently so for example you can do
YouTube and Google Chrome Facebook and
Twitter or any other combination of apps
that you want the options are pretty
limited and it's only going to make
multi window that much more useful and
easier to do coming in at number 4 is
live messaging this is one of the newest
features to the s-pen and it's going to
make communicating with your friends and
family a lot more fun it's essentially a
Jif or gif maker and you can draw or
write anything you want and when you
send it to someone it'll animate the
drawing or text and also add additional
effects like sparkles there's a ton of
possibilities here to really get
creative and have fun with your friends
family boyfriend or girlfriend and
because it's just a Jif or gif you'll be
able to send it to anyone without the
need for any sort of specialized
messaging app or service last but not
least is the support for Bluetooth 5 and
gigabit LTE we originally saw these
features debut on the samsung galaxy s 8
so it's only fitting that they made
their way over to the note 8 now if
you're not familiar with bluetooth 5
make sure to check out our very own gary
sims explained video where he goes very
in-depth with bluetooth 5 but
essentially what you're getting is
longer range faster speeds and eight
times the broadcast message capacity you
give a LTE on the other hand is
a bit more self-explanatory its LTE
speeds with a maximum download speed of
one gigabyte per second which is just
crazy fast and obviously faster download
speeds are always a good thing but this
is going to open the doors for a bunch
of new possibilities on your smartphone
like 4k video streaming streaming
content and VR higher quality video
calling and faster access to cloud
storage so that wraps up our top 5 list
of new features on the Samsung Galaxy
Note 8 personally having had some short
hands-on time with Eno 8 I'm really
looking forward to these features and
using them on a daily basis but what do
