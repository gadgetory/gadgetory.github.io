secret pokemon in pokemon go that no one
yet knows about now the question is will
this secret compel you to play the game
that you haven't played in three months
or is it more like Pokemon gone
John henkaa the CEO of Pokemon go
developer niantic has revealed that
there is a secret in the once popular
app that no one yet knows about speaking
to gamesradar regarding the mysteries of
Pokemon go henkka said and I quote there
will always be secrets in the game that
no one is found because we're always
adding new secrets to the game adding
there's one out there right now and
we'll see how it plays out over the
course of the next few weeks when
GamesRadar asked whether it was
introduced with Pokemon goes Halloween
update Henkes said he wouldn't give
anything away no more clues it's
possible that this relates to the
elusive ditto Pokemon which hasn't been
seen since the game's launch well have
you found ditto and do you care let me
know in the comments below now this
one's a biggie mother google has
clarified what the prerequisites will be
for daydream VR ready phones no among
the highlight requirements is that the
device must have at least two physical
cores must support sustained performance
mode and the screen must measure between
four point seven and six inches
diagonally across sad news for the fewer
and fewer lovers of the Sony Xperia
compact it won't be daydream compatible
now it does become clearer when we talk
about processing requirements clear as
mud Vulcan 1 point 0 support alone does
not guarantee compatibility as Samsung
s7 and s7 edge support Vulcan but are
not daydream V already in so far as we
know does anyone else not find this
frustrating I know it is a painful
cliche at this point that iOS is simple
and just works and Android is more
complicated and Kiki but come on mother
Google just tell us does it work on my
phone or does it not now in a happier
note if you've ever felt the need to
start chatting with random strangers
online Facebook has just the thing for
you when I say new we really mean old
but in a repackaged new location
Facebook rooms as a standalone app was
killed off back in december of last year
but it is now reappearing as part of
messenger messenger rooms is basically a
public chat room on whatever topic the
Creator wants think of it like Reddit
but capped at 250 participants
for now rooms can be private as well as
public and Facebook reserves the right
to boot any undesirables if they start
playing up because of course this is the
internet after all the feature is
designed to avoid hassling your friends
about topics they have no interest in
according to facebook Messenger product
manager drew max on drew said and I
quote group chats today are focused on
people you already know friends and
family and what we found by talking to
users is that there is a need for
conversations about specific topics
rooms will be for topic-based
conversations so people can talk with
others they may not yet know now I know
what some of you are thinking how is
this different from facebook groups well
this is within the messenger app sort of
different playground different ecosystem
and it's interesting to see how they
will integrate the whole bot thing will
you use messenger rooms let me know in
the comments below will that work for
you does it matter to you look forward
to hearing from you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
