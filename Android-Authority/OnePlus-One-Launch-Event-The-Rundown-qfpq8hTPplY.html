behind me and you hear the jazz music in
the background as everyone is testing
out the phone that was literally just
announced hey it's Josh Berg our manager
I thought hey what's going on everybody
and this is the 1+1 event rundown so as
you guys already know every time I come
out to a particular event whether it's
in China or New York or whatnot I do
love to give you guys a glimpse into
what these events are pretty much like
and I was in the back when it came to
the 1+1 event here in Beijing China
getting all of the footage that I could
so you're going to see what the
presentation was like and how in a way
simplistic it was but I'll get to that
in a little bit
ultimately what we're looking at here is
a 5.5 inch device with 1080p resolution
and a lot of power underneath the
Snapdragon 801 clocked in at 2.5
gigahertz and then after that you have a
wonderful core Android experience
provided by CyanogenMod which is a
version called the 11s which is a
different version that is catered
specifically to the oneplus one now the
oneplus one comes in at a very great
price point $2.99 and when that price
was revealed as you're seeing the clip
right now everyone went absolutely nuts
one of my favorite things about Chinese
events is that whenever an announcement
is made about a particular device
everyone in the crowd absolutely goes
nuts and everyone starts cheering and
clapping and it's just a really raucous
crowd and there's always a lot of energy
behind it but going back to the device
there's a design aesthetic to this
device that is very appealing it has a
tapered back that is made of a material
that they call baby skin it's very soft
and I already did my hands on it first
look when it comes to this device along
with a few verses videos that as I'm as
I speak right now it is those videos are
actually going live on YouTube so you're
probably watching those right now but
nonetheless what we're looking at here
is a phone that really tackles the core
experience and brings a wonderful price
point so that anybody outside of China
you know people in the US probably going
to gobble this phone up and it's really
a device that everyone's going to really
clamor over but on top of all of that
leading up to this actual announcement
and event there was a lot of questioning
as to exactly what oneplus would be able
to do with their particular device and a
lot of the information wasn't coming out
really steadily there was a
a lot of speculation as to exactly what
oneplus would be able to do and
especially with this companies let's say
attitude is the word that I keep using
and that they actually really targeted
some of the other manufacturers out
there like say Apple iPhone or even
Samsung pretty much calling them out on
some practices that they do and what
oneplus will do better and that was a
lot of the presentation that was here
today and you would see pictures of
iPhones and Samsung devices and you
would see how the oneplus one was
combating some of the issues that these
devices had but aside from that the
aesthetic of the actual show itself was
really interesting
normally I when I come to a launch event
especially ones here in China there's
always this big fanfare there's a ton of
spectacle there's always a lot of showy
presentations videos and I'd announce it
is made and they raise their voices and
it's just this huge raucous crowd but
one thing that I really enjoyed about
this presentation was that it was kind
of turned on its head it was almost
deconstructing the the launch event
Trobe itself or motif in that it wasn't
really a super high energy type of
presentation it was ultimately a
presentation just a simple one almost
like a lecture in a way where the
founder or the CEO of oneplus was
basically telling you the philosophy
behind why they picked return parts of
the device and the reveal of the device
itself didn't happen and so after all
that philosophy was put out on the table
and then finally when the device was
actually announced then of course the
crowd went a little bit wild and after
that they were able to get into the
specifics of the phone but as far as the
availability of this phone is concerned
I wanted to take some time to talk about
it right here there is an invite system
initially for the oneplus one and that
people will be given invites and will be
able to buy the phone if they have an
invite and as you buy a phone you will
be given even more invites and then so
on and so forth so just like how the
oneplus hypose a-- was sort of
cultivated in the beginning it's the
same way that the sales will be for this
phone because it's basically
word-of-mouth
there's also another campaign that you
can see at the oneplus website called
the Smasher phone now essentially what
is going on here is the first hundred
people who enter in showing themselves
smashing their current devices will get
invites they'll be picked four they'll
be hand selected the first 100 will be
hand selected
and they will be given invites to be
able to buy the oneplus at a premium
price it's really it's really kind of a
refreshing feeling to cover a device
like this that as I'm holding this phone
I'm almost astonished that I think to
myself I'm holding this phone and I
think I could buy this on my own
you know I could just I could literally
put down the money for this because it's
not going to break my bank and that I
think is the main appeal of the oneplus
one I can't say for certain what the
response is going to be for this device
but I can say that everyone should be
excited because that price is really
what makes this phone special so keep it
tuned to Android Authority for all of
the best coverage you can see the links
right over on the side over there to the
oneplus one first looking hands-on and
also to a versus video that you can
click on there and there are a couple
other ones that are available is stay
tuned we're also got a couple more
videos coming up I even have an
interview with Steve Kondik who who of
course is the architect to the
mastermind behind CyanogenMod and he
will talk to him about what it was like
creating cyanogen 1111 s for the oneplus
one so stay tuned for that and all the
best coverage with a oneplus one because
this is Android authority and we are
your source for all things Android
