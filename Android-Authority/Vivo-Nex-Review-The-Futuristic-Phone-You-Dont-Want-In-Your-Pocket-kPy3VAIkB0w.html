[Laughter]
this is the vivo next the closest thing
we've seen to a truly bizarre free phone
yet buying perhaps the Oppo find X which
is equally crazy should check out
David's review if you haven't already so
let's get this out of the way up front
is this the phone that you should lust
after absolutely but is this the phone
you should actually run out and get to
that I'd have to say probably not stick
with me here and I'll explain why the
best part of the move to have truly
bezel free phones is the weird and wacky
solutions to the question of where to
put all the stuff that used to live
above and below the display front facing
cameras fingerprint scanners speakers
and sensors all need relocating if we're
going to have proper fullscreen phones
the vivo next valiantly addresses those
necessities in pursuit of the industries
bezel free wet dream it doesn't succeed
on every fun and there are more than a
few caveats you need to be aware of
before you decide on importing one let's
start with the good things the screen on
the vivo NEX is a great start it's
really big for a phone that's barely any
larger than a pixel 2 XL making the neck
surprisingly manageable
it has good white balance and the deep
blacks and poppy colors you'd expect
from an OLED display below a resolution
display one please everyone but it along
with the battery saving benefits of OLED
to help you eke out a little more from
the four thousand milliamp hour battery
I didn't have any issues with arm such
rejection and even though it didn't get
bright enough for my taste outdoors it
wasn't any worse than most phones but
there's a lot more going on here than
just scream by going very close to bezel
that's the Nexus had to shuffle around a
bunch of components the front-facing
camera is perhaps the most exciting of
these as it is a housed inside a small
cavity on the top edge of the phone when
you launch the front-facing camera it
appears as if by magic then retreats
back into the frame when it's no longer
needed no matter how many times I showed
this to someone I was always asked to do
it again it's undeniably cool but
there's no doubt that adding a moving
part to a smart phone is a pretty bad
idea the good thing about the camera
mechanism is that I found it to be very
resilient and sturdy even if it is still
very early days I was intentionally
rough on it banging it on things and
forcing it back into the frame to see
just how tough it was after a couple of
weeks of abuse I expect it could take
some pretty decent battle scars before
you have any problems with it if you're
worried about it breaking if you drop it
you probably have more to worry about
from breaking the screen than the
but again if it didn't move it couldn't
break because it's only needed for the
front-facing camera though you won't
need to use it anywhere near as much as
the Oppo find X which needs to elevate
the entire top edge of the phone to
access either camera and even to unlock
the phone if you're not particularly
obsessed with selfies you're going to
have even less to worry about on the
next it's there when you need it but out
of the way when you don't plus you'll
know exactly when the NSA is spying on
you in the toilet the screen is also the
earpiece speaker there's a small
vibration motor under the display that
transmits sound waves through the whole
screen it's barely audible covers around
you I ran about the same as a normal
incall speaker and the quality and
volume is on par with any other phone
because there's no face unlocking going
on here you'll also find a fingerprint
scanner under the display it works via a
small camera that beeps are all cut out
behind the screen it's apparently better
than previous scanners but in practice
it's just plain unreliable and still
much slower than current capacitive
scanners which begs the question how
much inconvenience are you willing to
put up with to have something as
futuristic as the vivo NEX in your
pocket using it feels like being part of
a significant milestone in smartphone
history but it is still just a phone and
it brings with it a whole bunch of
all-too-familiar smartphone problems I'm
okay with putting up with a dodgy under
glass scanner for now but it's pretty
obvious why Samsung and Apple haven't
used one of these yet the nexus specs
the top-shelf snapdragon 845 8 gig of
ram 256 of storage Android phone 1 Oreo
and so on with the crazy performance
you'd expect but there's no IP rating
for these reasons no NFC wireless
charging or microSD expansion these may
matter to you or they may not but
they're pretty standard smartphone
complaints and this is a key point the
next is not a silver bullet
vivo hasn't so much solved a problem as
migrated existing problems into a new
form factor if you wouldn't buy a vivo
phone before I wouldn't recommend you
buy this one either case in point this
software of course the next was made for
a Chinese audience where iPhone inspired
launchers are considered a good thing
but the app drawl açaí OS copy will
irritate most Android fans even
switching up the launcher is an exercise
in frustration requiring a Chinese phone
number so you can create a vivo account
to allow the security permissions to
change the launcher to something less
awful
it's pretty convoluted and even if you
go through all that you're just going to
have other problems to contend with
there's not a Google Play or Google Apps
out of the box and while it's
straightforward enough to force install
them even then you'll have these shoes
downloading many other common Android
apps notifications are also pretty
patching you so you'll just have to
cross your fingers on that front
there's no Google assistant shortcut and
not even a way to quickly access the
settings unless you have an Apple icon
on your home screen
there's also weird formatting issues for
Clanton characters and various other
compatibility and reliability problems
with many of your favorite apps the
Evo's jovi virtual voice assistant gets
a dedicated button but because it only
supports the Chinese language and only
works with Chinese apps and services
it's basically useless outside China the
fun touch experience is understandable
giving an awareness of the Nexus target
market but the software as it stands
makes the next phone that is fun to lust
after but not one you actually want in
your pocket unless you live in China now
I can nitpick its faults all I like but
I still love this phone how you feel
about it will likely hinge on where you
stand on novelty and gimmicks versus
polish and reliability you'll either see
the V phone X as a technical marvel or
as a daily driver fraught with issues
but the truth is it's both of these
things now one area in which I was
particularly surprised with the nexus
camera while the shots from the
front-facing camera unfortunately soft
and lacked of detail and exposure the
main cameras on the back are
impressively competitive I took a bunch
of shots alongside the pixel - and in a
lot of cases the next came tantalizingly
close to besting it the next cameras
greatest weakness is its tendency to
overexpose it also tends to over
saturate a bit end over sharp and in
post whether you like the shots it takes
will depend if you judge your photos on
your smartphone screen or at 100% crop
on your computer for me I tend to bump
saturation contrast and sharpness in an
editing app anyway so the next saves me
a few steps for others it'll
understandably be in affront to the
principles of good photography portrait
mode is OK on an expert as with most
phones it struggles with cutouts and
artificial looking blur low-light is
quite good with very little noise and
clean images post-processing is clearly
in effect if you go looking for it but
the overall result is solid dynamic
range is unfortunately not so great
largely due to the camera's tendency to
overexpose blowing out the highlights in
the process
camera does draw a lot of detail from
shadowy areas even more so than the
pixel - in a lot of cases color
reproduction is also very accurate
notwithstanding the tendency to pump
saturation a little bit too much
there's also 4k video at 30 frames per
second and slow motion at 1080p and
while video is stabilized it's not quite
as good as that found on the p20 Pro or
pixel - the battery is a little bit less
impressive at 4000 milliamp hours it's
bigger than most but despite the full HD
OLED panel the vivo sucks the life out
of it a bit faster than I would like
I won't help too much on it here as the
phonons receive multiple updates during
my time with it and battery life may
very well change it's also a Chinese
unit being used in Europe so there's
that to consider as well in any case the
22.5 rewards power brick can recharge
the whole thing in just over an hour and
a half you'll also get a case in the box
and some decent earbuds but given that
the next has a 3.5 mm headphone jack
you're probably better off just plugging
in your favorite pair of wired
headphones because the v1 chip and
built-in DAC produce really excellent
audio all in all I have loved my time
with the next
despite its futuristic appearance it
reminds us that phones are still phones
and they come with the same kinds of
issues despite any misgiving the vivo
NEX makes this smartphone experience fun
and exciting again and that is no small
achievement perhaps even one big enough
to make you look past it software and
other issues so even if it isn't
perfectly executed and probably not a
phone you should use as your daily I
really hope it's ambitious example
influences other phones that come in its
wake as always thank you so much for
watching be sure to hit that
notification bell so you know the next
time we upload a video and head on over

the vivo next because we are your source
