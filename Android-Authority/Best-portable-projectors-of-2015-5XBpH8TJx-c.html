we're going to be taking a look at some
of the best portable projectors these
projectors are quite small and most of
them even fit in your pocket so you
would think the picture wouldn't be that
great but in 2015
projector companies have really stepped
up their game delivering some amazing
quality projectors than can fit in the
palm of your hand so without further ado
let's get right into the four best
portable projectors of 2015 so let's
start with a united object smart beam
laser projector it comes in at four
hundred and twenty dollars and comes
with a free tripod stand depending on
where you order it like United objects
website this is a smallest projector of
the group and one of the more
interestingly designed ones as well it
weighs one point twelve pounds and is
actually the world's smallest HD LCOS
laser projector at only 2.2 inches all
around so it can get pretty hot but with
this native 720p resolution and as fast
laser autofocus this portable projector
offers some very crisp and clear images
instantly no matter where you move it
the picture is very bright red it up to
60 lumens so watching movies even when
in a non pitch black area is manageable
overall the quality is great and can
stay in focus at very far distances with
a max screen size of 100 inches the
picture can have a very harsh bluish
tint at times but it's not very obvious
unless you're compared to another
projector it's very easy to get used to
the UO smart beam laser projector does
have built-in speakers and they get
pretty loud I don't have to watch
something on the go but of course not
loud enough for a full length movie the
quality of the sound isn't too great
either
it's not horrible but it's a little
muffled and I'd say it's probably the
worst of these four projectors
especially since the projector itself
creates a little noise with its fans
also there is no audio output so
connecting speakers of any kind is out
of the question
setting up a video for playback it's
very easy you can connect your phone
wirelessly with miracast
or DLNA or you can connect the laptop
using an HDMI cable although one side
will need to be mini HDMI there's a 4200
milliamp battery and
and that is set to last up to two hours
a little bit more if you're connected
with HDMI so if you're watching a long
movie you'll have to make sure you plug
it into a wall outlet the United objects
smart beam laser projector offers great
video quality amazing for such a tiny
little device sure the speaker's aren't
the best and the battery is a bit small
but this is the ultimate portable
projector if it's selling point being
its size it's very simple it's
incredibly small and most importantly
displays a beautiful picture next we
have the Pico Pro from cell you on
another projector that is beautifully
designed being one of the thinnest
projectors made you can pick one up for
around three hundred and fifty nine
dollars it's only 181 grams a half an
inch thick and six inches across making
it into a pocket with ease it has a very
interesting design as if two bricks are
stuck together it almost looks like if
you should be able to twist or turn them
but don't do it they are one solid body
it also comes with a stand with 360
rotation which makes finding a surface
for it to rest very easy sell you on
states that the projector light comes in
at 32 lumens but don't let that fool you
the Pico Pro can get very bright and the
quality is fantastic as well as 720p it
offers infinite autofocus so you never
have to worry about fiddling around with
the focus and it works just as well as
the laser autofocus on the smart beam
projector your picture will always be
clear you'll never see it out of focus
and up to a screen size of 250 inches
the color temperature can be a little
warm and leaned more towards a purplish
hue by comparing it with other
projectors the purple hue is very
apparent but it doesn't take too much
time to get used to it either it
supports the standard connectors like
the Euro smart beam but for mini HDMI
port and miracast or DLNA capabilities
unfortunately the speakers on the Pico
Pro don't get too loud either but the
sound quality is actually fantastic the
speaker's off is a best sound quality
over the other projectors by far since
this is a family's projector that
projector itself remains very quiet so
there's no unneeded noise to distract a
viewer although the Pico Pro offers
great sound quality you do have an
option
headphones for private viewing or even
hook up the projector to speakers to
create a real movie theater like
experience while we're not exactly sure
of the battery capacity inside the Pico
Pro we are told that when wirelessly
connected you can go for at least two
hours and when wired with HDMI at least
stream it's also nice to see that the
Pico Pro comes in different colors like
black silver and gold a three hundred
and fifty nine dollars it's a little
cheaper than the United optics smart
beam laser projector while having better
sound and the headphone jack and
although the purplish tint is a drawback
it's a little more preferable over the
bluish hue the third projector we have
is the asus s1 mobile LED projector and
it costs about $300 this projectors
design isn't as eye-catching as the
others but it's still small at four by
four point four inches and 1.2 inches
thick and it's actually lighter than the
Euro smart beam laser projector a 3/4 of
a pound it doesn't come with a tripod
but it does support one the acss one
also gets insanely bright at 200 lumens
so viewing from far away the picture
will still be viewable this projector
unfortunately does not have any type of
autofocus so you'll have to resort to
the manual focus wheel on the side the
resolution does take a dive this time
around dropping to a max of 480p so it
won't look as crisp as the other
projectors but still without being said
the overall quality of this projector
may be a bit better than the other two
colors are beautiful and the picture is
super bright there's no big huge shift
like the others
it may lean a little towards the blue
side of things but nowhere near as much
as a yield smart beam laser projector or
the pico Pro you have a lot of control
over the quality of the projection when
you dive into settings where you can
change the contrast and even put on
different modes like standard theater
etc one nice thing about the ACS s1 is
its ultra short throw ratio which is
just the angle of which a picture is
shown on the left we have the Pico Pro
and on the right we have our ACS s1 both
are sitting at the same height of the
table yet the ACS s ones picture is
shown higher at a 41 inch diagonal
projection which makes it very easy to
play videos at short distances like this
this time we have a standard
my connector on the back along with a
USB port because this projector can
actually charge your phone even if it's
off unfortunately you cannot connect
your phone wirelessly to the acss one
you'll have to connect using MHL the
speakers are not the best sounding but
certainly not the worse they are however
the loudest of the four and if you want
to go even louder hooking up speakers is
possible using the headphone jack with
this projector being bigger than the
others asus was able to fit a six
thousand milliamp battery in here
allowing three to four hours of playback
although not the most interesting design
and it's low resolution the asus s1 is a
great portable projector and it offers a
great picture quality it's the cheapest
of the four at $300 so it's definitely
worth considering and last but certainly
not anywhere close to lease we have a
portable projector that is in a totally
different league than the others it's a
$600 ZTE s pro 2 so what makes this
projector so much better and pricier
than the rest well there's a ton of
reasons but there's two big things one
this projector runs Android and sports a
5 inch touchscreen and 2 the picture
quality is out of this world yes the ZTE
S pro 2 is running Android 4.4.4 kitkat
and has a very beautiful 5-inch HD
touchscreen on the top where you can
surf the web download apps in the Play
Store browse your photos and even
message your friends this projector has
you covered no matter who you are or
what you have you'll be able to view
content on this device of course the
projector can connect to Wi-Fi but if
you're a Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T customer you're
in luck because this projector comes in
Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T variants so you can
project YouTube Netflix or even websites
even if you're somewhere without Wi-Fi
even if you're not a Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T
customer and find yourself somewhere
without Wi-Fi you'll be able to take
advantage of the projectors micro SD
card slot and as you would expect the
projector is capable of projecting with
miracast
and the standard HDMI cable once again
there's a USB port for charging it
doesn't come with a tripod but it is
capable of being used as one although
the little leg in the bottom may be
enough for
the picture quality is by far the best
of the four with a 720p resolution and
200 lumens it projects a nice and bright
crisp and clear image and colors are
absolutely beautiful at a maximum of 120
inches there are no weird tensing hues
or strange color temperatures colors are
very accurate and the whites are very
white it has an autofocus feature that's
slower than the others and we'll try to
address every so often but you can
disable it once you place the projector
down it only takes a second or two to
focus but it creates the sharpest image
of the four there are different
brightness settings like low and medium
and for the high option you'll need to
plug the projector into an outlet which
is unfortunate but it must be a big
battery dream one feature that the ZTE s
pro 2 has that the others don't is
keystoning which means a projector will
automatically correct the angle to
prevent the picture from stretching so
even if the projector is not sitting
horizontally on the wall the projector
image will remain in a true rectangular
shape the speakers on the projector are
about the same quality as the ACS ones
but just a bit quieter but once again a
headphone jack is available for audio
output inside is a 6300 milliamp battery
which can last for up to three hours
which is pretty good considering there's
pretty much a full phone running inside
there it's the biggest projector of the
four coming in at five point three by
five point two inches and being 1.2
inches thick is definitely a beast of a
portable projector outperforming the
others in almost every area although it
is at least portable of the four it can
be a bit pricey too at $600 but if you
buy it at a Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T store it is
cheaper especially if you add it with a
contract there's a little something for
everyone here with these four great
portable projectors of 2015 whether you
want to impress people with a very
stylish and compact design have the
ability to create a home theater
anywhere project beautiful video without
breaking the bank or going all out
there's a portable projector for you
