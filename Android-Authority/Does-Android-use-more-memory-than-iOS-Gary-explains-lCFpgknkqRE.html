authority now if you look at the latest
generation of Android flagship
smartphones for example the galaxy s7
the LG g5 the Google pixel they all come
with 4 gigabytes of RAM and if you look
at the equivalent in the iPhone line
that the iPhone 7 has 2 gigabytes of RAM
and the iPhone 7 it has 3 gigabytes of
RAM in fact 3 gigabyte is the most of
Apple I've ever put into one of their
iPhones and if you go back to last year
and the year before that you'll see this
trend that Android phones always seem to
have more memory than iPhones and this
has led some people to say that's
because Android uses more memory than
iOS and therefore and with phones need
to have more ran inside of them well is
that true let me explain so first of all
let's just clear it one thing here we're
talking about random access memory here
ramp okay that's the 4 gigabytes mode
last it was 3 gigabytes we're not
talking about internal storage which
might be 16 gigabytes or 32 gigabytes or
even 64 gigabyte which sometimes gets
called memory because it uses what they
call flash memory so therefore people
mix it up so we're talking about RAM
here random access memory not talking
about internal storage so the RAM is
used by the CPU to hold the operating
system itself both iOS and Android stick
in RAM and the data associated with
running that operating system and then
the apps you run also stay in the RAM
while they're running and the data that
those apps need and you need enough RAM
to hold your printing system and hold
your app so then you might ask yourself
the question well how much free RAM is
there on my smart phone now I'm forcing
the term free RAM is not actually very
very useful and that's because OS
designers worked out but actually when
you have a block of RAM but empty
nothing and it's not being used at all
that's not very efficient for example if
you want to have lots of i/o lots of
reason right from your flash disk it
will be better if that reading and
writing with cache that would improve
performance so if you've got empty Ram
well that Ram could be given over
to using for caching and it's really
good because actually in a moment if you
need to run another app and it needs
more around you can say okay let's
abandon the cache it doesn't matter
what's more important now is this app so
it's not actually free ram in that it is
not being occupied if you are both iOS
and Android how much freer and they've
got little tiny little bits like two
megabytes or eight megabytes is on the
tiny tiny bit but we have to use the
term available Ram
that's RAM that could be repurposed in a
moment in an instant to loading up an
app or to giving data space to an app
now that's something quite different now
for my testing I'm going to be using an
iPhone seven and a nexus 5x and the
reason for that is the iPhone 7 has two
gigabytes of RAM and runs the latest
operating system from Apple and the
Nexus 5x has pretty good bytes of RAM
and runs the latest version of Android
now when you boot up the nexus 5x it has
around about 840 megabytes of available
ram when it boots are not free round
with available ram when it boots up but
when you boot up the iphone 7 it has
around seven hundred and forty megabytes
of available ram so we can see actually
from the beginning actually Android uses
less ram in a freshly booted system than
iOS does so that's our first fact here
that actually in a freshly booted system
the Nexus 5x my iPhone 7 the iPhone 7
uses more RAM than the Android phone so
when the device's boot there's no
principal apps running there might be
some background services running let's
say checking your email but there's no
actual apps running you haven't touched
anything on the screen to say I want to
run a particular app now when you do tap
on an icon to launch an app it gets
ready and from the flash drive into the
RAM and it also will start asking for
some memory to do the things that it
wants to do and when that happens the
amount of available RAM decreases
because some of it has been given over
to the new app now all modern-day
operating systems including on the
desktop and mobile phones use a thing
called virtual memory now I haven't done
a video about virtual memory if you want
to see one then please do tell me in the
comments but just to tell you quickly
basically each app think is running in
its own address space
virtual address space and it doesn't
know about the other app and the
operating system is job is to allocate
physical RAM related to what the app
want in its virtual world is virtual
address space now that means actually
can be quite complicated because an app
might ask for something might say hey I
want a megabyte of RAM because I'm about
to load a picture from the flash disk
but the operating system might actually
give it to it at that very moment it
will wait because there will be some
more time will go past and the app will
start to actually load the data from the
hard drive from the flash disk and then
it likely start to write it to the RAM
at that point your racism will say ok
you can now actually have some physical
RAM so an app might ask for something
but it doesn't actually get it until
actually start to write to it and
actually what you might find is the
operating system might not even give it
a whole 1 megabyte of RAM if it only
writes per half of that area of memory
it might only physically allocate it
half of that amount of memory that's the
difference between virtual addressing
and physical addressing and so therefore
there's a difference between how much
RAM as APIs are for its virtual address
based on how much it's actually using
inside of the physical RAM and that's
known as the resident set size or maybe
the real physical memory usage now you
can actually on both the Android studio
and on Xcode you can actually bring up
some tools will show you how much
physical Ram is being used by each
particular app as what I've done is I've
launched some various app on both the
iPhone 7 and the Nexus 5x using the
tools from the development change to
study to see how much space is being
given over in physical RAM to each of
the different apps I think it's a
variety of apps I've got like cleans
like Crossy Road and Temple Run 2 and
Microsoft Word and the YouTube app and
I've run all of them to see how much
space they occupy and the question
before us is does Android use more RAM
than iOS well here as results let's have
a look so the results are a bit of a
mixed bags we look at Crotty Road for
example the Android version resident in
physical realm is 383 megabytes and in
iOS is 308 megabytes obviously
a bit more use there bye-bye Android if
you look at Temple Run in Android only
uses 211 megabytes
whereas in iOS it uses 364 megabyte and
then subway surfers Star Wars fourth
Arena they're pretty close particularly
Star Wars for to rename just a couple of
megabytes in it there if you look at
YouTube that seems to use double in that
case on Android Facebook up to the login
prompt about the same Microsoft Word a
bit bigger on Android and in fact if you
add up all those numbers and draw an
average Android phone users around 6
percent more than iOS device for the
same range of programs so there is a
slight memory increase on Android that
cannot be denied but it's certainly not
double you know or you know or like just
just a huge different we are talking
about the same actual relative size and
that's actually view think about it
that's going to be true isn't it because
if you're loading up a game like
crossing road it's got lots of graphics
in it it's got lots of animations going
on those graphics and animations and
they take the same amount of space on an
Android phone as they do on an iOS phone
so really the idea that Android uses
load more memory you know so that you
need an extra gigabyte or something
because of that actually isn't true at
all which is actually no truth to that
argument whatsoever
and the other thing to notice here is
that even games relatively complex games
like star wars force arena or Temple Run
2 they're using 300 400 megabytes of RAM
they're certainly not using 4 gigabytes
or 3 gigabytes even that you get in the
iPhone 7s so this really isn't the
reason why there is extra RAM inside of
these device it has very little to do
with the actual running at now I'm sure
there are some bigger apps up there I'm
sure you can download them within one
gigabyte one and a half gigabyte
downloads that you can get I'm sure they
are going to use more space but that
isn't actually the problem here because
you can see the Temple Run and Star Wars
watering on crossroads could all run
very comfortably in that for 700 or 800
megabytes of available RAM that there
are on the 2 gigabyte versions of the
Nexus 5x amber to gigabyte iPhone 7 so
why is the extra RAM there's more to
this story now we're all very used to
using our phones in a multitasking
fashion I might be using Gmail and Urkel
checking some emails replying to it and
then I might switch to a game to play
crossing road for a few minutes then I
might switch to my music app start
listening to the music and then a
notification comes in I might go back to
Gmail
now we what do we expect to happen this
is really the questions about user
experience for sure if I go back to
Gmail I use Gmail lots of times during
the day I want to be exactly as it was
when I last used it but if I play
crossing road and then switch out of it
and then I don't go back to it for a
week because it's family now a different
game becomes my game of preference or I
just haven't had any free time to do any
gaming at all what do I expect crossing
road to be when I come back after a week
do I expect it to be exactly where I
left it do I mind if it restarts from
the beginning what do I expect well as I
said this is about user experience now
when you are in an app it's called the
foreground app it's the app that you're
interacting with it's the app is
displaying on the screen but the moment
you switch away to another app that app
moves from the foreground into the
background
now how those background apps are
treated is where we find the interesting
part of this story now as I said there's
only a certain amount of available ramp
so when I start an app if I then start a
second one is there are still enough
available ram for both of them to be in
ram at the same time if I start a third
out is there still four five if there's
still space that's the question that
that has these operating systems have to
cope with now on a desktop what happens
when it runs out of memory and there's
no more physical RAM it uses a protozoan
of swapping and swapping basically means
it takes the bits
it doesn't need anymore because you
actually haven't used that app for a
week and it copies it to the hard drive
not the app like the program that you
install but all the memory that's using
it just gets shifted out onto the hard
disk that Ram becomes freed up and then
the new app can go in there and then
after a week if you do eventually switch
back to that app well actually it can
take it back from the hard drive
find some more free RAM probably happens
again through some more swapping and
then it puts it back into memory and you
can carry on running it now you can't do
that on smartphones for lots of
different reasons one is that writing to
flash is actually quite slow the second
is that actually you can wear out the
flash because of all this constant
reading and writing to it so iOS and
Android
don't take that approach of swapping out
to flash this which is what you would
get on a laptop or a desktop instead
they have to do something different now
what actually happens is is that on
Android it will keep trying to load up
into the into the available RAM and then
if it hasn't got any more available Ram
it will try to use a thing called
compressed swap now compress what isn't
like traditional shopping where it swaps
to the hard drive or to internal storage
which does is it takes the pages of RAM
the blocks of RAM and said well if I
compress these like like lift
compression if I compress these and then
put them into them Rama hey I actually
make a free up 50% of the occupied RAM
of that app we're using or or maybe even
more and now I can use that Ram to
actually put in my put in the new app so
it uses this idea of swapping but not to
external storage or internal storage it
swaps to its own Ram but compressed now
if it can't free up enough RAM by using
the compression technique then Android
says well I'm going to have to delete an
app here for memory and it's got various
algorithms that it uses let's say I
haven't played cross the road for a week
but it was still in memory basically
Android will say well he hasn't used it
for week it'll send a message to cross
the road and say you're about to get
deleted please save any state
information that you want to save
crossing road gets a a short amount of
time to to save work where it is and
then basically Android just killed it
you're gone it just deletes it from
memory removes it completely and that
space that was used up by that app is
now used for the new map that you just
touched on tapped on to to load up now I
did an experiment on the Nexus 5x if
Iran for example Crossy Road it would
use a certain amount of space I could
then maybe run
run to and that would run a third man on
both app could stay in memory simulator
and I could switch between them and
exactly where I left off I could carry
on running after Kara on fighting I
could carry on doing everything I was
doing inside though that if I tried to
run a third app let's say Star Wars for
Selena then at that point there wasn't
enough free RAM and it couldn't get
enough RAM using the compressed swapping
so at that point one of the apps is
killed off by Android to make space for
the new app if I then switch back to
let's say cross 0 which was if that was
one of the least if I switch back to
cross heroes it starts again get the
hipster whale thing coming up and it
reloads from the beginning because it
was kicked out of of the memory so on
the Nexus 5x with 2 gigabytes of RAM I
thought I could run two games
simultaneously switch between them games
that occupies two three four hundred
megabytes of RAM and then as a third one
came along that would cause an app to be
killed and that's using the low memory
killer that's a system that you find
that on Android when have enough memory
it decides which apps to push out in the
main memory and so that's a disadvantage
or two gigabytes of RAM when you're
running multiple apps that have large
memory requires 300 400 500 megabytes
then at some point other app has to be
killed off to make space for the new app
that you're running that's why if you've
got three gigabyte phone or a 4 gigabyte
phone actually the swapping between the
apps the multitasking will you switch
from one app to another becomes seamless
because they're all held in memory at
the same time
now what about iOS it has exactly the
same problems and in my testing I've
seen iOS kid off at exactly the same way
that Android does and you you go back to
them
and you tap on them again and they are
there in memory they actually are have
to reload from beginning I verified that
using the tools that you get with Xcode
so and iOS also kills off app so it
doesn't have enough memory however this
means streak of Android you find less
often in Iowa
because iOS manages to reduce the
resident set size or programs that are
already running too much lower levels
for example we saw that crossing road
might be using 300 something megabytes
of RAM but actually want to switch it to
the background I have seen iOS we call
that 300 megabytes down 200 megabytes
and then if you put more pressure on the
system I've seen that whittled down to
under 10 megabytes but yet when you
switch to it it's able to instantly run
from where it was before and the program
camera doesn't we load you are switching
to it now how i OS is doing that we
don't know Apple doesn't give away the
details or the internals of its system
it could be using a clever paging system
where for example the code that's
running and the graphics that are
running are automatically taken out of
the memory because it knows iOS no they
can find them on the hard disk again at
a relevant time and when you switch to
it it just brings all those back in now
when you do switch click the resident
peptide grows big again instantly it
goes back up to 100 hundred and fifty
two hundred megabytes
in a flash in a moment so that data is
still there it's probably getting it
from the from the internal storage it
could be using compression because
that's now found in Mac OS OS 10 to ten
point nine I think so that compression
idea exists in Apple's thinking it could
be doing that we don't know but I will
say I'm not an athlete fan but I will
say I am impressed by how iOS handles
low memory situations for background
apps so the reason why Apple have been
putting less RAM inside of their phones
is not because iOS needs less memory
needs exactly the same memory as an
Android does but when it in this
background situation it's able to reduce
the resident set size a physical Ram
needed by background apps that are not
running they just leave switched away
from significantly now obviously where
this falls apart is for example using an
iPad and using the split screen idea of
a split window then lead to a poorly
completely both need men
they need it now and that will cause the
the system to run out of memory much
quicker however I must say that the iOS
handles low memory situations better
than the Android does and what this
means is that basically apple of said
well we're not going to put an extra
gigabyte of ram we're not gonna put an X
to give our own we're going to rely on
this technology that handles background
parts whereas Android vendors are say
basic we're gonna stick another gigabyte
around now both are valid solution both
are solutions to this problem maybe one
is more elegant the other maybe the
other is more advantageous to the
consumer that's depending on your point
of view but they are both solutions to
the same problem what do you do you
don't have enough RAM and Android is
dealt with in one way and iOS has dealt
with it in another way and that's
fundamentally the difference between iOS
and Android and RAM usage what my name
is Gautam from Andhra thority I hope you
enjoyed this video just a quick thing
this is not a flame war
I appreciate what Andrew is doing I
appreciate what I RS is doing
I appreciate personally having more RAM
in my hand or phone because it's useful
for that switching I also appreciate how
iOS is handling that low Ram situation
please it let's talk about the
technology let's congratulate Androids
it's congressionally Apple for the way
they're handling this very complicated
task of running multiple apps at the
same time and then being there when we
tap on them in an instant it's a very
hard problem in software engineering to
solve
they've sold it in two different ways
not a flame war let's just concentrate
on the technology here now if you did
