variety of smart functions out of the
box now that alone would make anyone
question why they should even buy a
dedicated streaming device of some kind
but trust us you'll want to check these
two out hey guys
John velasco here with andrew authority
and this is our video comparison between
the new Roku stick and the chromecast
okay so they're gonna be hitting the
majority of the time so it doesn't
matter which one looks better right
actually we still have to point out the
ingenious design of the
second-generation chromecast for
starters it looks better with its
circular shape but is involved to not be
as obtrusive even better it's easier to
attach to rear or side mounted HDMI
ports whereas with the Roku stick it's
nearly impossible to attach to a
rear-mounted port if the TV is
wall-mounted sure you can place it on a
port that side mounted but its
conventional design makes it stick out
like a sore thumb the setup process with
both is a snap and quite frankly their
purpose and end functions are really no
different you plug them into an HDMI
port then connect to your existing Wi-Fi
network and that's pretty much it for
the chromecast you just tap on the
casting icon in the apps that support it
to begin streaming of course and with
the Roku stick it has a dedicated UI
that allows us to surf through various
channels which are the apps for the
service in this case at the heart of it
all users get to watch content on their
television set
popular monthly paid streaming services
such as Netflix and Hulu are supported
by two in addition to the vast selection
of services from other cable networks so
thank each bo comedy central stars and
much more you can get other popular
services like Fandango Flixter Pandora
Vudu crackle and YouTube the big
standout here is that the Roku stick
supports Amazon video something you
don't find supported by the chromecast
on top of that time warner customers can
watch a live tv through the power of the
Roku stick making it one of the few
devices to allow such functionality in
the first place
screen mirroring is available with the
two of course it means we can mirror
whatever we're doing on our Android
device it's pretty stable well that's
only if you plan on playing certain
games and speaking of games most titles
perform without any problems there are
some latency issues but it's most
problematic for those titles with
intensive action and kilogram --ax one
handy feature of the Roku stick though
is that your Android device also doubles
as your remote yes there's a physical
one that comes bundled with it but an
event that you happen to misplace it
there's that convenience of using your
phone with the chromecast there's really
no physical remote per se seeing that
you just interact with the apps on your
phone
and finally the Robo stick has a unique
feature called private listening mode
it's wonderful because you can pop in
your favorite pair of headphones to your
Android device and listen to whatever
you're watching in privacy it's really
useful when you don't want to disturb
others like at night when everyone's
asleep however it can be buggy at times
since it can sometimes cut in and out in
terms of price the chromecast is cheaper
at $35 so if you want streaming
capabilities on the cheap it's the way
to go plus we do like that it's design
is a bit more ingenious that's where the
second-generation Roku stick it does
cost more at $50 however it's
justifiable for starters we like that it
supports Amazon video secondly the
private listening mode is useful in
keeping the audio isolated to a pair of
headphones so that we're not constantly
disturbing others and for those Time
Warner customers out there you have true
live TV servers thanks to the Roku stick
in all fairness the chromecast is nice
but for serious binge Watchers the Roku
stick achieves a higher level experience
that shouldn't go unnoticed it is the
ultimate streaming stick so which one do
you like better leave your answer in the
