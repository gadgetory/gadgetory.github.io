manufacturers in the world it also
happens to be based in China the company
has an impressive range of products that
suit almost every budget recently it
announced a new top tier product called
the ZTE star - Josh did a great hands-on
video during Mobile World Congress and
now our review unit has arrived priced
at $399 without a contract it's more
expensive than the ZTE Blade s6 however
it brings more features to the table so
let's take a look the ZTE star 2 is one
of the sleek is 5-inch devices I have
reviewed recently it's easy to hold and
feels comfortable in the hand it
certainly isn't bulk yet just 6.9
millimeters thick and carrying it around
in my pocket was quite easy with no
pocket drag whatsoever one of the first
things you'll notice about the star 2 is
that it has glass on the back thanks to
the Corning Gorilla Glass 3 which is
also used on the front the back of the
device is smooth and sleek the chassis
is plastic but feels pretty durable the
top and bottom edges of the device curve
around continuing the sleek feel in many
ways it uses the same design language
it's the ZTE Blade Vic 4G joining the
glass on the back is the camera and the
dual tone LED flash looking around the
rest of the phone you'll find the IR
blaster on the top edge while the
microUSB port and the headphone jack are
on the bottom all the controls are on
the right first comes the volume rocker
and below that the power button on the
left hand side are two trays one for the
Micro SIM card and one for the microSD
card plus the speaker the position of
the power button and the volume rocker
means that if you hold the phone in your
left hand it's very easy to reach the
buttons with your fingers however the
positions of the speaker means that the
sound can be easily muffled by your palm
since the phone includes some very
clever voice activation software the ZTE
star 2 has a multitude of microphones
I've counted three separate holes two on
the top and one on the bottom
presumably they are for noise reduction
and better audio pickup and they
certainly seem to do their job well as
the voice command are excellent but I'm
jumping ahead of myself here the display
on the star 2 is very good it has great
viewing angles and a good level of
brightness personally a 5-inch display
is still the sweet spot for me and the
ZT star 2 brings everything that I
expected from a phone in this category
the 5 inch LCD display has a resolution
of 1920 by 1080 and a pixel density of
441 overall display provides a nice
viewing experience with a good level of
sharpness the colors are bold and the
display gives a device a sense of
vibrancy making it a pleasure to use the
display is flanked by nicely sized
bezels which my crude measurements show
at just under 3 millimeters each above
the displays a space for the earpiece
front-facing camera and the sensors
along with a multi card notification LED
below the display are the three backlit
capacitive keys the performers of the ZT
star 2 is excellent it has the same
Qualcomm Snapdragon processor as the
Samsung Galaxy s5 the HTC One m8 and the
oneplus one although the Snapdragon 801
is being superseded the processor has a
proven performance track record and it
will easily handle just by any tasks you
can throw at it using the star 2 was a
joy in terms of fluidity and
responsiveness the extra features like
the voice commands worked well and
didn't seem too overly taks the
processor at all as you'd expect the
benchmark scores are good and on par
with all of the 2014 flagship devices
the antutu score was 39,000 503 while
Epic Citadel the demo app for the Unreal
Engine reported fifty nine point eight
frames per second in the high
performance mode the star 2 has a
reasonably sized battery at 2,300
milliamp hours since we used to sing
devices with 3000 milliamp hour
trees I was a little skeptical about the
battery performance however I was
happily proved wrong during my time
using this device as my daily driver I
often saw 20 to 24 hours of off charger
time with a screen on time of around 3
hours my experience is that the device
will last a full working day without any
problems the power manager settings also
provides a couple of interesting power
saving options the first is auto adjust
CPU which allows the software to more
aggressively control the CPU frequency
with the auto adjust CPU enabled I
estimate the overall system performance
decreases by around 25% however such a
drop in performance is hardly noticeable
because the Snapdragon 801 is already
such a high performer I ran some
individual battery tests for example
when running Epic Citadel in its guided
tour mode the device will last for about
three and a half hours before it runs
out of battery
Riptide 2 will last around four hours
while Temple Run 2 will last for around
five hours for youtube streaming over
Wi-Fi the device can handle around 6
hours on a single charge
the camera app on the ZTE star 2 is
excellent as well as the normal
point-and-shoot auto mode there are lots
of other different modes including HDR
panorama and front rear the front rear
mode combines the image from the rear
facing camera with a shot from the
front-facing camera besides the auto
mode there is a pro mode a manual mode
that gives you full control over the
various settings like ISO exposure and
white balance however it also gives you
control over the focus this means you
can manually focus images and with a bit
of care you can create nice pictures
with a narrow depth of field other
interesting settings in the camera are
voice control and time-lapse the first
allows you to activate the shutter by
saying capture or cheese while the
second one is use on the video camera to
record only one frame per second and
hence to create a time-lapse movie
interestingly enough the camera can
record not only at Full HD but also at
Ultra HD ok here are some sample shots
from the ZT star 2 if you want to see
some more sample photos please check out
the written review on the android
authority website
on the software side the star 2 uses
Android 4.4 but it comes with a custom
UI known as me favor UI overall me favor
is colorful and light without being too
overbearing one of the big differences
in terms of the UI is a lack of an app
drawer all installed apps appear on the
home screen like on the iPhone / say I
don't - I tend to keep the majority of
my apps on the home screen anyway and
with a clever use of folders you can
keep the device easily organized the
other thing that's quite different about
the star 2 is its settings page it is
completely different from other Android
handsets however it's still easy to use
inside the settings you'll find a
plethora of new features that help set
the star 2 apart from the rest of the
field along with features like double
tap to wake and settings for the display
temperature there is also the always-on
the voice recognition service called
voice assistant even when the device is
offline you can still access a number of
different areas of the phone just by
using your voice calling contacts
controlling music and waking up the
device are just a few of the things you
can do using voice assistant ok phone
open Twitter you can record special
commands magic words which are
associated with an action which will be
performed when the phone hears that
command possible actions include cornea
contact or opening an app the difference
between the magic words and the normal
commands is that the magic words don't
need to be prefixed with the phone's
name quick camera another cool feature
of emotions as well as motions like flip
to mute there are lots of other motions
available including auto answer pocket
mode and change from speaker to earpiece
during a call the first will
automatically answer a call when you
bring the phone up to your ear
the second ensures that the phone rings
with the maximum volume when it's in
your pocket and the third will
automatically switch from speaker to
earpiece when you lift the phone up to
your ear during a call the 16 gigabytes
of internal storage might be a bit
limiting for some people
especially those who like to store a lot
of media on their phones the 16 gigs
divided up into a system area of 3.8
four gigs a user area of 3.9 3 gigs
which is used to install your apps and a
phone storage area of 8.2 three gigs
which is used to store data and media if
3.93 gig seems a bit small as an area
for storing your apps there is an option
to move the apps from the user area to
the phone storage the device also
supports the use of microSD cards up to
32 gigabytes unfortunately there is no
option to move apps from either the user
storage or the phone storage to the
external sd card you are however able to
set the default right location to the
external sd card but this seems to be a
bit hit-and-miss in terms of which apps
respect will understand this setting so
there you have it there's a t-star to
its recommended retail price is $399 so
I've seen it online for as low as three
hundred and fifty dollars I think it's a
great price for a premium smartphone the
processor is excellent and it's the same
package that we saw in many of last
year's flagship devices the design is
great as is the display the software is
advanced you're getting more than just
stock Android line gave the ZTE Blade s6
a score of 8.5 mainly because it's
competitive price its 64-bit processor
and because it's running lollipop now
I'm going to give the ZT star to a score
of eight point eight I think it brings
more feature to the table and even
though it cost more money I think that
extra money is worth it
