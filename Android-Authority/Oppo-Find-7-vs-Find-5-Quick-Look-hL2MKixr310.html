Opel has really come hey it's Josh a
are four man's Road authorities what's
going on everybody and this is the Oppo
find 7 vs. the Oppo find 5 in terms of
design define 7 in the 5 5 share the
same general aesthetic especially when
it comes to the clean lines and the
angular corners with that said Opel
further refined its design in the find 7
which features fewer accents and is a
little bit more understated especially
in the black version that we got to try
with the increase in display size comes
a larger footprint for the find 7 which
overall is about the size of a galaxy
note 3 with that 5.5 inch screen however
the difference between the two
generations is not that significant as
Opel reduced the bezel thickness on the
fine 7 at its thickest point the fine 7
is also a little bit thicker than the
fine 5 probably do to accommodate a
larger battery but overall what we have
here are two premium feeling devices
that continue the tradition started from
one and is put into the other and even
if the shell is plastic in the fine 7 we
still find that the build quality is
very nice and even if it is a little bit
of a bigger device we find that it
should be a little bit better to get
used to over time speaking of traditions
when it comes to the displays the fine 7
continue to the tradition of the find 5
in terms of display quality as the fine
5 was one of the first 5 inch 1080p
displays to come out on the markets the
same goes for the fine 7 in that it is
one of the first quad HD displays out
and that has a resolution of 2560 by
1440 which is just incredible for a 5.5
inch device now while the pixels aren't
necessarily visible on the 1080p fine 5
upon close inspection you do notice the
extra density in the fine 7 and we have
comparisons of these pixel densities
available on android authority comm
nonetheless the viewing ingress will
great on both devices and the colors
were very vivid and but as a caveat we
did have to say that the fine 7 we used
was a pre-production unit and its
display was not fully calibrated but
even so it was still one of the most
photogenic displays that I've ever had
the pleasure of filming or photographing
when it comes to performance there were
no compromises as Oppo cut no corners
when it came to the Snapdragon 801
processor clocked in at 2.5 gigahertz
and the three gigabytes of RAM found
inside the quad HD model the phone flies
absolutely through it
user interface in the room and you can
rest assured that graphics and sense of
games will be just as smooth but in the
opposite corner we find that the fine 5
is just aging a little bit it's not that
the Snapdragon s4 pro is a poor piece of
kit but the chip is more than a year old
and that is an eternity in fast-paced
world of smartphones
however helped by the 2 gigabytes of RAM
the s4 pro still does a good job in most
situations and is still quite reliable
even today as we move on to hardware we
find that it's not just sheer speed that
opal added into the fine 7 but there are
also very welcome additions especially
in the forms of a microSD card slot that
can support cards up to 128 gigabytes
and capacity and a large removable
battery all located under the removable
back cover now speaking of the battery
you get a nice bump from 2500 milliamp
hours to 3000 milliamp hours on the fine
7 but it's not clear if it will be
enough to satisfy the demand of that
quad HD display but the good news here
is that the fine 7 comes with a fast
charging technology that should enable
it to charge from 0 to 75 percent in
just 30 minutes
granted you will have to use the
included charger but that's probably a
small price to pay for such fast
charging times the updates continue when
it comes to the cameras the rear camera
of the fine 7 now is a 13 megapixel Sony
Exmor RS sensor coupled with the lens
composed of six pieces which should
minimize the distortion while still
offering a great 2.0 aperture the fine 7
has an interesting superzoom feature
that we got to try out a couple times
and that it takes 10 images and then
stitches them together using a lot of
post-processing to eventually create one
huge 50 megapixel image that has extra
detail in it the front camera is no
slouch either as the 5 megapixel sensor
and the wide angle lens put onto it
means that your friends will look good
in video chats and selfies the fine 5
also packs a 13 megapixel camera that we
did find quite good but there are fewer
software features and overall the image
quality in the fine 7 is just loads
better than what was found in the fine 5
and finally we move on to software now
while both of these phones run what is
considered the color OS the one found in
the fine 7 is very much like the one
found in the Opel and one and that
evolution was already great compared to
the one found in the fine 5 the fine
fives rather
odd oddly shaped and rather colorful
operating system wasn't quite our bag at
first and it was more than simplistic to
say the least without too many bells and
whistles found underneath but it did get
the job done in most cases move forward
to the find seven and you'll find that
the UI while still keeping that rather
ethereal and somewhat colorful and
somewhat oddly shaped tone throughout
its operating system you find that the
fine sevens a version of color OS is
actually highly functional there are a
lot of ways of taking advantage of
everything that is underneath the hood
including various places to do gestures
like the gesture panel and also even by
using the sky gestures which we
demonstrated in the first look video now
the color OS is based on Android 4.3
making the UI of defined seven includes
several of these features easily but we
are looking forward to the update to
color OS 2.0 which should be coming in
the next few months overall you see a
very good evolution when it comes to the
fine 7 from the fine 5 and in software
that is readily apparent and so there
you have it for this comparison and this
quick look of the Oppo find 7 versus its
predecessor the Oppo find 5 one thing is
very clear that opal has really stepped
up their game and what we already
thought was a great phone in the flying
5 only continues to be so in the brand
new flying 7 keep it tuned to Android
Authority for all of the best coverage
of the elbow fine 7 and remember to head
on over to Andrew authority comm because
