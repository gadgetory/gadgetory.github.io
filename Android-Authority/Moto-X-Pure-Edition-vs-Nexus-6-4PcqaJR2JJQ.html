authority and how does last year's big
Motorola flagship fare against this
year's big Motorola flagship well that's
what we're about to find out what the
Moto X pure edition versus the Nexus 6
it's no surprise that the Moto X pure
edition and the Nexus 6 both share the
same design language after all they are
made by Motorola so you have the same
metal frame that wraps around the sides
these same curves along the corners and
backside and identical placement for all
the buttons ports and front-facing
speakers of course you also have the
signature Motorola dimple on the back
for both devices with the Nexus 6 is
dimple looking much like the one from
the original Moto X while the pure
edition is being housed inside a
metallic strip along with the camera the
Nexus 6 however is obviously much bigger
phone due to not only the larger screen
size but also the much beefier side
bezels over the pure editions thinner
and sleeker bezels now the one is
exactly small by any stretch of the
imagination but the pure edition is
definitely the more manageable device
out of the two and doesn't have that
same unwieldy feel as the Nexus 6 when
it comes to one-handed usability the
biggest difference between these two in
terms of design is the color options the
Nexus 6 comes in blue and white and
that's pretty much it
the Moto X pure edition on the other
hand has more color options material
choices and accent colors then you can
count on your fingers and toes this is
all possible through Motorola's Moto
maker and along with being able to pick
your own colors and material choices you
can also add engravings and greetings
for even more personalization with the
screens you're looking at a 6-inch
display on the Nexus 6 and a slightly
smaller 5.7 inch screen on the Moto X
pure edition both share the same
resolution at 2560 by 1440 but on the
Nexus 6 you're dealing with an AMOLED
display whereas on the Moto X Motorola
decided to make the switch this year to
a TFT LCD panel both displays are
absolutely gorgeous in their own right
especially with the quad HD resolution
but if you're looking for those inky
dark blacks and slightly more vibrant
colors you're only going to get that
with the Nexus 6 the pure Edition on the
other hand has some pretty great looking
colors as well but with an LCD panel
features like motor display don't look
quite as sleek anymore especially in
darker environments we're seeing the
entire backlight light-up becomes much
more noticeable where the Nexus 6 has
the biggest leg up is in screen real
estate so if you want the biggest screen
size possible then the Nexus 6 is the
obvious choice but in terms of overall
brightness and outdoor visibility the
pure addition is the clear winner for
the specs you're looking at Qualcomm
made chipsets on both with a Snapdragon
805 Adreno 420 and three gigs of ram on
the Nexus 6 whereas the Moto X pure
edition is packin the newer Snapdragon
808 Adreno 418 and also three gigs of
ram even though the Nexus 6 is running a
much more dated processor at this point
it still performs extremely well as the
805 is a more than capable processor and
obviously running a pure stock version
of Android always helps the same can be
said about the Moto X pure edition it's
extremely fast and fluid in day-to-day
use and both devices play games and
multitask without any problems and
you'll be hard-pressed to notice any
real differences between the two as far
as benchmarks go and Geekbench you're
looking at a single core score of ten
seventy two and a multi-core score of
thirty four twenty five on the Nexus 6
and on the Moto X you're looking at
12:57 for single core and 3572 for
multi-core so the Moto X does edged out
the Nexus 6 but it isn't by a whole lot
so again as the benchmarks indicate
you're not going to see or feel a huge
difference in real-world use for storage
you're looking at 32 or 64 gigs of
internal storage on the Nexus 6 and like
many other Nexus devices before there's
no room for expandability and that used
to be the case with the Moto X in the
past but this year Motorola added a
microSD card slot to help augment the 16
32 or 64 gigabyte options the nice thing
about both the Nexus 6 and the Moto X
though is that they're plug-and-play
phones which means you can take them to
any major carrier like t-mobile Sprint
Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T
plugging your SIM card and be up and
running in no time
where both of these devices are complete
winners is in the speaker quality the
Nexus 6 and Moto X both have
front-facing speakers which is going to
give you some very awesome audio quality
when listening to music watching videos
and playing games but I will say the
Moto X's speakers sound just a tad
louder with a little more low-end punch
and you also have the option of tweaking
the audio for both the external speakers
and headphones on the Moto X which you
don't get on the Nexus 6
now with the Nexus 6
being substantially larger than the moto
wax you would think that the battery
capacity would be quite a bit bigger but
the Nexus 6 is 30 to 20 milliamp hour
battery is only marginally bigger than
the 3000 milliamp ire cell on the Moto X
but in my experience both phones are
perfectly capable of getting through at
least a full day which is all you can
really expect from most modern-day
smartphones both devices support
Motorola turbo charging so when you do
need to charge them they're super easy
and quick to fill up or top off and in
the case of the Nexus 6 you also have
the added advantage of wireless charging
something that Motorola for some odd
reason keeps omitting from the Moto X
Motorola's biggest weakness with their
smartphones historically has always been
the camera and coincidentally that's
always been a weakness for Nexus devices
in the past but the Nexus 6 broke that
mold and so did the Moto X pure edition
with some very drastic improvements to
both the front and rear cameras and they
even went as far as adding a
front-facing flash for this dimly lit
selfie shots with the Moto X pure
edition you have a 21 megapixel sensor
with face detection autofocus and a dual
tone LED flash while on the Nexus 6
you're looking at a 13 megapixel sensor
with an LED ring flash and optical image
stabilization as far as megapixels go
obviously there's more room for zooming
and cropping on the Moto X but as we all
know by now megapixels aren't everything
when it comes to overall image quality
and if you're just sharing these images
to social media you're not going to
notice too much of difference both
cameras are capable of taking some
great-looking images with tack sharp
focus but most people will probably find
the Moto X's images to be much more
appealing to the eye due to the higher
contrast and slightly more saturated
colors whereas with the Nexus 6 you're
getting a much flatter and more natural
looking image both perform decently in
low-light and although the Nexus 6 tends
to hunt for focus quite a bit the
resulting images are typically much
cleaner brighter and with better white
balance over the Moto X both cameras are
also capable of recording video in 4k
but again the Nexus 6 has the same focus
hunting problems when recording video
and for some reason the footage isn't
quite as smooth or stable as the Moto X
even though it has optical image
stabilization the real advantage of
owning a Nexus has always lied in the
software obviously because the updates
come directly from Google so not only do
you get updates quickly but the
experience is that spear as you can get
it with the next six plenty of users are
probably getting their marshmallow
updates right now
which brings a lot of nice improvements
like now on tap and dose or better
battery life but as of the filming of
this video the Nexus 6 that you're
seeing here is still on 5.1.1 but you
should be receiving the update shortly
the Moto X on the other hand
historically hasn't been all that far
behind in terms of speedy updates and in
some cases actually receive certain
updates before other Nexus devices the
Moto X is probably the closest thing you
can get to a Nexus in terms of updates
and an overall clean software experience
without actually being a nexus and in
some ways Motorola's enhancements to
stock Android make the experience better
than what you would get on a nexus just
to name a few being able to call upon
the Moto X at any time with moto voice
twisting your wrist to open up the
camera with moto actions or just simply
waking up the display by waving your
hand over the phone to see your
notifications may sound trivial or
gimmick at first but once you get used
to some of these features it makes it
difficult to switch to another phone
that doesn't have them when the Nexus 6
first became available for purchase it
was one of the most expensive Nexus
devices we've ever seen coming in at a
starting price of 650 bucks but now the
Nexus 6 can be had for prices that Nexus
owners are used to with $350 for the 32
gigabyte model and $400 for the 64 gigs
the Moto X pure edition is also quite
the bargain especially for our phone
that's only roughly a month old at this
point
starting at $400 you can get yourself a
16 gigabyte Moto X with a standard
colored back and pricing goes up from
there depending on storage and material
choices if you want the pearce Android
experience possible fast updates and a
large canvas to play on then go with the
Nexus 6 but if you rather have more
color and material choices buy a moto
maker a close to stock Android
experience with some useful Motorola
enhancements and microSD card expansion
then the Moto X is the obvious choice
both of these phones are extremely
affordable high-end smartphones and
ultimately what it's going to come down
to is what you're looking for in a
smartphone but either way you decide to
go
you're going to come out a winner as
