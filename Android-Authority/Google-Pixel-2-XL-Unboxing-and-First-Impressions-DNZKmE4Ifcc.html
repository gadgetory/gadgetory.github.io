everybody and it's time to unbox and
give my first impressions on the pixel 2
and the pixel 2 XL brought to you by
audible now we're only doing an unboxing
and first impressions today because we
wanted to make sure we had enough time
with these devices to bring you our full
review which you can look out for within
the next week but let's go ahead and get
into the unboxing when I first got a
glance at these boxes first thought that
went through my mind was I wish I got
the Panda 1 the pixel 2 XL is what we're
unboxing here and it comes with a number
of different accessories including a
small tool in order to connect other
devices to the phone in order for you to
transfer your data after that you have a
USB type-c cable and the USB type-c plug
adapter this will allow for fast
charging on the device so you never
really have to worry too much about
power draining out and then there is the
one accessory that I think everyone is
going to be a bit bummed out about the
USB type-c 2 headphone jack adapter I'm
sure a lot of you are ready to get right
into the comments and talk about how you
hate the fact that the headphone jack is
gone from this device well I kind of
share your sentiment I have wireless
headphones that I love using but when
those run out of battery I do hate
having to have the adapter on me
connected to my favorite pair of wired
earphones just to be able to do things
like play music or play YouTube or play
some audio books from audible getting
the device into my hand during my setup
I was able to see that the pixel 2 XL is
still a pretty attractive device it
might not have too many bells and
whistles but it has everything that you
kind of need the essential is all
available right where you need them like
the fingerprint reader which is right
underneath the glass panel that is sort
of a calling card for the pixel design
now now the smaller pixel 2 is obviously
going to be the easier to handle one and
slightly more accessible for a lot of
users out there but you do miss out on
the 18 by 9 aspect ratio screen that the
pixel 2 XL can boast that aspect ratio
makes for a device that is a little bit
taller than it is wide and it's very
akin to a lot of the devices we're
seeing this year from the likes of
Samsung and LG which have the same
aspect ratio and overall the same kind
of form factor the only thing that's
missing here is the pixel to excels
ability to get the screen to go as close
to the edges as possible that might be a
big deal to some of you out there but it
isn't really that big a deal
to me this does mean there's a little
bit more to the chin in the forehead but
that's because you have the front-facing
camera and also dual front-facing
speakers which all perform pretty well
so far
and another thing that I really love
about this display on either of these
devices is the always-on display this is
something that has been missing on Nexus
devices and pixel devices for a long
time now and we've enjoyed it on other
manufacturers devices now we have our
own version of it and there's an extra
feature the phone is basically listening
for music cues at all times and when it
recognizes a beat or a lyric it will
start to search for what that song is
and it appears in the always-on display
and on top of all of that there's a
little texture to the backing that is
underneath this glass panel that
provides a little bit of grip it doesn't
just slip about in the hand too crazily
and of course you're going to be holding
the phone pretty tight because there's a
squeeze feature now this isn't the first
phone to have a squeeze feature and it
does have one specific function
opening the Google assistant even though
it might have been nice to program this
to other features I would argue that
this is probably the best way to open up
Google assistant at any given time and
Google assistant can do a ton of stuff
not only are you constantly googling
things throughout the day potentially
but it can also open applications or
trigger functions inside of the device
like opening applications like shadow of
war it is pretty easy to trigger the
squeeze depending on how you're picking
up the phone for example if I was using
my fingers in order to pick up the
device off of a table I might squeeze it
just hard enough that it triggers Google
Assistant not a huge deal but something
to keep in mind another exciting feature
about these pixels is the camera
experience the rear camera is only a
single camera it's not going to have
dual lenses whatsoever but it is going
to use computational photography in
order to use data that can help you get
the best quality out of your shot I'm
going to give you more camera samples
and also tests on the optical image
stabilization and other features of the
camera in my full review later on but
for now I want to talk about the
front-facing camera an 8 megapixel
shooter that actually has a portrait
mode aside from the fact that the
front-facing camera seems to be pretty
high quality in and of itself turning on
the portrait mode brings in that
computational data in order to draw out
the foreground and blur out the
background making for while a portrait
pictures in portrait mode tend to be
really pleasing to the eye at least so
far and we haven't tested it in
low-light
ditions yet but we're pretty happy with
what we see so far you don't see any
egregious problems with the foreground
subjects getting cut out along with some
background elements the pixel - and the
pixel - Excel come with the snapdragon
835 4 gigabytes of RAM and large
quantities of on-board storage depending
on how much you pay there are different
sizes in the batteries but I wanted to
tell you about the smaller battery in
the pixel - I do a lot of video calls
these days and on facebook messenger
video calls I went from 100 to zero on a
very long call with somebody that went
for about three and a half hours after
that however I went back to normal usage
that included some gameplay of shadow of
warm YouTube Facebook social media
browsing all of the above and I was able
to get five and a half hours out of that
battery so we're going to do more
testing on these batteries but so far I
actually think the smaller pixel 2 is a
good indicator that battery life on
these phones will be pretty good and
finally let's talk about the software
Android Oreo which is exciting because
this is going to be the first time I'm
using it on the daily all of the
elements including text seem to flow
about perfectly exactly the way they are
supposed to in a stock version of
Android and being able to just seemingly
flow from different applications to the
recent apps screen to even the
picture-in-picture which is automatic
for applications like YouTube just seems
right I'm inclined to say that this is
the version of Android that everybody
should be experiencing and that has been
true for pixels and Nexus devices in the
past but with Android 8 there are a lot
of great additions including even the
battery life application that is built
into the settings and shows a lot of
great statistics as to what is really
taking up your screen on time but let's
pop back to that Sophia took a little
bit ago and let's talk about google lens
google lens is still going to be put
into google assistant in the coming day
so we can't really test that part out
yet but it is built into Google Photos
now and you can do really quick scans of
photos that you've already taken in
order to do quick Google searches but I
want to talk about the selfie I took
because when I put it through the Google
Photos Google lense apparatus it was
able to read the text on my shirt that
you can see here which is a restaurant
out in Maui that is an incredible
restaurant and it was able to provide
that search automatically we obviously
can't judge google lens yet until we get
the full version of it with Google
assistant but I thought
this was a really cool feature and I
wanted to share that with you right now
and so there you have it my first
impressions on the pixel tube and the
pixel to excel there are already some
great features about this phone that I'm
using on the daily and the battery life
seems to be surprisingly good so far but
we're going to give you all of our final
thoughts in our final review as always
