by Toyota hey Josh McCown from answer I
thought it what's going on everybody and
here we are taking a look at the Alcatel
OneTouch Idol X this is the flagship
phone which I was just announced here at
CES 2014 by Alcatel and is it continues
the tradition of guitars very nice
smartphones that have very good
specifications at pretty affordable
price points this one in particular is a
5-inch screen device that provides a
pretty nice display experience here on
the front and you have our soft keys
here at the bottom and if I were to just
click on there you can see the three
over there menu home and back as far as
the design goes we have the 5-inch
screen up front and it does have a bit
of a bezel around the actual display
itself do you see that those black bars
over on the sides however aside from
that the bezels are quite nice after
that when you look at the front the
first thing that I thought was it was as
if an iPhone had a baby with a samsung
galaxy s more because when you look at
the sides it has a very very flat
profile on the sides very easy to grip
and the button layout is a little bit
different it actually has the power
button here at the top so if I were to
turn it off it will go into the
screensaver
I think it'll say out there there you go
so coming back into the OS here over on
the back we do have the OneTouch I don't
ex comes in a bunch of different colors
and you can see the 13 megapixel camera
up in up here underneath the surface we
do have a mediatek processor that is a
octa-core that runs at 2.2 gigahertz
rather and as far as the operating
system goes what we're looking at here
is a very very nice-looking operating
system very colorful pretty pretty
standard for the most part you have your
app drawers and whatnot and then if we
bring down from here you have your
notifications and from there
let's just get those out of the way you
have a nice power widget in the shape
just like a very very similar to stock
Android this is this built however is
Android 4.2 just so you know further
underneath the surface a 2,500 million
power battery will allow you to power
this one for quite a while and you will
be able to use this very nice and sleek
light pretty pretty phone for about as
long as you need it to 2500 milliamp
hours is pretty good
for a processor like the mediatek and
also this display which seems to look
really nice so that is the Alcatel
OneTouch Idol X here at CES 2014 this is
Josh regard from Android Authority stay
