by android authority and her authorities
podcast now called the fdp we do some
explanation as to why we change the name
but mainly it was because we knew you
guys liked that hashtag we wanted to
keep it as well but we also read our
youtube com and so we will respond to
some of those I just put it this way it
is not what you think it is for those of
you who have been commenting particular
ones on our YouTube channel about what
fdp stands for nonetheless we have a
spirited conversation about that and get
right into Android M the supposed
release that's going to come out at
Google i/o this year which is just
around the corner and yours truly Joshua
pagar will be heading over to that show
to bring you all the best from that
event I'm really excited about it but we
also talked about what we want to see an
Android M and even pontificate as to
what M might stand for and we get a lot
of really great suggestions from the
crew we actually have a full 5 panel
show this time around as new rev it was
able to join us on this particular show
and andrew grush because he has a kid
who woke up in the beginning of the day
because we did this early on a thursday
if i remember correctly and he was able
to duck out just a little bit early so
we were still able to have a full panel
for this episode episode number 16 where
we also talked a little bit about the LG
g4 which I had just put out the review
for so I hope you guys all watched that
joe hindy and jonathan fights to join us
as well as our usual panel is so we all
just talk about those things here I did
want to get a couple of announcements
out of the way we did finally get our
soundcloud account up and running so
make sure you head over to the
description below if you're in the
youtube description and also head over
to the full post for the ftp at android
authority calm so you can see and find
the link to the soundcloud account for
us so for those of you who've been
wanting soundcloud you now got it after
that we're coming up on a lot of
different events in the next couple of
weeks so we might have some special
shows in store for you guys but
nonetheless that should pretty much do
it for this intro keep it tuned here and
remember if you're on the YouTube
channel you can always go to itunes to
soundcloud now to stitcher or two pocket
casts any of the podcast programs that
are out there and you'll be able to
listen to the fdp in that particular
fashion one of the best ways of
listening to the end
authority podcast so without any further
ado here is number 16 episode number 16
I should say of the fdp Android M and LG
g4 hope you guys enjoy hey everybody
welcome back to the son of a bitch
podcast yes we changed it up and and we
read our YouTube comments yes we do um
okay I guess that's what we're gonna
start off with because obviously we're
not naming it that because of what it
means in particular languages and on so
yes we are the fdp now and I was
actually told by one of our one of our
bosses a good old Derek over there he's
like I don't think we need to tell them
that P stands for podcast I think it's
kind of implied already just called you
because if you look at our listing on
Pocket cast and everywhere else I've
changed it up ready it'll say Andrew
Authority podcast but then the title of
the podcast is ftp number whatever and
then the type and then the actual sub
sub title um so technically were the
android authority podcast but we we just
kind of like the the term fdp and we
thought we would do like and we will put
like a HTC of sorts and just be like oh
it's the ftp what does it stand for do
you guys have any like what does ftp
stand for for you guys you don't want to
know you don't want to go all the
ridiculous horrible and typically vulgar
things that i have associated with F and
then especially with DP oh oh alright
alright i made my one bad joke for the
day you guys can talk now we I don't
think we really thought of too much when
we what we did it's just that I at least
I noticed and I'm sure grush II did to
that on social media cuz brushing your
more on google+ and twitter right mmm
yeah so i know some Twitter that hashtag
fdp was really gaining traction everyone
kind of like that you know its distinct
what I mean who cares what it stands for
her
Yeah right and that's the whole reason
why we said more P stands for podcasts
preferred the only time I've ever really
said that was last week's show which was
did you guys listen to last week's show
by the way uh the first like 20 minutes
or so but I've had a insanely busy week
so I haven't really yeah much most of it
I think I cut out somewhere in the
middle cuz yeah that dates and stuff but
I love it when we go to events and I get
to have people on like neuron was
supposed to be a guest on the show back
when we went to China together and then
all of a sudden aravis here and he's
with us and authority so doesn't even
really well yeah yeah we were we were we
were all just sort of like in that hotel
lobby just sort of drinking up a bit and
then um like I remember you like nudged
me you're all like what about that
podcast men and I was like um we're not
really really drunk but yeah the I love
it when we get guests for these events
and obviously last week was the LG g4
launch I had a flow from green by donna
esposito and michael fisher on that was
a hell of a show we were I put the clips
at the beginning of the Youtube version
we were on a boat and we got off the
rails so much more than I think any of
us ever have like our usual panel here
on the show but that was the only time
I've ever really said P stands for
podcast and then well we saw the YouTube
comments it just got a little bit crazy
uh but yeah we're we're back in our
respective homes and studios it's time
to talk of we had our poll and I'll let
brushy sort of kind of talk about our
poll and see it was like an overwhelming
response right dude yeah basically like
fifty eight percent of everyone wanted
to talk about Android M so even though
we know nothing about it but speculation
is good of course well let's start with
this let's keep it light for this
beginning part and and just so you
listeners know and viewers on the
YouTube version we will talk about the
LG g4 a little bit later nirav and I are
the only ones who have LG g4 so I'll be
able to do that and hopefully you guys
have been able to see the review that I
put out yesterday already and hope you
guys
but here's my first question keeping it
kind of light I'll start with feisty
what do you think Emma's gonna stand for
all you had to start with that one hey
I'm gonna go off the beaten track beaten
path let's go with marmalade marmalade
that's the first I've heard of that one
Martin well you know it's not exactly a
candy but it's sweet then uh it's unique
so hey here's hoping I'm not putting any
money on that but here's hoping yeah
okay cool um how about Joe um I don't
know what I really really really want it
to be called Macarena Karina is that
even is that a sweet no it's a dance
move come on exactly virtual I know that
you were alive in the 90s right no I do
know that I'm ocarina was my jam when I
was going on but I just don't know if
that would that would that would stick
it wouldn't it that's just that's a pipe
dream that I have because then you know
on stock versions of Android when you
turn it on the boot screen can come on
and you can hear her Macarena and then
it would go to the home screen I think
that would be not only awesome but
hilarious and that band whoever did that
song originally would get some royalties
for the first time in like 15 years and
then collectively we're gonna have so
many broken phones across the world
because I never restart my phone cuz I
don't want to hear that brick in South
your f about you man um I don't know
okay on a serious note I think probably
something like marshmallow but i would
love android mcflurry awesome yes I love
it and then when you boot up or when you
got press the build number like God
knows how many times it comes up with a
picture of mcflurry how cool would that
be now here is the question is it an M&amp;amp;M
mcflurry or is it the obviously superior
oreo mcflurry oh I was just about to say
Oh better question if you take your
Nexus device into McDonald's do you get
a free mcflurry did I would betray you
hit them off that may be a great
promotion wouldn't it did you did you
get a free KitKat when you have
cat no but you got a nice easter egg
when you opened up your kit kat on there
wasn't happy a robot there remember that
mmhmm yeah yeah those get sold around
here I never got to see one of those in
person that's what kind of cool like you
open todavia no I well they miss an
opportunity they should have been
handing out like green tea KitKat so
it's green but yeah that was that was a
thing how about how about you aggressor
what do you think Emma's gonna stand for
um I don't know mackeral mackeral worst
version of Android ever no I well I'd
say marshmallow is probably the most
likely but you know if they could go
Eminem but that would sound kinda weird
actor well I don't know they should keep
up those uh those those company centric
sponsorships you know I was thinking
yeah I don't know I just doesn't roll
off the tongue to me I guess I mean we
gotta I have Eminem I agree marshmallow
probably will be it but but really they
who knows though I mean they don't
always go for obvious one yeah exactly
we thought wall key lime pie and then
almost wanted became KitKat you know and
then my lollipop was pretty obvious I
think I really think this will be a
milkshake to be on milkshake I can see
that yeah I really think it's gonna be
milkshake but but though the one that
came to me and actually was funny with
Joe saying Macarena made me think of
this um I you know what like givin you
no mountain view San Francisco all these
like like yuppie hipster people up in
San Francisco I think it'd be macaroon
macaroon yeah those little kids will
does a little want to be hamburger
things like okay yep I don't want you
talking about yeah I think you're even
mince pie beatable just want a chew on
the lawns at Google just be a big pile
of chocolate brown I was gonna say
cookie that's the words chocolate brown
love it big ol chocolate brown in the
lawn yeah we're holding a chocolate
obviously total tangent by the way like
I saw this on I saw this I don't know if
anyone here watches at midnight on
County Central but there's there's that
um there's an emoji that looks like poop
this total tangent I'm sorry guys but
does that emoji that looks like poop and
the thing is I found out that's not poop
that's supposed to be ice cream who
thought of that like who who said that
was fine like is that the one that's got
the face on it I'm like little smelly
lines Camille yeah that's supposed to be
ice cream somehow the most solid ice
yeah really it's fine that looks like a
steaming pile of it sounds like somebody
just trying to save face oh yeah it's
ice cream Yeah right it's jiff not give
and then like oh my goodness okay so
Android M speaking of poop now I'm just
kidding I would totally eat Android
shaped marshmallows just saying oh I
thought that was going at Oh loyalists
here Andrew 30 um agreed oh man imagine
like a lucky charms with with androids
in it hopefully alright so Android M now
I just did a search right before this
podcast just to see like you know what
are the clothes do we have an Android or
D about Android M anyway we have two one
of them is Android M revealed on the
schedule and then the next one Android M
reportedly to be or supposedly going to
be release at Google i/o and that's it
that's the first time I've ever searched
for something on android authority and
there was an end to the page um given
that um we don't we really don't know
much about Android M which is a travesty
because Google i/o is right around the
corner and we're still kind of n okayed
this was a this was one of the poll
options but I suppose this still fits
we're right around the corner from
google i/o and if Android M is actually
going to be announced to there we're
still in the middle of Android L release
cycle aren't we yeah well they did you
finally got 5.1 on the Nexus 9 hey guys
don't forget that this is exactly what
happened last year also and they
announced android l and Kit Kat only had
ten percent of the market share like
this is um typical behavior from the
googles so yeah it's right the middle of
the release cycle and eat this is I've
complained about it like for weeks now
so I'm not gonna go over it again but I
mean it's the it's the yearly release
I think they're trying to get back into
it well you know that but typically
there's been like a lesser version in
the summer and then you know the big one
later and so are they just shifting to
once a year having release I don't know
maybe really you can't really count 5.1
I mean yeah it's 5.1 but can you really
count it as well you can I don't you
can't make an announcement at i/o about
5.1 you know not necessarily yeah it's
not well I mean it didn't bring him I
mean even if they have waited for all
the bug fixes in 5.1 it wouldn't have
been special enough to like make a big
announcement about you know yeah and so
I mean it even like compared to like the
jelly bean point you know point two
point three either there's less
difference you know and so uh I don't
maybe maybe they're trying to move to a
once a year yeah probably so and of
course we don't know how long it'll be
before they actually like I highly doubt
they're releasing em you know this
summer they're gonna probably do a
developer preview who knows how long the
wait i mean i would imagine not till you
know not until the next nexus is at the
end of the year mmm yeah and so that
basically means it's been a year since
you know the last update because like i
said i don't really count 5.15 point
one's not an update it's just fixing
things that should have been there big
one yeah alright and then like maybe a
few additions to the auxiliary android
platforms like like like where and then
you know Android M is so supposedly
supposed to have some Android auto
functionality in there that will tap
into your actual navigation system so
you don't necessarily have to have like
an Android auto like installation in
your car speaking of Android auto in
about two and a half to two and a half
two and a half hours I'm finally getting
a android auto um equipped Hyundai after
that debacle from last time was like
wait this car doesn't have Android auto
like what's that that's always inside
that is a great sign you know that right
wells android auto what well the the
guys who sent the car and who are
sending it today or a third party so i
wouldn't i give them the benefit of the
doubt in that case and then are our
contacts over at Hyundai were like sorry
about that like we we have demos
available but we're not going to be able
to send them out and it only took them a
month to bring me a car that I
she had it so for the next ten days I'm
going to be using this car like really
getting to know it putting up videos and
stuff but yeah Android M coming out at
i/o one thing I have to comment on and
of course I'm the only one I think in
this group that's been to I oh right yes
yeah okay correct yeah I love I oh but
it's been shrinking like the first year
that I one was two years ago to years
ago and it had like there was like a
huge store on the bottom floor of the
Moscone Center it went on for three days
last year it was three days but no store
this year it's two days and it's like
there's not i'm not excited about IO for
the announcements anymore because the
first time i went it was like oh here's
google play music and that was amazing
you could try it out right he'd like as
they were announcing it everyone was
installing it on their phones last year
we had some Android wear stuff and and
you know we had all those analysis I
don't know what to expect for this
year's i/o and if Android M is the only
thing I'm actually not quite that
excited about it to be honest I don't
know I think they'll be some surprises
you know hopefully uh and having an
Android am I think it's gonna be
interesting because I think they're
gonna they've already kind of hinted if
you look at the schedule uh yeah I'd say
autos gonna be a big part of Android M
and then just work place they have some
workplace tough one thing yeah we have
an article on it but it didn't say
Android M one thing that probably is
related to Android mo is that Google in
their schedule has hinted about new
voice actions that are coming mmm and I
would imagine that coincides with em and
basically they're going to be bringing
the ability well here's the here's what
they say in the schedule mobile hardware
has adopted the touchscreen as the
primary mode of input and with 1 billion
active Android users there's no signs of
the slowing down what if you could
provide users with a new method of
access to your apps with little to no
development overhead in this talk we
will discuss ways to give anyone access
to their android device device through
voice alone hmm so we may be seeing more
and more apps that can be controlled to
your voice like at a more granular you
know level you know the deeper level
basically well and so that could be cool
you know and that would make sense for
Android auto yeah I suppose so right and
it would make sense for Android auto but
but even then
again and and did this this will segue
me into some Android auto talk but I
just wanted to ask speaking of voice
Actions Narev do you use do you use
voice actions on on your android phones
for fairly often I used to um but I
don't to be honest that I found I don't
know why but i think it's just my
approach axon gu doesn't really like
trying to like the transcribe what I
actually said racist is why you're
saying I never said anything like that I
just said it doesn't like us professor
to be fair it has like five thousand
different accents it needs to understand
here I'm from London like proper
Englishman so oops that's just bet
that's a different dad come I say
actually closer to racist London where
I'm writing my english i can say that
it's ok very whoops it's like that link
running southern country stupid rednecks
you're sure this gonna be testing sorry
go ahead i'm sure there's gonna be
comments right now based on exactly what
I said about Englishman because it's
always a topic that grains anyone who's
not from London and people who are from
London but yeah i use i think sometimes
i use google now occasionally to search
but an occasion used voice input but
i've never really found a need for
anything else yeah if i think back to my
going back start off topic but going
back a few years to when s voice first
came out i think it was the s3 or maybe
the s4 s3 for I used to I used to use it
to open apps all the time because I
couldn't be bothered to find them in an
app drawer because it was far too much
bloatware and it was just stuffed in
some corner somewhere but I don't really
I don't know I've never really found a
need I'm not found out that voice
functions are useful but I would love to
be able to kind of just go off my watch
like my ideal for something on Android M
and voice actions would be from my
android wear watch go ok Google on my
phone launch what Sam as an example so I
don't even need to pick up my phone and
then from there I can do another thing
ok Google new voice that new whatsapp
chat with x y&amp;amp;z or use hangouts because
it's google service or something like
that that's the only way that voice can
be really kind of like instead of having
to physically touch your phone ideal if
you obviously your friend and like touch
them with Android auto be perfect if
friends on your dashboard or something
just being able to open an app start a
new chat type of message and send it
without having to touch your phone mm
but not just with google apps but once
developers add their support any apps
mmm well the UH I think that's a glaring
hole with with I guess I guess I guess
what we were saying that was google now
is you can't necessarily just say launch
this and just assume that every app will
open based on that command I think
there's like a glaring hole there where
if you were to install an app from the
Play Store that isn't necessarily known
or has like let's say less than 10,000
downloads you just can't say open like
in my case like open open I gluco and
that's like my that's my blood sugar
meter app it won't open I'm sure of it
because it's listed with a bunch of
different names on the freaking Play
Store like that's the consolidation i
think is what is lacking in terms of
voice actions it's a thing and the only
way that Google can make them useful is
to keep them very vague which is why I
feisty you have you have a Chromebook it
wasn't wasn't voice action a key part of
the Chromebook experience is it really I
thought it was because I remember I
remember looking at Chromebooks at at
actually at Google i/o and um it kept
saying like you know if you were in
chrome or in any which particular
application it could say like okay at
this point you can say Google ok Google
and it would do it like like they said
that chrome had the built-in voice
actions and it was a key part of
Chromebook I'm assuming you don't use
voice actions on your Chromebook huh
that is correct your right they are
there I've disabled them we're making
the case that there's one thing that
Android em might be great for is
something we'll never use which is which
is my point like or could they go from
here and we we had a very spirited rant
from Joe a couple weeks ago about like
the the infrastructure of Android and
how that needs to be changed for
obviously but I a dead cut you off there
I see what it will already go say I was
going to jump back in you know give my
opinion on the Android side of things
but you keep going come back to me well
that that was what i was going to sort
of segue into was like what what do you
want to see in let's say android
macaroon or android milkshake or or
android Macarena yeah what would you
like to see in and I could double back
over to you feisty like do you have
anything in mind that you would really
want to see let's stick with the voice
stuff for a moment here there is already
a lot of voice activated stuff in
android now i'm not sure if they're
talking about increasing the
functionality through google now or
throughout the operating system I don't
know what I he was a lot of operas ism
tasker I mean if you've been following
my Thursday posts everybody knows they
say use tasker a lot I've got a button
on my you know one of the home screens I
tap it Tasker comes up I talked to
Tasker through an Android voice input
and then Tasker does a whole bunch of
things for me I barely use google now
but but i'm still using that voice so i
guess it depends on how they're gonna
implement this and you know if they're
going to route everything through google
now then I don't want to use the word
monopoly and bottleneck but I see the
fears on that otherwise enter it and
sorry go on Ref now go on feisty cariño
I was gonna say Android M in general I
need to say Google stop it just stop
let's look back a year two years ago
when we looked at mobile operating
systems the power of these devices was
in the applications and now Android
itself is doing everything and there's
going to be some confusion on the word
but it's it feels to me bloated it's
doing way too much is trying to handle
too many things it can't offer the same
sort of options that a dedicated app
might make sure it's great that the
operating system could do it all and
look after your entire phone but there's
a million plus episode
and many of them are you know being shut
down or deprecated because android does
the stuff now but it doesn't do it quite
as well in a lot of cases so can you
give us a specific example they're like
I'm curious a flashlight applications
that's a big one that people think talk
about I mean that was big stuff for a
lot of people and they're dead now if
you've got lollipop installed it's right
there in your quick settings um you can
actually make the argument that it's
less convenient there because like I i
I've been using it on I actually went
back and got a flashlight widget because
it's actually fast for me to turn on my
screen unlock the phone and tap the
widget than it is for me to like unlock
the phone reach all the way to the top
drop the notification thing drop it a
second time to get to the flashlight and
then finally turn on the flashlight let
you make my point exactly yeah that's
exactly I was gonna say almost the exact
same thing when it came around to my
turn but ya know like the it go to stare
two steps forward two steps backward you
know that's what it feels like yeah the
OS is doing it but there are apps out
there that are now not going to get
installed because yeah why it's there in
the OS so I say this strip most the
stuff out of it keep Android clean work
with better integration look at like the
exposed modules and easier support with
them without root and I think that's the
way that things should go is that what's
coming I doubt it but I mean the
permissions thing coming up if that
becomes real where Google is going to
let us choose to grant or deny
permissions on a per-app basis / m /
permission basis I think that's awesome
but again that's something the root
world has been doing for a while yeah
it's just let's say okay feisty Oh so
before I guys I was actually gonna pop
it over to you arrived oh I'm Justin
going back to your topic but you're what
you mentioned about Google now that's
pretty much what I was going to say I
don't think I think Android M is gonna
be like Lodi but where the less
obviously everyone knows that Android is
open source it the AOSP in
it's the google services that kind of
had the play store etc onto it I think
that the likes of cyanogen and others
and write their close relationship the
fact they're getting a lot of funding
because people don't want to rely on
Google services actually has boo them a
little bit worried so where Google is
driving kind of any innovation Android
it's now going to try and bottleneck it
all through its own app to kind of force
people to use it but going back I think
probably grew if I see that actually
there is a time when there's too much
Google too much reliance on that because
we all know that no matter what you do
it's going to have your data on that and
let's be frank it already has so much
data about you anyway do you really want
to start routing all your voice actions
to it so essentially it knows everything
you've done on your phone more than you
may not know already kind of thing it's
I think if it's too like having voice
functionality that didn't rely on Google
now would be brilliant but I personally
agree with I see that we're going to see
anything we see going forward that's a
Google Ned innovation is going to be
done through google now it won't be
Android at the call because if it's
Android up the call I spotted by OSP
example then they're giving that from
strategy to other people who aren't who
may not necessarily install that Google
suite of applications and that's
obviously a problem for them because
they don't get the day two and make
shitload of money yeah it's yeah you
well I I can't stop thinking about that
point you made that you know there's so
much of our data that's already in
Google's camp you know like this there's
so much it's already there and and for a
company that's like so huge you're right
there could be something as too much
google and i think a lot of people can a
lot of people have already voiced that
opinion out you know it isn't it true
though that Google's really been pulling
the reins on Android recently I mean
look at all of these we have now three
flagship phones that have been released
this year and nearly all of them have
this kind of I don't know they feel like
they're not putting too much of
themselves into the phones as much as
before you know like we used to complain
about it with TouchWiz
samsung over the last year or two and
all that but I feel like every company
now has like even LG was saying they
have this really close relationship of
google and it worked really closely with
them and now most of the apps that are
defaulted on the g4 are like chrome and
drive and all that stuff so yeah google
is kind of pulling the reins Grusha how
about you man well how do you feel about
a Android M what woody what do you want
to see in this upcoming version oh and
if that doesn't have millions of
millions of bugs that make it worse
that's why i believe is version that's
why I'm leaving Joe for last because I
know it we're in for a good one that's
general probably the biggest thing but
I'd like to see a little more movement
between you know chrome and you know
more merging between chrome and Android
I think that could be interesting hmm
you know I think that we're already
moving in that direction so I'd like to
see more android apps come to you know
Chromebooks and I don't think they're
ever gonna merge completely but I could
see them coming closer together yeah uh
you know the voice action thing I agree
i probably wouldn't use it a lot but i
could see i could be useful for when
you're you know in the vehicle obviously
yeah that was uh that was where i was
going to go with that in a vehicle like
so that that hyundai that i had almost a
month ago at this point i obviously
there was no android auto in there but
its integration was already really good
with my smartphone you just connected
via bluetooth it auto connects every
time you get into your car and the
microphone is placed perfectly right
above you so all voice actions are
coming loud and cleared and everything
like that the video i'm gonna make next
week or one of the two at least is the
case that maybe android auto as cool as
it might be and as nice as it as it is
to integrate everything from your
smartphone to your car maybe it's a
little unnecessary and because if we
already have good navigation systems
like Audi's navigation plus or BMWs or
or Hyundai's blue link in that case then
you know is it more is it more of a
luxury rather than necessary and and
Google really has to make the case that
it's completely nest
on the other hand having a car mount and
putting her phone there and then using
voice actions using your phone kind of
works pretty well already that's what
I've been noticing recently so if the
voice Actions work great on the phone
and you're in your car and it's able to
pick up your voice and you know you just
have to car mount right there so the
screen is right in your face while
you're driving I I'm all for it I do use
google voice I do use google i use
google voice but i do use google now
voice actions fairly odd but never that
i still think the whole ok Google now
thing is dumb uh Google ok Google blah
blah blah it's not even that hard to
just like just hit that microphone icon
right next to the widget you can change
the hot word to like I know people
who've changed it so you know okay blah
to blah okay Jarvis I think is a popular
one that people do a lot of course yeah
I mean that was something somewhat
popularized by her brother Roman if for
a period in early 2014 I said hey
douchebag and it hey douchebag search
for stuff hey fdp I'm sorry I do all
right so all of us let's grab our
popcorn let's let's sit back Joe sure
now man haha well okay like you know
just joking around there um what uh well
what do you what do you want to see an
Android M um well a feisty had probably
the best point out of everybody so far
is that um android has always been a you
know the strongest suit has been
applications there's 1.3 or 1.4 million
of them right now um you know a games
and apps and tools and things that do
all kinds of other things and um you
know I think it would behoove Google to
go back to you know promoting that a
little more just you know examples
exactly what feisty said but uh my the
biggest thing that I hope they do
eventually in any version of Android is
to give the users more control of their
devices without requiring root access
and it's not just stuff like you know
being able to change the battery icon or
having root access or backing up your
absence I hating it back up but it's
other stuff too like something I've been
complaining about a lot recently is
Google location services you know I know
what it is but I don't know why it's
always running like it's been running
since i rebooted my phone last night ten
and a half hours facebook is another
application that's really really really
bad at this i turned off sync i turned
off everything literally everything in
the settings says off are not active but
facebook has a process running on my
phone right now that's used the mobile
radio for 20 minutes and has sucked down
nine percent of my battery life what the
hell is Facebook doing and how come I
can't find out that information I can
tell you what it's doing tell me baby
girl because I need to know um okay no
this is not a scientific answer by any
means but you guys ever noticed that
Facebook does that that that weird thing
where it tells you if one of your
friends is nearby I think that's what
you that's what it's constantly trying
to do and it's okay eh it's creepy but
be you're right having that location
service on at all times it does drain
the battery life a bit and it's oh no no
it drains the battery life a whole
ton I think with my screen off between
Google Play services and Facebook it's
forty five percent of my battery a lot
of I think I mean at what a five percent
of the drainage today since I unplug
I've noticed I've noticed the same
joking like on the last three weeks with
the essays I think probably out of about
20 days in my top three facebook at the
end of the day maybe 10 days out of 20
it's been there on the other days it's
in the top five and I might open it once
in that entire day but it's the like 43
there for days it with a biggest drain
until I turned location off system-wide
and that's the thing I and then it
started being better or something I
don't want to do that all the time like
I don't want to have to walk around like
micro aetna this is exactly what I'm
talking about i don't want to have to
walk around it and micromanage my
connections if i turn location off in
facebook the freaking app shouldn't have
it and facebook should look at my device
and go here spain whatever and I don't
appreciate that like I have to like turn
it off in the system then I have to turn
it off in the application and and then
at some point even if I turn both of
those off it's still somehow like
opening itself up like if I'm not
using the application it shouldn't be
used at all unless I tell it to that to
sink in the background and you know that
this is a problem that it's been getting
progressively worse than Android is he
like back in like you know gingerbread
there were processes that were in the
background but it wasn't like you know I
I'm gonna look to sub just like i said i
think i have six or seven google play
services tasks open right now and i
don't know what they're for like I don't
even have that many apps that track my
location so I don't know what it's doing
I never know what it's doing and that
that's what I you know if I had to ask
Google you know pray to Google you know
sit on Google's lap and ask for
something for Christmas um it would be
you know allow us to kind of Lassa win
these things and stop them entirely
because it's just it's getting
ridiculous at this point and hey joe
what's what's really going on is that
i'm tracking you and i'm watching you
from the camera I I'm your secret
stalker to make sure you're not viewed
at the fruit for whatever that yeah damn
it chase it's really going on is I'm
just I'm just following you around see
what you doing right yeah I'm sorry that
I'm putting so much straight on the
battery though two processes are two
processes and seven services seven
services fur and that's just uh it's
frustrating it's frustrating because it
doesn't exist if google play or Google
Play services weren't so you know a
shrouded in mystery and I could see
what's causing all of this drain I would
take steps to fix it I would maybe start
browsing facebook from its mobile page
instead of having the application or you
know petition facebook to put in
settings so I could turn that crap off
but right now like Google Play service
is kind of like hides all of the bad
stuff that other applications are doing
and I really really want that to end
like I don't think that should be a
thing that exists anymore hmm you know
on iOS I mean just on location alone on
iOS you can see the little indicator in
the navigation bar when when locations
been activating then you can go to
settings and tells you exactly which
apps are
using your location at that time I can't
believe android doesn't have that
because it will tell you like
occasionally my location will be on and
I've seemed a little indicator going oh
look location set by GPS but I can't see
at that moment exactly which app has
asked it to check that location yet iOS
does and I'm not trying to compare them
but having used an iphone for the last
couple of last few days just to do some
testing on something I've noticed that
actually it's a lot easier to find out
there what's using the location and just
turn the off switch yeah and then it
stops exactly and I know that you look
at the the last couple of years the last
couple of releases you know they you
have people saying like oh you have more
you know control than ever before no you
don't you have if anything who's
telephone is that is that a landline
landline still who has a damn that means
I can't ask you to put it on vibrate
yeah it's a it is it 1950s into your
house Oh give him a break he's got a
rental house at the moment and what if
his one of his phones time travels yes
nice T is it one of those those little
funds that you can't have to you can't
even press button you have to dial it
around and right now the rotary of fun
Terry well yeah did I bet the one I
can't even make that sound uh oh and
yeah if i sees over though he's got like
a TARDIS right next door is on the side
you like adding I'm gonna make this
phone leave the room I'll be right back
20 50 HR ash in a window shatter
everything out the window you hear ya
you don't even run Android don't even
write what I was alright sorry but um
yeah where were you you know outside of
the complaints you know what do I wanted
I what I don't even know what I want an
android I'm cuz like it's it feels like
it's too soon to talk about it you know
it's a thing so cuz we're so close to il
at this point man like I'm my whole
choice don't know we're saying really
yeah I know it's not that the proximity
to the event is the idea that they're
not gonna you know I figured that they
would you this is a huge like uh it's a
huge change like
the last time they did such a huge
change it was going from ice cream
sandwich and honeycomb to jelly bean and
they took a couple of years to refine
that and you know given how lollipop
started out one would think they would
want to refine that a little bit more
before moving on to the next one so yeah
I don't know just in my mind I didn't
have it built up that we were going to
get Android M at Google i/o this year so
I agree with it it feels like that day
right before you get a cold and you
don't know if you have like a cold or
the flu or if there's something that you
ate or if it's just really hot outside
and you like you know is it do I have a
fever is just warm out here let's go see
right now yeah yeah I do although I do
have a cold I'm sorry yeah you know so
you're like you like you know you don't
exactly know what medicine take you like
I don't know exactly what I'm gonna do I
should I call off of work to just take
them all combined um you'll be fine yeah
job there that's my philosophy good job
over there liver failure geez who needs
why it feels kind of like that where
it's like I don't know what I want
because you know the stuff that I have
now is just so incomplete that I kind of
wanted to wait and see what a completed
lollipop felt like I mean I think you
have a legit point who of us was where
any of us expecting em I was expecting
point you know 5.2 yeah like a five boys
lollipop or something you know yeah i
was i was expecting it yeah before
Android M I thought yeah it was gonna
take at least a couple of years I agree
and I think coming right you could be
right that lollipop started off so badly
what I do believe that it's the last
half naughty yeah you know I saw this
shirt off badly is that it was such a
huge change I mean you guys remember I
Oh last year I mean that blew everyone's
freaking mine material design and Google
you fittin android auto and more Android
wearing like it was just like oh and I
know an Android M this year what are
they gonna do like how what could they
possibly do that it was so big that it
deserves a name change especially after
all the ridiculous stuff that they
announced last year that still just
barely exists this year like Android
wear is coming along nicely but I mean
josh is getting a demo unit for Android
auto that's out do out what circuit 2017
like Helen
it is just half of the stuff that they
announced last year isn't even out yet
so they've created these other
ecosystems that honestly are not
ubiquitous and it just feels odd that
they would OOP start and they would it
just kind of feels odd that they would
focus so hard on stuff that pretty much
everyone in that room at Google i/o
there they need to put their own foot in
the door to have it you know and that's
the part that kind of gets me is that
Android auto is not really in every
single car it won't be and even then
most people are okay with their cars and
they're not going to even touch android
auto until like you said 2017 probably
same thing with Android where you have
to actually buy and buy into this
particular ecosystem that's why it's odd
you know like I'm not gonna I'm not
gonna go out on a limb and say that you
know Android has reached its its peak or
anything like that so what else could
they do because obviously they have auto
and where but those I shudder to think
that that's even enough to warrant a big
name change Android that that's how I
feel about it and that's why I'm not too
excited about I oh I don't really know
what's gonna come you know to me it
almost feels like they're pulling a
Microsoft that you know lollipop had
some reception issues just like you know
windows 8 did so now they're just
pulling a change so that way they can
sweep it under the rug yeah yeah it's
almost what it feels like to me yeah
exactly that is like the perfect analogy
for exactly how I feel it's like it
almost seems like they're trying to just
get away from lollipop as soon as
humanly possible well that's basically
with windows 10 I mean other than they
bring back a start menu and stuff it's
still I've been using the you know that
the test version it's still basically
windows 8 and I that feeling em will be
the same thing it'll be basically the
same thing as lollipop but they'll fix a
few things that are complaint points
like bugs and you know maybe things like
the we will have a you know real silent
mode again and you know stuff like that
and then all of a sudden will be a big
deal it'll be awesome you know cuz
that's what's gonna happen with Windows
10 is it's they're gonna make it seem
like it's a big deal because you know oh
we jumped from eight to ten we've done a
bunch and I think that's good what I
feel like they're doing here with that
it's like oh look how much we've
accomplished it's like it's gonna be
this good hugs in my
you know cuz really you know not to get
the whole Microsoft side of things but I
feel like using Windows 10 I'm probably
only one who's used that the test
version but I have uh I have you know I
ate mice grape tomato it doesn't feel
that different than Windows say other
than it has a start menu and so any
different from windows 7 either oh yeah
none of them do yeah they could all
still be we could be like windows seven
point five and be fine you know it's all
basically feels the same and I feel like
yeah just to me I mean maybe they'll do
something big and we're just talking out
of our asses and uh well they did never
just awesome you know maybe em will be
the most amazing thing ever and we'll
all be like yeah we were totally off
base but to me it just seems like
there's gonna be blackberry meet windows
and a bit of iOS and the generator
android is dead battery that's the
future happens I'm back to my blackberry
OS for Android murdered yes yeah the
murder mystery out of here first folks
you could make a blockbuster movie out
of that man like literally like watch
like people get angry like just look
outside just see like steam trails
coming up out of the streets like
they're doing what blackberry no well
i'm speaking of i'm just gonna say this
until it happens like I'm waiting for
Google to buy blackberry and bring back
the keyboard that's a yes that's all I
want that's a given hipster I was
actually kind of off topic but when your
pointer what I really think should
happen is I think blackberry should
finally admit that they probably are
listening to this and if they are hey I
don't mean anything by this but clearly
OS 10 really is a bit dead and it always
has been before he was even conceived
they should they could have easily just
taken Android put a launch on it and
made our stand yeah and probably with
like one percent of the money why and
use the rest of the money to make good
phones and that Marketing market stuff
yeah and you're not even just that it's
just the the fact that you could even
side load android apps onto a freakin a
freakin blackberry bb10 you know and you
know the framework is there yeah just
they just you know sort of
being so stubborn you know they could
probably resurrect themselves a little
at least a little bit if they just sort
of embrace what whatever you want kind
of assumes they will do one day you know
um okay and far ready yes follow google
right I know we're here like Google's
doing too much and now we're like follow
go back to whatever google says it's
fine just installed google play services
it'll make everything yep no it won't
never you'll never make it better you
googled making us install Google Play
services is the technological equivalent
of turning out the lights and telling
someone to close their eyes and open
their mouth and I just know it makes me
so uncomfortable they took me a second
to imagine that image that I was so
regretful about but Josh you could just
look at Joe's like Skype image and
you've got the perfect example so uh Joe
is a kirkham at McMaster Europe like
Idol then oh good god no I don't think
what he's doing is any better you know
he's such a he's so over over the top
with everything that you read the kirk
master says you know I don't like it's
helping the company at all um but
speculation wise cuz you know I don't
think I said about specula Tori what I
think Android M is gonna have is a bunch
of smaller stuff like akin to when
kitkat got frickin cloud printing
because that was a revolutionary feature
it's gonna be a bunch of stuff like that
like the screencasting and lollipop and
you know a cloud printing and Kit Kat
and you know those small little tiny
things that get baked into the operating
system that constitute a change but like
not really a change that a lot of people
are going to use I think that's what
Android and realistically it's gonna be
it's just it's going to be some small
things here and there that you know are
going to sound really impressive when
they talk about it and then when it gets
put into practice it'll be something
that you know like people use for a
little bit and screw it the old way was
better and like like like cloud printing
I mean that sounded really exciting like
oh man we could just tell it to print
from our phone it's going to print and
then like to
years later does anyone does anyone use
cloud print I remember thinking that too
yeah I remember thinking that too like
it's like a big heavy that print things
from my phone to see well how often do
you print stuff like never I mean I have
to at tax time I have to dust off my
printer by the cable like I don't know
where half the cannibals are ya cuz I
don't use it except for tax season it's
the only Tommy printer gets used cuz I
keep all my records did is the year of
our Lord 2015 there's no need for a
printer anymore next time thanks time
nice thing I managed well my tax without
burning anything off I agree with brushy
it needs in each printing but one that
topic of power bringing I believe I have
an account of the film Joe so I asked my
my stuff to them and you know they you
know so but sorry they're happy virtual
and restored it happened we said it
wrong okay how's your chance here on you
call him a tosser damn yes you're a
toaster get my name right my bad i think
we went through this josh's expense last
time I thought people don't really nice
to you the right way I like in my mind
the right way and tell you said it and
now it's you know you have to listen to
whatever josh says he's good haha he
said sustainable suck and you just
change your name that will solve the
problem okay um I will to the next one
I'll tell you guys what my new name is
hey oh you it's gonna be fun to say but
on the subject to cloud printing I
bought a new HP printer it works out the
box with iOS it doesn't work with Maya
six like i used i printed one thing off
my iphone that this iphone I've been
like using for a few days and that's
more than I printed in god knows what
ever of Android the problem is that
people can I going back to fragmentation
and on a serious dropping all that
rubbish but the whole problem is you can
introduce things by cloud printing but
what's the point if people like ok
Google supports it but you need to get
all the manufacturer printer
manufacturers to support it without
needing like the ideal is to do the way
IRS is and it's just being able to print
stuff without having to install apps
installed drivers and all of that i can
get this working with an S six but I've
got to download HP zap I've got it
installed a driver I think that actually
hook up the printer to my computer turn
on a few settings yet versus iOS I just
pressed print airprint and all of a
sudden is printed within about 30
seconds that's the whole problem you can
introduce all sorts of features but
given that like even lollipops on ten
percent now and Android M will probably
take a year to get ten five or ten
percent or whatever what's the point
because no one no money back hardware
manufacturers actually ever going to
support it and that's exactly you know
that's a great point and that's exactly
why I don't like it when people come up
to me and be like well it doesn't matter
if you don't have the latest version of
Android because as long as you have the
latest version of Google Play services
you're up to date no you're not didn't
like lollipop have something like 9,000
new api's that no one with Google Play
services on 4.4 and back can even use
like and that's exactly the same problem
is even a kit kat what's kit kats a
thing right now I didn't look at that I
just saw that lollipop was at ten
percent but I mean you know kick ass
about 59 is it will never move nothing
16 I'm the last on one check yeah I'm
looking at right sorry for the clicky
clicky noises everybody kit kat is
thirty nine point eight percent so not
even half full of the people and
everyone counting lollipop which
obviously has these api is also not even
half of the people currently using
android I think my own what does this
even add up to a hundred percent yoga
yeah it does oh I'd love it is like I
just doesn't seem like it did for a
second but yet not even half of the
people who rock at android phone right
now can use cloud printing so what's the
point of coming out with a printer for
something that only half of a potential
user base can use and then you have to
deal with the fact that you know
somebody running jellybean might buy the
cloud printer like oh yeah cloud printer
for Android and then they can't use it
it's like well why not cuz you don't
have Kit Kat and then they're like well
uh well that's your fault obviously and
it's like now is you dragging the
printer companies into this and it's
like no they don't want to do it and I
understand why they don't want to do it
and it's because Google Play services is
a band-aid for a gunshot wound and it's
not really a the kind of fix that Andrew
it's the kind of fix android has but
it's not the one that it needs
now Batman oh man all right well we're
coming up on the last like 10 10 or so
minutes here I did want to spend a
little bit of time talking about the g4
so the review came out yesterday and I
do have a couple things that I want to
say but the only other person on the on
the cast right now that obviously has a
g4 is an Arab so real quick I wanted to
get your thoughts on how you feel about
the LG g4 so far and yeah yeah just your
thoughts so far hmm I you do you have a
leather bag let me ask that no and I'm
really really really disappointed about
yeah because okay like our everyone
thought Oh leather back it's gonna look
at rochas and the public can't be got
more stick than if they had just not
bothered announcing it before but LG
being LG they thought all let's make a
big deal about a leatherback and yeah
and then actually it's and really the
blender back is gorgeous so in this
turned out I can't admit that I wasn't a
bit disappointed but I've got the
titanium finish same here plastic yeah
what is titanium finished plastic come
on man like it's great Zoila ditch there
are two things that should never ever be
put together yeah titanium finished
plastic I mean that just seems like a
complete nut to waste but I've got to be
honest I like it and I'm just going to
probably spiel off and I have it it's
not i'm not looking at your review and i
say this josh but what I actually think
is the design is nice the curve is ok
it's I can see why they've done it and
if it's just kind of a combination of
like the one m8 1 and 9 and the G flex 2
but they've kind of just bought their
version of the MA out so it's just
slightly curved edge really nice the
display yeah I like it um I can see why
they made a big deal about like the DCI
standard and all of that and it is I
mean it is pretty it is better than the
s6 when it comes to her just just when
it comes to just be like real kind of
real colors and stuff and it's really
nice the camera is fantastic it's the
one I mean I like the camera I think
it's really good uh-huh i'm like i'm
like ninety-eight percent there with you
on the camera
like you know speaking of DCI standard
the thing is the thing is I don't know
they like I've had a lot of times in the
past with these reviews that I really
thought that post processing makes or
breaks this whole experience and oh is
that Zack brushy heading out yeah she's
got to go he's a yeah my son's waking up
geez yes he is with child ways at the
path the phrase I'm sorry yes I have a
child and he's waking up so I'm gonna
have to we're pretty much almost done
anyway yeah no problem brother alright
thanks for being on Russia give your son
a fist bump press I heard how well it
actually likes doing that too so I gotta
alright cool Banerjee later bye um speak
speaking of the camera on on here it's
just there's still some post processing
being done and I'm kind of that's it
kind of it kind of astounds me that we
haven't figured this out yet that you
know you could just leave the data on
the photo and you don't have to put like
noise reduction or anything like that on
there because it's been a standard
that's been available for so long on
DSLR cameras that you know these cameras
just have their own ways of interpreting
the color but for the most part when you
get your JPEG it's pretty much what you
got even if you did a raw photo like you
get the data it's just sort of like put
together in a nice way with the with
their own post processing without too
much noise reduction because you can
actually go into the settings and turn
off noise reduction I wish that we could
do that with these phones and LG
unfortunately still has a little bit
going on other than that though I do
think the camera is great because of
those manual controls I have too much
fun with those and I've already yeah
I've already shot a lot of raw photos
and I put them in Lightroom and I had a
lot of fun with those also so it's
possible to get some real high quality
photos from here you just have to make
sure you have an SD card in there which
is great too like this is the only phone
that has removable battery and SD card
slot how does a lot of the flashing eyes
removable battery for me as well is
pretty good trick is I mean yes 6
battery just get it sucked ass
but let me ask you a question do I would
you like for me personally the camera is
probably the best part as nice as that
display is i think i prefer the slight
oversaturation at the f6 display or the
s6 edge display don't know why it's kind
of it's very much a kind of an even
balance between the display but the
camera is quite up there the question is
would you buy it just for the camera or
would you buy something like an s6 edge
or something else that has the camera
but a little bit more as well because
the G falls got the display got the
camera but it does experience to
software for me just isn't as refined
and I can't believe I'm saying this it
isn't as slick as touch with that which
is six which is now kind of like the
most is probably setting a benchmark for
user interfaces and again I can't
believe I ever said that this is
somewhere a stock android fan is having
a stroke right hahaha oh Jesus better
they play with the Essex press polished
what um I again I'm close to that point
this is the thing that on the one hand
it's a tough question to ask it's a
tough question answer I should say
because oh and to the point TouchWiz now
is really good I'd like that's the thing
like when you compared to this version
of TouchWiz from the s6 and s6 edge i
agree with you like like this this
operating system still feels a little
bloody stuff like that I measure I just
thought of this right now but it's kind
of true it's it's been in the back of my
mind I measure operating systems in
terms of their bloatware in terms of
their snappiness and smoothness based
upon how many areas in the operating
system could be the place where
translations get lost you know like
where you get lost in translation and
there are so many areas in the in the in
the LG UX like for example that's smart
bulletins and a number of settings
inside of the actual settings menus that
if this were a sloppily ported Korean
phone that's where you could get like
and there are a couple there are a
couple parts here that have that like if
you go in the settings menu and it says
and see what it says real quick if
you're in tab view you swipe over to
sound and notifications and it has to
scroll through that that little area
like those areas are
are there a lot less in this version of
TouchWiz this new one which I give it so
much credit for because it feels
actually kind of Spartan it feels like
they dialed it back and it actually
worked on the lg unfortunately it
doesn't have that type of feeling so I
give I give TouchWiz a samsung i should
say i give Samsung a little bit of the
edge in terms of that but as much as I
way the camera in my reviews I would be
happy with either phone honestly and you
know for me the thing is I think I mean
I think I guess you're using the Korean
version on ear it's not easing the same
to be fair mind whenever I turn the
screen on it still thinks it's still
giving me the time update on what the
time it is in Korea even though I've
turned every setting off in the world
and it still tells me oh look it's half
past three in the morning in Korea
because you know my family live in
career and all sorts and ID I'm friends
with everyone in Korea or something I
really that important to me Bell sarcasm
case anyway the phone is home so yeah
basically I don't I personally think
obviously Connor gotta take into context
the fact that this isn't clearly a
release candidate I mean my phone
somewhere even says not for sale on it
somewhere on this phone well no it's on
the box at least it's a big sticker
saying not for sale right over the
default but for what given that I used
to g3 that was kind of that was
pre-release if you were or not kind of
retail this is easy impressive and his
comer look quite a long way since the g3
the problem is that as much as I like it
and I really do and if i had the leather
version i could probably tell you I'd be
feeling completely different to the
point where the leather would have just
sealed me because the leather is that
beautiful but this just doesn't the
least of the kind of the titanium
finished it doesn't feel as premium as
it should do that there is a problem I
heard that a couple times yeah and I
remember marco from phoneDog and and
dama sposito they have the same exact
feeling that the brushed plastic of the
g3 felt so much better
I I wanted to ask feisty and Joe feisty
we haven't heard from you in a bit i'm
so sorry for that the have you seen the
the g4 review or have you been following
like the the releases of the g4 over the
last couple days yes I have you not
extensively but but enough to to know
the basics um how do you feel about it
it's tough up I like LG as a company and
I like what I've done with phones in the
past specifically but this ad the G who
the G line if you will the g2 g3
specifically for me it didn't fit in my
hand very well so nothing I've yet to
pick up the g4 and I won't make any true
judgments until I do so but I'm
expecting that it's just gonna have that
same kind of slip and slide feeling to
it and it's certainly leather would help
that out but you know their plastics to
me just I keep dropping LG phones and I
pretty much don't drop any other phones
just I don't know why it doesn't quite
fit in my hand and it's slippery just
just doesn't work and I think for me is
that I think the size of these phones I
mean this is a g4 is 5.5 inch correct me
if I'm wrong I've got a lot of tablets
I've got seven eight nine ten 10.6 you
know I've got all the sizes of tablets
specifically 27 inch tablets will but I
mean but 5.5 inch phone to me it's just
it's too big I don't want anything more
than just a five incher just because
I've got the tablets already I mean
that's another discussion obviously but
but you know what I agree with you and I
think that's the reason why I wouldn't
run out and buy a g4 right away because
I used this for the past week this g4
and then just last night I picked up my
s6 edge and I was like oh man where has
this been on my whole life like I
because it just feels perfect you know
and I I do think that the g2 probably
was that sweet spot and it just had the
the unique button layout and made it
look distinctive but it was just the
right size and LG is like no big screens
big screens all day
and there are title screens yeah but
yeah exactly there are times when it's
beautiful and it's so much fun to use
and playing games on it watching YouTube
Netflix Hulu all that stuff and then
when I pick it up in the car while I'm
driving trying to like like respond to
something or look at what notification I
have I just feel like I'm gonna die
because it's like the hand gymnastics
are just like like they're not too bad
but it's not something you want to do in
certain situations just on that though I
think that they made the handset not
miss probably I mean 5.5 inches is huge
let's be honest it like first standard
it it's kind of phablet versus phone
kind of thing in in man in a man versus
food style kind of thing but as much as
I agree kind of get what you were saying
feisty I actually think that size-wise
this the g4 is an example of a 5.5 inch
that is usable in one hand because you
get the like you get other 5.5 inches
friends are just way like deaf people
have gone up we're gonna go big screen
but you know what we're gonna throw
loads of bezels on there and goes like
the bigger devices we can okay so this
is probably the only one that I could
comfortably use in one hand despite the
fact is 5.5 inches so I think LG
deserves some credit for being able to
kind of make the handset user friendly
and kind of one hand friendly ish
despite the fact is 5.5 inches because
not many people can do that and no one
really has apart from this good that's
exciting to hear I can't wait to put one
in hand down yeah I good I think I kind
of agree there yeah it's that curve that
curve is nice and subtle you know it's
like it's very uh very motorola asked
for them to put this type of curve on
here for ergonomics rather than just for
like the sake of having a curve you know
um alright Joe how do you feel our
resident HTC One m9 lover how do you how
do you feel about the g four you know it
was oh the thing that uh maybe the most
curious is how like in it was obviously
a big launch in it you know it got a
bunch of coverage from you know people
like us but I haven't seen like you know
in on social media stuff I haven't seen
the same kind of buzz about it that I've
seen with the HTC One m9 in the the
galaxy s
six and it actually makes me curious
because like the phone seems like a home
run you know removable back external
storage huge battery big screen you know
distinctive style um I do I a small
little bit of a criticism on your review
there Josh I under your prose you put
like feels less bloated and then under
cons you put still feels bloated oh and
I try to remember what language I was
trying to use their like like I think I
put the word almost in there though
almost is less bloated because the
reason why is because it feels so smooth
and and this is something that LG Linux
hasn't I felt like I understood what you
meant you know he's like yeah there's
still a bunch of bloatware there but it
feels less bloated than it did last year
it's just something we have brought up
in the slack chat the other day and we
were left having a laugh at you but I
also wanted to clear something up on my
review but I'll do that after you're
done Joe but it seems like a really
solid phone to me I can't imagine a
unless you you know you're like feisty
and you have you know little tiny hands
I can't imagine a reason why this isn't
you know I among the best maybe top to
top three phones that are it's going to
be released this year and the thing is a
you know the g3 was the same way last
year and the g2 is the same way to year
before that you know exactly what point
do we start like taking LG's launch
events with the same kind of you know
excitement that everybody has for the
one m9 and you know the galaxy s6 events
and it's annalise just it's i mean
obviously not as we covered the hell out
of it but you know i just like from like
an audience perspective like i just
don't see people being excited about it
and I don't know why because it's so
yeah a really good thing I think it's
cuz LG announced pretty much at least
fifty percent of the phone before it so
others like Samsung HTC tease stuff and
they do really nice teasers let's be
honest I mean touching on your social
media thing HTC probably has the best
social media out of the big
manufacturers because Samsung doesn't do
a lot of it doesn't really do much LG
does nothing but HTC is quite active
with the whole one was it one life m9
life One m9 life
southern I guess I never get with the
hashtags but I know what you're talking
about and if I mean they've got the
elevate as well and they then they
really kind of promote they've got
people and fanboys to promote help
promote it with LG I mean with Samsung
everyone takes it Vickers mmm s5 aside
you can be sure that the next Samsung
device is pretty gonna have something
called on it the s5 was just a whole lot
of crap but and I used it for six months
and I'm telling you that so I speak
purely I like my experience the g4 I
don't think they really did enough they
announced chunks of it before and that
was it and now they what they should
have done is teased it and don't like
subtle teasers I mean even before the s6
edge samsung had before mwc samsung had
everyone talking about that teaser that
teaser we all know which teaser on
talking about the one with that was
black with just the faint outline of the
bezel of the sex appeal and it the sex
appeal there you go right there and you
can but so you're saying that the LG g4
is an unattractive phone is it the fat
phone that the skinny phones take
pictures next to to make themselves look
even skinnier is that what is it so it's
really not really nice phone you know
but the i think i think what we're
trying to get at here and i think it's a
combination of yes this phone came out
after the other big too but also like LG
just doesn't have the marketing budget
you know and they're probably the the
most laid back when it comes to social
media and marketing and whatnot HTC
tries really hard i mean they have the
freakin celebrities trying to market the
hell out of it and then social media and
then samsung like just one quick note
that commercial i keep seeing on on TV
where there's that guy doing that
perspective unboxing of the s6 or the s6
edge why is his name Josh like I wonder
if Samsung did it on purpose just to be
honest but anyway I think you should
send a matter of going a 100 right
become using me I know two white guys
when I want really good way better if
his name was Josh v okay I'm Josh V
right and then he starts porn and then
he starts parkouring and in like what is
going on here and then I just it's just
funny and but anyway it does come down
to marketing
I don't think I don't think LG has that
kind of power when it comes to marketing
and this is a phone that if you look at
it then you will realize it's a great
phone it's probably the best alternative
for a unique / feature-filled device out
there that's why it is on par with the
s6 and the s6 edge especially since
those two phones don't have those two
main features the removable battery and
the expandable storage but the thing is
you have to make your own effort to find
it and LG is not going to shove it in
your face that's their mistake I mean
what they really should have done is
hired a social media expert to plug the
crap out of it on social media and I
mean they've got the g full preview
hashtag going on they're gonna give it
to 4000 people around the world before
it goes on sale and that's a unique
effort and I mean I got talking to the
head of marketing at LG UK I know the
guy quite well when I was there at the
launch and he was just what we can't do
and I am just kind of ad-libbing off top
my head of hohenberg word for word what
he said but the gist of it was they
can't use the same marketing methods as
others because they don't have the money
to put behind 0 which a I mean they I
reckon they should have a bigger
marketing budget than someone like HTC
does Drogba care there are bigger
company they really should if they don't
then they've really got asked why but
what I would hope to see from them is
real kind of not not just our let's
throw stuff out stick it throw stuff at
a wall and see what sticks but a real
deep understanding something like social
media and how it best supplies to them
how they can turn the g4 into like enter
into the most sought-after phone on
social media if it's just going on
Instagram and instagramming the crap out
of loads of places around the world with
a g4 using the LG g4 hashtag that is all
you need to do to get loads of people on
Instagram loving the camera is take
pictures of amazing things it's not that
difficult I mean I've never been to
Korea but I'm sure there's some
interesting stuff in Korea and they've
got people all around the world but the
office is all around the world all
you've got to do is have say 10 offices
or 20 offices each posting one picture
from their relevancy capsule on the g4
once a day one
every two days and what you're going to
see is G for pictures coming up and all
of a sudden wow it's kind of like oh I
didn't realize the camera was that good
and that instantly is one of the selling
points because the camera is one of the
selling points of the g4 but instead
it's just like oh well here's a great
phone but you know what if you don't
want it don't worry about them enough
left over look at that if George it's
like if you don't want to buy please
don't worry about it it's just not a
problem whereas honestly if I was them
I'd be like we didn't know you come to
see my phone I don't you bet you buying
this damn thing yeah another guy that
look at it be a man do we know about via
markets at home versus abroad I mean
we're talking about North America UK and
stuff but do you think they're marketing
a Korea and closer in there you know the
Asian markets do you think maybe they're
doing a little bit stronger oh I
certainly do but but there's another
fact that if you're going to talk about
home marketing is that they have a much
larger line of phones in Korea and much
more unique phones in Korea than they do
here in the West and in the West we
pretty much know about this one the g
flex and that's about it and then we see
all these like articles and these these
pictures of like these unique colorful
super cartoony super asian phones out in
Korea so of course they have a huge
foothold out there but over here they
just kind of don't put that much like
their everyone's trying to go for this
like westernized like look at this sleek
phone executive leather all this stuff
you know the g3 uh commercials that I
saw for so for so long after the g3
launched you know those kinds of
advertisements are fine they were just
everywhere and maybe they could do that
with this phone and maybe some people
won't take notice with that but I don't
know like it's not going to be the fun
that everyone talks about and that is a
shame so that's that I agree with you
there in a half ah I think I think one
just kind of kind of something off my
point about LG the biggest problem
they've got is and I think this is
applies to a lot of companies its brand
perception now something have done
really well because the galaxy range has
been like if blown up and people will
forget about the really really really
crap so
that they used to produce and I mean the
really crap ones I used to work in
retail selling them and trust me when I
said really crap they were really really
cramped HTC has a brand perception but
people love them the problem is and I
know this because having against old
people is having without the marketing
to throw the product and all the
benefits down somewhat and Ram it down
someone's throat quite literally and
physically you go to someone go oh look
here's an amazing g LG g4 oh no I wanna
no G oh here's a Santa yeah doesn't
matter it could be a samsung 20-pound
Samson that's been solved for 500 but oh
it's a samsung galaxy oh it must be
amazing because it's the brand awareness
and possess and thats LG's biggest
problem is changing that brand
perception and that's what the rights of
like HTC have had to do yeah exactly
when they were going away from the
really bad devices of the past and kind
of the one range help do that and save
the samsung because before the i think
probably before the s2 they were know
her yeah for sure um hashtag we don't
suck there you go that's melodies as
LG's new a brand slogan we don't suck we
promise and it's it's a it'll be
interesting to see what happens for the
rest of you because you know like these
are the world where were coming up on
the half way point of the year usually
marked off by Google i/o and yeah we
have we have the we have pretty much
three of the biggest releases already
out and what it was whatever's gonna
happen later in the year I mean
obviously we have the note for but
that's still Samsung I mean 05 and
that's still samsung and sony and then
we'll see what else comes out um but
yeah I wanted to make a point real quick
about the battery life section in my
review people like donna esposito was
was and i were talking about this knee
was ranting for a little bit that this
whole this whole thing about screen on
time as a way of measuring battery life
is just crazy i've been reading the
reddit posts and the youtube comments
and they're all pretty much giving me
slack for saying that three hours of
battery our zuv screen on time is bad
for battery life how much battery life
are you getting on there how do you feel
about the battery i I'll be honest and I
I've got to be completely Frank well
this I've had this I've got this on
Wednesday afternoon so I had this no
more than day off two days Titus so
let's let me let me look at this example
today I've used the phone a little bit
today and I'm just going to use this
because the only only thing I've
actually got to kind of kind of
reference today I've used it all right
at the last time I charge this was 27
hours ago and my screen on time is one
hour and 12 minutes before I love that
you put it that way because who out
there and done this is what Dom told me
is like this whole screen on time thing
is kind of weird because you know if if
your phone is able to make it from point
A to at night point B without dying and
without you being worried that you need
an external battery or a plug then that
should be what matters and depending on
screen on time is not the problem of the
phone it's a problem of what your
lifestyle is like are you who are you on
your are you on your phone for hours on
end during the day that you leave five
plus hours of screen on time when in
reality if you're able to go through
your normal day and get to the end of
the day with let's say still twenty
percent at the very least then that's
actually pretty good like that that'll
that'll serve your needs and for me
three hours of screen on time for about
16 to 20 hours of total time in one day
that's to me pretty good because those
three hours are the three hours that I
used the phone the rest of the time it
was able to still remain so so does my
thing let me kind of pick up on that
because I dad she had this of rugged but
he must was like a three hella
conversation with someone the other day
debating they're not on Twitter or
anything but it was debating the same
thing and my point of view on this and
this is where I say that the galaxy s6
battery is fine and people are like oh
you don't know what you're talking about
your fellow rubbish in for the crap and
all of that and I'm like well I do an
arm talking about because I think back
to how what two years ago when i was
working retail the whole point is like
we were kind of power users we sit there
and power on our phone all day and then
you get business users who do the same
apart
when there are meetings but average Joe
who we've mix up maybe ninety percent
and i don't mean joseph in degree i'm in
just general Joe no no and that's the
second week in a row so I would have
said that to me you're certainly not
every don't tell you that I don't care
for their Joe was in the Army I don't
think he was a general though nope
general Joe you know we go general don't
you and but then gonna go on what does
what does Joe average Joe blocks do on
their phone and the point is you get up
in the morning say this is my case of
this is what i would say that 75% people
do it but the timings might be wrong you
get up and say six thirty in the morning
and if you work in you've got to spend
an hour traveling to work so in the
morning you're not you might spend half
an hour on your boat checking your
updates whatever then you're on the
train maybe spending half an hour on the
train listening to music watching a film
reading a book doing whatever you get to
work and that's it and I'm sorry if
you're sitting at work and you spend
five hours and or you need three hours
screen on time between say nine and six
when you're at work your boss should
fall because let's be frank you're
clearly not doing anybody work yeah then
the cycle repeats itself so when you get
to work you maybe had an hour hour and a
half usage you then at lunch might use
it for another half an hour because if
you spend the whole hour lunch break on
your phone you clearly haven't eaten
anything you're probably going to waste
away and collapse by the end of the day
or at least if you're me because I need
my lunch and stuff then you get the end
of the day and you're like right I'm
going to come home etc or you go out the
point is joke Josh you're right three
hours three and a half hours screen on
time if you can achieve that off say 8i
calculate here 630 in the morning till
if you wake up at six thirty morning
every day chances are you're in bed and
sleeping by eleven-thirty midnight so I
count that as a teen 292 between 1820
hours after each use case and this is
what people say when they say can last a
whole day manufacturers don't think
midnight to midnight because if you're
up midnight to midnight you'll be like
me on the podcast two weeks going
absolutely Junction is it and on a side
topic can be tangent someone else be
what I said in the podcast
you can remember as I just make up and
then I got proven wrong but the whole
point is 18 to 20 hours if a phone last
you from 18 to 20 hours usage with say
three to four hours screen on time
that's it that's what the phone that's
what a smart phone is designed to do for
average consumers now if you're a power
user who spend their life and your job
is on social media and all you do is do
social media off your phone hey get on
your laptop because I guarantee will be
a lot easier and be then clearly it's
not going to last you 18 hours because
if you can get 18 hours screen on time I
want to know what phone you use it's
probably got like six day battery life
yes and you're probably using something
like a 51-46 like an old nokia or
something and using mobile web or
something but that's the whole point you
kind of get the nail on that if you can
take three to four-hour screen on time
of 18 to 20 hours usage you are this is
this is what a smartphone designed to do
not spend 10 hours screen on time
because what's the point you're kind of
picking at straws to find a fault and if
you're doing that then you're very sad
yeah on the on the Samsung review I said
that a guy close to three hours screen
on time but that was almost like a
12-hour day like if i woke up at eleven
and slept at eleven then that was what
my usage would so that's when I said it
was pretty average that's pretty average
battery life this this g4 on the other
hand gets three hours but I had like 16
hours worth of worth of a day and I
thought that was pretty great not good
back for you or for me yeah so pretty
suit me perfectly in Miami I did feisty
and Joe do you guys I was set Hindi I
hide feisty and Joe do you guys do you
guys agree like like how do you measure
your battery your life in that case um
you can call me handy yeah it's okay I
don't mind um I don't know why you're
like oh those called you can be like
well cuz i hear they like it it's my
frickin name oh you're like the only one
who I don't really you're almost the
only one who I don't like named VLS you
know like like name via your last name
or anything cuz we got feisty grouchy
and your name already ends with y so now
I'm realizing how come I don't do that
hey yeah hindi Hindi II over there here
we go you Fergie dude they always Dorsey
you used to call me that actually
vertical mirror gburg it's like a
mixture between like Fergie and the
verge so I don't know how I'd feel about
that
haha but yeah so okay yeah go ahead uh
and then I know we're going a little
long with the show but I wanted to make
sure we got this point I am so sorry um
battery life like I think that there's a
huge disconnect between what people
remember about cell phone battery life
and what battery life is today because
like back in the day you're like oh yeah
my cell phone you know lasted for a week
between charges like what did you do on
it for that whole week you made a few
phone calls you said a few text messages
but what did you do you didn't do
anything so I challenge anybody to do
that if they don't think that their
phone battery is any good turn off
mobile data entirely turn off all
sinking to all services period and do
absolutely nothing but make phone calls
and send text messages on your phone and
tell me how long the battery lasts
because I I've been doing that you know
for a while now with my nexus 5 because
I don't you know do anything on it
really so if I turn off mobile data and
turn off all the sinking the nexus 5 can
sit there and do nothing for six or
seven days before it runs out of battery
the people need to realize like cell
phone usage or smartphone usage is not
like cell phone usage it is more like
computer usage where you're always
online readers you know doing stuff
playing games all of that stuff you know
not only takes a battery life when it's
dragging data down from you know the
towers but it's also using cpu
especially with gaming so people are
like well I want six hours of screen on
time so i can play clash of clans for
six straight hours what like you know
that's that that's not possible with
today's technology you're never gonna
get something like that because that's
not how you know that's not how cell
phones are supposed to be used but
that's how we try to use them and then
we turn around and say well the battery
life really sucks because I'm using it
wrong it'd be like if somebody like took
their car and started driving in the
grass and you didn't complain that the
shocks sucked because it was a bouncy
ride like you know like and then like in
the said that you can sit in the past
 you're looking at I'm like you're
doing it wrong and that's the way that
it really is like people are doing you
guys pretty much if hit the nail on the
head they are do the perception of cell
phone battery life today is wrong and
it's one hundred percent wrong because
you know if you used it to just make the
phone calls and just in the 10
messages then your phone is going to
last exactly as long as your old nokia
did just on top of those two things you
also surf three different social media
sites and play candy crush or clash of
clans or some other game that takes up a
bunch of stuff then you have the weather
data syncing on top of that and if you
didn't disable location services then
pretty much every app I just mentioned
wants to know where you are every 30
minutes all day long and then on top of
all of that stuff you have the the under
apps the apps that you have but you
don't really use that often but still
turn on every now and again like um like
I have amazon mp3 on this phone i don't
know why i think it was just some
bloatware but it took up one percent of
my battery today I don't know why I
don't have never opened it I don't know
why it opened but then you know you have
you know those other apps that are on
there that are going to run and have
processes in the background like
SwiftKey runs all day long you guys know
that swiftkey never closed yeah it runs
in a processing I know that and it's
it's it's frustrating it's been in there
was one point when I was a comma more
what I was doing but I spent a lot of
the day typing and I realized by the end
of the day screen was number one swifty
was number two yeah it you're like say
what how did that take ten percent of my
battery are you yeah and once in a
separate process and that's the thing
that people don't really think about
very often is that not only are using
your screen and you know your speakers
and you know your mobile data and phone
calls and text messages but you've also
got like two or three dozen processes
that are always running in the
background they're always pinging your
location and dragging more data down and
that's you know that's really the
difference between the old Nokia and
today's smartphone is that extra stuff
that you have to do so to me you know if
I can go from waking up to going to bed
regardless of the screen on time
regardless of what I did that day if I
can wake up use my phone all you know
and then go to bed and my phone hasn't
died that's a good battery life day for
me thank you i'm i'm probably say that
as long as I'm as long as it lasts for
Austin out the house cuz i do use my
phone quadband i'm willing to admit that
if i can leave my house in the morning
and when i used to work for a living and
yeah and you know more than i do now and
then having to actually go to an office
and all of that and then I get home and
it's still got college I'm a happy man
yeah and I think you're kind of the
point is that everyone's perception of
battery life will be different for me
battery life is that for some people
battery life is getting from midnight to
midnight and they're going to complain
because no smartphone in the world will
ever do that with your monthly use their
phone p you kind of Ju so invite you
don't realize that actually you've got
shadow to stop running that you have no
idea about yeah for sure how about how
about you feisty we'll go ahead and end
on this on this on the snow here all
right you know I thought I had a unique
look at devices here you know pretty
much in my world if the device isn't in
my hand and it's not full then it's on a
charger you know with if it's bedside
table the desk you know the living room
in pretty much every room in my house
I've got enough USB cables and chargers
set up that I can charge anything
anywhere obviously that's not available
for everybody if you work on the road or
what not you you don't have power
outlets but but if you're an office
worker there is no excuse not to plug in
cables are cheap i go to monoprice
they're two bucks get a dozen of them
you know so all of my devices I pretty
much keep them fully charged all the
time I'll unplug them I use them you
know you burn a battery a little bit you
plug it back in it's almost rare for me
to go a full day without charging like
like you know your your daily driver
phone for example so you know sit in the
car it goes in the dock it's charging is
this bad for long-term battery life sure
but you're still going to get a couple
years of the device and but you know are
you still gonna have it in two years
anyway so you're gonna upgrade to the
next phone anyways so that's kind of it
for me it is it is really yes I'd like
to test the devices and see what kind of
battery life they get and you know on
screen is obviously important because
that's when you're using it we find a
charger just just have chargers around
they're cheap and it's only a laptop
dude you use it like a laptop yeah and
take it off the charger wins need to put
right the hell back on there when you're
done with that's pretty cool i never
thought of using it like that and it's
important to find those apps that are
you know rogue apps that truly are
eating
battery you don't need that it's extra
stress on your machine that isn't
necessary but for the most part I do not
subscribe to locking the Machine down to
save juice I won't you know give me full
power just let's do this yeah and yeah
so this is sort of in on that note just
a pair of ray is kind of what Dom was
saying like to anyone out there who's
asking like how do I get better battery
life on this phone like kind of liquid
Dom said he was like go outside like but
the way that I was going to say was like
if you if you need four and a half hours
screen on time for your smartphone you
should probably talk to your girlfriend
more like you should probably just
probably talking to your significant
other a little bit more don't have that
phone on during dinner don't don't don't
like like I still get really I get
really antsy when I like I when I when I
sort of step outside of myself and
realize that my girlfriend and I are at
like a restaurant and we're both on our
phones and I'm like wait a minute buddy
it doesn't happen often at all but like
that's why I'm thinking in my head is
like if you need that much screen on
time and you need that phone to really
lasts for that long you probably need to
stop using it as that much you know um
but yeah I just want to make sure you
get that point out there because I saw a
lot of comments about it and a few
people were like oh but but if you like
a year ago we two years ago we had 4.5
hours of screen on time I'm like why
show me show me that phone did that no
they didn't and the thing is is what
happens is people i get like root access
and then they turn everything off and
then their phone does spectacularly
because i know when you fresh install a
rom those services haven't opened up yet
you know like that first few days your
phone is still kind of setting itself up
underneath and it's not doing anything
and then you're like oh yeah i forgot to
sign into twitter now Twitter process is
running 24 7 oh i forgot to sign into
google plus now Google Plus running 24 7
and if you're dumb enough to enable the
UM the auto upload of photos and videos
over mobile yeah first of all if you're
that dumb like I'm sorry I don't mean
any offense by this but you should
probably look at yourself in the mirror
slap yourself across the face and say
bad person as a bad person auto I take
offense to this Joe
is the mind set up I have videos off
videos over Wi-Fi only but honestly I
think it's just go I think it's super
useful as a thing but I think our
argument here is that if you're
complaining about battery life you gotta
look at why you know and that's how it's
enough it's really important to figure
out exactly what your device is doing
that's something that most people don't
do and that's why I don't really engage
too much in battery life conversations
like i'll post mine every now and again
but i know exactly what's eating my
battery and why um I can't explain it
but I know I know that Facebook runs a
process that you know opens up my mobile
radio for 25 minutes a day and stays
awake for you know for hours at a time I
don't know why it does it but I know
that it does it and that's I know where
my battery life is going so that God
forbid if anyone drives by your house
their phone will go Joe was nearby I
think that's setting disabled on the
website like I don't even oh got it yeah
I don't know it's frustrating but that
is a topic for a different podcast I
think for sure um but yeah well we'll
see where our topic goes for next week
brushy just want to give one quick shout
