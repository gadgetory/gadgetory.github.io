handy the Android authority app guy and
I'm here to tell you that some people
screw up a whole lot more than others
so with that in mind let's take a look
at the most controversial apps and games
from the Year 2016 the first badland was
one hell of a good platformer game it
was a pay once title with tons of
gameplay features thus we were excited
when we learned that bad land 2 was
coming out that is until we learned that
it was coming from Cheeta games a branch
off of cheetah mobile the makers of the
clean master app their beta release of
the application contained rampant
advertising and in-app purchases which
made everybody understandably angry the
first full release returned to a pay
once following all of the backlash
however there was still tons of
advertising along with other corny
freemium mechanics that just make the
game less enjoyable beam was an
attempted social media application that
was created by popular youtuber KC nice
dad and never quite achieved the
popularity of his YouTube channel but it
did work pretty well in late 2016 nice
dad sold the application to CNN for 25
million dollars following this he quit
his daily vlog and is now doing some big
project for CNN many have labeled nice
dad a sellout and many more of wondering
how Bheem was worth 25 million dollars
to begin with in early 2017 bean will be
taken down and destroyed so it's not
something we'll have to think about for
very long
ES File Explorer didn't have the best
year once known as the best free file
explorer out there the application began
its decline by adding in a bunch of
snake oil features like performance
boosting cash cleaning and task
management the decline reached critical
when the application released an update
in 2016 that added a so called charge
booster into the app and then hijacked
the lockscreen with advertising the
outcry was bad enough that the
lockscreen aspect was taken down but by
then the damage had been done we're sure
many still use ES File Explorer but it's
nearly ubiquitous praise from users and
pundits alike no longer exists Evernote
had a fairly interesting year their
first big step was cutting down the
features that free users get while
beefing up the features that paid users
get this caused mild annoyance among
people but it wasn't really all that bad
however they followed it up by
announcing a new privacy policy in late
2016 that would allow some employees to
see users notes this was done as part of
a machine learning feature that the
company was working on the backlash was
immediate harsh
and angry which led the CEO to announce
a reversion to the old privacy policy
soon after everything is back to normal
from now unless you're a free user of
course but it wasn't a great year for
Evernote famous formerly known as stolen
was a mobile game where players could
buy and sell Twitter accounts there
weren't any sales of actual accounts but
it kind of turned every Twitter account
into a baseball card that could be
collected with in-game currency the idea
while harmless sparked a variety of
concerns from players and pundits alike
the app was taken down revamped and
renamed as famous before being released
again however the concept of buying and
selling people never really did mesh
well with the kinds of people who decide
those kinds of things and it was pulled
again as it stands the application has
been removed from pretty much everywhere
miitomo was released earlier this year
does anybody remember miitomo
for those who don't meet OMA was
Nintendo's first official release on
Android it's essentially a social media
app with cutesy nintendo stuff
everywhere people ask you questions you
answer them and then you get coins to
customize your little miitomo character
the game was wildly popular for like one
week and then dropped off the face of
the earth the next week
people were undecided on whether or not
it was actually a game let alone whether
or not it was any good and people did
feel a little weird about answering
questions for total strangers needless
to say it was a fairly big letdown and
it exited the spotlight almost as soon
as it got their pokemon go came out in
mid 2016 and then everybody lost their
damn minds
people were trespassing criminals were
using pokey stops to rope people in to
rob them whole countries were banning
the app and plenty of other ridiculous
things were happening to top things off
the game itself had rampant server and
feature issues for months had popular
features ripped out of the game and a
rise and fall of popularity so intense
that no other game in history could
compare people loved it people hated it
and everybody was talking about it the
viral nature of the phenomenon made
flappy bird look pathetic by comparison
things have calmed down now but pokemon
gold be one of those things that even
non tech nerds will remember about 2016
Twitter and vine booth had really
interesting years in a bad way Twitter
was at the heart of several
controversies regarding various bands
and punishments against various online
personalities along with conspiracy
theories about Twitter's penchant to
pick sides in things like politics then
we have vine there was an announcement
that vine was going to go down in flames
only to be
pulled back again at the last second
there were rumors pretty much all year
that Twitter and vine were looking for
buyers but they were allegedly too toxic
for serious investors it's been a down
year for Twitter and Twitter definitely
knows it's a hand finally we have uber
they have made this list three years
running and in fact it would feel almost
wrong to not have them here okay so
here's what obrah did this year in
Taiwan they label themselves as a tech
platform whereas the Taiwanese
government labeled them as a
transportation service if uber is right
the Taiwanese government is asking them
to pay taxes that they don't owe if
Taiwan is right that uber is essentially
dodging taxes in California their
self-driving car ran a red light and now
California doesn't want a bird doing
self-driving car stuff there anymore
uber fought it but ultimately took their
project to Arizona instead as per the
norm it was a crazy year for uber oh
sorry I misread that every year is a
crazy year for uber and that about does
it for this one folks if you want to
keep watching we have more best apps and
games lists linked up there on the
screen and in the video description
