Hindy the android authority app guy and
I'm here to tell you that some people
screw up a whole lot more than others so
with that in mind let's take a look at
the most controversial apps and games
from the year 2016 the first badland was
one hell of a good platformer game it
was a pay once title with tons of
gameplay features thus we were excited
when we learned that bad land too was
coming out that is until we learned that
it was coming from cheetah games a
branch off of cheetah mobile the makers
of the clean master app their beta
release of the application contained
rampant advertising and in-app purchases
which made everybody understandably
angry the first full release returned to
a pay once following all of the backlash
however there was still tons of
advertising along with other corny
freemium mechanics that just make the
game less enjoyable beam was an
attempted social media application that
was created by popular youtuber Casey
nice dad it never quite achieved the
popularity of his YouTube channel but it
did work pretty well in late 2016 nice
dad sold the application to CNN for 25
million dollars following this he quit
his daily vlog it is now doing some big
project for CNN many have labelled nice
tat a sellout and many more are
wondering how bean was worth 25 million
dollars to begin with in early 2017 beam
will be taken down and destroyed so it's
not something we'll have to think about
for very long ES File Explorer didn't
have the best year once known as the
best Free File Explorer out there the
application began its declined by adding
in a bunch of snake-oil features like
performance boosting cache cleaning and
task management the decline reached
critical when the application released
an update in 2016 that added a so-called
charge booster into the app and then
hijacked the lock screen with
advertising the outcry was bad enough
that the lock screen aspect was taken
down but by then the damage had been
done we're sure many still use ES file
explorer but it's nearly ubiquitous
praise from users and pundits alike no
longer exists Evernote had a fairly
interesting year their first big step
was cutting down the features that free
users get well beefing up the features
that paid users get this caused mild
annoyance among people but it wasn't
really all that bad however they
followed it up by announcing a new
privacy policy in late 2016 that would
allow some employees to see users notes
this was done as part of a machine
learning feature that the company was
working on the backlash was immediate
harsh
and angry which led the CEO to announce
a reversion to the old privacy policy
soon after everything is back to normal
from now unless you're a free user of
course but it wasn't a great year for
Evernote famous formerly known as stolen
was a mobile game where players could
buy and sell Twitter accounts there
weren't any sales of actual accounts but
it kind of turned every Twitter account
into a baseball card that could be
collected with in-game currency the idea
while harmless sparked a variety of
concerns from players and pundits like
the app was taken down revamped and
renamed as famous before being released
again however the concept of buying and
selling people never really did mesh
well with the kinds of people who decide
those kinds of things and it was pulled
again as it stands the application has
been removed from pretty much everywhere
me toma was released earlier this year
does anybody remember me tomo for those
who don't me toma was Nintendo's first
official release on android it's
essentially a social media app with QT
nintendo stuff everywhere people ask you
questions you answer them and then you
get coins to customize your little me
tomo character the game was wildly
popular for like one week and then
dropped off the face of the earth the
next week people were undecided on
whether or not was actually a game let
alone whether or not it was any good and
people did feel a little weird about
answering questions for total strangers
needless to say it was a fairly big
letdown and it exited the spotlight
almost as soon as it got there pokemon
go came out in mid-2016 and then
everybody lost their damn minds people
were trespassing criminals were using
pogi stops to wrote people in to rob
them whole countries were banning the
app and plenty of other ridiculous
things were happening to top things off
the game itself had rampant server and
feature issues for months had popular
features ripped out of the game and a
rise and fall of popularity so intense
that no other game in history could
compare people loved it people hated it
and everybody was talking about it the
viral nature of the phenomenon made
flappy bird look pathetic by comparison
things have calmed down now but Pokemon
go will be one of those things that even
non tech nerds will remember about 2016
Twitter and vine booth had really
interesting years in a bad way Twitter
was at the heart of several
controversies regarding various bands
and punishments against various online
personalities along with conspiracy
theories about Twitter's penchant to
pick sides in things like politics then
we have vine there was an announcement
that vine was going to go down in flames
only to be pulled
back again at the last second there were
rumours pretty much all year that
Twitter and vine were looking for buyers
but they were allegedly too toxic for
serious investors it's been a down year
for Twitter and Twitter definitely knows
it and finally we have uber they have
made this list three years running and
in fact it would feel almost wrong to
not have them here okay so here's what
bird did this year in Taiwan they label
themselves as a tech platform whereas
the Taiwanese government labeled them as
a transportation service if ober is
right the Taiwanese government is asking
them to pay taxes that they don't oh if
Taiwan is right then uber is essentially
dodging taxes in California there
self-driving car ran a red light and now
California doesn't want a bird doing
self-driving car stuff there anymore
Bluebird fought it but ultimately took
their project to Arizona instead as per
the norm it was a crazy year for uber oh
sorry I misread that every year is a
crazy year for uber and that about does
it for this one folks if you want to
keep watching we have more best apps and
games lists linked up there on the
