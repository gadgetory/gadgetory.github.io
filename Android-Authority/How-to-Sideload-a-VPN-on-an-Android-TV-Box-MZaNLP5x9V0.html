like China and the Middle East sometimes
have trouble downloading all the apps
they want on their Android TV box due to
region blocks a VPN or virtual private
network can help to fix this allowing
you to connect to the internet like
you're in another country but what if
region controls won't let you download a
VPN from the Play Store in the first
place in this video we'll teach you how
to slide load a VPN app onto your
Android TV box to follow along with this
video you'll need an Android TV box with
an empty USB slot as well as a USB Drive
with some extra memory we'll be
demonstrating the process with
expressvpn so note that if you try the
process with another VPN it might look a
little different begin by signing into
your expressvpn account on a computer if
you're in an area where the expressvpn
website won't displayed right away try
typing it into your favorite search
engine and working URL should appear log
in to your expressvpn account and click
on the button that says set up on more
devices then select the Android platform
followed by download apk stick your USB
Drive into the computer and load the apk
file onto it then safely remove your USB
file now switch gears by turning on your
Android TV box go to the google play
store and search for ES File Explorer
the software is free allowing you to
browse files on USB Drive so that you
plug into your device once you find ES
File Explorer install it before you plug
in your USB Drive and play around with
it you'll first need to change one
setting on your android TV box though go
to the device settings followed by
security restrictions then go to unknown
sources and toggle it to on allowing you
to access apk files that you load on
your device you'll be asked to verify
your choice to change this preference go
ahead and choose ok but use caution when
downloading files in the future now it's
time to access your USB Drive make sure
it's plugged into your Android TV box
and open s File Explorer select your USB
Drive on the left and then navigate to
expressvpn
APK on the right when you click on it a
select Install once it's installed
choose open that's the side loading
process in a nutshell and you can use it
to load other types of apk files
under TV box two however now that you
have expressvpn loaded you can also
change your IP address allowing access
to the Internet like you in another
country to do that you'll need to log
into your expressvpn account note that
you can also complete a free trial on
your android TV box but you won't get
the benefits of a four subscription
whichever you choose once you go to the
next screen you'll be asked to configure
your VPN press ok
followed by ok finally expressvpn will
ask you if you want to share an honest
diagnostic information and that's
totally up to you once you've fully
configured the expressvpn app connecting
couldn't be easier
simply select the big bond button in the
center of the screen if you want to
change the VPN server location to
another country which is kind of the
whole point of what we're just talking
about click the choose location button
and select the server in the relevant
country then just connect again you're
free to exit the app and use your
Android TV box as you normally would
only now your traffic is routed through
a VPN and that's it folks not only have
you learned how to sideload an APK in
this video that you've also learned how
to change your IP address give yourself
a pat on the back and if you like
