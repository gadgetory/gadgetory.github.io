Authority and today we're taking a look
at the Android Pi beta for the one plus
six now Android Pi has been available
for the one plus six for a little while
now but it's been in Developer Preview
form and this is the very first beta and
if you're coming from the previous
Android Pi builds there's not gonna be a
ton of changes but if you're coming from
the more stable builds the Android Ori
oh you're gonna notice a lot of changes
so let's go over what those are so the
first major change that you're gonna
notice is what the navigation gestures
so they've updated the navigation
gestures to include the Android PI
navigation and you also have the option
of using the I guess you can call them
old-school navigation buttons with back
home and recent apps and then of course
the Android Pi version or Google's
implementation is with the pill shape
button which you can tap on to go home
you can also swipe up to go to your
recent apps or you can just slide across
left and right on the pill shape button
itself to scroll through them and then
of course you have the back button for
going back and then there's one plus as
implementation which is very similar to
the iPhone 10 where if you swipe up
it'll take you home swipe up and hold
and it'll take you to your recent apps
and then if you swipe up on either the
left or right side it'll just take you
back another major change is the gaming
mode it's been updated to version 3.0
and you could find this under utilities
and then gaming mode and you now have
notifications for third-party calls it
can also show your notifications with
just text only do not disturb mode is
also updated as well you can now set a
schedule so you can pick anywhere
between 15 minutes all the way up to 12
hours and you can also pick when you
want do not disturb to turn on which is
something that you couldn't do with
previous builds those are pretty much
all the major changes with this Android
Pi beta and if you're coming from the
dev previews you won't notice a whole
ton of changes but if you're coming from
Oreo you're obviously gonna see a lot of
aesthetic differences the notification
shade obviously looks different they've
also updated shelf you'll notice that
the cards are
ever so slightly transparent you might
not be able to see it that well on
camera but take my word for it they are
slightly transparent and then the breaks
in between the cards have also been
color matched to the cards themselves so
if you're on a light theme the breaks
will be light and if you're on the dark
theme obviously the breaks will be dark
and you'll also notice that the labels
on the cards have now have an icon next
to them so it kind of just makes shelf
look a little bit nicer and a little bit
more refined
they've also re-implemented the beam
engine so you now can customize the UI
with different colors which is under
display so again you can pick from a
light or dark theme or colorful if you
want and you can also pick different
accent colors so if you have like red
purple blue green or whatever color that
is you want just select it hit OK and
you'll see that it starts to change the
color here now everything is green
including the toggles in the shade
itself but that is pretty much all the
big major changes with the Android Pi
beta if you want to install it it's
actually really simple we'll leave a
link to it down below in the description
but the way that you do it is you
download the file you go to settings go
to system then go to system updates and
then you'll hit the COG wheel here and
select local upgrade and then you just
select the file and it'll automatically
flash it and then you reboot your phone
and you will be on Android Pi so it's a
very simple installation process oneplus
does mention that it's not perfectly
stable of course it's a beta there are
some known issues one of them is Google
pay doesn't work and another issue is
the Google Play Store will not recognize
this as a certified device so those are
the couple of known issues there might
be some other minor bugs here and there
but I personally haven't really noticed
anything major just yet but that's
really it that is the Android Pi beta
for the oneplus 6 again if you want to
flash it check the link in the
description below and if you enjoy this
video and found it helpful give it a
thumbs up of course and thanks for
