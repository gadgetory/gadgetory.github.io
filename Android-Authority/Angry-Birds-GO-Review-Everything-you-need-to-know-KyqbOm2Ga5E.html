handy the Android authority app guy
Angry Birds go was arguably the most
creative and unique member of the Angry
Birds franchise but isn't any good in
this video we're gonna find out despite
the near constant action Angry Birds go
is a very simple game it's a racing game
where you drive or fly around a track
obviously the point is to get first
place like most racing games these days
the longer you race the more vehicles
you unlock and the more upgrades you can
apply to those vehicles each level is a
single track that you race a variety of
events on included is the fruit Smasher
one-on-one versus with an AI opponent
the standard race a Time Trial style
race and a boss race that you must win
three times you then unlock a new bird
to race with and move on to the next
track to repeat the process over again
and that's really it folks surrounding
the main premise of the vehicle upgrades
and tracks are a myriad of other things
there are n app purchases that get you
anything from new cars to double coins
after every race there are sponsored
power-ups and in-game services like the
State Farm mechanic and the Facebook
integration so you can see how your
scores compare against your friends the
game mechanics are very simple there are
two types of controls one is tilt to
steer and the other is on-screen
controls there is a powerup button that
lets you use that racers ability each
racers ability is different the first
time is free and each subsequent time
costs you one blue gem which you get
when you defeat bosses at the end of
tracks in terms of racing you can't just
fly through the game like with prior
Angry Birds titles each bird can only
erase a certain number of races before
it has to stop and rest for a little bit
the more you unlock the longer you can
go but you will still have to wait for
that to fill up every now and then so
here's what we liked the controls and
gameplay are easy enough for even a
child to grasp no complicated drift
controls or draft physics you just race
and it's fun the game is playable and
beatable without any in-app purchases
you can get through this whole game
without spending a single dollar it's
visually appealing there are a lot of
bright colors types of vehicles and the
tracks are scenic and now for the bad
some of the in-app purchases are just
ridiculous they want 50 bucks to unlock
a couple of cars which are only
marginally better than the stuff you end
up on locking on your own they bug you
frequently to spend money you'll see the
button to buy a permanent upgrade for
double coins after every race whether
you like it or not the system where you
have to wait for racers to rest
is kind of lame one of the best features
and Angry Birds is the ability to play
whenever you want for as long as you
want
now Rovio makes you wait after a while
unfortunately the in-app purchases are
going to ruin this game for some people
however many more will be able to
overlook this minor inconvenience and
enjoy this game for what it really is
which is a colorful simple and fun
racing game that finally brings a new
experience into the Angry Birds
franchise it's one that it desperately
needed also it's free so there's no
reason not to at least check it out

social media links below if you're up

awesome suggestions right over there
