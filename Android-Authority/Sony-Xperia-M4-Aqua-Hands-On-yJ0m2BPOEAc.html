Andrew of authority and we are hanging
out at the Sony booth here at Mobile
World Congress 2015 taking a look at the
Sony Xperia m4 aqua and this is
basically Sony's latest mid-range
flagship device and they're sort of
marketing it as a high-end mid-range
device but essentially what you're
looking at is a design that's very
familiar to previous Sony devices like
the z3
z2 or the z1 but instead of being made
of metal and glass it's actually made of
plastic but it still feels really nice
in the hand and the compact size makes
it very easy to operate in one hand now
as far as the specs go you're looking at
a 5-inch display
coming in at 720p resolution and inside
it's being powered by a Snapdragon 615
two gigabytes of RAM and there's a 2400
milliamp hour battery which should be
enough to get you through a full day
especially with that 720p display on the
back is a 13 megapixel sensor coming in
an F 2.0 aperture and an ISO performance
that goes all the way up to 3200 so at
least on paper you should be able to get
some really great low-light performance
on the front is a 5 megapixel camera and
say wide-angle lens at 88 degrees so you
should be able to take some really great
selfies and fit a lot of your friends
into a single shot a software it's
running Android 5.0 lollipop out of the
box
what Sony's Xperia UI so you're going to
get all the great features of lollipop
and all of the great features of the
Xperia U I built into the operating
system
it's also dust and water resistant like
many other Sony phones with a rating of
IP 65 and IP 68 and available colors
include black white and coral
availability starts in spring of 2015
with a price of 299 euros and it will be
available in 80 countries with 800
carrier partners but this has been a
quick look of the Sony Xperia m4 aqua
we're still here at Mobile World
Congress 2015 so stay tuned for the rest
of our coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
