ZTE device but when they put out an
exclusive release for t-mobile it did
catch our attention and now here we are
because it's Josh of Agartha mandrill
authority what's going on everybody and
this is my full review of the ZTE zmax
ZTE went by way of the large form factor
in this t-mobile exclusive device a 5.7
inch screen sounds like it would be much
like a galaxy note but in reality a lot
of real estate around the screen just
adds to the girth capacitive Keys line
the bottom in addition that I thought
wasn't really needed considering the
very stock like nature of the Android
build underneath glossy plastic lines
the top and bottom of the phone held
together with a hard plastic frame
though the look of this phone is
actually quite sleek a few choices in
material hinder the handling experience
trouble handling a large phone is one
thing but the hard plastic material
isn't the most ideal for preventing
slippage and to exacerbate this further
the buttons are actually slightly curved
into the sides making them quite awkward
to reach and push when using your thumbs
index finger input is a little bit
better but still this setup is far from
ideal it's almost as if ZTE was trying
to merge different design languages
together particularly with the glossy
plastic on the top and bottom that
seemed a bit disjointed from the overall
package and handling is still not an
easy task for a number of the already
mentioned reasons and that is something
the zmax is good looks simply cannot
distract from despite having a larger
display the resolution of the c-max
unfortunately doesn't do it justice
720p resolution brings 8 258 pixel per
inch density to this TFT panel this is
the first having a while that I could
actually notice the difference in
sharpness on the phone it wasn't so much
when the text was stationary as text
still looked pretty crisp but when I
started to move that text around that
was when I was fully aware of the
separation in the pixels when viewing
media and playing some games this wasn't
as bad a problem due to their native
resolutions but that's a small
consolation because colors weren't
particularly vivid and that flatness did
translate to media a lot can be said
about how displays are a dime a dozen
but it's in the ZTE zmax that I found
one that simply did the job without
flying colors quite literally
performance is decidedly mid-range as
well as the zmax sports the Snapdragon
400 clocked in at 1.2 gigahertz with the
Adreno 305 and two gigabytes of RAM it's
no surprise that this isn't the fastest
or the smoothest processor available now
but it should get the job done for
pretty much any moderate general user
well that may be the case it was hard
for me to not notice the difference
after I've been inundated with
processors over the 800 mark recently
nonetheless I didn't find the
milliseconds more it took this phone to
load applications unbearable by any
means and despite some jarring
transitions from time to time the
aesthetic and experience was still
pleasing enough Moore has to do with how
ZTE built the UI for this particular
device but the bottom line is the
snapdragon 400 is certainly as mid-range
as you can get and it performs perfectly
well under that umbrella hardware
features on the zmax are a largely
standard affair though its inclusion of
a micro SD card slot over the on-board
16 gigabytes is one that is always
welcome as t-mobile is the main place to
get this phone in the States its
performance on the LTE network was
expectedly solid call quality on the
other hand sounded well enough though a
noticeable lag from the spoken to
digitized word on either end happened on
more than one occasion the rear-facing
speaker suffers from the same issue any
rear-facing speaker faces on top of its
general sound quality yielding a very
narrow soundstage with a distinct lack
of body and richness to the sound its in
battery life that I found some good to
this phone as it handled really heavy
usage and lasted for over 12 hours still
a solid day's worth is pretty much
guaranteed with this 3400 milliamp hour
capacity units those performance will
certainly be average for heavy usage
compared to other large phones but it
was when I lowered my usage that I found
a surprisingly incredible standby time
if you're not going out of your way to
keep the screen on you can really go the
distance with this phone and that's a
huge plus for the zmax the 8 megapixel
optics of the zmax are backed by a 1.6
megapixel front facing shooter with
video modes of 1080p and 720p
respectively the app is actually pretty
simplistic like the rest of the software
suite but does provide some modes for a
bit of creativity night modes bring down
the shutter speed for better low-light
shots and HDR actually does add some
color to an otherwise blown out subject
bursts are taken advantage of for Best
or group shot modes where you can select
the best of the bunch picture quality
takes an expectedly decent turn in
highly lighted situations where you can
certainly get some usable shots an ISO
limit of 1600 means that low-light
situations will be very
and the quality does reflect that you
can use the flash but it does more to
flood the subject than to just
illuminate it it's clear that despite
submode editions the camera is meant to
just get the job done without really
performing above and beyond and finally
the software experience is decidedly
Spartan as the very stock like version
of Android KitKat 4.4.2 comes with the
zmax anyone looking for a more stock
like experience will get it here but I
still question some of the choices made
in its implementation the lockscreen
requires a press and hold to unlock the
device which isn't a huge change but
somehow doesn't feel as fast as a quick
swipe close to no ZTE additions at all
make it into this build and it feels
highly more generic than anything to
keep things as minimalistic and less
cost effective as possible this does
make a little bit of sense but it's more
of a button layout that I find just
jointed having a dedicated capacitive
menu button almost feels archaic here
especially considering this KitKat build
nonetheless this is a case of Android
Spartan build being easily used for any
number of manufacturers devices and it
still feels just fine as a means to
bring the Android world to any device
and to any user looking for a particular
experience without paying too much and
that's exactly what ZTE is able to do
because we're talking about a very
affordable device here with zero down on
t-mobile's payment system and according
to the website it would be two hundred
fifty two dollars outright if you did
not do the payment system that's a
pretty great price for a phone that
easily brings an Android experience to a
very large screen though there are
plenty of competitors in the large form
factor space they cost a hell of a lot
more but that does mean in the end you
will get what you pay for and so there
you have it ZTE is able to bring a large
screen experience the very affordable
segment of the Android space but does so
under a decidedly mid-range scope
there's nothing inherently wrong with
the zmax as long as you factor in how
affordable it is
after all there are plenty of people out
there that want to enjoy a large screen
without having to spend an arm and a leg
and in that case ZTE has succeeded in
making that a reality there will of
course be better performance pretty much
all around from other higher-end models
but that isn't the point of the zmax and
that makes this a decidedly average but
justified addition to the Android world
as always thank you guys very much for
watching and I hope you enjoyed this
review of the ZTE zmax
it is a decidedly mid-range offering but
it is one of the few out there that
brings a large screen experience to
anybody that's not looking to pay as
much as you would for plenty of the
other ones in the market already today
