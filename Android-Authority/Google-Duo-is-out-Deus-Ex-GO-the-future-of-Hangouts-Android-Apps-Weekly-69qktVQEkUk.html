handy the Android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 154 so let's get
started first up let's take a look at
the headlines from the last week
Verizon's urge to pester their customers
seems to be reaching new heights this
week because a new report talked about
Verizon's new brand wear program the
idea is that the app and game developers
can pay Verizon an exorbitant amount of
money and their apps will be downloaded
by Android phones on Verizon's network
when that phone gets booted for the
first time it's no small wonder that
people are buying unlocked phones in
greater numbers it was announced this
week that a hallmark feature of Google
Plus was leaving hangouts on air is
officially being moved over to YouTube
where it will become part of the YouTube
live experience this is yet another big
feature ripped out of the social network
and one that people weren't really using
anymore that's probably because the lack
of reverse chronological order made it
impossible to plan a hangouts on air
this also comes on the heels of Google
removing the requirement to have a
Google+ account to post user reviews on
Google Play snapchat purchased a company
called verb for one hundred and ten
million dollars this last week the deal
is for seventy-five percent in stocks
and twenty-five percent in cash verb is
a search application that tries to show
you local stuff based on your location
reviews and whatever else they can pull
from sites like Yelp no one's really
sure why snapchat purchased the company
but the popular rationale is that
snapchat search function sucks
and they intend to improve it and we'll
see how that works out it is worth
noting that verb 1 TechCrunch Disrupt in
new york back in 2014 Google Play made a
significant move this week by releasing
a truly separate top charts for
applications and for games previously
you could only see the top charts for
apps and games but the app section was
essentially an ad-hoc game section with
a smattering of apps throughout now both
sides are completely separate so you can
find apps or games instead of just games
this is great news and something that
should have happened a really long time
ago the update is rolling out now so
everyone should have it sometime soon
with duo released and a low on the way
the big question has been what Google
will do with Google Hangouts a report
this week indicated that hangouts will
continue to stick around after the
release of the new chat apps but it will
be more focused on business use over
time we imagine that means that the
server
we'll be stripped of the more consumer
based features with business features
added in later at least it'll still be
around for even more Android apps and
games news releases and updates
including the latest Pokemon Go news you
can check out this week's newsletter
which is linked in the video description
below if you want to sign up for the
newsletter we have a form that you can
fill out in the written companion which
is also linked in the video description
below and we'll send it to you every
single Sunday for even faster updates
check out the android authority app and
now it's time for the new releases that
made a big splash this week if you want
to check out any of these apps or games
for yourself you can find those links in
the video description below it's a space
thing is a completely free game that was
released earlier this week it's an
arcade shooter where you play on the
ground and match wits with an opponent
in the air the controls and the
mechanics are simple enough to
understand but you'll need to have some
decent reflexes in order to win each
round it comes with a few boss battles
power-ups and even a local multiplayer
mode where you and a friend can play on
the same device it's all entirely free
so don't expect the very best but it's
still not bad Mars Mars is a platformer
where you must explore the planet of
Mars you do this by leaping from
platform to platform and using your
thrusters to make sure you make a clean
landing if you don't you'll end up
having a rapid unscheduled disassembly
it takes a minute but the controls are
easy to grasp and it shouldn't take you
long before you're floating around
effortlessly you'll also have
opportunities to take selfies and unlock
other characters it also comes with
Google Play games achievements Microsoft
released a new application called
Microsoft flow this week the idea of
this application is to directly compete
with apps like IFTTT for those that
don't know I have TTT and flower
applications that allow you to create
actions that are performed automatically
for instance you can have the service
save an image to Dropbox after you post
it on Instagram all by itself
yes IFTTT is definitely superior in this
space but a little competition never
hurt anyone you can try out the
application for free but it is an alpha
release and it's going to be buggy
Square Enix has released their latest
puzzle game with Deus Ex go much like
Laura Croft go this game has you
traversing puzzle maps in order to
defeat the bad guys and clear the level
unlike Laura Croft code this game
features characters and environments
from the deus ex games the game features
50 story levels that you'll have to use
various tactics to make your way through
the developers have also promised a new
puzzle every day as part of their live
content feature it's $4
99 cents which is also exactly how much
Laura Croft NGO costs Google duo was
released this week to extremely polar
reviews on one hand it's a wicked simple
video calling app that just works on the
other most of us already have video apps
that do this exact thing already
unlike most video calling apps duo
operates using your phone number so
there is no account setup if you have
someone's phone number and they have duo
you can use this app to call them which
is just fantastically easy of course
we'll have to wait for allo to come out
before we can render final judgement
since the two applications are supposed
to work together and that about does it
for this one folks if you want to keep
watching we have our review of the
galaxy note 7 linked up there on the
screen and in the video description
below don't forget to sign up for that
newsletter and keep it tuned to Android
authority because we are your source for
all things Android thanks again for
watching everybody and have a wonderful
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
