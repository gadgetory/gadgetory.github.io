this is episode 111 let's get right into
it Adobe Lightroom mobile received a fun
update this last week adobe has
announced that the application will no
longer require an adobe creative cloud
account in order to function this really
opens up the mobile app for serious
photographers although you'll still
likely meet the desktop applications to
maximize use the latest victim in the
in-app purchases and kids games problem
is Kanye West who blew up on Twitter
after his kid spend a bunch of money on
an iPad game it shall go down in history
as one of the few times that most people
actually agreed with Kanye West a new
malware called ghost push has been
discovered in a number of applications
including some in the Google Play Store
the malware forces root access and then
proceeds to do bad things as expected if
you think you may be affected there's an
application to fix it called ghost push
trojan killer in the google play store
right now google play music appears to
still be running its best of promotion
and now the list of free best of albums
has rotated to include artists such as
Europe Alice Cooper Miles Davis and more

yourself up some free music do keep in
mind that this is likely region
restricted so you may or may not be able
to get them we'll also have that link

ways released a report earlier this week
that rated how well the driving
experiences were around the world they
voted the Netherlands Latvia and the
United States tied with Sweden in the
top three with El Salvador Guatemala and
Venezuela being the three worst due to
the frequency and severity of traffic
jams for even more Android apps and

games that made a big splash this week
as usual if you want to check any of
these apps and games out you can find
those links in the video
description below contrast is a new
atmospheric adventure game released
exclusively for NVIDIA shield devices
it's an action platformer where you play
as the girl who could seamlessly
transition between being a real person
and her own shadow he played through the
game transitioning between the two to
overcome obstacles and progress in the
story it's kind of like a 3d limbo but
with a better storyline better graphics
and slightly more complex puzzles the
price tag is a bit exhorbitant but it
seems like a legit game cloud chasers is
a new game that falls into the category
of survival adventure you play as a girl
and her father as you traverse a
dangerous steampunk desert in search of
a better life you'll have to manage
their food and health much like you did
an Oregon Trail you'll also have a
glider that can be used for various
purposes the graphics are pretty nifty
and the concept is definitely fun
because the world is randomly generated
and there's some other fun elements it
also touches on the topic of immigration
there are also no in-app purchases
Wonderwall is a new wallpaper
application that brings something a
little bit different the app is a wash
and landscape and nature photography
that you can use as wallpaper images for
your device each day they add a new
hand-selected wallpaper to add to the
collection all of this is wrapped up a
material design which makes it easy
enough to wander around and search
through it also comes with auto set that
lets the application set the wallpapers
for you and you can even submit your own
photography it's also totally free with
no in-app purchases the pocket
programming is a newer application that
aims to help absolute beginners get into
the world of code unlike most there is
no actual coding in this application but
rather a set of tutorials and lessons
that explains what the code does how it
works and the various verbiage used in
coding and what those words mean it's
intended as an intermediary step between
not knowing anything at all about code
and your first hello world application
it's three dollars with no in-app
purchases and features in less than a
day for four weeks we first saw minions
paradise back at e3 and we were told it
was going to be released over the summer
there were some delays but now the game
is out on the Google Play Store this is
a resource builder gamer you must create
a paradise for the minions and of course
all of the villains it's surprisingly
in-depth as you have almost complete
control over everything that happens in
your paradise and the game comes with
plenty of goofy antics from the movie
there are in app purchases but if you
can get past them this is a fun little
game this week's Android apps weekly
