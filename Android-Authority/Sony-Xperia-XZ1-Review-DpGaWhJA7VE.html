when it comes to mobile products they're
not really conforming to what's going on
in the industry with the bezel the
screens the dual cameras and whatever
else they're just sort of doing their
own thing and making phones the way that
they see fit and whether that's gonna
work for them or work against them only
time will really tell and the sony
xperia x z1 is their latest flagship and
it's really just more of the same from
sony but this phone does have some
interesting things going for it let's
talk about the not so interesting stuff
first if you used a sony phone within
the last five or six years the design of
the xz1 will look very very familiar it
still has that overall boxy rectangular
look but Sony has done a few things to
sort of freshen up the design a little
bit it has the loop design so these
sides are rounded off which makes it
feel a little bit more comfortable in
the hand but it's still not quite as
comfortable as something like a Galaxy
s8
or an LG V 30 and this loop design has
now been extended to the top and bottom
of the phone so if you look closely the
top and bottom are ever so slightly
bowed out so the phone actually no
longer stands vertically on its own
anymore and in the hand it does feel
quite nice it's completely made out of
metal so it does have a very sturdy
construction but the overall look of the
phone just feels very dated compared to
everything else we're seeing in 2017 and
because sony has been using this overall
design for so long it's starting to get
a little bit stale at this point taking
a look at the front of the xz1 the
display it's not going to be the most
eye-catching part about this phone the
display doesn't go edge to edge it
doesn't have curved glass it's just a
pretty standard looking display it's 5.2
inches it's an IPS LCD with a resolution
of 1080p but it is a very good-looking
screen it has really nice colors really
good viewing angles and it also gets
plenty bright that's seeing outdoors
even in direct sunlight is not an issue
and the software does allow you to tweak
the colors of the display you have a
perfect
that will give you a more natural and
flatter looking image and then you have
the standard mode which is the default
that cranks up the vividness just a
little bit and that you have a super
vivid mode which really cranks up the
saturation and the contrast but this was
my least favorite of the three modes
because it looks really unnatural so I
just sort of stuck with the standard
mode which is a perfect balance between
the professional and the super vivid
mode now the bezels surrounding the
display are quite large especially along
the top and bottom but Sony does make
good use of these thicker bezels by
giving you front-facing speakers which I
do appreciate but historically Sony's
front-facing speakers have been pretty
weak but on the EXCI one there's a new
smart amp now that's supposed to give
you 50% more sound pressure and it's
supposed to make the speaker's a lot
louder and they definitely do sound a
little bit louder but it's still not
quite as loud as other phones that I've
heard and they passed with front-facing
speakers so while I do appreciate the
stereo sound that you get with these
front-facing speakers I still wish there
was a little bit more volume to these
speakers just in case you're wondering
the xz1 does come with a headphone jack
and sony has always put a pretty big
emphasis on audio with their smart phone
so you have a lot of support for a lot
of high res audio codecs and you also
have Sony's proprietary technology that
can upscale any of your music to give
you a closer to high-res sound on the
inside the xz1 has your typical set of
2017 flagship specs so snapdragon 835
and 4 gigabytes of ram and there's not
really a whole lot to say about the
performance of the x8 one it performs
just about as well as any other flagship
with these same specs it's very fast its
responsive it opens apps quickly
multitasking is not a problem here
either with bored gigabytes of RAM and
it also plays all the graphically
demanding games perfectly fine without
dropping any frames so there's really no
issues here at all with the performance
of the XE one in terms of features it's
got all the typical stuff that you might
expect from a Sony flagship its IP 68 so
it's protected against submersion and
water or using it in the rain it has 64
gigabytes of internal storage and it
also has a micro SD card slot if you
need more
but one thing that it does not have is a
fingerprint sensor at least not if you
live in the u.s. which is something sony
has been doing for a while now so it's
just something you have to live with now
as far as battery life goes it doesn't
have the biggest battery that we've ever
seen in a smartphone it's 2,700 milliamp
hours which sounds pretty small in 2017
but that hasn't necessarily tanked the
battery life in my experience I can
still get through a full day with casual
use the key word here being casual and
that consists of checking emails web
browsing social media texting and maybe
the occasional YouTube video but if
you're doing more intense things like
gaming a lot or you're using Sony's 3d
Creator app which we will get into the
phone does tend to get quite warm and in
that case the battery life does go down
rather quickly but for most people I
think the battery life is going to be
perfectly fine and of course it does
have the standard quick charge 3.0 so it
doesn't take a whole lot of time to top
off or fill up so there's a couple of
things that makes this phone interesting
the camera and the software let's start
with the camera first so the camera is a
19 megapixel sensor that Sony is dubbing
motion I and essentially what this means
is it can capture unexpected motion or
emotions such as a baby smiling and
basically the way this works is it will
actually take three photos before the
one that you take yourself if it detects
there's any unexpected motion or emotion
in the frame and it actually works
surprisingly well and because of Sony's
predictive hybrid autofocus it can
capture these photos with very little to
no motion blur every smartphone camera
right now has its own gimmick and the
xz1 is no exception and the gimmick here
on the EXCI one is that you can use the
camera to create 3d scans through Sony's
new 3d creator app and you can scan
pretty much anything that you want
whether it's people's faces food or any
other random object and it works
surprisingly well I was surprised at how
well it captures details on people's
faces and how eerily similar it looked
and with these 3d scans you can print
them off if you have a 3d printer but
even if you don't have a
3d printers Sony has partnered with some
online 3d printing companies like
Shapeways and sculpt do if you want to
print them off yourself and they've made
it really simple and easy to do through
the 3d creator app and eventually you'll
be able to use these 3d scans as a
gaming avatar or insert yourself into a
game once Sony finalizes the
partnerships with those companies the
most important aspect of any camera of
course is the picture quality and
picture quality on the EXCI one is just
okay in good lighting situations you can
get some pretty nice-looking shots the
photos are vibrant without looking
overly saturated but the camera lacks a
lot of dynamic range and it really
crushes the shadows that you lose a lot
of detail in those areas and in
low-light the photos look overly
processed that it makes noise really
easy to see and you get a lot of weird
artifacting in places that you would not
expect to see them and highlights are
also very overblown you get a lot of
lens flares a lot of streaking and a lot
of blooming and lack of OAS really hurts
the performance of this camera the
software experience on the XZ one might
actually surprise you a little bit
because it's the very first Android
phone to run 8.0 Oreo out of the box and
that's gonna be a big selling point for
the XE one at least until people start
getting their hands on Google's brand
new pixel - and of course with 8.0 Oreo
you get all the Oreo features they would
expect like notification dots native
picture and picture support a revamp
settings menu etc the list goes on and
on the only thing I really don't like
about these software experience on the
XZ one is Sony skin on top of Android
while it is very light and very close to
stock it hasn't really been updated to
fit the aesthetics of Oreo so hopefully
Sony updates that soon because right now
it does feel a little bit outdated so if
you're looking to buy the Sony Xperia XE
one it's available now directly through
Sony or other online retailers like Best
Buy and Amazon for a price of $700 and
$700 isn't necessarily cheap but
considering we're in the era of the
thousand dollar smartphones $700 doesn't
sound all too bad at this point but
should you buy the sony xperia x z 1
overall it's a really solid smartphone
and it does all
lot of things well and it has some
pretty interesting things going for as
well like the 3d creator app and the
fact that it's running android 8.0 oreo
but that selling point is going to be
relatively short-lived and i think only
the most die-hard of Sony fans will
really appreciate this phone so if you
really enjoy sony's design you really
enjoy sony's mobile products then you'll
really like this phone but if you're
looking for just a solid Android
smartphone with some really nice
features there's a ton of better options
