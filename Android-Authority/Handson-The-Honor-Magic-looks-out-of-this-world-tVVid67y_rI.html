authority coming to you from CES 2017
and this is the honor magic if you
haven't heard about the honor magic it's
a phone that's currently only available
in China and it is an Android phone but
there's a lot of really interesting
things about this phone that make it a
little bit different and unique the
first thing that might stand out to you
is the design it's got curved edge glass
on both the front and the back so think
galaxy s7 edge except on both sides and
it's wrapped in metal around the entire
perimeter so the build quality is
definitely top notch I would go as far
as saying that this is the most
beautiful and distinct phone that honors
ever built and it's not that honor
doesn't make good looking phones but the
magic is guaranteed to turn some heads
because of the curved glass it feels
extremely thin on the left and right
sides but it's thick enough on the top
and bottom that it still houses a
headphone jack and you'll find the USB
type-c port speaker and SIM card slot
here as well it's also packin some
pretty high-end specs so you've got a
five inch screen with 2560 by 1440
resolution dual cameras on the back at
12 megapixels in 8 megapixel front
camera a 2.3 gigahertz octa-core Huawei
built processor 4 gigs of RAM a 2900
milliamp hour battery with quick charge
and 64 gigs of internal storage the
biggest differentiator that this phone
has is the built-in artificial
intelligence and it works by taking
advantage of the existing sensors in the
phone like the proximity sensor but it
also has some additional sensors like an
infrared sensor and even the metal frame
itself works as a sensor there's a lot
of things that the AI can do with these
sensors but one example is when it
senses that you're picking up the phone
the screen will automatically wake up
something else you can do is scan your
face using the infrared sensor in order
to recognize you and it will only show
you notifications on your lockscreen if
it knows who you are so other people
can't snooping on your messages or
emails the best part is you can set it
up to work with or without glasses the
software on this phone is quite
different than what you might be used to
on other on our phones it's running
Android 6.0 marshmallow but instead of
emotion UI it's running what honor calls
magic live and the magic live UI is what
allows a lot of the AI to work it's a
pretty different experience but I would
say it's a huge improvement over emotion
UI it's a lot cleaner much more
simplistic and it doesn't feel car too
me or intrusive it's a shame that the
honor magic isn't coming to the u.s. at
least that's how it stands for now but
it's still a pretty interesting device
regardless and it's cool to always see a
company trying to push smartphone
boundaries and do something different
but what do you guys think about the
honor magic let us know down in the
comments below and if you want to know
more about the honor magic check us out
at androids or calm and keep it tuned
