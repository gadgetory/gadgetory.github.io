device is one hell of a phone but now
there are multiple versions of it the
latest being a ruggedized waterproof and
overall beefier version of its original
brethren is this a galaxy s6 version you
should be looking at well before we get
into our full review of the phone we
explore that question with the Galaxy s6
active versus the galaxy s6 and the s6
edge now it's really important to note
that across all the different versions
of the galaxy s6 a lot of the features
are the same across the board in the s6
active there are some compromises and
maybe a few enhancements that are put in
but that goes the same for the other two
versions as well and for that reason
we're going to skip what is similar
about these devices like for example and
mainly the performance aspect with the
exceed knows processors that are among
all of these devices and just focus on
what is different so make sure you keep
that in mind when we're going through
this versus video many were quite happy
us included to see that Samsung finally
moved to a different design material in
the s6 and edge with glass and metal
adorning them it almost feels like a
step back to go all plastic on the s6
active but that would be in hindsight as
the active version of the s6 ports a
sturdy and beefy build willing to take
any punishment and there's plenty that
this phone can boast about in protection
ip68 certification keeps the phone
chugging along even after being
submerged in 1.5 meters of water for 30
minutes and a military-grade seal of
approval means the film can resist most
weather conditions short of true acts of
God but what you might remember most
about this phone is that it is
shockproof so drops and spills won't be
enough to keep the s6 active down as
this phone is outfitted for even more
than the clumsiest of people can
probably dish out contrast that with the
fragility of the glass encased s6 and
edge whose very thin and seemingly
delicate builds make us feel like even a
small drop from a hand to a table could
cause damage remember in my Essex review
how the report routing camera cracked
from just falling over since then I've
been wary of even small tumbles and of
course you shouldn't be spilling water
or dunking this phone into liquids
because just about everything will
malfunction if you do of course
compromises have to be made on the
active and they're easy to see at first
glance the button layout has been made
fully tactile and the home button loses
the fingerprint reader but perhaps the
s6 active gains
point due to a quick large button on the
top left that can wake the phone and
raise applications of set to do so is
the s6 active the most attractive phone
out there many would say no the wannabe
camouflage on the back of the lighter
edition screams aspiring outdoor nerd
though the only version perhaps worth a
double-take is the sleeker black finish
that will end up losing some of its dark
luster due to all the scuffs you might
get in drops not to mention how much
thicker the phone is than the original
s6 and edge but in reality that's not
really the true point here is it what
the active sports is a rugged design
that is able to withstand anything
thrown at it or anything it's thrown at
where as an elegant but ultimately kind
of delicate s6 and s6 edge might prove
to be unnerving at times the s6 active
provides what the other two versions do
not an added peace of mind
no the s6 active is probably not going
to go through a Tundra or a hurricane
any time soon but at least you'll have
the peace of mind knowing that even if
it did you're probably going to still
have a working phone in display the same
Super AMOLED screens are found across
the board but the main differences can
be found against the edge it seems
obvious but the Essex active doesn't
have the curved sides that ultimately
helped with handling more than abilities
in the s6 edge the edge screen
capabilities mainly brought tickers and
quick shortcuts overshadowed by the only
truly useful feature that it gives the
knight clock but what the s6 active made
clear to us was that some extra girth
never hurt anyone and in the case of the
s6 edge we almost preferred the beefier
version handling and comfort are helped
by the curved sides on the edge but what
became a nuisance was accidentally
triggering the screen from time to time
not to mention any times that our palms
emulated a long press on the screen and
stifled any other tabs as a result now
this isn't an issue with the original s6
which makes it the middle path device
here to beef your s6 active won't suffer
from touch problems like the s6 edge but
the edge is definitely the one that will
be most head-turning of the three
devices you might be turning heads with
the active as well but obviously not for
the same aesthetic reasons as the sleek
s6 edge because of its curved screen
beefy the word we keep using to describe
the s6 active but it's not just about
the size of this phone on the contrary
some of what makes this ruggedized
device so appealing lies underneath the
surface mainly the battery life a much
larger thirty five hundred million
powered device gives
the active one highly contestable point
over two original siblings and it has
been proving itself this far for someone
like me a somewhat heavier user than
most
my typical external battery slowly
became forgotten and left at home as
full 12 hours of work were met with
relative ease on the s6 active I have
ended most days with at least 25% left
in the tank and with fast charging
capabilities still on hand it isn't hard
to get the s6 active back on the road
for another long stretch granted the s6
and edge are capable of fast charging as
well but you may have to rely on it far
more often than it's comfortable the 25
50 milliamp hour batteries in both the
glass devices just feel paltry compared
to the beefier active unit like we said
before however there are compromises in
the galaxy s6 active like the
understandable omission of the
fingerprint reader if you really need
that extra bit of security then by all
means go for the film that has it we on
the other hand don't miss it quite as
much as we thought we would that said we
do enjoy the reader on the s6 and edge
especially after ill has made a press
type rather than a swipe type and the
customizable Quick Launch button on the
top left of the s6 active allows for two
applications to be launched via a tap or
a hold and this has actually proven to
be very useful have them open up a music
application and let's say your fitness
tracker and the button will be pressed
consistently and happily for every hike
or gym visit or just have it open up
Evernote's and a calendar app for any
important meetings and notes
honestly the active is proving that an
extra button on the side for customized
launches is useful for everyone not just
active types and this is a feature that
we think should be available across all
Samsung devices from here on out it's
like the silence toggle on iPhones it's
just an extra input that actually proves
always useful now the same camera
package returns in the Galaxy s6 active
F 1.9 aperture Pro modes and video
recording that includes 4k and slow
motion capture as a result picture
quality is still great in the active
with pictures benefiting from a slightly
higher saturation for those looking for
sensory overload and high detail and
even lower light situations as mentioned
in our previous reviews of the s6 line
the best part of the image quality stems
from a lack of post-processing artifacts
noise reduction is kept to a happy
minimum because the original shot allows
details to be shown just the way that
they are rather than smudged out in post
the only real difference from the s6 and
the edge is the addition of an aqua mode
which makes the touchscreen inoperable
and capture performed by pressing the
active button for photos or the volume
buttons for video it is a typical move
for swimming photos that makes another
case for the active button as an
addition in future Galaxy phones and
finally in software we're looking at the
same new TouchWiz from before the trim
down speedy and smooth version of
TouchWiz we kind of didn't believe when
we first used it with both phones
sporting exactly the same operating
system it's hard to really give the edge
to either of these phones in this
department though the s6 active does now
include an activity zone for the active
types it's really nothing more than a
grouping of tools that are already
mostly found in s-health
but it does include a compass and a
barometer now though the active key is a
highlight of this phones usage it's an
addition that has to be desired to
really put the s6 active over its glass
counterparts it really doesn't get much
more in the way of software features but
having a rugged phone ready for the
active lifestyle still make sense for
the s6 active when it can still take
advantage of all the sporty apps that
are found in the Google Play Store now
here's where things get interesting it
would seem the curves of the s6 edge
cost a lot to make because it has a
price point usually 100 dollars or more
in comparison to the s6 proper but for a
bigger battery an extra useful button
and a rugged exterior the active only
pulls about ten dollars more out of the
pocket but there is only one problem
here it's an exclusive to AT&amp;amp;T at least
for the moment so if you do want the SX
active you may need to be switching
carriers really the s6 active is the
phone made for anyone that doesn't
really feel as safe with Samsung's most
elegantly created phones as they'd like
despite the move back to plastic the
active can take a beating and keep
moving along but its usefulness is for
more than just a rock climber the drinks
pillar or the clumsy handler the larger
size means a battery capacity and
longevity we only wished the s6 and edge
would muster and the active button has
proven useful for everyone who wants an
easy access method to their most used
applications it's not something you
would just have to see on the active we
think it should be available across the
board the s6 edge is the luxury sports
car priced accordingly and the s6 active
is the off-roading car that can still
show off on the streets even if it means
some dirt marks and scratches will be
seen
but hey it still works and has much
better gas mileage as always thank you
guys very much for watching and I hope
you enjoyed this vs. between the Galaxy
s6 active and the other two versions of
it the s6 and the s6 edge I personally
am a very big fan of what the active
provides especially that extra button on
the top left that you can use for really
any application not just active
lifestyles but you still have a great
elegant phone in the other two versions
and if you want a phone that is
ultimately very different than
head-turning the s6 edge is still one of
the best phones out there the active
just provides a little bit better peace
of mind so that even if you did drop the
phone you don't have to worry about it
not one bit so keep it tuned to android
authority for my full review of the
Samsung Galaxy s6 active which is coming
very very soon I just wanted to make
sure to give you this video to show you
the differences between it and its other
brethren but until then keep it tuned to
