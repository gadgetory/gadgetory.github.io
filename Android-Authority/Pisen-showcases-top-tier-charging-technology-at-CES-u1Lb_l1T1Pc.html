Android authority we're here live from
CES 2018 in Las Vegas taking a look at
pison the Chinese company that invented
the power bank so as you know there are
a lot of choices when choosing an
external battery to charge your
smartphone pison wanted us to show you
their booth and their new products and
we were left quite impressed after all
this is the company that invented the
power bank way back in 2005 and is the
official battery and charger
manufacturer Fred Leica cameras so you
know their products are top-quality
their star product for CES 2018 was
their new 10,000 milliamp hour ultra
slim battery it's less than half an inch
thick and can power up to two devices
simultaneously it's made of aluminum and
is offered in a number of color options
including this beautiful red that you're
looking at now my personal favorite
feature of this power bank is the LED
screen at the top which shows exactly
how much juice you have left so there's
no more guessing if you need a ton of
power pison also offers a 20,000
milliamp hour battery which has 12.1 amp
USB output and another 1 amp output
what's really nice about this product is
that you can charge the actual battery
with either micro USB or USB C so you
can choose what you ever is convenient
for you at any given time if you'd like
something a bit simpler you can also get
the Pisan
AC 5000 which X is both a charger and a
battery it even includes multi outlet
support so it's a great choice for
travellers we were also able to check
out their new wireless charging pad
which follows the chief standard it's
super thin at one point to 3 centimeters
and can do quick charging at 5 volt 1
amp output you may not have guessed but
pison also offers qualified repair
services through their 3c ez platform
which over 10,000 stores globally
participate in they even had a
technician on site who is able to
replace an iPhone battery in just around
5 minutes the repair is very
professional as you can see please enjoy
this quick time-lapse of the repair
given the iPhone slowdown issues paisans
affordable battery replacements it might
be a great option if you live on the
dark side or have friends or family
using iPhones the iPhone that you're
seeing is actually a PI's and employees
so you can see that they are rightfully
confident in their products if you're at
CES you can head on over to their booth
in South Hall to get your iPhone battery
replaced the best part they'll do it for
no charge if you're interested in
