ostensibly a mid-range u 11 but it's
also a lot like a mid-range pixel to
which HTC also made under the auspices
of the Android 1 program the u 11 life
runs near stock Android Oreo offering a
very similar software experience to the
pixel 2 but with mid-range specs and a
350 dollar price tag the u 11 lifes
lineage is visible in the familiar
liquid surface design but it makes the
switch to an acrylic and polycarbonate
chassis instead of glass and aluminum it
maintains those big old bezels but
unfortunately does away with stereo boom
sound speakers but it does come with a
fully fledged version of HTC edge sense
something even the pixel 2 doesn't have
edge sense lets you use long and short
squeezes of the frame to launch the
camera and take photos or switch between
cameras you can also use it to launch
Google assistant and map various actions
within individual apps some might think
it's gimmicky but I find it to be quite
intuitive and actually use it a lot of
course if you're not into it
it can easily be disabled another nice
HTC add on to the stock Oreo experiences
HTC use sonic audio tuning vo 11 life
comes with a pair of active
noise-cancelling used sonic earbuds
connected via USB type-c they're very
comfortable to wear and offer rich bass
and excellent audio quality but they're
real secret is in their ability to map
the contours of your ear canal to create
an audio profile that's unique to you
because the u11 life Android one runs
Oreo
it also supports various high-end audio
codecs like optics HD and L doc so if
you're into wireless headphones you can
enjoy a higher quality streaming it also
supports Bluetooth 5 for higher
throughput and longer range connections
with compatible devices the downside of
all this Audio goodness is that there's
no 3.5 ml headphone jack and there's no
included adapter either even if you
already have a 3.5 ml two USB type-c
adapter lying around it likely won't
work with the u 11 life that's because
HTC uses a special digital protocol the
dumb adapters don't support so if you
want your wired headphones to play nice
with you eleven life you'll have to pick
up an HTC made digital adapter with a
built-in DAC
another thing worth noting is that the
impressive viewsonic earbuds won't work
with other smartphones that don't
support that protocol I mentioned while
they worked fine with the huawei mate 10
Pro they didn't with the LG v 30 the
Galaxy Note 8 or the pixel 2 it's likely
not a deal-breaker but something to be
aware of the you 11 life has two big
surprises in store and the 5.2 inch full
HD super LCD panel is one of them it's
really quite good with rich colors good
dynamic range in viewing angles and
decent if not exceptional outdoor
visibility with over 500 nits of
brightness the second surprise was the
camera which was much better than I was
expecting
HTC has been making some good cameras
for a while now and the 16 megapixel F
2.0 cameras on the front and back of the
U 11 life are really very good the main
camera has phase detection autofocus but
unfortunately no optical image
stabilization but steady hands though
you can get very good low-light shots
with little noise and good color
reproduction just take a look at this
side-by-side with a pixel two to see how
well the you eleven life performs at
this price point the cameras performance
is a very big bonus
sure it has its weaknesses most notably
a slow camera app and shutter lag but
with a little patience you can get
really good shots out of it it shoots
video in 4k at 30 frames per second with
high res audio recording and 720p
slow-motion at 120 frames per second as
HDR boost on both cameras and you've got
a very capable pro mode with support for
raw I found the U 11 life tended to
slightly under expose shots but that's
easily fixed with the exposure
compensation slider in the camera app or
by using the manual controls colors were
accurate without over saturation and the
11 life captures a good amount of detail
in daylight well both things do degrade
in really dark environments and sooner
or later noise is unavoidable but I was
generally really impressed by the you 11
lifes camera and think it along with the
software experience and display are the
real standouts of this phone you 11 life
also has an ip67 water resistance rating
NFC if you're into Android pay comes in
versions with 3gb of RAM and 32gb of
storage or four gig of ram and 64 gig of
storage both of which have microSD
expansion they're considering the
minimal price difference between the two
I absolutely recommend the version with
more RAM and storage it also packs all
the benefits of Android Orio alongside
guaranteed updates for two years and
security patches but
but there's always a downside and some
of the you 11 life's floors are going to
be make or break for some besides the
contentious headphone jack situation the
you 11 life is powered by the Snapdragon
630 a thoroughly mid-range chipset that
while it handles the Android borio
experience admirably isn't going to be
good enough for some folks especially if
you consider yourself a power user or
mobile gamer I found the 630 to be quite
sufficient for everyday tasks but it's
something to keep in mind especially
considering the same amount of money can
get you a better spec sheet elsewhere
the 2600 milliamp hour battery is also
not going to be big enough for everyone
I have raised between four and a half to
five and a half hours of screen on time
of day which is fine for most but we'll
leave demanding users wanting more the 5
volt 2 am charging brick will top the 11
life off in a little over an hour and a
half with a half charge in 30 to 40
minutes you're living life also feels
very plasticky and scratches much more
easily than a glass packed phone it's
more resistant to impact and less likely
to crack the glass but I'd still
recommend using a case just to protect
that surface from scratches it'll
attract as readily as it does
fingerprints likewise the single bottom
firing speaker is there if you really
need it but there's no HTC boomsound to
be found here and as nice as a 16
megapixel selfie camera is I personally
would have preferred a more sedate front
facing sensor in exchange for OAS on the
main camera
as with all mid-range phones it's a game
of give and take if you want to know if
you should spend 350 euro on the u11
life with Android one I can't
definitively say that you should there's
just too much solar competition in the
same price range that you'd need to
check out first some of which has dual
cameras bigger batteries and more audio
options for example but one thing I can
say is that if you do buy the you 11
life Android one you're very unlikely to
be disappointed yes it's a little slower
and less powerful than some other phones
out there and maybe it's battery could
be bigger and it's price tag a little
bit lower but the software experience is
excellent and has some great additional
features like edge sense and new sonic
audio and it packs a great screen really
good camera and has guaranteed updates
for years unfortunately for our US
viewers it's not making it to the US
market though but you will get a version
with HTC Sense the HTC u 11 life Android
1 is not the perfect phone for everyone
No
but if the issues you've seen here
haven't put you off the HCC you eleven
life with Android one is going to be a
really great phone for many as always
