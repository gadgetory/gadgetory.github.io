what's going on everybody it's kind of a
chilly morning here in SoCal but I'm
still here to bring you yet another drop
test and this time we're talking about
the LG g2 still has that glossy plastic
design but the button layout is now on
the back so we're going to see how this
phone stands to our drop test now you
guys know the drill I'm going to be
doing three different tests on this
particular phone I'm going to be
dropping it on its back on its bottom on
its face I'm going to do my best to get
it to drop perfectly but even if it
doesn't we're going to see how it stands
when it hits the ground and here as you
can see this is the LG g2 itself but lay
out on the back and of course this is a
working phone this is this is just me
showing you that the phone is completely
operational even before we start these
drop tests all right here we go this is
the first test dropping the LG g2 right
onto its back alright so here we go
dropping in three two one whoo nice
bounce on there
as you can see everything seems to be
operational still if we look at the
damage that is on the back it really
doesn't look like there's a whole lot
however on the bottom here we do have
some scuffs which is pretty much where
it had dropped actually no not on the
bottom on the top here you could see
some scratches above where the camera is
but for the most part everything seems
to be working just fine
all right the g2 seems to be holding up
pretty well so far but now we have our
second test where I drop it right on to
its bottom so let's see what happens
dropping the phone in three two one and
there you go it landed right on the
corner down here on the bottom left
which caused enough of an impact to make
it shatter close to here but the crack
also does sort of spread out to other
parts of the screen after I was able to
turn it off and turn try to turn it back
on it doesn't look like the screen is as
responsive as before if at all kind of
get a little bit over on the bottom now
but it's definitely not enough to unlock
the phone unfortunately we might be
dealing with an inoperable phone at this
point broken enough to the point where
we can't really use it but we do have
one last test and that is the face test
to see just how much the screen might
get damaged if it were to land right
onto its face dropping for the final
drop test in three two one all right
getting a little bit closer with my
camera just to be able to give the full
reveal and know there it is it actually
looks like the impact isn't quite so bad
when you take a look at this particular
drop however it did land pretty squarely
on the bottom left corner again causing
even more of a breakage however across
the rest of the screen it doesn't seem
to be much else in terms of cracks or
shatters we do have some dust from the
fall there however if we turn on the
phone pressing the button it doesn't
seem like anything is turning on any
or perhaps the phone much like the
Xperia z1 is still operational but it
looks like the screen is just broken
beyond usage so nothing is even coming
up and I can't get anything to happen on
the lg g2 anymore and so their habits
for this drop test the LG g2 did fight
pretty valiantly however it could not
stand up to our job test it did manage
to work through the first and also kind
of the second drop even though the
screen was already unusable for the most
part however after the face-down test it
became completely inoperable as I can
try right now I just cannot get the
screen to turn on at all anymore
so unfortunately we're working with a
completely broken phone at this point
