you saw the new video directly from
Samsung this isn't some crazy
anonymously curse um we're showing
samsung's new smartphone display
technology and you're thinking hey chase
this must be the new Samsung Galaxy S
eight right well it's complicated you
see the source of these reports are to
youtube videos posted by samsung Display
to promote its AMOLED smartphone screens
that are provided to other companies as
well as for its own devices both of the
video show would appear to be a
smartphone with a display that only has
very small bezels on the top and bottom
it also lacks a physical home button
both of these features have been rumored
for the galaxy s 8 probably not you see
this is probably a more authentic render
of the upcoming Galaxy S 8 but I'm
getting ahead of myself so did Samsung
actually leaked out the look of the
galaxy s aid in these clips well
probably the answer is no both of these
videos were shown as examples of the
company's overall smartphone display
technology and are probably not directly
linked to what the galaxy smartphone
team has in mind for the next flagship
now back to this leak render here you
see this design is much more consistent
with the overall design language of the
galaxy s series however multiple reports
out of Korea do suggest that Samsung
will finally abandon the physical home
button in favor of on-screen keys bezel
asst displays are also all the rage of
course and we expect that Samsung will
capitalize on this trend removing the
home button will help with that another
safe bet is that Samsung will make the
galaxy SI even edgier the edge design
has been immensely successful even
spawning imitators so expect Samsung to
double down on that according to Korean
reports the s8 will feature curve
designs on the top and bottom in
addition to the sides we also expect
that there will be no visible
fingerprint sensor rumor has it that
Samsung will somehow integrate the
fingerprint sensor functionality into
the screen allowing for a much cleaner
design now I do have two silver you all
up a course as exciting as that is
remember three years ago we were burned
bad Samsung
did a great job at building hype for the
s5 I was part of that I was building a
night for the s5 I was excited for it
and then we got that story excuse for a
smartphone design the smartphone
band-aid that was the s5 so let's stay
sober about it and see what do you guys
think let me know in the comments below
but there's more let's talk about the
leaked Xiaomi me 6 it looks like a
successor to the Xiaomi me 5 smartphone
is close to being announced images and
hardware info have reportedly been
leaked for the v6 along with news that
Amy six Pro variant could be in the work
according to the images and info from
the Chinese based site my driver's com
the Xiaomi me 6 could have 4 gigabytes
of ram and a flat screen display while
the me six pro could have 6 gigabytes of
ram and a curved display similar to how
samsung launched the galaxy s7 and s7
edge in 2016 the same site claims that
both phones will have the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 835 processor along with its
quick charge for technology they could
also have a front fingerprint sensor and
a four thousand million power battery
the site claims the launch price for the
me six could be about two hundred eighty
eight dollars us while the mythics pro
could be priced at three hundred sixty
dollars u.s.
