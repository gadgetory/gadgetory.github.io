authority now recently honor lost the
honor nine and Kris was at the launch
event and did an excellent hands-on
video however now I've had a device for
a number of days I've been testing it
out so here is my full review of the
honor nine now those who are familiar
with the honor brand is actually a
huawei brand and while we've been using
it to make inroads into countries where
maybe the Huawei brand wasn't so well
received it also allows them to use
different pricing structures for selling
these phones and of course different
types of marketing now the honor nine of
course is the follow-up to the honor
eight however on the inside it's
actually very similar to this year's
while a p10 and to the mate nine now
looking at the outside what you have is
is dual glass design very similar to the
honor eight in many many ways with this
special reflective design that while we
have a work into the back we've kind of
micro he2 you these interesting
reflections now both sheets of glass
then fold down to meet to the
sandblasted metal frame now the biggest
difference on the design wise from the
honor eight to the honor nine is that
now the fingerprint reader has been
moved from the back to the front of the
bottom where also doubles up as a home
button very similar to the while we p10
now looking around the rest the device
on the right hand side you have the
volume rocker followed by the power key
on the left hand side you have the SIM
tray which can take two sins or alters
the one sim and an SD card now on the
bottom you have the single speaker the
3.5 millimeter headphone jack and a USB
type-c charging port and up at the top
you have an IR blaster and an additional
microphone and flipping its phone over
onto the back he'll see this very
reflective surface that gives these
unique reflective patterns but the real
star of the show here is the dual lens
camera setup now these aren't the Leica
lenses that you find on the back of the
p10 or May 9
however honor are using a very
sophisticated dual camera setup here
now one thing worth mentioning about the
build materials is it can be quite
slippery if you put it on a flat surface
and you try to kind of
on a keyboard the phone will slide about
on the table a bit and it can actually
be quite slippery in your hand now if
you're gripping the phone on that
sandblasted metal frame it's not a
problem but if you're relying more on
the glass on the back it can be a little
bit slippery and in fact on ER have
included a plastic bumper case in the
packet in case you are worried about
that now at the bottom of the bezel
you'll find this home key stroke
fingerprint reader it's not a physical
button you don't press it you just
tapping on it will do the same as
pressing on a home key on other devices
and then flanked left and right of that
of course are the recent apps and the
back button how you use these keys can
be reconfigured in the settings you can
swap it to the back keys on one side and
the recent apps on the other or swap it
around you can also put it into a
special mode where you only use the
fingerprint readers stroke home key for
all the navigation for example what I
tap is the same as going backwards touch
and hold we the same as going home a
swipe to the left will be the same has
recent apps now one great thing about
the fingerprint reader on this device is
that you can unlock and wake your device
all in one swift move it really is quite
fast you just place your finger on the
sensor and the phone wake up and unlock
in one step you don't need to turn it on
with this power button on the side then
place your finger on to unlock it
tapping your finger and you're straight
into the phone now the display on the
honor night is a full HD LCD IPS display
it majors five point one five inches
across the diagonals which means it has
a pixel density or 428 PPI now the
display can punch out four hundred and
fifty four nits of brightness which is
excellent for all indoor usage and it's
also good for many outdoor cases now
sometimes I would like to see more than
500 nits for displays that you're going
to use in bright sunlight however that
might not need to be the case here with
the honor 9 because it also includes
assertive display which is a sunlight
readability technology I've got a whole
video on what assertive display does but
basically allows the readability to be
increased while in bright sunlight and
actually can even save you power because
it doesn't have to keep punching up the
brightness it actually can do things
with the display
to make it more readable actually save
you power when you're in those
sunlight situations now while talking
about the display it's worth mentioning
one thing the on a9 does not come with
toughened gorilla glass on the front so
if you do get one of these devices
probably worth putting on some kind of
screen protector then when it comes to
the internals here you'll find the
quirian 960 processor that's coarse got
four cortex a seventy three cores and
four cortex a53 calls in a big dot
little a heterogeneous multi-processing
environment you've also got the great
mali g71 GPU and of course you've got
some other interesting things like four
gigs of ram seems to be understandable
there saying this test model I have
actually has six gigs of RAM and there's
64 gigabytes of internal storage and
there is a module available with 128
gigabytes of storage in terms of
performance this device performs very
very similar to the while way mate 9 to
the while we p10 it gets 1868 on the
Geekbench single core test 6000 392 on
the multi-core tests and 140 2046 on + 2
- I also ran Epic Citadel that's the
unreal technology demo app you can get
from the Play Store and the honor 9
managed 59 frames a second in ultra high
quality mode you really can't ask for
much more than that
now honor have put quite a lot of effort
into tweaking the audio on this device
and most of the benefits come when you
use a pair of headphones first where you
can select which type of headphones are
using in ear or near and so on and
different profiles are selected for you
and then there's also these 3d
spatialization effects which allow you
to tweak the sound to make it sound like
it's coming just through a normal pair
of headphones or through a home theater
setup or if you were actually at a
concert now you're not using headphones
as a single speaker on the bottom and it
does get quite loud and the reproduction
is pretty good however as often the case
if you just notch it down a couple of
taps on the old volume key then you
actually find you get better music
reproduction than if you have it at full
volume as for the back - there's a 3200
milliamp hour battery including the on
and on which is a good sized battery and
my testing has shown if you're doing a
mix of different types of workloads you
on the phone
you're checking the internet you're
watching some movies you're playing a
bit of games and you can get about five
hours of on-screen time every day if you
do lighter workloads maybe just watching
videos or predominantly surfing the web
then that number could be eked out to
maybe eight hours and if you do a lot of
3d gaming and that number they come down
a bit to just under four hours however
with a five hour average on the screen
time you're certainly gonna get through
the whole day using this phone if you do
fight up running out of battery power
than that are to battery power saving
modes that can be enabled the first
disables background apps it takes away
the things like the auto syncing of the
email it kind of reduces the kind of
graphical effects that happen in the
user interface and that should account
your time by next for a few hours then
there's an ultra emergency mode the
ultra power saving mode which basically
turns your Smartphone into a feature
phone you can make phone calls you can
receive phone calls and you can send and
receive text messages and that's about
it
now when you do need to recharge your
battery this has got just kind of
standard 2 amp fast charging on it which
means it takes about two hours to charge
up the whole battery you need about 45
minutes to go from under 5% to 50% and
during that charging cycle the last 30
minutes is what's needing bump up from
90% to 100% this device comes with
Android 7.0 and emui 5.1 built on top
now emui is wire weighs specialized skin
and software additions that go on top of
the vanilla Android now in the past I'm
provisions like emui because it didn't
have an app drawer something's very very
common from devices that come from Asia
however the latest versions of emui
allow you to either have an app drawer
or not have an app drawer so really
everybody it should be happy now emui
comes with lots to extra features that
you don't find in vanilla Android for
example there's the motion controls for
example flip to mute there is a floating
dot that you can activate to go onto the
screen that allows you to use the back
button then the home button from this
little floating dock and there's also
the knuckle gestures for example you can
draw a letter on the screen and launch
an app or you can double tap with
or to do a screenshot now either camera
is the star of the show on them on a
nine you've got this dual lens setup
which is a 20 megapixel monochrome
sensor coupled with a 12 megapixel RGB
sensor and both things are used together
for light gathering and for detail
gathering to produce excellent photos it
also includes wire ways hybrid zoom
system which uses both sensors to
improve the digital zoom capabilities of
the device the good news here is there
is a 4k video recording and the it
electronic image stabilization but only
when you're videoing at full HD but the
real star of the show having the dual
lens camera is the depth of field
features using a special mode in the
camera you can take a photo and extra
depth of field information is stored and
then in the gallery you can change what
object is actually in focus maybe you
want to change it to be a different
object a different person and you can
also change the depth of filter how much
is in focus and how much is out of focus
and that allows you to play around with
all the different effects you can have
with bokeh effects and focusing effects
and soft focusing but you can do that
all after you've taken the picture where
you want to take the picture to capture
that moment you're sticking in that mode
take the picture and worry about sorting
it all out artistically afterwards
there's also loads of other modes
available in the camera like night shot
for improving nighttime photos they have
like trails for capturing a car
taillights during the night time you've
got HDR and panorama slo-mo time-lapse
while they really like they've done with
the other phones really built in a whole
bunch of great mode into the built-in
camera app the front-facing camera is a
strong 8 megapixel sensor and that has
got it the Huawei standard
beautification mode in it and it also
has a new feature which I've not seen
before which is a bokor mode which
basically blurs out things in the
background it does that by using facial
recognition to find out where the
subject is and then working out what's
behind the subject and to make that
background blurred now the recommended
retail price of the on an eye is 449
euros
however if you shop around you can
probably get it for a lot less than that
and there are some current
was where you might get things like a an
honor band thrown in for free and
certainly lower than that for four
million prize in fact in the UK you can
get it to maybe three hundred and
seventy nine pounds and so there you
have it my review of the honor nine now
for just over four hundred euros are
getting a high end phone that's got the
same internals as the mate nine and the
wipey ten but you're also getting that
dual camera setup you're getting NFC
you're getting that lightning fast
fingerprint reader getting four gigs of
RAM 64 gigabytes of storage and a micro
SD card slot now that really is quite a
bargain however on the downside it can
be a bit slippery in the hand and there
is no corning gorilla glass on the front
to protect that display I'm going to
sing from Andrew authority and I hope
