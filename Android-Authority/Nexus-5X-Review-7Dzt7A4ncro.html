authority and the Nexus 5 was arguably
one of the most popular Nexus phones
ever made and was made by LG a company
that quickly became a fan favorite as a
Nexus manufacturer here we are two years
later with the highly anticipated and
somewhat unexpected sequel but is this
the Nexus 5 successor that we've all
been waiting for this is the Nexus 5x
the design of the Nexus 5x continues
where the Nexus 5 left off but this year
it's more of a mid-range ur and not
really a flagship at least not when you
compare it to the higher-end Nexus 6p
the 5x is made completely of plastic and
feels extremely lightweight in the hand
weighing in at a little over a hundred
and thirty grams
it's very steadily built so I don't want
to necessarily say that it feels cheap
but it doesn't have that same luxurious
or quote-unquote premium feel of a phone
made of metal or glass and if you're
coming from a phone made of those kind
of materials it can be a little drawing
at first to go back to a phone with a
plastic build it's still a really
attractive looking phone with the
rounded corners and slightly tapered
back and the plastic is coated in a
matte finish which helps a lot with a
grip and prevents the phone from
collecting fingerprints because I have a
smaller 5.2 inch screen over the more
massive screens of other smartphones
currently on the market it's also a lot
easier to hold and use in one hand like
the last few Nexus devices there's a
Nexus logo written in landscape on the
backside but this time around instead of
being embossed or made of separate
pieces it's just simply painted on
probably to avoid any Fiasco with
letters falling off there's also a
slight camera bones on the back but
unlike a lot of other phones that we've
seen this year with protruding camera
lenses the five X's is a lot more subtle
due to how the back panel tapers upwards
to meet the lens on the right side of
the phone is the power and volume
buttons and they're very easy to press
but the feedback is a little bit mushy
and they lack that satisfying click on
the left side there's not too much going
on with the exception of the nano SIM
card slot and along the top is a
microphone but otherwise it's also
pretty bare in true Nexus fashion
there's a bright LED notification light
cleverly hidden in the front speaker
grille and finally on the bottom is a
standard 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
and a you
be type-c port making the 5x one of the
few smartphones on the market to adopt
this new standard now because USB type-c
is still so new it's gonna be a while
before it becomes a convenience rather
than an inconvenience and I love the
reversible nature of USB type-c don't
get me wrong because it's USB type-c on
both ends of the cable it's going to be
a hassle for both charging and data
transfer unless you own other devices
that are USB type-c unlike the Nexus 6p
the 5x doesn't come with the USB type-c
2 USB standard in the box so if you need
that extra cable which I assume many of
you will you're gonna have to shell out
some extra cash to get it
the 5.2 inch screen on the 5x is still
an LCD like it was on the Nexus 5 except
it's a slightly larger panel and the
resolution remains the same at 1080p
even though it's not quad HD I don't
find myself missing that extra
resolution as the screen is still plenty
sharp the viewing angles are pretty good
and it has some really great-looking
colors without appearing overly
saturated the biggest downfall is the
screens outdoor visibility it's
manageable if you crank up the
brightness all the way but it definitely
isn't the easiest screen to see in
direct sunlight just like the LG Meiji
for the Nexus 5x is being powered by a
Snapdragon 808 but there's only 2 gigs
of ram and in 2015 that number sounds a
little skimpy but I've had zero issues
with performance on this device it plays
games well it multitasks well and is
overall generally very fast in everyday
use and it obviously doesn't hurt that
it's running pure vanilla Android with
absolutely no bloatware it'll be
interesting to see how well the 5x holds
up over the next year or two but as of
right now it seems to be able to hold
its own just fine
the most notable piece of hardware on
the 5x is the fingerprint sensor which
is a first for this year's crop of Nexus
phones and a lot of that has to do with
marshmallows built-in fingerprint
support which Google is calling Nexus
imprint it's conveniently located on the
backside where your index finger
naturally rests so it's very easy to
find and using it to unlock the phone is
actually very fast it's not
instantaneous or anything but fast
enough that you'll pretty much never see
your lockscreen
and the setup process is also extremely
fast it takes anywhere between 4 to 5
taps to register a fingerprint but
despite how short and quick the setup
process is it's surprisingly
very accurate and I get to have it miss
read my fingerprint once the 5x comes in
either 16 or 32 gigabytes of storage and
just like previous Nexus devices there's
no expandable storage so spring for the
32 gigabyte if you can and trust me
you'll be a lot happier that you did
there's a single front facing speaker
located on the bottom chin of the 5x
it's pretty decent for what it is but
the sound is a little on the flat side I
would have liked for there to be two of
them but I'll still take this set up
over any bottom mounted or rear firing
speaker and because it's on the front
you won't run into any issues with
accidentally muffling it with your hand
the 2700 milliamp hour battery inside
let's the 5x go for a full day with
average use but I wouldn't expect too
much more than that and if you're
heavily gaming on it you can easily kill
it before the days over which I managed
to do a couple of times marshmallows new
battery saving feature called doze does
however work very efficiently putting
the phone in a very deep sleep and
limiting unnecessary app activity this
will cause notifications to be delayed
unless they're deemed as high priority
but the device will periodically wake up
to sync them it's a small price to pay
for better battery life but I think it's
a trade-off that most people will be
perfectly okay with the 5x doesn't come
with wireless charging like the last
couple of Nexus phones but it does
support fast charging through its USB
type-c port and in my experience I can
go from 0 to 100% in roughly 90 minutes
making it extremely easy to fill up or
top off any time during the day the bane
of pretty much every Nexus phone in
existence has always been the camera but
Google is looking to change that this
year there's a new twelve point three
megapixel Sony sensor with a pixel size
of 1.5 five microns F 2.0 aperture and
laser autofocus
unfortunately there's no optical image
stabilization but Google is promising
that it doesn't need it in order to take
great pictures due to the larger pixels
but it still wouldn't of hurt to have it
especially for recording video which
turns out pretty shaky even from
casually walking down the street this
new sensor also allows for the 5x to
record slow motion video at 120 frames
and the slow motion video is a lot of
fun to play with the slow motion is very
silky smooth and Google's photo editing
app lets you select exactly which part
you want to slow down versus the whole
entire clip the camera can be easily
launched with a quick double
app of the power button which is very
convenient and once you're in you're
greeted with Google's new camera app in
true Google fashion the camera app is
still pretty bare-bones but it's still
an improvement over previous versions
you can swipe left or right to toggle
between video or stills and the HDR
toggle is located right on the
viewfinder where it's easy to locate
instead of being buried in a submenu or
the camera settings like other camera
apps tend to do with the 5x we finally
have a camera on a nexus phone that's
capable of taking some excellent photos
they're sharp full of detail with just
the right amount of saturation to make
the images pop and most importantly it
has great dynamic range the overall
camera experience is very fast - with a
quick shutter speed and fast focusing
thanks to that laser-guided auto focus
the low-light and nighttime shots are
good but I don't think they're quite as
good as Google might have heiped them up
to be looking at the images as I hold
are still a very respectable amount of
detail but you can definitely notice
some heavy noise reductions in the dark
parts of the images another thing that I
noticed is that if you have HDR Auto
enabled every shot that you take in low
light is guaranteed to be processed as
an HDR image and this is a good and a
bad thing at the same time the photos
are definitely a lot cleaner with punch
your colors and obviously increase
dynamic range but the processing
typically makes the images overly yellow
and it just doesn't look natural or as
color accurate as the non HDR version of
the same shot so you have to weigh out
the pros and cons and figure out if you
rather deal with the excess noise or
have more accurate color reproduction
where Nexus devices have always led the
Android pack is in the software the
Nexus 5x is running Android 6.0
marshmallow out of the box and if you
want the most pure and clean and Roo
experience possible Nexus is the only
way to go aesthetically you won't notice
too many differences from lollipop to
marshmallow but marshmallow does
introduce a lot of meat under the hood
improvements like doze which we've
already talked about and some other very
nice enhancements on the surface level
the first thing you'll notice is the
brand new app drawer which has been
switched back to a vertical scrolling
list instead of with the horizontal
paginated view from before there's a
search bar at the top to help you
quickly search for an app or you can
scroll through by grabbing the scroll
bar with a letter indicator to let you
know exactly where you are within the
list app permissions also got completely
revamped in previous versions of Android
app permissions were granted upon
installation and you couldn't pick and
choose which permissions to allow or
deny it was pretty much all or nothing
and this created a lot of concern but
with marshmallow permissions are only
granted when the app needs it and you
can pick and choose which apps get
permissions to what within the settings
now on tap is the most highlighted
feature in this latest version of
Android and this more or less brings the
power of Google now to any application
that you're in it's contextually aware
which basically means it analyzes the
screen and offers up suggested
applications and information based on
what it thinks you're looking for and
although I haven't had very many
instances where I needed to use it in a
real-world scenario thus far I do like
what it's capable of doing and should
only get better as Google makes
improvements I do however miss the swipe
ups to get directly into Google now and
you can still do this by long pressing
on the home button and tapping on the G
logo but it isn't quite as quick as
before the Nexus 5x is available now for
a starting price of 379 and comes in
black white and a mint bluish color or
as Google likes to call them carbon
courts and ice 379 is a very cheap price
tag for what is a very solid Nexus phone
but with phones like the oneplus 2 and
Moto X pure edition hovering around the
same price point the 5x
isn't the best bang for your buck
smartphone it is however a great smart
phone and if you've been waiting two
long years to upgrade from your Nexus 5
the very much improved camera and the
latest version of Android make the Nexus
5x completely worth the upgrade as
