against apple's big dog age joshua car
from android thority what's going on
everybody and here is your quick look at
the samsung galaxy note 5 versus the
Apple iPhone 6 plus starting off with
the galaxy note 5 we will say that the
Galaxy S series was never quite
recognized for its design but that
changed with the s6 the Korean
manufacturers adopted the same changes
with the note 5 it comes with the same
sleek unibody metal design sandwiched by
a glass front and back the only real
difference is that the curved edges of
the note 5 were on the back instead of
the front giving it a bit of a good feel
Apple will have a harder time competing
with the new note handset and that is
because the 6 plus is housed by that
aluminum unibody design that we're also
familiar with and both phones are
gorgeous and made of solid materials
making the aesthetic battle a little bit
more of a subjective one do you prefer
glass or metal regardless of your choice
all we can hope for is that the Galaxy
Note 5 isn't prone to bending which was
a popular issue for apples about gancho
and smartphones but aside from the
obvious differences both phones are
actually kind of similar they both have
the volume rocker on the left side the
power button on the right and the home
button that doubles as a fingerprint
reader and in addition both carry
protruding cameras on the back but the
galaxy note 5 does have its main trump
card which is of course the S Pen now it
is loaded into the bottom right and a
small pin can be snapped out from the
actual pen itself that has a clicky top
now and it is from there that you can
pull on it in order to remove the S Pen
in the battle of displays the note 5
comes with a 5.7 inch Super AMOLED
display and the iPhone 6 instead comes
with a full 1080p resolution IPS LCD
display which equates to a far inferior
401 pixels per inch compared to the 515
that the note 5 has needless to say the
note 5 will offer much crisper text and
clearer images but those who really
worry about color reproduction know that
IPS LCD displays didn't generally offer
more accurate colors but on the other
hand some of us do love the deep blacks
and highly saturated colors that Super
AMOLED panels are known for now as
always is the case with Android versus
Apple it's kind of hard to compare the
phone's performance levels as
specifications don't tell us too much
yet but the difference in the components
themselves are huge the samsung galaxy
note 5 is amazingly speedy with its
octa-core exynos processor which made
the galaxy
s-six absolutely fly on the other hand
apples a8 chipset is no bad contender
but that is because Apple has a
completely different ecosystem in the
iOS multitasking is where Android really
shines though and the samsung galaxy
note5 is bound to be more resourceful
due to its 4 gigabytes of RAM which
quadruples that of the iPhones mirror 1
gigabytes that being said the multi
window is something we're very used to
in the note 5 and finally Apple was able
to make multitasking a part of the
iPhone 6 plus it might look a little bit
more elegant but ultimately multitasking
is something that the Android device
will really shine through with
especially when you consider its
additional s-pen but when it comes to
Hardware additional specs might seem
pretty similar there's no real support
from microSD or removable batteries in
either device and both sport pretty fast
fingerprint readers Apple does have a
bit of the upper hand in the storage
department because the options go up to
128 gigabytes while the note 5 will just
have 32 and 64 and battery life might be
pretty similar with both devices having
pretty big units especially the note 5
having 3000 milliamp hours in its unit
while Apple's battery is a little bit
smaller at 29 15 unfortunately the real
battle here is not one will be able to
do for a little while and that is the
camera we're still waiting for our note
5 review unit to come in and it's at
that point that we will do a camera
shootout between these two and see which
one fares better in picture quality but
the iPhone 6 plus camera simply in specs
doesn't seem like it will be able to
beat the note 5s camera and we already
had a great experience than note 4 and
then the following s6 so we really do
think that the Samsung cameras will
continue their great quality now the
note 5 sports the same sensor and
technology we saw in the galaxy s6
series and that device still holds one
of the best smartphone cameras in the
industry so we're excited to see where
it goes here and now we have the
obviously polarizing section of the
comparison this is because Android and
iOS are completely different and we've
said it time and again your preference
between Android and iOS is a very
subjective matter Android may be
superior in customization has a more
open ecosystem and offers much more
flexibility to the user on the other
hand iOS is simpler intuitive and tends
to be better with updates it is the
better option for those who want to
phone to just work rather than avoid
longer setups Thor the note 5 what
really shine is in its software for
Samsung usually puts a huge focus on
these so you will be much more
productive if you actually take
advantage of all of the gestures the
multitasking tools and the S Pen
features of which the note 5 really
focuses on with features like the screen
off memo and the scroll capture the two
new ones that are available here in the
enhanced S Pen that feels even better
than before so in the end which one is
really better well we can't really say
yet because we haven't given our full
comparison of these two devices but we
will say that as it has been for all
comparisons to Apple devices it really
comes down to what you want out of your
smartphone the direct answer is at the
note 5 especially on paper just has a
better camera is more powerful and has a
wider array of software features that
could make you more productive the 6
plus is an older smartphone by now but
it could win if you prefer its
aesthetics and its software or if you
need more internal storage obviously by
our book though we do prefer everything
that the note 5 gives but for the
general users out there the note 5 just
might be one of the best Android devices
that we've seen thus far because it
piggy backs off the success of the s6
which you already loved earlier this
year
