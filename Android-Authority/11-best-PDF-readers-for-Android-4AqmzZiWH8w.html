handy the Android authority app guy and
in this quick video we're going to take
a look at the best PDF readers for
Android first up is the obligatory nod
to Adobe Reader which is the obvious
choice for most people it comes with the
standard reading features and is
oriented more toward business use
including annotations and other features
and doc is a very simple reader option
that can read PDF files as well as djvu
files all I can do is read them so if
you need more features you'll need to
look elsewhere but it is a good simple
option for readers camScanner is a bit
different it can read PDFs but its
primary function is business use
including creating PDFs sending them to
other people
annotations and other features it's a
must-have for business users easy PDF
reader is another business oriented
reader that has features like document
signing and the ability to fill out PDF
forms from the application it can also
read a pub files if you need that it's
three dollars and 99 cents and the paid
version is way better with Foxit Mobile
PDF is more of a reader oriented
application rather than business and
includes cloud storage support and
optimization specifically for reading it
can do annotations if you really need it
Kingsoft office is one of the most
popular free office options and it also
supports PDFs it is almost exclusively
for document style use including viewing
saving and opening PDF files new PDF is
another reader that focuses more on
reading than business use but it can
still be used for filling out PDF forms
if you need that it won't be relevant
for much longer but if you're running
something before lollipop it's a really
good option the PDF reader as the name
implies allows you to read PDFs
it has reader centric features such as
various view types text-to-speech OPDs
epub and even comic book format support
it's also totally free cue PDF notes Pro
is a PDF reader with a lot of unique
options including cloud storage supports
annotations text reflow and a whole lot
more it's a full-featured PDF
application and it's definitely worth a
shot with raw da as another reader
centric PDF application that also
includes very basic editing tools it
supports multiple languages a simple UI
and even some tasteful page turning
animations it's also free and
surprisingly difficult to pronounce
smart cue reader is last up for now and
it's fairly obscure it has all the basic
features a decent
face in the essential stuff like form
filling on PDFs it's also totally free
which is a big plus and that about does
it for this video folks the video won't
be updated but the article almost
certainly will so check back from time
to time to see what's new also if you
have any recommendations leave them in
the comments because I am a big fan of
recommendations if you haven't already
