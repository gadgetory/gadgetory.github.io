sony xperia x hello they might have
scary Sims from Andrew authority now
Sony has been making flagship phones is
Xperia Z range for a number of years
however that range is now gone the way
of the dodo and its place we had the
xperia x range now today the Xperia X
range has three phones Xperia XA the
xperia x performance and the Xperia X
now anybody who's familiar with the
Xperia z5 will be instantly familiar
with the Xperia X as it borrows a lot of
the same design language even a quick
glance at this phone will just tell you
that it's quintessentially a Sony
looking at the right-hand side of the
device you find the familiar Sony button
layout starting with the big power
button in the middle which also
incorporates a fingerprint reader then
the volume rocker and then the dedicated
camera key on the left hand side you
have the SIM tray at the top you have
the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack at the
bottom we have the microUSB port on the
front there is a five inch full HD
display plus the front-facing camera and
on the back we have the Xperia logo an
LED flash and of course the 23 megapixel
rear facing camera now why the xperia x
borrows a lot from the experience at
five it does add some of its own unique
design elements for example there's now
curved glass on the front the corners
are more rounded and there's some curves
on the edges when it comes to the
internals of this phone sony has made a
bit of a strange decision because it
taxed the qualcomm snapdragon 650 are
not the cork on snap dragon 820 if
you're after an 820 you need to go to
the xperia x performance so what is the
Snapdragon 650 well basically it's a
hexa core CPU with two cortex a 72 cores
and four cortex a53 cores they clocked
at a maximum 1.8 gigahertz and backing
this up you have the Adreno 510 GPU and
3 gigabytes of RAM the standard single
sim model comes with 32 gigabytes of
internal storage which can be expanded
using the microSD card you also get all
the normal bells and whistles including
GPS and
see Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and of course 4G
LTE now while I'm talking about NFC Sony
have made a bit of a strange decision of
putting the NFC detector on the front of
the phone which means that when you want
to pair it with another phone to copy
over a photo or something you have to
put the front of the Sony to the back of
the other phone and that can create lots
of Mis read on the screen and I actually
found it quite difficult to get the
alignment just right as for sound the
xperia x features dual front-facing
stereo speakers meaning the sound is
unobstructed when you place the phone on
a flat surface and the sound is always
projected directly upwards and outwards
the speakers can get quite loud and
placing it on a flat surface actually
seems to boost the sound somewhat there
are a number of audio settings that you
can use to improve the sound quality
including dsee
HX clear Audio plus and a dynamic
normalizer there is also a manual mode
which allows you to enable the equaliser
will activate various surround sound
options including s force front surround
when it comes to the battery the sony
xperia x packs a two thousand six
hundred and twenty milliamp hour unit my
initial charge from when I took it out
of the box lasted just over two days but
I must admit I didn't really use it much
in the first day and during that charge
time I got 4.5 hours of screen on time
the next charge gave me 5.5 hours of
screen on time with a mixture of web
browsing YouTube navigation 3d gaming
and 2d gaming what this means is that
with moderately heavy use you'll be able
to get a full day of battery life and
this can be improved even further by
turning on some of the power saving
features according to Sony's website the
xperia x supports quick charge 2.0 which
means that the phone can be charged
relatively quickly up to that 80% level
however the charger that came with my
reviewing unit was not quick charge 2.0
compatible using the supplied charger it
took one hour and 15 minutes to charge
from 5% to 75% in terms of general
performance the Snapdragon 650 provide a
snappy experience the UI is smooth and
there aren't any noticeable lags the
gaming experience is also
very good in fact the xperia x scores an
impressive 59 point 5 frames per second
on epics is a bill in its high quality
mode and 58 frames per second in the
ultra high quality mode and for those of
you like benchmarks the device managed
to score 70 7306 in antutu 1442 in geek
benches single core tests and 3,800 in
geek benches multi core tests the Xperia
X comes with a 23 megapixel Sony Exmor
RS sensor a wide-angle 24 millimeter G
lens and support for low-light
photography at ISO 12800 the camera on
the Xperia X is good it's not the best
but it's good although the camera has a
23 megapixel sensor it's set to 8
megapixels in 16 by 9 by default sony
enthusiast will tell you this gives you
the best results because it uses super
sampling now these pictures that I'm
showing you include pictures taken in 8
megapixel mode in 20 megapixel mode and
in 23 megapixel mode as you can see in
good daylight the camera works well and
there are little to choose between the
20 megapixel and the 8 megapixel images
oven of course the resolution however
you will notice that some pictures are
dull and seem washed out take particular
notice of the sky it's meant to be blue
where they're using HDR does improve the
washed out sky problem but also no it
does change the overall colors of the
pictures in low-light situations the
camera tries very hard to produce a good
shot or although the levels of noise do
go out and you'd be expected the overall
results are actually quite good the
Xperia X also features Sony's predictive
hybrid autofocus in a nutshell you tap
on an object in the frame and if it
moves like a kid or a dog then the
Xperia X uses object tracking to keep
that object in focus while there is no
4k recording the xperia x does support
60 frames per second while recording in
full HD there has been some concern
about the sony xperia overheating while
recording video when I first use the
camera app I saw a warning message which
said if the temperature
as Rises the app may close during use
your recording will be saved
automatically to see if the Xperia X has
an overheating problem I started to
record a full HD 60 frames per second
video and set the camera on top of a jar
just to see how long it would record for
everything went okay until about the 18
minute mark when a warning was displayed
camera will now turn off to cool down
which it calls it probably did on the
plus side the bundled camera app is
actually quite good along with a semi
manual mode there is lots of additional
modes including AR mode which can
superimpose computer-generated scenes
like dinosaurs and fish onto your photos
and videos an AR mask mode to mask your
face with different generated masks and
a time shift mode which recorded a high
frame rate and applies slow motion one
problem I have with the bundled camera
app is it seems the only way to enable
HDR is to use the semi manual mode and
even then its buried away in the
settings menu and isn't an onscreen
control the upshot of this is well for
me at least that the semi manual mode
became the equivalent of HDR mode if I
wanted to HDR then I switched to semi
manual if I didn't les switch back to
full auto in terms of software the
xperia x comes with Android 6.0
marshmallow along with a light skin on
top of the stock Android UI it also
includes extra features and Sony related
apps as well as a software for merging
at the fingerprint reader there is a
myriad device connection options
including the ability to wisely play
content from your Xperia x2 other Sony
devices there's also a theme library
with some free color based themes that
matches the phone colors along with a
theme store full of both free and paid
themes under the battery settings there
are two different power saving modes
available stamina mode and ultra stamina
mode we have stamina mode enabled then
GPS vibration image enhancement etc are
restricted to reduce battery consumption
also background data is restricted again
to save battery with ultra stamina mode
enabled your data connection both Wi-Fi
and cellular is disabled and the home
screen switched to the ultra stamina
mode home screen which includes access
to only a
you apps basically the phone contact
messaging camera and a clock so the
xperia x is available right now in the
UK and in Europe for four hundred and
fifty nine pounds 99 or four five
hundred and eighty nine euros it also be
coming to the USA on the 26th of June
where it'll cost around five hundred and
fifty dollars off contract now those
prices are actually higher than what you
can probably pick up an LG g5 or a
samsung galaxy s7 however if you find
one on contract maybe you'll get a good
deal through your carrier if you're a
Sony fan or you already have an
experience and you want to upgrade that
I really can recommend the xperia x
however really the flagship device is
the xperia x performance however the
pricing of the xperia x off contract is
actually quite high
