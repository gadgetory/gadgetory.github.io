your average hard drive but does that
justify its somewhat I price find out in
our review hey everybody I'm Chris look
right now smartphones usually top out at
about 64 gigs even if you double that
with a microSD card that's not a ton of
space if you want to keep a lot of music
movies and photos on hand
not to mention apps and games the
Voyager air can help solve that problem
but how well does it work the Voyager
air comes in two capacities 500
gigabytes and one terabyte which we're
reviewing and it connects via backwards
compatible USB 3.0 it has a built in
6200 milliamp hour battery it allows you
to use it without having to be plugged
in the Voyager error measures roughly
five and a half inches long by three
inches wide there's about one inch thick
it's roughly the size of an old mp3
player and it fit easily in my pocket
the power and Wi-Fi switches are on the
front while the USB power and land
connections are all placed on the back
while you can connect the Voyager air
with just one cable for data transfer
using the second cable in a second port
charges the device's built-in battery
while you use it while you can plug it
into a computer via USB or use it as a
network attached storage device if you
connect it to a router to use the
Voyager air with your Android device
you'll want to enable the built-in Wi-Fi
just turn the drive on turn on Wi-Fi and
connect as you would to any other Wi-Fi
network with your phone or tablet once
you're connected you can use the Voyager
air a p-- available on the Google Play
Store to manage settings and files one
of the coolest things about the Voyager
air is its built-in Wi-Fi pass through
basically the Voyager air connects to
another wireless network and acts as a
bridge between your device and the other
network meaning you can still access the
Internet but this has other uses think
hotel rooms that charge per device
simply connect the Voyager air to the
hotel Wi-Fi and connect all your other
devices through the Voyager air there
you go
the corsair claims that the Voyager air
6200
our battery allows streaming video for
up to seven hours I didn't test this
specifically but I did get quite a bit
of battery life out of the air you can
always check the battery capacity
through the voyager an app if you want
to keep an eye on how long the battery
has left I connected the Voyager heir to
a bunch of different Android devices as
well as computers running Windows 8 Mac
OS 10 mountain lion and a few different
Linux distributions and it worked great
with all of them the only one I had a
little trouble with was mountain lion
because the drive is formatted as NTFS
so I couldn't write to it right out of
the box but it does give you the option
to format it as HFS+ if you want to use
it with time machine now the Voyager err
is on the pricey side right now it goes
for about $200 online depending on where
you look but if you travel a lot or if
you just use a lot of media with your
phone I'd say it's definitely worth it
this is a really cool little gadget
we've got a written companion to this
video at Android authority comm you can
find a link in the description make sure
to stay tuned to android authority for
more reviews news QA giveaways and more
I'm Chris book and as always thanks for
