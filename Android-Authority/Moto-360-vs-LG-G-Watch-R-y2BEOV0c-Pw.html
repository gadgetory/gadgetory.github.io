Android Authority and even though it's
been on the market for a while now the
Moto 360 is still considered to be one
of the best Android wear watches if not
the best most because it was first to
market with that circular design but it
didn't take long for LG to create a
competitor with the G watch R and it's
currently the only other round option
you have right now with Android wear so
it only makes sense to compare the two
this is the Moto 360 versus the LG G
watch our starting with the design of
the Moto 360 and the G watch are you'll
find the two to be very similar but also
different in a lot of ways they both
feature dust and water resistancy a
heartrate monitor and are the only two
Android wear smartwatches currently with
a circular watch face they're also both
made of metal and leather but you do
have the option of a metal band on the
Moto 360 now which you don't get on the
G watch R so from a pricing standpoint
the Moto 360 might be a better bang for
your buck the leather bands between the
two are also quite different the Moto
360 is a lot softer and flexible whereas
the G watch ours is a little thicker and
more rigid and which one you like better
is going to be a matter of personal
preference size wise they're actually
quite similar the G watch arm might
appear a little bit bigger due to the
watch lugs and the more flared out
design but in reality the difference is
negligible if you want a more simplistic
circular SmartWatch that can be worn on
pretty much any occasion the Moto 360 is
the best bet but if you want a
SmartWatch with a little bit of extra
flair and design cues from a lot of
modern-day watches then the G watch R is
the one to get they both feature circle
displays obviously but the technology
between the two is quite different the
Moto 360s is an LCD panel with 320 by to
90 resolution and the odd resolution is
deuce the bottom black bar that a lot of
people like to make a big deal out of
but honestly it's really not that big of
a deal and if you own one you will most
likely agree on the G watch are you do
get a full circle display but it's
slightly smaller and
uses P OLED technology instead both of
these displays look great in their own
right they both feature great colors and
viewing angles although if you're
looking for those slightly punchier
colors and deeper blacks the G watch
arts display is the way to go if you
don't mind sacrificing a little bit of
size taking a look at the specs the Moto
360 features an extremely old TI OMAP
processor and half a gig of ram whereas
the G watch r has a newer processor with
the snapdragon 400 and the same half a
gig of ram when the Moto 360 initially
launched there was a lot of lag and
performance hiccups and many blamed that
on the old TI OMAP chip but after a few
software updates you'd be hard-pressed
to notice any difference between these
two watches or any other Android wear
SmartWatch for that matter performance
is very buttery smooth on both and any
choppiness or lag that the 360
originally had coming out of the gate
are virtually gone outside of the custom
watch bases included on the Moto 360 and
the G watch are the software experience
is practically the same without Google
allowing OMS to alter the Android wear
experience you won't find much
differentiating one Android wear watch
from the other but it does create for a
much more consistent experience between
all of the watches if you're not
familiar with Android wear at this point
it's basically your Google now cards
plus any other notifications you would
go and receive on your phone except on
your wrist
Android wear isn't perfect by any
stretch of the imagination but through
each and every update it continues to
improve on its ease of use and
functionality in regards to the battery
the Moto 360 packs a three hundred and
twenty milliamp hour battery whereas the
G watch r has a slightly larger 410
milliamp hour battery and even though
there's a difference in battery capacity
between the two you'll actually find the
battery life to be very similar and you
should be able to get no less than two
days between them both if not a little
bit more and this is another area where
software updates made a huge difference
with a moto 360 and if you bought the
Moto 360 on launch day like I did you'll
remember that the battery life was
initially pretty terrible lasting only a
day and this was if you did
use ambience mode the Moto 360 does have
an advantage over the G watch R when it
comes to charging the Moto 360 uses
wireless charging and comes with a much
more elegant looking charger out of the
box but you can use any qi wireless
charger of your choice the G watch R on
the other hand utilizes a proprietary
charger it's not the prettiest thing in
the world nor does it change your watch
into a desk clock but it gets the job
done just fine
both of these watches are available now
through Google Play and various other
retailers the Moto 360 starts at 250
bucks for the leather band version and
if you want the metal band it's going to
cost you an extra 50 bucks the G watch R
starts right at 300 dollars making it
the most expensive Android wear
SmartWatch on the market and like I
mentioned earlier you don't have the
option of a metal band so if you want a
circle or SmartWatch with a metal band
the Moto 360 is currently your only
option but that is going to do it for
the Moto 360 versus the LG G watch R at
the end of the day these are both great
options when it comes to Android wear
and if you have to have a circular watch
face these are currently your only
options what is really going to come
down to is personal taste as to which
one you like better and how much money
you're willing to spend these are two of
the most expensive Android wear watches
on the market right now putting them on
the upper echelon at least in terms of
price but I can definitely guarantee
that they are both worth every single
penny and you can't really go wrong with
either one as always guys thank you so
