at Mobile World Congress 2017 while I
released the p10 and VP 10 plus and now
following a trend they've set in other
years they've now released a cut-down
version of their flagship phone this
time is called DP 10 light so I've had
the phone for a few days now
and I've been putting it through its
paces and let me tell you what I found
out when you look at the p10 the p10
right next to each other you can tell
they're from the same family however
there are some significant differences
between the two for example there's no
physical home button on the front of the
p10 light and therefore no fingerprint
reader on the front in fact the
fingerprint reader for the p10 light is
on the back and talking on the back of
the phone here you won't find the dual
camera setup from like like you do on
the P 10 and P 10 plus in fact what you
get is a much more simple single camera
configuration and there are a few other
minor differences for example the P
taillight is using microUSB rather than
USB type-c the headphone socket is now
on the top rubber on the bottom but some
things are the same for example the
power button and the volume rocker on
the right hand side and the microSD card
and SIM tray are on the left hand side
as well as the differences on the
outside of the phone there are some
significant differences on the inside of
the phone for example you're not going
to getting any flagship processor here
in fact what you do get is the keyring 6
v 8 which is an octa-core cortex a53 set
up with a Mali 830 MP - GPU now neither
of those are powerhouse or bleeding-edge
however I must say that I found
the device actually handled quite well
and that's probably because of two
significant things first of all this is
a built on 16 nanometer FinFET which
makes it kind of towards the bleeding
edge of processor technology and
secondly the 830 is a good GPU even
though it here it in that 2 shader core
configuration and we'll talk about some
specifics in terms of gaming in terms of
benchmarks in a moment you also get 4
gigabytes of RAM that's for Western
Europe and a few other key regions and
for the rest of the world is 3 gigabytes
of RAM and then supporting that you've
got 32 gigabytes of internal storage
however I must say quite a lot of the
internal storage is already taken up by
Android and some of the pre-installed
apps maybe 10 gigabytes maybe a little
bit more you also get all the other
things you'd expect to find this is a 4G
LTE phone you've got bluetooth 4.1
there's GPS of course and good to see
here also include NFC now I must say
when it came to the performance this
phone does perform better than most of
the other octa-core cortex a53 phones
out there so we're talking about phones
have got things like the snapdragon 6 2
5 you'll actually find that the kilian
65 8 just beats them maybe just
marginally which does indeed beat them
now here are some actual numbers for you
and - - it scored 60 1164 and on
Geekbench it's called 901 on the single
core test and 3310 on the mortise core
tests so to put that into some context
what you'll find is that the p10 light
off about half the performance of the
current p10 on the p10 + and also it
means if you go back to older devices
like the Galaxy s4 or the Nexus 5x these
are the kind of performance numbers
we're getting out of these devices
so today's mid-range smartphones are
really offering the performance levels
of yesteryears flagship devices and of
course that's always going to be true
now one small area of concern is the
fact that the GPU including this device
only have two shader cores so it's the
Marley 830 MP - now that initially kind
of made me think well that's actually
not going to be up to the job but I must
say that I was actually quite impressed
with the results that I was
able to find for example on Epic Citadel
it managed 46 frames a second in ultra
high quality mode no that's not
brilliant there are lots of device out
that are giving us 48 58 and 59 frames a
second in that same test however for a
mid-range phone that's actually quite
going on I'd be able to play a few 3d
games on it and I didn't have any
problems but if you are looking for
ultra smooth 3d gaming without dropping
any frames and it isn't device for you
so let's move over onto the camera so as
I've mentioned earlier here you have the
single camera configuration and it
includes a one over two point paid
sensor now I initially thought that was
actually going to be quite small because
you find a lot of phones you get a one
over 2.3 inch sensor however while we
have not pushed so megapixel in this
particular sensor so it's not a 16
megapixel sensor it's actually just a 12
megapixel sensor which of course means
that even though it's a smaller sensor
the pixels are able to be just a little
bit larger and they're able to capture
good amount of lighting fat Huawei say
20% more light but they don't say
compared to what unfortunately however
in my testing I did go out quite dubious
that we were going to get any decent
pictures out of this but I have been
pleasantly surprised not only in good
lighting are you getting good photos
which of course you would expect but
also indoors inside shopping malls and
even in the very low light there are
getting reasonable pigeon-house course
is going to be noise of course it's
going to be some grainy issues however
considering the position of this phone
as a mid-range device I was actually
very impressed by the camera and as for
the camera app itself I must say I've
been quite impressed on previous Huawei
configurations what you found was that
when you turn the camera from portrait
into landscape the menus didn't turn
with you so you ended kind of swiping
from the top and that gave you a menu in
portrait mode you could switch the phone
back and then fiddle with it and then
bring the first but now in the new
versions which you also find the p10
repeat em plus you can swipe from the
left on the right when you're in
landscape mode giving you instant access
to all the different modes and all the
different settings now talking of modes
and settings what else do you get well
of course there is normal things like
HDR and panorama but you also get things
like
and time-lapse and interesting that is
also a pro mode which allows you to set
things like the white balance and the
ISO and the shutter speed the areas of
focus and so on now I've mentioned the
camera app what about the rest of the
software well the software on the p10
light is based on Android seven however
it's not stock Android here using
emotion UI 5.1 now in the past some
people have been hesitant about emui
four from Huawei because it doesn't
include an app drawer as often the case
with phones that come out of Asia
however while I can a brilliant thing is
now configurable you can have an app
drawer or you don't have to have an app
drawer it's up to you it's a very simple
setting to change in the settings menu
talking about setting menu there's loads
of the stuff that you'll find there that
you don't find stock Android for example
there's a course of stuff for the
fingerprint reader UK there are various
gesture motions like slipping the phone
to mute you can change the color of the
display to me warmer colder you can
change it how it's completely
configurable however you want with also
a floating dock you can activate there
are the knuckle gestures there's a whole
bunch of stuff which of course is all
configurable so if you don't find it
work so you can just turn it off you can
just not use it that way if you do find
it work there's lots of different stuff
that while we have built into their
version of Android that you don't
necessarily find on stock Android they
talk about the battery for a moment the
p10 light has a very impressive 3000
milliamp hour battery and that double
impressive when you consider this using
a processor like the cortex a53 based
keyring six five eight and you've only
got a 5.2 inch full HD display we're not
talking five point five five point seven
inch here so actually it is a very power
efficient phone so in day to day use
your easing and get between five and six
hours of on-screen time which may find
for some people that you could actually
last for two days if you don't use your
phone actively all the time during the
day or a heavy power user then you know
always checking your email or were
checking your social media then I think
you're going to find you get through the
whole day on this without any problems
whatsoever
doing some individual testing I found if
you play a lot of 3d games that will
bring the battery life down you can
probably play about four hours of 3d
games or
this device in one full charge and if
you're doing much lighter things like
browsing the web or watching video you
can easily get eight or nine hours out
of this device so depending on your
usage but day to day probably five to
six hours which i think is a very very
good number it also worth mentioning
that the phone comes with fast charging
at 18 watts at nine volts and two amps
and in my testing it goes from 10
percent to 100 percent in about 87
minutes but it's worth noting but 22 of
those 87 minutes were actually to go
from 90 percent to a hundred percent
which is often the case with these fast
charging technologies that kind of that
ramping up to 70 80 % is very quick and
then that last could have hurdle at the
end which is or takes a long time and to
go from 10% to 50% takes about 30
minutes so if you want a quick charge
before you dash out for an evening
before you go somewhere then the quick
charge on the p10 light is going to be
good and so there you have it my review
of the huawei p10 right now which is not
a flagship device but there are lots of
good things you can say about this phone
for example you've got that three
thousand milliamp hour battery you've
got NFC you've got microSD card support
and of course you've got four gigabytes
of memory the camera is pretty
reasonable considering this is a
mid-range device the only thing that may
be a problem for you is the overall
performance it's about half the
performance of what you get from a
flagship device today and particularly
if you're into 3d gaming you don't want
to see any drop frames at all then that
two shader core GPU is not going to be
enough so if you're a casual gamer or if
you just play you know when you're
waiting five minutes you're not really
into mobile gaming then of course it is
going to be absolutely fine and of
course the pricing being a mid-range
phone it can be very different to what
you pay for a high-end flagship device I
go sim from Andhra thority and I really
