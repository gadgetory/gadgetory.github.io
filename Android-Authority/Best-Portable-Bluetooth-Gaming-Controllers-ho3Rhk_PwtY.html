name is Kevin a tech ninja and these are
my top portable Bluetooth wireless
controllers we will begin this video
with one of the controllers that is the
most portable this is the $65 drone
evolution controller this colorful
controller on the surface looks like a
normal gaming controller with a pair of
analogues face buttons d-pad and
shoulder buttons and also two additional
buttons on the back that acts as
triggers the controller is open source
so you can see a lot of mods and unique
configurations for the controller online
if you head over to the phones right now
you can see a few mods that are actually
in place beyond that this controller is
really easy to use you can quickly
charge it via microUSB analog stick out
just far enough to get a good grip and
the d-pad is nice and clicky the face
buttons have a decent amount of depth
when pressing them down and even start
and select button are well placed and
easy to find as well the shoulder
buttons are thinner that I like them to
be they become tough to find when
playing a game and sometimes my fingers
slip off the back trigger buttons are
also in a weird locations not that I've
never seen since a Nintendo 64 the
triggers have a smooth shape to them and
they are angled out to be pressed easily
it is just pretty hard to make the jump
from the bottom of the controller to the
top shoulder buttons it's a big
adjustment period that's for sure
regardless of all the flaws I just
mentioned this controller is still one
of the better ones out there because of
the size the nice face buttons and the
d-pad the battery life is pretty good
and it's rated for 17 hours of playing
time and after seven days of standby
time now I can't vouch for that type of
battery life since of not game for 17
hours in a row but often on this battery
has not died on me it has been over
three days the phonejoy controller makes
my list due to the uniqueness of it
this controller really tries to turn
your phone into a portable gaming
console it's a slider design that fits
your phone even if you don't put your
phone in it you can still use it closed
as well this controller features the
standard buttons that you would expect
the shoulder buttons are spaced out more
like a standard console and the analogs
feel a bit mushy to me and in some games
like Riptide GP the mushy analogs really
hinder your movement the d-pad does not
have a click to it as well and honestly
it's a bit tough to press however the
face buttons and shoulder buttons do
make up for they are spaced out well and
they also really are tight when pushing
them in the start and back buttons are
found on the side of the controllers so
when playing in close quarters there's
no problem at all the controller does
fit your pocket which is a huge plus and
the phonejoy store app really helps you
pair your controller to your device and
also have the compatible games that are
listed in there as well as far as
portability this controller collapse
very well so you have a pocket-sized
controller that can also hold your phone
the slider is held together with tough
Springs and metal housing and it should
hold up after a while but only time will
tell on this one the phonejoy
also comes with a charging adapter so
you can play in charge and also a few
other accessories in the package the
last controller is the $80 steel series
free mobile wireless controller there's
only one color style of this and that is
black and grey it is very attractive to
me and it reminds me of a PlayStation
controller the controller has a solid
feel to it it's lightweight but it does
not feel cheap I have bigger hands and
the controller is small but the surface
buttons and analogues are built in a way
that control is pretty easy now small
enough to slide into your pocket and
quickly pull out for some gaming the
battery life is really good due to its
auto off feature and is greater for 10
hours of gaming nano Long's are at the
bottom of the controller and the d-pad
is spaced out pretty well although the
controller is small it does not feel
cramped and all the buttons have a great
clip to them one thing that I am
disappointed about is that there's only
one set of shoulder buttons for gaming
that requires both sets this does
require some button remapping
now to remove the button zit does
require a computer software to do this
which is a bummer since you may download
a game and not have a computer nearby to
help you adjust the buttons and there
you have it folks those are my top three
portable Bluetooth wireless controllers
now there's not a clear-cut winner
because they're all good in different
instances and you may find one better
than the other so I can't give an answer
of which one's the best but I do enjoy
all three now when it comes to wireless
controllers that are not portable the
Moga pro power controller is still the
best one hands down and I will tell you
that as always guys if you like we do
