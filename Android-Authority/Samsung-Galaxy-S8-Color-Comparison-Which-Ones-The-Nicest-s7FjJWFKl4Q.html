that launch will arrive in three colors
in both the US and Europe midnight black
Arctic silver and something called
orchid grape I'm Chris Colin with
Android authority here to take a closer
look at your Galaxy s8 color options
before we get down to each specific
color the first thing to note is that at
least at launch every version of the
galaxy F 8 will have a black front bezel
it rest assured that if you don't see
your favorite color here yet more are
undoubtedly coming the ones of the
colors we have now first off is midnight
black the sexiest sleekest and
stealthiest option by far it's almost
identical to the black galaxy note 7 the
black metal frame and front bezel make
the phone the most consistent looking of
all the options and the side buttons and
camera and finger scan on the back just
melt into the inky blackness and
virtually disappear the black is very
high gloss though dasu the was on the
note 7 and as such it's going to collect
fingerprints in exactly the same way
while Samsung has some really great
colors up its sleeve these days the
company still doesn't seem to recognize
just how disgusting these phones get the
very first time you touch them if you're
into obsessive cleaning then you're in
for a treat if not then maybe invest in
a case next up is Arctic silver while
the color is in some lighting conditions
similar to last year's silver galaxy s7
in others it's much darker one thing it
definitely isn't close is the same kind
of gleaming narrow like surface
reflections are diffused a lot more on
this year's galaxy s 8 colors which have
taken on a much more subdued palette as
well they're still quite reflective but
it's a superficial reflection without
the shimmer underneath the glass if you
like white phone the arctic silver s8 is
the closest you're going to get at
launch as I mentioned more colors will
undoubtedly be arriving and they may
include a white prism but for now this
is as white as it gets the metal chassis
of the arctic silver f/8 has a slight
gold hue to it and the camera flash and
fingerprint scanner on the back stick
out more than on any other color not
physically of course everything is nice
and flush but they don't disappear it's
just like they do on the black version
finally orchid gray subscribing this
color in words or even in photos is a
little difficult because it constantly
shifts depending on the lighting
condition as you can probably see in
this video at times almost identical to
coral blue that others are duct gunmetal
gray and sometimes very similar to
Arctic silver no matter which way the
color skews though there's always a
subtle lilac undertone that's really
lovely on the eye the metal edges of the
phone or a straight silver color but
despite having black Devils on the front
silver metal edges and a shape-shifting
lilac back panel the phone never feels
like a mishmash it brings just the right
amount of sex appeal to an otherwise
unassuming color as mentioned each color
of the galaxy f/8 has a corresponding
default wallpaper which can of course be
changed just like any other there isn't
any default theming going on with
software or anything like that so the
color choices are only felt in the back
panel edges and on the wallpaper
considering the immense popularity of
the coral blue color last year though
we're sure we'll see that option crop up
soon enough alongside the darker blue
Galaxy s8 we recently saw leaked both
the white and a gold version might also
be in the works if selected to be
believed and there's always the
possibility that Samsung will jump on
the fire engine red bandwagon sooner or
later so that's it saw the available
color options at launch hit the comments
