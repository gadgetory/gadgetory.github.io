know I had to spend some time in Europe
but as we all know the Android new
strain does not stop so neither do i so
grab yourself a British pint or some
strong French coffee because it's josh
magar from Andhra I thought it what's
going on everybody and it's time for
another dose of the week's top Android
news it's android authority we did you
get as excited as we did seeing that
picture of what looked like a new Nexus
device well the smoke of confusion might
be clearing as we get more details on
what could be the upcoming Nexus
smartphone evleaks hinted on Twitter
that claims an FCC filing thought to be
the much-anticipated device might have
been premature turns out those weren't
patents for a cdma version of the LG g2
but instead evidence pointing to filings
for a different smartphone pictures of
the supposed device then appeared as
well and clearly this isn't an LG g2
we're looking at this is certainly more
news on the fabled new Nexus smartphone
than we've ever had to tide you over
reddit user bodycon created a pretty
badass render that considers the lack of
a phone speaker as a sign that the new
phone might use bone induction
technology instead and as I'm sure
you've heard all over the interwebs this
week Apple announced their new iPhone
entries into their smart phone line not
only did they announce the iphone 5s
which now comes with a fingerprint
scanner they also announced the iphone
5c a plastic encased version of their
flagship smartphone this $99 on contract
version of the iphone looks to engage
the mid-range of course the 199 dollar
on contract 5s brings further updates to
the flagship as we're always wanting to
keep our pulse on the competition we
take our own look at the new iPhones to
see how they stack up with their new
updates we also ponder the implications
of the new iPhones mainly in regards to
the 64-bit chip it introduces check out
all of those articles on android
authority calm
speaking of 64-bit processors it seems
that Apple was ahead of a trend that is
actually already bound to happen and
along with it we might be seeing even
more powerful memory inside of our
smartphones in the near future with arm
essentially leading the charge we could
be seeing upwards of fifty percent
increases in performance compared to
current chipsets as Samsung boss JK Shin
confirmed 64-bit processors are in
Samsung's future and we are reminded
that this is a leap in processor tech
that isn't some sudden occurrence for
rather an endeavor in the works for at
least the last few years another
interesting tidbit regards ram Samsung
introduced 3 gigabytes of RAM in its
Galaxy Note 3 but it unsurprisingly
won't end there apparently we could be
getting up to 4 gigabytes in our phones
within the next year effectively making
smart phone computing about as powerful
as regular computing it's an interesting
prospect indeed and do you remember the
saga of Hugo Barra the now former
Googler who give us a lot of really good
presentations of new products in the
past year well in an interview with Karl
Swisher of all things D Barra stated
that he already knew Ben Lin founder of
Zhao me and himself a former Googler and
was interested in the upcoming company
for some time with the release of their
mi2 Shami reached out to borrow for
advice on international expansion and
talks eventually moved to them teaming
up in the interest of transparency Mara
involved google execs early on and about
a year later we find ourselves at this
juncture with Jamie and Google's
positive vibes perhaps Mountain View was
ok losing borrow to a friend now we will
just have to see what Barra can do for
the up and coming chinese manufacturer
at the top this is fine okay let's get
back to some device news with some
announcements that were made at IDF in
San Francisco not to be left behind all
of the Haswell power notebooks that have
been coming out intel has announced a
bunch of new Chromebooks offerings from
toshiba acer with its own chromebox and
HP were hinted at though a lack of talk
regarding pricing suggests that they
might be more premium devices than once
hitting the original Chromebook low
price point we will learn more about
what these updated chrome devices offer
but with the new processors we can
expect them to have much better Barry
life without sacrificing performance and
finally we end on HTC who's a larger
version of their flagship device should
be coming out pretty soon with a bunch
of other company is coming out with
their own huge versions of their
flagship devices HTC hopes that the one
max will be taking the one line to
another level evleaks was the first to
put word out that the one max is on its
way and could be headed to sprint the
rumor mill kept going as two shots of
the new device leaked at least showing
us how much bigger than one max will be
from its originator with 5.9 inches in
its display it will come with the
Snapdragon 800 and HTC's additions like
the ultra pixels and blinkfeed but if
you look closely the one max as a small
area on its back that looks like a
fingerprint reader looks like it's going
to be a returning trend and so there you
