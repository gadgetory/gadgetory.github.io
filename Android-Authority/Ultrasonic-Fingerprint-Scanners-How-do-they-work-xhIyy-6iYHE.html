domain.com do you ever have that
nightmare where someone cuts off your
thumb uses it to get into your phone and
then has access to your clash of Clan
gems while qualcomm feels your pain
let's take a look at Qualcomm sense ID
ultrasonic fingerprint scanner and see
how this technology works and what sort
of advantages it has to offer over
current fingerprint scanning
technologies on the market to actually
capture the details of a fingerprint the
hardware consists of both a transmitter
and a receiver an ultrasonic pulse is
transmitted against the finger that is
placed over the scanner some of this
pulse is absorbed and some of it is
bounced back to the sensor depending on
the ridges pores and other details that
are unique to each fingerprint there
isn't a microphone listening for
returning signals instead there's a
sensor that can detect mechanical stress
that is used to calculate the intensity
of returning ultrasonic pulses at
different points on the scanner scanning
for longer periods of time allows for
additional depth data to be captured
resulting in a highly detailed of 3d
reproduction of the scanned fingerprint
now this is considerably different even
the best capacitative fingerprint
scanners on the market at the moment
which are only able to reproduce 2d
images 3d details are much more
difficult to forge or fool than 2d
versions of the technology potentially
making the ultrasonic system much more
secure another added perk of this
technology is that it allows the
fingerprint scanner to still operate
through thin materials such as a
smartphone case built from glass
aluminum or plastic therefore the
scanner can be embedded under the case
allowing for a more discreet look now
when it comes to security Qualcomm
secure MSM architecture in its
Snapdragon processor provides additional
protection by a separate execution
environment that is kept away from the
rest of the high-level operating system
secure MSM is traditionally used to
handle cryptographic and other sensitive
bits of data this way important user
security information is kept secure on
its own piece of hardware and in a
separate software bubble away from
potential malicious bits of code
Qualcomm sense ID also supports Fido or
fast identity online
Alliance protocols which can be used for
online password less authentication
without transferring any of the
confidential fingerprint information to
the cloud or through networks that can
be compromised now to unpack that for
you that just means you'd be able to log
into certain apps or websites by simply
using your fingerprint scanner and not
having to type in your password with
your two little thumbs pretty cool this
is very geeky but very exciting it
allows us to make our devices much more
secure
I hope Qualcomm can market this in an
effective way just say that it's way
more secure than first generation
fingerprint scanners instead of going
into all the techy details what do you
guys think would that be a
distinguishing feature for you to buy a
phone if it had you know Qualcomm sense
ID would be for me what do you guys
think let me know in the comments below
so do you guys remember from like 15
years ago when people were making money
hand over fist in the dot-com bubble
remember we didn't call it a dotnet
bubble or dot org bubble we didn't call
them dot biz billionaires we called them
dot-com billionaires because that's the
power of a dot-com now why is that
because no domain name extension tells
your story with the same degree of trust
as a dot-com or dotnet domain name.com
and dotnet domain name extensions and
jet credibility into your online
presence save fifteen percent on domain

out when you think domain names think
domain.com thanks for watching edward
army my name is Jace just a quick
reminder that yes I still am taking uh
you know thanks for watching Edward army
my name is Jace I'm still sick I know
forgive the voice but I wanted to say
that I still am taking domain name
suggestions via Twitter or in the
comments below
Twitter's usually best because I follow
that all the time and I will announce
that at the next domain.com show alright
good stuff don't want to forget about my
brothers and sister and Android who are
working super hard to be your source for
all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
