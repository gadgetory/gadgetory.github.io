Jase and this is where we try and answer
your most pressing Android questions but
sometimes you don't even know what
questions to ask because you don't even
know what's possible with our beloved
Android so this is the hidden secrets of
Android you know with the secret to
happiness is Wi-Fi everywhere but sadly
there's not Wi-Fi everywhere and that's
where the first hidden secret of Android
comes in and it's all about google maps
offline with Google Maps for Android you
can select and download a specific area
on the map the downloaded section can be
used in places that have limited or no
internet connection and on devices that
don't have a data plan if you don't have
an unlimited data plan using an offline
map will save you the cost of accessing
Google Maps on a mobile network to
create an offline app enter Google Maps
for Android and display your desired map
on the screen as of July 11th 2013 there
is a button that says make this map
available offline to simplify the
process the estimated size of the area
in your map will appear on the screen if
it is too large you will be asked to
choose a smaller area you can store up
to six maps on your device now the
second secret is 4G versus 3G many of
today's devices run on the 4G network
unfortunately 4G coverage is often
spotty and using it can quickly drain
your phone's battery and put you over
your monthly data allowance you may want
to use the 4G network only in a well
covered area or switch to 3G when you're
running low on power
Android makes this easy to do to switch
networks simply go to settings mobile
networks then network mode and set your
phone to CDMA only now be warned that
these settings may vary depending on the
network that you're on now the third
hidden feature applies to those using
KitKat and their camera raw and burst
shooting are now included in androids
hardware abstraction layer which is part
of the software that talks to the
phone's actual hardware the Nexus 5
androids most cutting-edge phone showing
off the very latest software makes use
of this burst mode but not to take a
sequence of shots in quick
succession as you might expect from the
name instead the quick burst of shots
captured different levels of exposure
and combined into one picture with a
high dynamic range so are you one of
those people who long for the stock
Android experience but can't afford to
buy a new Nexus phone well this is for
you you don't have to buy a new Nexus
phone and you don't necessarily have to
route your phone you can get a similar
result by installing the KK launcher
from the Google Play Store or
alternatively you can download the apk
file of the Google Experience interface
yourself it's available from Android
police before you install however make
sure third-party apps are switched on in
the settings menu
Android blocks third-party installs as a
standard alright thanks for watching
android army my name is Jase love to
connect with you right here on Google+
or Twitter but I'm just gonna get right
to it just gonna give you the clue here
is the clue are you ready just to recap
the question was what is the next big
leap forward in the world of mobile
technology I mean not just Android but
what is going to blow everyone away and
just change everything just like the way
mobile phones or smartphones did you
know seven eight years ago so here's the
clue are you ready I think one big
component to the next big leap forward
is just to do away with a phone
altogether
think about that one I'll see you later
on Android Q&amp;amp;A</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
