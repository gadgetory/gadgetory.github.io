so it seems like just yesterday that
Google announced two new Google home
speakers the mini and the Mac's but that
was actually way back in September of
2017 we were completely different people
back then
now that the Mac's is finally available
we can actually answer the question that
everyone's been asking since the
announcement bucks why would I spend
that on a smart speaker why can't I just
get the $49 whole mini and call it a day
is the whole Mac's really that much
better well that's what I'm here to
answer so this is the Google home X I
know pretty right it's clear that Google
put a little more thought into the
aesthetics of the speaker the overall
design is super minimalist with no
buttons to speak of only a mute switch
on the back and a touch sensitive
control panel up top designated by a
thin line whether I have the speaker in
the kitchen or on top of a bookshelf in
my living room and blend it in perfectly
it just became the thing that I can
forget about and tell to play music or
ask questions and this was the white
version if you get the all black color
you'll get an even more discreet speaker
so at eleven point seven pounds the
speaker isn't light so if you were
hoping to throw this in your backpack on
the way to your friend's house think
again pick a spot you like and leave it
there
the dimensions are roughly 13 by 7 point
4 by 6 inches and it's made of the same
kind of hard plastic that you'll find on
the OG Google home and smaller home Mini
the biggest difference in build
materials between them is the fabric
that you'll find on the front of the
home max which is unique to the home
acts not only does it feel good to
scratch but it's what Google calls
acoustically transparent which basically
means it won't interfere with how the
sound waves are coming out of the
speaker along the back below the mute
switch you'll get a power input a USB
type-c input and a 3.5 millimeter input
so yes if you want to plug in your own
gear and make some sick beats with the
speaker you can
now the home max comes with a little
bass pad which sticks to the bottom of
the speaker and because the speaker can
be oriented horizontally or vertically
you will have to pay attention to which
way you place it it has to be placed so
that the touch controls I either on top
or on the right side otherwise you might
get this warning that it's upside down
by the way the Google home is upside
down it'll work best if you turn it over
that touch-sensitive strip is basically
used for playback controls if you don't
feel like using your voice you can swipe
to adjust volume and tap to pause or
play but unfortunately you'll still have
to ask Google to skip to the next song
or return to a previous one so I'd note
while I'm on the subject I don't know if
I have it setup wrong or something but
every time I tell the Google home max to
put a song and repeat it straight up
lies to me it says that the song is on
repeat but then when the song finishes
it'll just go on playing the next song
so along with chromecast built-in and
Wi-Fi the Google home max has bluetooth
4.2 built into it so if a friend comes
over and you don't feel like sharing
your Wi-Fi password for whatever reason
they can still connect to the speaker
and play music now if you've ever owned
the Google home product before the main
way you're supposed to interact with it
is with your voice and in that respect
there's not much new here you can also
ask it questions or control compatible
smart home devices if you haven't one
issue that I didn't really like was that
when I was asking to cast Joe Hindi's
latest upcoming games video it was a bit
slow to show up on my TV but I really
didn't like how someone in the comments
of that video so that no one likes Harry
Potter thumbs up if you know what this
means digging further into the Google
home set up you'll be able to customize
your preferences like your preferred
music streaming service including
Spotify Pandora and of course Google
Play Music or even what kind of news
stories you want to hear at the
beginning of the day now again these are
all technically features that are
available on any of the Google home
speakers so why by the max well one
feature that's unique to the max is the
ability to sync up two of them for a
stereo pair so if you want to drop a
cool $800 on smart speakers you'll have
a pretty badass listening station if
you're looking for more of a multi-room
audio solution you can of course group a
few of these together which I have to
admit is pretty cool with the home max
at the center of the two minis that I
have but one issue that I did find
consistently was that after a certain
volume the microphones in the Google
home max just couldn't pick up my voice
every time I said the hot work
at a hundred percent volume I found
myself literally screaming at it to try
and get it to stop so it made me think
of a super unscientific test basically I
recorded myself saying the hot word hey
Google at a normal speaking voice and
played that clip from a Bluetooth
speaker at distances of 5 10 15 and 20
feet all while the speaker was playing
the song Havana by Camila Cabello at
varying volumes you can see the results
for yourself after I passed 50% volume
it was really hit or miss and compared
to my real life usage I actually thought
these results were pretty good to be
honest there were times where the music
was definitely not louder than 50% and
it still couldn't hear what I was saying
even if I was standing only a few feet
away I don't know what's going on with
these mics but it definitely gets a
little annoying but the best part of the
speaker the reason that you'll probably
want to buy it the reason that it's so
much better than the whole mini and the
reason that I think it's amazing is the
sound quality the Google home max sounds
really good the base notes are
definitely emphasized enough to give
them that mainstream bump that so many
people will appreciate but it stays well
away from beats territory thankfully
Google emphasized those low frequencies
a little too much for my personal taste
but most people will easily enjoy it
because of how well-defined it is in a
song Moon River by Frank ocean the low
e-string is a little too strong for my
taste but it does give the song some
grittiness and never gets in the way of
his vocals in the mid-range which is
what counts
the bass pad also keeps the rumbling of
the speaker from disturbing anything
around it and the whole max has 6
internal microphones to detect in
real-time how much of its sound waves
are being reflected off nearby surfaces
and then it corrects for that with an EQ
that's built in so you won't need to go
into any eq settings on your own because
the Google algorithm does it for you now
whether that lack of control is a good
or a bad thing is up to you since you
can't really tweak it but I found it to
at least be consistent
wherever the speaker was placed the low
end didn't drastically change those low
end frequencies don't overpower the mids
at all and when paired with how loud
this thing can get it's perfect for
powering your parties that said it
sounded good even when playing music at
low volumes and I ended up using it to
play music in the background throughout
my day vocals in the song generator 2nd
floor by freelance whales we're still
plainly audible even with all of the
other instruments joining in during the
course at around 2 minutes 17 seconds
which included plenty of thumping drums
and bells ringing throughout speaking of
the bells one of my only issues
regarding sound quality it had to do
with the high end frequencies it sounds
like Google played it safe here and
didn't give them the same kind of
emphasis as they did with the lows which
is understandable because when is the
last time you heard someone say drop the
bells and max volume nothing really
distorts which is good but there also
isn't a ton of reverb to high hats and
cymbals which can really help with the
sound stage of the music and I've owned
the Google home basically since it was
released and thanks to Black Friday
sales I have two of the Google home
minis but besides setting timers while
cooking asking it basic math questions
when I'm feeling lazy or setting alarms
I never found any of them particularly
useful I definitely don't use them when
listening to music because the sound
quality is mad at best but I found
myself using the Google home max
constantly whether it was just to play
background music while I worked or to
stream YouTube videos to my TV or just
listening to podcasts the home X weaved
its way into my life in a way that none
of the other home speakers have so even
though it's a terrible listener I have
no problem saying that anyone looking
for a smart speaker who values sound
quality will probably really love the
Google home max and a way that I don't
think anyone loved to the other two
Google home products but I guess only
time will tell and that's it for our
