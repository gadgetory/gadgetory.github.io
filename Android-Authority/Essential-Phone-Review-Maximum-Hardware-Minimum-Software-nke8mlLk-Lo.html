when it comes to the smartphone
what exactly is essential well its
structure of agarra what's going on
everybody and this is our full review of
the essential phone at first glance and
first hold it's obvious that the
movement of minimalism is really
coursing through the design of this
device the blocky design does away with
overtures and fancy curves in favor of a
phone that is easy to hold and highly
accessible and the titanium frame with
the ceramic covering it all provides a
heft that makes this phone really feel
premium now the glossy materials are
going to get smudged with fingerprints
quite easily but the sheen and symmetry
definitely help keep the phone I caching
without trying too hard that symmetry is
achieved by the fact that the essential
has basically no branding on it it's as
if the phone is not trying to pick sides
it just simply is the dual camera setup
sits directly opposite the connector
pins providing that symmetry below it is
a fingerprint reader and then pretty
much nothing else a central really did
put their minds to the design of this
device and they have succeeded in making
what might be the cleanest phone we've
seen in recent memory and most of the
reason for that design is because the
whole phone was made with the screen in
mind and to do that they used a quad HD
19 by 10 aspect ratio screen that
sprawls throughout the majority of the
front cut only by a respectable chin and
a small little dip at the top made for
the front-facing camera the feeling of
actually gripping basically an entire
screen hasn't actually gotten old yet
and it's definitely a huge drawing point
for the essential there are a few quirks
to this IPS display however elements
have to reach all the way to the top and
sometimes they don't quite blend in and
in one other case like in snapchat is
actually hard to press certain elements
because the app hasn't adapted to the
kind of screen that the essential
provides but overall using the actual
screen for jumping around the Spartan
software has been great thanks to plenty
of the other essentials that the company
kept in mind the Snapdragon 835 keeps
the phone up-to-date and it includes
four gigabytes of RAM there is no SD
card slot here but 128 gigabytes of
internal storage is standard unlike the
Xiaomi me mix that tried to use bone
induction this phone still has a phone
speaker it's just tucked away in a very
thin slit at the very top and it works
well enough for calls providing good
enough sound and loudness and even has a
notification LED right beside it
unfortunately this beautiful
hardware had to make some sacrifices and
this is where things get iffy look
around the minimalistic build and you'll
notice the main sacrifice the headphone
jack I don't blame anyone for calling
out the name essential for this as the
company opts for a USBC adapter in order
to plug in your favorite wired
headphones or earphones that said the
USBC audio experience is actually above
average this phone can drive headphones
pretty well leading to some of the
fuller and louder experiences that I've
had recently unfortunately this
positivity can't be applied to the
speaker it gets really loud but is
almost piercing at its highest levels I
would be happier with a lower volume
unit that provided a richer sound now
the battery is a 3040 milliamp hour unit
which is kind of standard maybe a little
bit average for a phone of this size and
though my tests were mostly based on
very heavy usage as I used the phone as
a vlogging rig I was able to get three
and a half hours of screen on time
during those really heavy days so with
some frugality I don't see why anyone
wouldn't be able to get another hour of
SOT out of the essential and charging is
easy and quick with a high-quality
braided cable and high wattage output
from the included charger the connector
pins are another facet of the hardware
but we can't really talk too much about
them yet because there are no mods
available the 360 camera is still on its
way and it's at that point that we'll be
able to talk about what could be one of
the better portions of this phone
essential promises that the connector
pins will be made available in future
devices and be backwards compatible so
that is certainly exciting
now speaking of cameras essential made
sure to be part of the pack when it
comes to dual and setups for their first
smartphone attempt they have put
together a RGB and monochrome sensor
combo meanwhile the front-facing camera
is an 8 megapixel shooter that actually
the cords 4k video which is pretty cool
and all of this is supported by a camera
app that is decidedly bare-bones and has
actually been updated three times since
we got our hands on this unit those
updates add in an HDR mode which was
kind of weird and a bit more speed when
taking pictures shooting what the
essential has gotten better in terms of
these shutter to file speed but it does
still have some glaring holes for
example it's still a little bit slow at
changing from the regular lens to the
mono lens and furthermore the update
still don't address the issue that the
camera is still just a little bit too
basic now users will be able to fire up
the camera and start taking pictures
pretty easily but aside from a slow
motion
there's very little else by way of extra
shooting modes or even a manual mode now
this is not a bad thing when the phone
is a good automatic shooter but
unfortunately it kind of falls short
photos from the essentials seems to like
a lot of proper processing as pictures
are rather flat and pale in comparison
to other phones like the Google pixel
dynamic range is lacking even when HDR's
turned on and it's not even HDR auto
pressing HDR for some reason turns the
flash back onto Auto which is again kind
of weird
and while pictures can certainly be
decent in really bright situations it
tapers off pretty quickly as a light
dims colors don't really get a big punch
in or out of HDR which is evident in the
pictures compared to the pixel look at
this photo with the Sun blurring
straight into the lens the essentials
simply doesn't have an answer when HDR's
turned on while the pixel manages to
make the best of a poor scene holding
all the RGB photos aside and just using
the monochromatic sensor leads to very
detailed and dramatic black-and-white
photos but that really wasn't the point
here I even used the essential as my
vlogging camera for a couple of days
while in New York City but you can see
in these clips already that the phone is
a bit flat in its color profile and it
just lacks dynamic range even for video
we are certainly going to get more
updates from essential after all it was
a promise of theirs but if history is
any indication updates don't actually
really make the camera quality that much
better nonetheless we will be there to
report any major changes should they
come for this decidedly average camera
speaking of the promise of software
updates that is one of the main draws of
the essential as a father of Android is
at the helm of this phone it should be
no surprise that the essential trims the
software down to the well bare
essentials anyone that has opined for a
pixel because of the overwhelming
amounts of features baked into other
user interfaces will feel the joy of
simplicity here but I can also see where
that might work users who are not
diehard Android purists after all a lot
of features that might go otherwise
unused and let's say a Samsung or a
Motorola device were conceived for a
reason and when those features actually
work the convenience and usability of
those phones goes up this just isn't the
case for the essential and that's kind
of where the essential really finds
itself in a weird place for 699 dollars
it seems like you're paying for a
beautifully crafted piece of hardware
with very little value added into the
software aside from the fact that it's
well there again this is a polarizing
topic
Android purists are going to view what
is lacking and view that as value which
is fine but that's just the reason why
the essential phone is so interestingly
frustrating the essential is locked in a
tug of war between its software and
hardware both polar opposites of each
other every bit of the hardware the
pleasing screen the high quality build
great specs in the dual camera
effectively reel you in however what is
supposed to drive it all the software
and it fails to truly take advantage of
that excitement you're given carte
blanche to customize the essential with
third-party apps and in the future the
promise of the phone's modularity but
without that effort put in what
essentially seems delectable eventually
reveals itself as decidedly vanilla now
don't get me wrong vanilla is not a bad
flavor but there's a reason why it's
tucked in the corner of the ice cream
cooler it might sound like I'm being a
bit defeatist about this device but it's
because I love using it so much and then
I get really disappointed when I run
into one of the huge stumbling blocks
mainly that camera it's a great first
attempt that makes us excited for what
comes next but of course what comes next
is the modularity and we will be here to
review those once we get our hands on
future mods for the essential phone keep
it tuned to Android authority for more
about the essential phone including some
comparisons more from us because there's
a lot to come here and Android Authority
