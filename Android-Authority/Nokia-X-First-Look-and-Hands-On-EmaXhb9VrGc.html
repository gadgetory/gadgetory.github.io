by bitdefender mobile security hey it's
stressful garfin manager I thought hey
what's going on everybody and yes here
in my hands is the brand new smart phone
from nokia that runs android and
everyone has been asking for android
firm okay a rather to put out an android
smartphone and this is exactly what
we're looking at it may not necessarily
be what you expect but we're going to go
through all of the features and this in
my hand is the nokia X now there is an X
and X plus and I will take a look at the
XL in a little bit but essentially the
ex and the X plus are essentially the
same phone however the X plus has 768
megabytes of RAM while this one right
here is the ridges the X base model at
512 as far as the build quality goes we
have a very very very reminiscent type
of build quality as compared to let's
say the Nokia 928 that I originally
review quite a while ago has a very
blocky design it does sit quite nicely
in the hand especially with this 4 inch
screen right here and the the bill
quality really just kind of exudes nokia
it really is just kind of what you
expect from them if this is the yellow
color of course and as you can see
across all of the various parts of the
phone it's very simplistic we have the
power the power and volume markers right
over here on the right side and it is
pretty easy to hold especially with that
size once one lone back button right
here and that's one thing that you will
notice is different in terms of the
interface of the experience of the phone
because when we turn it on you'll see
that it looks very much like a windows
phone 8
type of OS this is the Metro UI
essentially that has the same aesthetics
and and it is powered by Android but
they did focus on giving it the natural
look so Android is the back end here
that allows you to install android
applications from the Android ecosystem
however what you may know already is
that the nokia X line does not include
Google Play services so you won't be
getting say google play music gmail you
won't be getting any of those here as
far as all of the built-in applications
go as you can really see skype is over
here yes they are going to be Microsoft
centric applications including email and
whatnot and also maps however when it
comes to installing applications here on
the UI it is possible for you to install
third-party applications that tap into
the Android apps and get them installed
onto here as well so those are
definitely possible for applications
like say Instagram and well Facebook is
on here and it is part of the windows
phone ecosystem easily but you will see
a few applications here like let's say
candy crush that is here you have an
Android style power would you write here
so it is possible to get android apps on
here it's just a matter of how you're
going to do it there are a couple ways
including side loading but that's not
necessarily something that Nokia really
academics doing obviously because
they're not really working at Google but
that's perfectly fine what we have here
is the first android-powered device from
Nokia it does look quite nice the UI
it's really up to you whether or not
it's something that you like but it does
look quite organized it's very
simplistic I'll bring down the
notification drop-down you do have the
power widget there the other thing too
as you can see up there is these phones
are dual sim now these phones are going
to come in at very affordable price
points sub 200 around there for the
nokia X and X plus however they will not
be coming to the states as of yet and
we're going to see them probably a
little bit later in the year hopefully
out in more select markets but for now
it's a bit of a limited release at least
for us in the West so this is a quick
look at the nokia X we do not have the X
plus but we're going to take a look at
the XL in just a moment stay tuned to
android authority for all the best
coverage from here at the mobile world
