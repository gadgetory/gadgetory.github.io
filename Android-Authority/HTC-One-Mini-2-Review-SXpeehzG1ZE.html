given the shrink-ray treatment and the
result is at the very least a more
accessible version what gets shrunken
down on the inside is what matters even
further though and in the smaller
version of HTC's hot smartphone we look
at just that
hey it's Joshua regard from Android
authority and this is the HTC One mini -
for the most part you're looking at
quite literally just a smaller version
of the HTC One m8 but key differences
can be cited as reasons why it does not
bear the m8 moniker off the bat you will
notice the size difference this is
definitely a smaller device compared to
many of the flagship devices we have now
but in terms of the actual dimensions
well this phone actually comes more in
line with last year's flagships mostly
because the extra girth at the top and
bottom or will make it a little bit more
comparable to let's say the HTC One m7
the front house is the four point five
inch screen but also has the expected
boom sound speakers at its top and
bottom these are basically what add to
the extra surface area come around the
sides and you'll find one of the main
reasons why this is definitely more a
mini device rather than in EM a plastic
lip goes all the way around the screen
and breaks up the aluminium found on
this device unlike the m8 this phone is
made of aluminium pieced together rather
than made from one complete block so
that border does return here in the
second version of eight the HTC One mini
and while it might be more recognizable
in the silver version which is not the
one I have obviously the black lip on
this gunmetal grey edition blends in a
little bit better than the white one on
the silver edition of both the original
mini and the Mini 2 while the volume
rocker and micro SD card slot are on the
right and the SIM tray are on the left
the power button remains up top as
always undoubtedly the power button on
this edition of the HTC One is a lot
easier to get to because you can just
pinch the phone and just reach up top to
turn on the screen so really just it's
placements is what makes the power
button still just a little bit awkward
at least in my opinion and finally
around the back is the aluminium slab
with a hairline brushed look and feel
characteristic of only the gunmetal grey
edition the polycarbonate black lines
show you where the
phone has been pieced together and the
main glaring difference found here is
the lack of a dual camera a feature left
for the flagship instead handling is the
most refreshing part of any mini device
and especially one compared to current
large smartphones this one doesn't
disappoint
being able to pinch the sides and easily
get up to the power button helps since
the waking gestures are not available in
this version of the HTC One and the
noticeable narrow profile of the phone
is also on hand here as it is easier to
reach the other side of the screen with
your thumb in one hand then on similarly
sized phones like flashes flagships in
the end HTC signature style comes back
once again only this time in a slightly
more miniaturized size and if aluminum
is your deal being able to more easily
handle this version of the HTC One might
be worth the price of admission for you
already a smaller display often leads to
lower resolution and this is definitely
the case here as the 4.5 inch display
comes in at 720p resolution and 326
pixels per inch
while some screen nuts out there might
want higher resolution we've generally
come to the conclusion that 720 is still
very enjoyable and at a smaller screen
size overall the difference is really
not that noticeable Super LCD 2 is the
construction here and it lends itself to
good brightness and colors as well as
good viewing angles text is still more
than workable with the lower pixel
density and in the end provided really
no issues as media consumption is rather
expected obviously with the boomsound
speakers being on the docket I will say
that larger displays tend to be a little
bit more fun for watching videos YouTube
or whatnot but on this device with its
smaller screen it is definitely far from
unbearable it's not often that we see
phones maintain top level processing
packages when shrunken down and that
trend continues in the HTC One mini 2
with the Snapdragon 400 the 1.2
gigahertz quad-core processing package
backed by the audrina 305 an one
gigabyte of RAM now while going really
hard on the gaming for example might
provide a little bit of slow down
general tasks were really no problem on
here thanks to the minimalistic design
of HTC Sense I never doubted the 400 as
the mid-range processor found in the
snapdragon family but I will admit that
I was pleasantly surprised by the
snappiness of the mini for everyday
tasks like playing music taking pictures
doing some navigation and
watching the occasional YouTube video
for example I had no reason to complain
about this phone's performance in the
hardware aspect the one mini does bring
some good extras to the table
we'll get the boom sound speakers out of
the way immediately as I can tell you
they provide a very enjoyable experience
still in comparison with the larger
speakers found on the m8 the sound on
the mini falls in line with its smaller
stature with mostly just a lower level
of volume overall
the general bevy of connections are
available here including NFC but the
sensor suite that allowed for waking the
m8 through gestures does not return here
call quality was also good made even
better if you prefer speakerphone
obviously because of the front-facing
speakers and as far as storage goes 16
gigabytes is what you get here
expandable via microSD cards of up to
128 gigabytes of capacity as far as
battery life goes I found the 2110
milliamp hour unit found in the HTC One
mini to pretty much par for the course I
did a lot of camera shooting I used the
GPS navigation for about an hour and I
played a lot of music and that pretty
much comprised up about four hours a
little bit over that of very heavy usage
and that was able to get the battery
down to about half life once tapered
down to more general usage and back on
Wi-Fi I easily made it to the 9 hour
mark this makes the battery life more or
less average but with power saving modes
on I'm sure you can get through and pass
that 12 hour workday in a pinch the
extreme power saving mode can also save
you when you're down to those single
digit percentages now the camera
situation on the Mini 2 is a bit of a
peculiar case not because it doesn't
have the duo camera of the original
instead of the usual four megapixel
affair you get a more conventional 13
megapixel shooter in this one now before
you sound off on your support of such a
choice in either direction let's talk
about the app which has been somewhat
given the shrink ray treatment while
holding the same general look as at the
m8 s camera app it no longer has the
Zowie camera as well as the Pan 360 mode
keeping only the regular camera with its
various settings and modes the video
recording mode and a selfie front-facing
camera mode there are standard options
available for changing the exposure the
ISO and the white balance but a few
modes like sweeping panorama and HDR are
still available along with live features
off the bat some of you may consider the
higher megapixel count as an obvious
marker of higher quality photos and it
certainly does have its advantages
having larger photos lends to better
cropping and while the noticeable drop
in sharpness can be observed crop still
yielded a pretty usable image text was
rendered with decent crispness though
colors did tend to remain quite vibrant
throughout and dull photos were readily
avoided great photos are certainly
possible with this camera it might not
be the best camera out there but one
thing is clear it is certainly a more
than decent performer so here are some
comparison shots with the ultra pixel
shooter of the m8 low-light performance
did fare much better in the ultra pixel
category which does put a feather in the
m8s cap so in the end while the loss of
detail in crops is more pronounced in
the MH for obvious reasons that makes
this a bit of a toss up better natural
low-light performance on the Big Brother
versus the high resolution pictures of
the Mini as we make it to software we
also find that it is probably the only
place you'll find the most abilities
retained from the original m8 the only
main aspect missing is the ability to
turn on the phone using gestures because
of the lack of that sensor package
underneath but for all intents and
purposes otherwise Sixth Sense is what
comes along here in a smaller screen the
same simplistic design HTC has achieved
well in their operating system helps
make it one of the most accessible
versions of Android of course blinkfeed
is the most important facet of sense and
brings along the simplistic tile design
for all of your news and social media
feeds it is one of the best second
screen second home screen experiences
out there with a curated but very robust
list of sources and a pretty easy way of
customizing the experience to your
liking speaking of customization sense
is also ready for colour changes as the
theme engine will change the colour of
various elements in the interface
primarily to show you what area you're
currently working in the recent apps
screen of HTC style returns as well
showing you your 9 last applications in
the neat grid format and finally after
that the enhancements of Android KitKat
like the quick settings are here and the
familiar though vertically presented app
drawer backs up the classic home screen
experience found to the right of
blinkfeed HTC specific apps also come
along
zowie is built into this device though
this version is not quite ready for
primetime yet nonetheless it will allow
you to share your built zoe's in the
social cloud for friends and public to
enjoy and as always are still in the
built-in gallery where pictures and
videos are created in tonight's packages
complete with music you may not have the
short burst Zowie camera anymore but you
can still build zoe's no problem
so in the end send six brings you one of
the easier to use iterations of Android
made possible by HTC style you get
pretty much anything that you need often
on a monochromatic background but in the
end it prioritizes function over being
eye candy and in the end you also get
the benefit that minimalistic takes on
Android often have the fact that when
you keep it simple you keep it fast
currently we know that the HTC One mini
two will be made available in European
markets in June an early pricing reports
state that it can come in around 500
euros making it a pretty premium price
point we don't know what it looks like
for the states just yet but we want to
be surprised if the price tag was pretty
steep here as well main competitors in
the mini game currently include last
season Sony Xperia z1 compact also found
at a premium price point but sports one
of the most powerful performance
packages available on any smaller device
the Moto line comes to mind as smaller
device offerings though the Moto X is
really the only one that stands as even
close to equal to the Mini 2 with a very
optimized and catered processing package
that has proven reliable for plenty of
users and so there you have it the HTC
One mini to form does lend itself to
function as HTC has created yet another
very attractive aluminum clad device
that comes in at a smaller stature than
its flagship while it might not offer
the same raw power underneath the hood
it is still more than viable for even
somewhat above the average users and a
more conventional 13 megapixel rear
camera despite having its own
limitations has already done its part to
attract a few users on its own still
sporting a more than capable media
consumption experience with the boom
sound speakers and expandable storage
the HTC One mini 2 is yet another
example of how the mini genre of phones
is more than just a fad it's a wholly
viable market for people who know they
don't need the biggest or the baddest to
enjoy the smartphone experience
especially when it still manages to look
this good as always thank you guys very
much for watching and I hope you enjoyed
this review of the HTC One mini 2 there
are plenty of reasons to like this
device not the least of which is its
looks really it is a smaller version of
the m8 both inside and out and it
you want the raw power of course you
have the flagship available but for
plenty of average users out there even
somewhat above-average
this version should work just as well
