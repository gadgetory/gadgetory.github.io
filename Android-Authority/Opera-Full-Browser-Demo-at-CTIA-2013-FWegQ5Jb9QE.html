George of a garfin mandroid Authority
what's going on everybody and I'm here
with opera and a representative I name
of Tatsuki Tatsuki totzke we were we
were debating about that earlier and
they just released opera rather a full a
full released was just done this morning
so we wanted to talk to them and see
what things opera can bring to the table
that other browsers may or may not so
taps Keys gonna give us a bit of a demo
and we're going to talk to him about it
so here we go sure all right well thank
you very much Josh and so let me just
kind of you know go through some of the
new features that we included in the
latest version of opera and and then you
know I also I think it's worse going
through some the existing feature that
is really popular amongst our user base
yeah the first time you launch the
browser you get to speed dial and then
you flick to the left you have a history
and and you click to the right you go to
discover which is a new feature entirely
in up to 14 so what it is is that
basically it's a curated a catalogue of
contents that that will fetching from
the internet because the Internet is
becoming really really big and you know
it's kind of hard to find the content
that you know you might be you know you
might be you might you might enjoy so um
the you know we've got the stop stories
in arts and business entertainment and
science well not so you can kind of
drill down into specific contents and
you get to this the preview mode and
then you know you click through and then
you're going to get to the destination
site so that's the that's the new
functionality and you know what we're
thinking about is that you know maybe
that you have a ten minutes to kill you
know maybe go into a certain station or
something like that on the bus and then
you can basically use a go here instead
of you trying okay you know what do I go
now or you search through things and the
other feature that we included in the
latest version is to download a manager
so you know of course we have had the
download manager but it is a
improved so you can easily sort of a
managed you know the media files and you
know the movies and you know music and
what not the other functionality we
added is the off-road more so I guess
you know you might have tried Opera Mini
which is basically the older rendering
happens on the server side and we we
always had a opera mobile app mini and
opera mobile it's a full browser so the
over rendering happens on the client
side so that you know the website gets
downloaded a new phone and the benefit
of the Opera Mini is that it goes
through our compression server so
basically you know instead of you
downloading entire website over the
radio network we basically do the
compressions on the server side so what
you're downloading to your phone is
typically about twenty percent of the
you know original says the web page and
and so this will basically gives you
snappier experience but also it saves a
lot of data right so if you're on the
free you know prepay you're paying for
the pay-as-you-go for the data or like
you have a care a data plan or something
like that or maybe you're you know
you're on the roaming and you don't
really want to pay a lot of roaming fees
and things like that so this gives you a
great benefit for the user looks okay go
kinda a little bit up drifting off a
little bit about that yeah so I'm so
basically this shows you you know you
can kind of toggle on and off so
basically what it is is that we're
combining the visible most word so the
benefit of OPA meaning is now integrated
into the upper products so you have a
choice of you know not going through the
server if you you know if you don't
worry about the you know the speed or
the cost but if you're on the certain
situations where you know signal string
is not gray you're not getting a Content
downloaded snappy enough then you can
basically turn it on and you can see
here basically the the contents that you
would have downloaded if you didn't have
to offer more is 11.4 megabyte but what
you have actually download is 3.7
megabyte so that gave you a sixty-eight
percent of the data saving yeah so on
so let me just go go back to the other
features one good question the the
discovery area you said it was a curated
list of websites that you can look at
and what not does it take from any
information that you put into the
browser like contextually or is it
really just sort of there a fix to list
for you yeah so right now it's it's
basically a fixed list but you know if
you stir it's basically browsing more
visayas or like your technologies and
things like that it's going to try to
learn a little bit and you know so it's
going to surface more with technology
kind of informations to you rather than
you know maybe at their lifestyle and
things like that you might not be really
interested so if you go to you know
certain specific categories then you
it's going to be always the same content
it's you know whatever that's popular
and then also the the latest with the
current you know get surface on top yeah
so um so some of the new functionality
is also on the speed out so we used of a
bookmark no longer there's a separate
bookmark speed out on bookmark is
combined into single functionality so if
you keep adding things and if you go to
website and if you want to add that to a
bookmark you can do so by just you know
hitting this plus button at the speed
dial and it's going to show up in an SP
dial ok well ok so how about this then
yeah sort of in a nutshell what would
you what would you say to somebody who's
looking for a new browser to use what
makes opera better than the competition
likes a chrome or even even built in
internet browsers on phones right so I
think that as the speed has been always
a for you know that a biggest focus bow
opera has been you know ever since the
company is founded we want to make that
the speedy you know fast web experience
whenever possible so obviously you know
the offeror functionalities and just the
whole user interface that we really
focused on giving the kind of
the perception that people just you know
getting the contents as first as
possible and so that's the first bit and
there also are we really focused around
the net the user interface this time so
the offer has been always about senior
making web accessible from just about
any devices so the you know we've been
you know making web available on
different kind of devices not just smart
phones and pcs for all kinds of
connected devices and so because is that
we have had the architecture that is
highly portable so we can basically port
opera in you no matter you know
basically a few days into just any kind
of devices any kind of platforms
basically whatever the platforms that
you're running you get the same
consistent upper look and feel but this
time we actually adapt it to to Android
native user interface layer so on so we
think that this we think that the latest
user interface is it's just simply
beautiful we think that you know it just
sort of gives you a feeling that is
really solid and you know the the the
devil's and details right you know all
these little details that they think
that that keeps your user that it's you
know you're you're doing in the style
and also the the last thing is the ease
of use that you know we're basically the
web is again you know just there's so
much out there on the web and and
finding and things that you might you
might want to you know what you want to
read on it's kind of getting harder and
harder content escape ability so we we
find this with we implemented discover
feature that makes it easy to find the
content that would be probably you know
you're likely to enjoy so those are the
three things that I think that that sets
us apart from anything else a nice
comprehensive avoid putting it together
you know alright tusky well thank you so
much again where I'm at opera and here
at Pep com mobile focus here at ctia
2013 we'll be right back with more
