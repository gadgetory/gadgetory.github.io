was in 1973 by Motorola in the phone
name was the Dyna Tec 8001 came out it
was a portable phone but still it was
tough to carry so a lot of developers
tried really hard to make that cell
phone become smaller something you can
carry with you no matter where you go
and they succeeded very actually able to
make these cell phones extremely small
but shortly after that people started
using their cell phones for more things
than just making calls
so phones naturally became bigger and
bigger now the question is how big is
too big for a phone how big into the
phone is considered a tablet well today
I'm going to show you guys the biggest
Android phones available we are going to
start off this list with the Samsung
Galaxy Note 3 from a 5.7 inch screen to
his 3 gigabytes of RAM we can easily see
why this is a crowd-pleaser
the display is a super-mo LED 1080p with
386 dpi this phone stream speed in a
great battery life with a Snapdragon 800
processor with a 3200 mAh battery
whether you like TouchWiz or not you
cannot argue it to the fact of what it
adds to Android it has so many
enhancements that you have to respect it
the s-pen is a huge selling point allow
you to write draw move windows annotate
with precision the multi window support
2 is also a winner the camera is a 13
megapixel and it also records in 4k
resolution and Samsung went away with
the normal glossy plastic and went with
a faux leather backing somebody argue
this adds a bit more styling and layer
of functionality to the backing and
other people like myself call it cheese
but regardless Samsung is trying
something different
in pushing the envelope and you have to
respect that the note is known for its
big size but some people may question
how much bigger can Samsung actually go
next up we have one of the most unique
phones that the market has ever seen and
that is the opal in
Opel was a newcomer to the game but they
quickly realize the need for a large
screen phone this phone has a massive
5.9 inches it has a back touch panel
180Â° swivel camera and also peripheral
called the Oakland this is also the
first-ever cyanogen mod phone this is an
edition of this phone that you can
purchase that comes preloaded with CM
and that in itself it's pretty awesome
this device has pretty decent specs with
a Snapdragon 600 processor 1080p screen
with 377 PPI and the swivel camera is a
13 megapixel camera so you can turn the
camera and take a high-resolution photo
from the front and selfies will never be
the same again the back touch panel
allows you to navigate your phone from
the back and this makes the phone easier
to use since the device is so large
itself the massively large phone makes
other phones like the note 3
looks like child's play the Oppo n1
comes unlocked and it can be purchased
through their website Oppo style comm we
can't possibly trade a list of the
largest phones without having the Sony
Xperia Z ultra which is the largest
phone on my list with a 342 PPI 1080p
resolution and a 6 point 4 inch screen
if anything is called a phablet in this
list this is it wearing the Snapdragon
800 processor with a 3050 milliamp
battery and if you've been listening to
this by now you should know this combo
gives great battery life and just like
the z1 s this is running the Sony Xperia
skin and just like all the other newer
Sony smartphones this too is waterproof
Sony decided to use this slate style
device and for something of this size
it's really tough to grip with one hand
the phone weighs in at a whopping seven
point four eight ounces and has a glass
back kind of similar to the Nexus 4
which gives it a great feeling in your
hand but at the same time it may not
withstand a drop this device has 16
gigabytes onboard 2 gigs of RAM and the
internal 330 GPU the back camera is 8
megapixels with image stabilization HDR
and other sony camera enhancements and
also has a two megapixel shooter on the
front this device is not carried in the
United States at all but it can be
finally internationally last but not
least I have for you is the HTC One Maxx
the HTC One Maxx had a quiet release it
snuck into the North American markets in
the fall with Verizon and Sprint the
Snapdragon 600 device has a 5.9 inch
screen with 373 PPI and to me that
screen size is really trading close to a
tablet 2 gigabytes of RAM and it really
shares the same internals as the
standard HTC One with a 4 megapixel
camera and the 320 and rino GPU on the
back it has a fingerprint reader to
unlock the device with just a swipe of
your finger this also doubles as a quick
launch button you can assign it to
launch different applications when you
swipe down the HTC also sports an
aluminum body which gives it an overall
premium feel and oddly enough it has a
quick-release backdoor button on the
side of its body
this phone is available internationally

phablet wrap up as always guys if you
