have yet another phone from Moto's camp
that really tackles the lower price to
your market but we've already had a
pretty good one in the Moto G so how
does it stack up to now what is
considered it's mid tier counterpart
well let's find out because it's Josh
Vergara from Android authority and this
is the Moto e versus the Moto G both
smartphones have very similar aesthetics
especially on the back of the device
we're the only real major difference
seems to be the Moto E's lack of a rear
flash now both devices do employ a soft
touch plastic for their backings however
I will say that the plastic on the Moto
e does feel a little bit less soft if
you will
compared to the one on the Moto G and
also that quality idea does rear its
head again as the buttons on the Moto e
are definitely a lot squishy or compared
to the much meteor and stiffer click
found on the Moto G's by the way out on
the front the Moto e has a smaller 4.3
inch display with slightly thicker
bezels it also lacks a front-facing
camera and has a different speaker
design with a front-facing unit found
within the silver bar on the bottom the
Moto G's back speaker was a point of
contention for a number of consumers who
expressed a desire for a front-facing
iteration luckily Moto listened and
brought it to the Moto e and in terms of
the body size the Moto e is a little bit
thicker but it still weighs roughly the
same as the Moto G and also staying true
to Motorola's motif of customization
that backs on either device in this case
the Moto e is what I'm holding will be
replaceable with what are called
Motorola shells and they will come in a
bunch of different colors and I also
will say that the Moto is backing is
slightly easier to remove than it was
from the Moto G so for such a low cost
the Moto G was actually very durable but
the Moto e continues that with a display
protected by Gorilla Glass 3 and also an
anti-smudge coating the entire handset
also has a small advantage here thanks
to its splash resistance design achieved
by adding a p2i coating moving on to the
screens the Moto G features a 4.5 inch
display with the resolution of 1280 by
720 and 326 pixels per inch
now while the Moto E's display is an ear
as good as that it's 4.3 inch qHD now
that's 540 by 960 resolution is still
one of the best in its class as it comes
in with 256 pixels per inch
whereas 720p resolution in the Moto G's
display certainly does well in common
media situations the lower resolution
and the size of the Moto e display will
simply only get the job done in the
overall viewing experience if you're
looking for a little bit more out of
your general viewing experience then you
might want to consider the Moto G in
this particular case as we move on to
performance we find that the Moto e
features a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core
Snapdragon 200 with the audrina 302 and
1 gigabyte of ram but in contrast the
Moto G offers a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core
Snapdragon 400 and the audrina 305
instead now the Moto e may actually be
the first place that we've seen the
Snapdragon 200 and if you felt the 400
was only decent in performance then you
knock it down a peg and you can pretty
much get the idea of what the
performance is like on the Moto e while
the Moto G's processing package is
certainly stronger both of these devices
should provide a decent overall
experience that is considerably above
anything else in their respective
pricing classes and when it comes to
basic use such as flipping through apps
and loading webpages the Moto e really
isn't that noticeably slower than the
Moto G but when it comes to heavier apps
and multitasking we suspect the Moto e
will probably find itself struggling a
bit more than its slightly bigger
brother both handsets take a no-frills
approach to hardware and it is the
reason why both are able to be priced so
aggressively the Moto G has a nineteen
eighty million hour battery that they
say can deliver all-day life considering
the smaller lower resolution display
along with the lower spec processor the
handset should offer at least a
comparable experience and likely more
when compared to the 2070 milliamp-hour
battery found in the Moto G when it
comes to the sound experience the Moto e
does get a little bit of a nudge in the
right direction here considering that
the rear facing speaker of the Moto G
does get covered up when you have the
phone down on a table or really when
your hand is covering it
moto did listen and put a front facing
speaker on the Moto e but with that
being said it's not necessarily a very
spectacular performer it really does
just get the job done
but having that speaker up front is a
bit of an enhancement and is a feather
in the cap of the Moto e and while a
version of the Moto G capable of LTE
connections is coming both of the phones
that I'm using in this comparison stick
to HSDPA connectivity though the Moto e
has just four gigabytes of storage
versus the Moto G's 8 or 16 gigabyte
options the Moto e does hold an
advantage here over the original thanks
to its microSD card slot affording it up
to 32 gigabytes of additional storage
now like the Moto G the Moto e features
a 5 megapixel camera on the rear the big
difference in this case however is that
the Moto e ditches the LED flash in
order to keep the costs low the Moto e
also lacks a front-facing camera while
the Moto G does offer that in 1.3
megapixels the camera app is essentially
the same as the Moto G offering things
like auto HDR easy focus and some
exposure controls now the picture
quality on either lower tiered offering
will be very exceptional as is what we
will kind of expect here but Moto did
make it clear that the 5 megapixel
optics of the Moto e have been optimized
as much as possible to provide a
reliable experience despite its space in
the lower-priced market and finally in
software like with the Moto G and the
Moto X before it you do get a version of
Android in the Moto e that is in near
stock in many ways of course there are a
handful of special motorola apps such as
the motorola assist for intelligent
control options and the Motorola
migrated for making the move from an
older device the Moto e does bring at
least one new software feature that
doesn't currently exist on the Moto G
called Motorola alerts this app is
designed to make it easy to share your
location with friends and family or when
leaving places essentially on both of
these devices you get a version of
Android that is about a stock life as it
can get without buying a nexus and with
the promise of future updates at least
to the next version of Android these two
devices right here are probably the
easiest entry points for anybody out
there looking for the best
Android experience at a budget price and
so their habits while the 129 unlocked
price of the Moto e is definitely its
biggest selling point the Moto G isn't
much more expensive at $179 but does
that mean you should be going for the
Moto e well that remains to be seen
considering what you wouldn't
out of your smartphone paying the
premium for the Moto G does get you a
better screen resolution and a faster
processing package on the other hand
modo learned a couple lessons and put a
front facing speaker and expandable
storage on the Moto e but such features
may pale in comparison to what makes the
Moto G a more premium offering what is
clear in this comparison is that if you
know anybody that still hasn't made the
leap to smartphones just yet well moto
has their back with highly accessible
highly affordable offerings of Android
that are fit for any budget and so there
you have it for this comparison of the
Moto e and the Moto G given that their
price ranges are actually not that far
apart it is a kind of a toss-up for a
lot of you out there if you want the
higher resolution of the Moto G and it's
slightly better processing package then
you can obviously go for that and also
the version of it that is capable of LTE
connectivity might be more enticing to
you but if you really just want a
bare-bones very core experience that is
reliable and should be able to give you
a nice experience either way you should
be able to go for the Moto e and it will
not break your bank so keep it tuned to
