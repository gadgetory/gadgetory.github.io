everyone has a lot of thoughts on the
Galaxy s7 and the LG g5 but instead of
making them talk for a long long time
about it i'm going to give everybody 20
seconds to tell me what they think about
the s7 and the g5 now i love the galaxy
s7 edge not the guy g7 the galaxy s7
that feels a bit boring the s7 edge is
better and the main main main main main
reason is because the s6 s6 edge last
year were a nice design but you know no
function with the with the s7 edge if
actually almost perfected it they've got
really put everything that we could have
said was wrong with the first version
that's the time right with this one it's
just so boring and uninspiring and I
don't think that it should be given
props for fixing mistakes from the
previous generation having said that
it's a really nice phone and you won't
regret buying it but it's just like the
boring safe boring choice I love the
Galaxy s7 i love the s7 edge more
because it's the perfect size perfect
design it's not sharp anymore all the
pieces just blend together perfectly and
it just feels like the perfect
smartphone out of time mm-hmm i love vs
evans particularly the edge but i think
that the regular 7 is really great at
hand but you get excited about the
camera at 41 points
micron pixels that's my takeaway that's
why I wanted the camera and it's also
what the GS 6 should have been last year
you know st and all that yeah tell me
about the l7 the s7 is not very
different from the s6 this is basically
an evolution of what they've already
done but it's that's not a bad thing the
camera is so much better and it also you
know the waterproofing and the SD card
or some things that have really been
paying points for users so they get it
back otherwise it's a great phone still
one of the message I have to say I love
it I love it I have not been the biggest
fan of Samsung Galaxy devices for a very
long time there's always something I
don't like actually too many things that
I don't like with the s7 edge anyway
gets everything right well not
everything but close enough for me and
it's the first galaxy s flagship that I
actually really really want you everyone
I think 20 seconds is too much time
almost the galaxy s7 itself is not
terribly inspired right so Samsung hit i
think the high-water mark with the s6 it
made the sx-70 s7 edge it's it's fine
it's totally mundane the s7 edge though
is where it's at I mean this is where
Samson is pretty flexing the total power
of their design is
