ladies and gentlemen I'm Joe Hindy the
android authority app guy and welcome
back to this week's Q&amp;amp;A this week we
have a lot of great questions about the
android 4.3 update for the galaxy s4
what the best tablet for a college
student is and a whole lot more so let's
get started britvic asks when will
android 4.3 come out for the samsung
galaxy s4 the official word out of
samsung is the galaxy s3 and the galaxy
s4 will get an update to android 4.3
sometime in October we imagine they're
going to wait until after the note 3
craze dies down because you don't want
to overshadow a device launched with
update news however thanks to carrier is
an other unforeseen delays it could be
later than that so don't take our word
for it 100 percent that's just what
Samsung is telling everybody right now
Heather asks what would you recommend is
the best tablet for a college student
there are many different lists of top
tablets however I am looking for one
tablet that is the best for a college
student as a current college student I
have shared this frustration before and
trying to find a tablet that performs
well but is also cheap because as
college students we're generally very
broke in the Venn diagram of performance
and cost there is only really one right
answer and it is the nexus 7 you can
pick up this year's Nexus 7 for about
three hundred dollars and it does pretty
much everything you needed to do and it
has top-of-the-line specs if you're
extra broke you can probably get last
year's nexus 7 model for about two
hundred dollars or less on sites like
eBay Derek asks hey guys I want to get
the Oppo find 5 can you tell me which
carriers it will be able to run on
according to the spec sheet the Oppo
find 5 is compatible with up to hspa+ 42
on the 850 900 1700 1800 1900 and 20 100
megahertz bands this means you can get
3g and HSPA+ on t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T it's
also worth noting that the phone does
not support LTE so if you're looking for
a device with LTE you may be a little
disappointed it's also worth mentioning
that the oppo and one
recently announced so if you're not a
hundred percent on board with the fine
five just yet it's worth giving that
phone a shot hey you guys so we're going
to be designing a blog really soon it
gives you a sneak peek behind the scenes
view of how android authority does
things and guess what we're going to be
using Squarespace we decided to use

will my evo LTE see the light of day in
this situation day is another update
perhaps descents five and android 4.2
point2 or 4.3 i wish i could say i had
some good news for you but as of right
now there are literally no rumblings
about the evo LTE getting an update
anytime soon there have been rumblings
about the 1x getting an update and if
the 1x gets an update the evo LTE might
also get an update however you need to
look no further than the HTC One S owner
to know how those rumors can turn out
sometimes so keep your fingers crossed
and it could go either way John asks is
there a way to have my HTC One X or any
Android device use atomic time for a
specified website like time gov like a
computer the answer is sort of there are
android applications which will let you
sync to an atomic clock which atomic
clock is totally up to the application
without route you'll be accurate between
1 and 60 seconds and without root it's
pretty much spot on your best bet is to
go to the google play store and search
pitamah clocks to see which apps sync
with which clocks and see if you can
find one that works with the clock that
you need it to work for once again I'm
