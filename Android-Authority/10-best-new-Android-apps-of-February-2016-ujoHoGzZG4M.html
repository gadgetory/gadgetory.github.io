I'm Joe handy the Android authority app
guy it's nearing the end of February
which means it's time to take a look at
the best new Android apps from the last
month
blady browser isn't really a new
application but rather every branding of
an old favorite it used to be called
link bubble before chris lacy sold it a
while back it retains most of the
features it used to have but now also
includes ad blocking tracker protection
and some additional settings it's also
now entirely free with no in-app
purchases it's a fun way to deal with
links quickly and more features are
coming soon the rumor is another browser
application that's been receiving some
big changes lately it now comes with
bubble browsing functionality similar to
brave browser it also allows
applications to open up in chrome custom
tabs even if they don't inherently come
with that functionality of course any
link can be opened in the standard
google chrome if you have that installed
it's a good way to experience chrome
custom tabs and bubble browsing
simultaneously foody is a free camera
application brought to you by the same
people who do the line messaging service
it's a simple camera application with
about two dozen filters designed to make
your food look even better this is
obviously targeted at people who take
copious amounts of pictures of their
food and the app is designed
specifically for those people it's
entirely free with no in-app purchases
and works rather well so it can't hurt
to try it out Forex signals is
essentially what the name says it is
it's a signal service that automatically
sends Forex signals to your trading
account this is an Android app extension
of an existing web application that does
essentially the same thing so if you use
the web edition then all you have to do
is sign into the app version to get
started of course if you have no idea
what any of the words I'm saying means
then you probably can't use this app at
all the pub keyboard preview is a new
keyboard application from Microsoft's
garage project that aims to keep you
typing where you're typing instead of
having to switch applications for
instance there is a context button on
the keyboard that will fish out names
and phone numbers so you don't have to
leave what you're doing to go find it
hub keyboard also has office 365 support
translation support and a lot more it is
new and it does have some issues but
this keyboard has a lot of promise
if my shake is an application that was
developed by some people over at the
University of Berkeley the idea behind
this application is that it can sense
vibrations and then let you know how
strong they are this is primarily meant
as an earthquake measuring application
which means it could potentially be
useful pretty much anywhere that has
earthquakes it's completely free to use
has logs including safety tips and a
whole lot more if you live in an
earthquake prone area you should
probably give this a shot the promo
codes is a unique application that
allows developers to use their promo
codes as advertising opportunities for
consumers you download the application
and then once every 12 hours you check
and see if you've won a promo code if
you have you've won a free application
or at least some in-app purchases inside
of an application if not you're still
shown the application and you can try
again in 12 hours it's a fun way to
check out some fun new apps and
potentially even get some free ones /
keyboard is a new keyboard application
that combines an old idea with a new
concept with this idea you can type a
slash symbol and then get access to a
bunch of information from various apps
for instance you can type slash jiffy
puppies and get a quick chip of some
dogs or slash Maps Times Square to get
directions to Times Square it's a fun
premise and comes with support for a
variety of services including Spotify
YouTube Google Maps jiffy Google search
and a lot more spritely is another
application that came out of the
Microsoft garage project this month this
one is a content creation tool that you
can use to create stuff for yourself or
your business it's a fairly simple
application that really just creates
fancy looking graphics for social media
sharing but it can be useful for many
different reasons
it also looks nice works well and it's
entirely free to use Sundance VR is a VR
video application that has some good
little clips of VR stuff for you to
watch with your compatible device the
selection isn't too great just yet but
we expect more content to be added over
time and really the only complaint about
this application from users is that it
doesn't have a lot of content just yet
even so it's a fun little app to use if
you have access to VR and it could be
worth a little more later when the
application gets more content once again
I'm Jill Hindy the Android authority app
