authority what's going on everybody and
we're looking at the samsung galaxy
grand kind of in a nutshell this is a
5-inch phone which is somewhere in
between the samsung galaxy s3 which you
see the design is very much the same as
well but also the notes which is a
smaller than note so somewhere in the
middle there with a 5-inch display
however it does have to be considered
last year's specifications underneath or
the 1.2 gigs dual-core processor one
gigabyte of ram you and still pretty
good performance as you could probably
see you all here so you're still going
to be getting pretty good performance on
here but it is far from the tough
devices in the market right now that
would all be by more used to so put onto
the back over here just kind of taking a
look at the design bill there is a
silver lining around the edge around
here so there is a nice premium design
to this galaxy brand however will you it
takes a lot from the galaxy s3 so the
design kind of it really mimics thank
you a megapixel camera on the back over
here and a 2100 milliamp hour battery
underneath so there is quite a lot of
battery power inside of this fear galaxy
grand inside of this device but
essentially what you're getting here is
a mid-range phone for a more affordable
price ah that is capable of a lot that
the samsung galaxy s3 was capable of the
way a slightly larger spain different
however so now you are looking at lesser
specs there the top of your head great
and if one good thing to mention on here
though is that the galaxy game is
capable of dual SIM cards doses over
here so for all of you heavy
communicators out there this is
definitely
might appeal to you so that you can have
ansible functionality in terms of your
connectivity with your leave so that's
just a really quick look at the samsung
galaxy ground one of these lowly phones
gulps in my leg and now just right here
samsung booth at mwc it's the final day
of the mobile world congress in
barcelona spain and we're working to
bring you all the videos possible from
everything that you see here on the
trade show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
