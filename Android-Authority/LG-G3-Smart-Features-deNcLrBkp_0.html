brought to you by the LG g3 hey what is
going on guys lon here from Android
authority and LG's new slogan for the g3
is simple is the new smart and for good
reason because the g3 comes packed with
a lot of new features that LG likes to
call smart features so today we're going
to be taking a look at some of them and
how they all work all right so let's get
right into it starting off with smart
notice and it's sort of like Google now
in a way but it's actually a widget that
lives on your home screen and over time
it will learn your usage and habits and
make recommendations or give you
information that it thinks might be
important to you so it can suggest
things like new contacts that you should
add to your phone if it sees a number
that you interact with a lot but you've
yet to save that particular number it
can also give you reminders to call
people back if you've had any missed
calls birthday notifications low battery
info tips on how to use your phone
exercise updates and weather suggestions
like bringing an umbrella if it's going
to rain feature number two is the all
new smart keyboard and what makes this
keyboard so smart is one its resizable
which you don't really see on mini
keyboards and to correcting a typo is as
easy as swiping left to right on the
spacebar to get the cursor exactly where
you want it to be so no more having to
constantly tap on a word and hoping the
cursor eventually lands in the right
spot and the third reason why this
keyboard is considered a smart keyboard
is that it learns from your typing
habits words you use most commonly and
makes the appropriate adjustments what
makes the LG keyboard different though
is that it also observes the way you hit
keys so if it sees that you constantly
hit the wrong letter on a particular
word that you type a lot it will make an
adjustment for that you won't actually
notice the adjustment happened but
you'll eventually see that you're no
longer making the same typos even if
you're still hitting the wrong key next
up is smart cleaning and typically with
most Android phones you have to download
a third-party cleaning application but
with the LG g3 it's built directly into
the settings and what smart cleaning
it'll get rid of any temporary or
downloaded files you have on your phone
it'll also detect any applications that
you haven't used in a long time and you
go through and uninstall them all at
once so it's very quick and easy a lot
faster than individually uninstalling
each app one by one you can also set a
notification to remind you to clean your
phone periodically so you never forget
and it's great for keeping your phone
nice and clean of any junk files that
not only take up space but potentially
slow your phone down over time feature
number four is smart screen and this one
is relatively straightforward if you
ever get annoyed that the screen dims or
times out when you're in the middle of
reading something smart screen is a
feature that will remedy that so even if
your phone has hit the screen timeout
period as long as your g3 detects that
you're still looking at the screen it'll
keep the screen illuminated so you never
have to deal with the screen dimming or
timing out at times when you don't want
it to and last but not least we have
smart security what their smart phones
carrying so much of our personal data
security is becoming more and more
important so at smart security you have
a content lock and this basically allows
you to set a password or pattern to lock
away any images in your gallery that you
don't want anyone to see so if someone
was snooping through your phone they
wouldn't be able to see these files
unless they knew what your lock pattern
or password was once you've designated
your lock you just go into your gallery
and select the files you want locked
away and it will not be visible to
anyone but yourself but there you have
it for these smart features on the LG g3
