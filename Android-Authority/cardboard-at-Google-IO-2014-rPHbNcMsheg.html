during the keynotes
something that I've just got my hands on
a little few minutes ago is hashtag
keyboard and as you can see right here
we have the keyboard available and I've
seen a lot of people walking around with
it already having it constructed and
using it a certain way I kind of got a
little bit of a wind of exactly what
it's supposed to be too and I haven't
really tested it out myself because
after all the first thing I got to do is
construct it and that's what I'm just
what to do right now we're gonna see how
long it takes me to construct this
little piece right here because there is
a booth at the third floor that they
have people there who will show you how
to put it together if you just can't
figure it out yourself basically I'm
challenging myself to not have to go
over there and need them to put it
together for me so let's see what
happens it's almost like a FedEx package
or they have the little thing right
there and let's open it up alright so
there is what it should essentially look
like and down here we have the parts
that are supposed to be used so I'm
going to attach those because it says
detach here and let's take a look so
and start here to assemble insert the
numbered tabs into the corresponding
slots
and then it oak rose and there you go it
only took me about a minute or so to be
wall to get started but there it is now
what we're looking at here is you have
these little eye holes right here so
kind of these are of goggles and I'm not
gonna put them on right now because what
you're supposed to do is right here on
the bottom there's a QR code and you're
supposed to download an application that
will then be what you look at when we
insert the phone into this area right
here
I hope my phone will work in this regard
because I'm using the oneplus one right
now hopefully it's not too big for this
right here but let's go ahead and
download the app while I was waiting I
just thought I would try and see if the
oneplus one was going to fit into the
cardboard here and the answer is no but
from what I can tell I should be able to
still look through it when the time
comes I still have quite a few minutes
left to be downloading that application
but yeah a little bit of comedy there
for you you can see it coming out of the
sides right there alright and here we go
we have the app finally installed let's
go ahead and take a look at it
presentation at the top there
there you go alright so here we are
taking a look at it you say put on the
viewer right there so let's go ahead and
put the phone in as it tells us to and
let's see what it comes up I probably
look really ridiculous right now but
essentially what you're getting here is
a line of applications that will allow
you to pick something there's this
little magnet right here that you bring
down and flick back up and that's what
selects the thing so essentially what is
happening here is it's giving you
perspective and being able to look
through this cardboard allows you to
look through various parts of the item
that is in front of you for example what
is on the screen right now using the
sensors on the phone it'll be able to
show you around this item that you're
seeing here and it shows you in quite a
bit of depth the actual item itself
we're putting it into this little
apparatus right here allows you a little
bit a little bit better look at it very
3d look here and you actually have the
the full depth at 3d would allow you so
that's kind of what you see let's take a
look at Street View
Shriya comes up and there you go oh
we've got a 3d view of everything I can
really like move around and see
everything around me this looks like it
doesn't look like San Francisco it is it
is haven't just already so you have a
street view basically here's what it
looks like on the phone and basically
it's given me a 3d look or in a depth
look I keep trying to say in depth but
there's some real depth to the actual
look once you if you went through these
glasses right here I'll look at one more
application
there you go Google Earth I'm looking at
a 3d depiction of an area and as I look
around I can actually see everything so
it's a little bit like augmented reality
in that sense but it really is just a
way of looking at all looking at it
through a real sensory type of feel
because what it looks like I'm some kind
of looking around and you can't really
tell what it is because you have to look
at the the goggles I write here so I
think I actually take keep hold of this
for a little bit but it is a very
interesting way of looking at it
something very cheap like a piece of
cardboard with a magnet rubber band
looks like and a couple of pieces of
glass or plastic rather and it looks
like so it's a great way of looking at
various elements of your phone of course
I don't need it only does a few very
particular things but all in all I think
it's a very nice little piece of kit it
allows you to do a couple of interesting
things so keep it tuned to Android
Authority for all the best coverage
including our continuing coverage of
Google i/o which is happening right now
you'll see my videos of the keynote from
earlier and also of the Moto 360 and the
Samsung Gallegly live so keep it tuned
here for even more coverage and having a
little bit of fun with this thing
actually but drop us some like subscribe
to our channel too so you can keep up
