Android ham is just around the corner
now let's talk about the purple speck on
the front-facing camera of the galaxy s6
according to a recent thread on reddit
some Galaxy six owners are seeing a
purple speck on all photos taking with a
front-facing camera it's not exactly
clear why this is happening
though the thread lists numerous people
who have had similar issues some users
who have experienced the same problem
claimed that the issue can be fixed by
switching the front facing cameras
resolution to 3.8 megapixels from the
standard 5 megapixel resolution while
that may be true if you experience the
problem with your handset either Samsung
or your mobile provider will be happy to
send you a new device in exchange for
the defective unit are any of you
experiencing that issue with your s6 I
want to hear about your purple specs in
the comments below next up is that Oppo
has confirmed that the new r7 will sport
a full metal unibody as the company has
explained
besides further increasing the metallic
ratio the Oppo r7 sports a metal unibody
undergoing 48 polishing processes to
retain the original metallic flavor as
well as a curvy and lustrous charm
thus delivering a peerless feel in the
hand a curvy lustrous charm who writes
this stuff in addition to the metallic
unibody the r7 will come with a 2.5 D
glass touchscreen extremely narrow
bezels and will feature a super slim
design something we've come to expect
from the company's our line and more
news on the Xperia c4 otherwise known as
the selfie phone Sony announced the
successor to the quote world's best
smartphone last year the Xperia c3
featuring the same great 5 megapixel
front camera and the experience c4
offers upgrades across the board like

with a 5.5 inch LCD screen that uses
Sony's well known display technologies
including Bravia Engine 2 and super
vivid mode however the c4 is 1080p for
an excellent 400 PPI pixel density

Tech 2 gigabytes ram 16 gigabytes of
internal storage with a card slot
