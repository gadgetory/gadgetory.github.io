Authority what's going on everybody and
I have the privilege of bringing you the
Xperia tablet Z or Zed made by Sony this
really is a remarkable piece of hardware
one of the one of the main things you're
going to notice when you see this tablet
is the size 10.1 inch screen however
even though it is a 10-inch tablet you
have one of the lightest if not the
lightest tablet on the market today at
495 grams and also the one of the
thinnest if not the thinnest at six
point nine millimeters so we're gonna
take a look at some of the software
inside but one thing I can tell you is
that there are a couple of really big
features on here that will please a lot
of tablet owners out there expandable
memory with an SD card slot right under
over here and also a 6,000 milliamp hour
battery which will provide you up to
eight hours of straight usage on this
tablet it's really good feet to have a
lot of tablet a lot of battery power on
a tablet like this that packs a lot of
power inside you have the Snapdragon s4
pro processor which has been able to
power some of the best devices on the
market and this is going to be included
on top of that you have two gigabytes of
RAM and 16 gigabytes of memory onboard
so we're gonna take a look at some of
the software and after that we're gonna
show you one of the other cool features
of the Xperia tablet Z which is its
water-resistant so we're gonna move over
to that real quick all right we're
looking at some of the software aspects
here as you can see it's one of the most
customized Android UI is this tablet is
sporting one of the newer versions of
Android jellybean 4.1.2 so may not be
the most updated but there are still
some of the great features that are
included inside like Google now as you
can see here obviously we're not really
going to use it at the moment but as you
can see the interface around here some
of the elements are on the bottom like
the notification drop-down whether it's
a pop up because it's coming from the
bottom and then the soft keys over here
you also have quick access to a lot of
these small apps that Sony phones I've
become quite know
and just kind of looking through the UI
very very high quality icons probably
high resolution because it's taking
advantage of a 1920 by 1200 resolution
screen it's very very impressive okay
and you know just a quick look at the
screen here pretty good viewing angles
looking very very nice so what we're
going to do then is take a look at the
water resistance that this has because a
lot of Sony phones and now tablets are
coming with a water resistance that
allows it to be used even when submerged
underwater as you can see we have a tank
over here on the side if you look on the
booths here at the Sony area you'll see
that there are always tanks of water all
over the place the back at CES we saw
the Xperia Z phone being dipped into
water and now we get to do it ourselves
which is pretty awesome to be honest so
want to go ahead the screen is still on
as you can see we're not uh we're not
holding any punches here we're gonna
leave it on nice unlock screen right
there and goes right in so as you can
see when it goes into the water
sometimes a register some touches
because there's there's a lot of contact
happening on the screen but nonetheless
if I were to go through I can't do
anything with the screen but it comes
the really cool part take it right out
of there let it drip off a little bit
and what the water is still all over it
as you can see works perfectly it's a
wonderful wonderful feature of this
phone imagine if you were at a table
eating with your family and your little
brother just knocks over a glass of
water it'll still work even after them
just give it a quick wipe down it should
be good to go so that friends was the
Xperia Z I'm sorry Xperia tablet Z or
Zed made by Sony really a very
impressive we're really liking what
we're seeing from here and it's so easy
to hold in one hand really at 495 grams
it's a seriously one of the most nimble
devices that I certainly have ever had
working with so once again is Joshua
Vergara from Android authority and this
is our coverage from the Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona Spain so remember
to subscribe to our Channel and stay
tuned we'll have more coming soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
