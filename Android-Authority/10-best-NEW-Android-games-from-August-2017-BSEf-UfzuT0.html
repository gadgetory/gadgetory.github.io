handy the Android authority app guy and
we're nearing the end of the month which
means it's time to round up the best new
Android games that were released in the
month of August if you want to check out
any of these games for yourself you can
find those links in the video
description below
adventure time run is the latest
adventure time game it's also an
infinite runner in case the title didn't
give it away you'll collect a bunch of
characters and run through a bunch of
levels and the mechanics changed
slightly depending on the level that
helps keep the game feeling a little bit
fresher for a little bit longer
you can also level up characters check
online leaderboards and find various
treasures it's a freemium game through
and through but it's still pretty fun
combat squad is a new online FPS game
and it's about as good as a young mobile
FPS game can be its hallmark features
include online multiplayer players can
do 1v1 5v5 and choose between 7
multiplayer game types the graphics are
unreal engine 4 and it has other
features as well it's not too bad
however it's definitely not quite where
critical ops or modern combat would be
FPS fans should be able to enjoy this
one at least for a little while framed
at 2 is the next title and one of the
better puzzle games in recent memory
each scene in the game is shown in a
variety of panels and your goal is to
arrange the panels to change the outcome
of the story there is a noir themed
simple graphics and a fun premise it
also has a storyline for players to
complete it's an excellent play however
it is suffering from some framerate bugs
that will likely get fixed in a future
updates Kraken land is a new runner and
platformer it features retro style 3d
graphics and an easy premise you'll run
through a bunch of different levels
while overcoming a bunch of different
obstacles you can also wipe out enemies
use various objects and a whole lot more
it also includes a lot of the typical
runner stuff like power-ups leaderboards
and the like it's a freemium platformer
and it plays like one however it can be
fun at least for a little bit peon ista
is different from most other rhythm
games they generally go with high energy
pop electronica or similar music and
this one breaks that mould and goes with
only classical music instead it offers a
variety of songs from a variety of
composers the songs get more difficult
as you progress it also features a 50
stage cam
pain mode three speeds and a lot more it
still needs a little bit of work and the
timing mechanic could be a little bit
better as well still it's not half bad
tales of the Rays is a new mobile RPG
and it follows that trend of RPGs themed
from popular console franchises and
anime
it features action RPG elements and
you'll also get to explore dungeons
collect loot and watch storyline
cutscenes it does have some freemium
elements as well you'll collect
characters and there's a gem system
bandai namco claims that this is a
console level RPG they're not telling
the truth but the game is pretty good
for what it is
titanfall assault is the latest game in
the FPS franchise unfortunately this one
isn't a first-person shooter
this one is a real-time strategy game it
includes card collecting mechanics live
combat with online opponents and a lot
more there are also social features such
as guilds you'll get cards that you can
use in combat to give you a competitive
advantage and you can probably already
see where the freemium part starts to
get a little annoying
the combat mechanics are more
interesting than most games in this
space full of terraeum sky explorers is
a new adventure game two characters want
to learn what happened to their
ancestors and thus they build flying
machines in order to find them your goal
wait to fly around collect various
machine parts and then build your own
flying machine there is actually a
real-life version of this in europa park
in germany and those who make it out
there can try a VR experience as well
it's a neat little game that doesn't
cost a lot to play what had jane says
goes is a new RPG style game from camco
you play as head jane queen of the
underworld unfortunately your minions
are rebelling against you and your goal
is to stop them it features a ton of
levels a crafting system level obstacles
to make things just a little harder and
even achievements there are also cloud
saves for those who need that each level
gets progressively difficult with more
bad guys and you can pick up the game
for free or pay $4.99 both versions of
the game have in-app purchases
what's up Snoopy is a new game from
Cartoon Network it features 10
mini-games with various characters from
the peanuts comic strip
none of the games are particularly
difficult to play you initially play in
story mode and that gives you coins to
unlock games in arcade mode the game is
totally free to download with no in-app
purchases whatsoever adults can probably
beat this game in a couple of hours
it is an excellent game for kids a hand
that about does it for this one folks
don't forget to subscribe to android
authority and ring the bell to get the
latest android authority videos as soon
as we release them all of these games
are linked up in the video description
below in case you want to check any of
them out as always thanks for watching
everybody and have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
