brought to you by godaddy welcome back
to android weekly my name is Jace and I
could talk about a lot of good things
this week like the rumored powerhouse LG
g3 and recent developments surrounding
project ara but all of that would be
dwarfed by the rumor that Google will be
launching a new Nexus device under a
hundred dollars that's the Android geeks
giving birth with excitement mmm that's
right the rumor mill has been piping up
over the weekend surrounding a Nexus
device that is sub $100 now there's no
specification to speak of yet but
unnamed sources claim that this is a low
range device that will have a MediaTek
chipset with one gigabytes of RAM not
too bad this ribbon Nexus device is not
expected to be Google's next flagship
smartphone that has been reserved for
what is dubbed the Nexus 6 but this sub
$100 phone is starting to feel like what
other manufacturers call a mini version
could this be the nexus 6 mini perhaps
move it onto news about the LG g3 this
image was supplied to android authority
by a rock solid source familiar with
LG's plans starting with the name the
photo confirms that the device will
indeed be called LG g3 and that isn't
really surprising but this is the first
confirmation that we know of of the
phone's name last month a user agents
profile on LG's on website suggested
that LG will be launching a qHD display
that's 1440 x 2560 resolution because
that's what we all need more resolution
on smaller screens Josh I love this
review but you have got to trim your
nose hairs but it's not all just
meaningless speck there's also a rumor
that LG will be producing their own
mobile processors LG looks to begin
production of its own range of mobile
processors and according to an LG
spokesperson the company will be mass
producing its own mobile processors soon
but declined to elaborate on exactly
when do you know that one of the first
internet billionaires sold a domain name
that is no longer being used yeah you
know the owner of the Dallas Mavericks
mar
Cuban bought and sold broadcast.com for
more than a billion dollars holy Cripe
makes me wonder what domains I can get
now that might pay off later Apple eats
android.com save Jace's hair fun.com cut
hindi hair fund comm go daddy has
everything you need to put your business
online finding customers and just
generally take but get started by
registering a domain name and creating
your website with Go Daddy's easy-to-use
website builder already have a site keep
it running fast with godaddy web hosting
visit godaddy.com enter promo code and
save thirty percent on new purchases
some limitations applies so see website
for details or alternatively you can use
this promo code and get any new URL for
295 sweet moving on to news about your
own personal kill switch currently many
users have the ability to lock and wipe
their phone remotely should the phone be
lost or stolen but come July 2015 many
more phones will have that capability
Google HTC motorola and samsung joined
the top five US carriers and other
companies like Apple and Microsoft in a
new industry initiative the idea is that
everyone will have the power to protect
the data on their phone and prevent the
phone from being used by someone else if
it is ever stolen of course users will
have the power to restore the device
once they have access to it should they
ever get the phone back moving on a good
news about the new Google camera app the
Google camera app was released to the
Google Play Store the camera app comes
with five modes including panorama mode
photosphere mode regular camera mode
video mode and a new thing called lens
blur mode the regular video and camera
modes are pretty much self-explanatory
but I thought the lens blur mode was
especially cool lensblr mode allows you
to take a picture that keeps the subject
of your photo in focus while making the
background blurry this is a feature
that's very popular with DSLR cameras
but in this mode if the blur is too much
or too little you can adjust the level
of the blur after the photo is taken
make sure to check out Joe handies
review of that app linked up below he
did a great job thanks for watching
android arm
my name is Jace I'd love to connect you
to hear on Google+ or Twitter but this
week I have a question you or from
William sim he asked hey Jace I have a
question what should I do if my phone is
getting slower only do from normal use
so this question or questions like it
are very common so if you want to win
the Android 30 t-shirt please answer
that question the best you can in the
comments below two rules one the answer
must be referenced so William can go and
research that information independently
about his phone and to know trolls no
demeaning don't be nasty please be
mature adults about it the winner or the
person with the best answer i'll choose
later on the week and i will send you a
t-shirt anywhere in the world don't
forget about my brothers in android Joss
Joe in the tech ninja Kevin and Chris
we're glad to have him back I shall see
you next week on Android weekly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
