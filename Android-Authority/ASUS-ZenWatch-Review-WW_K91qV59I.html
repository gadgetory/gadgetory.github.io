Android authority and the number of
Android wear smartwatches on the Google
Play Store has grown quite a bit in the
last couple of months and every OEM sort
of has their own take on what they think
and Android wear Smart Watch should be
including a soos company that I
personally did not expect to see a
SmartWatch from has joined in on the mix
so with that being said let's go ahead
and take a look at the Zen watch a soos
is first Android wear SmartWatch so to
be honest when a soos first unveiled the
Zen watch back at Aoife I wasn't really
all that impressed but now that I've had
the chance to use it for a while I have
to say that as soos did a really nice
job with the design of the watch even
though it's a square watch face they've
managed to make the watch look really
nice by using premium materials you're
looking at a stainless steel
construction for the body and clasp and
the band is made of genuine leather so
not only does it look nice but it feels
very comfortable on the wrist it's also
not very big or heavy the bronze /
oranges color scheme isn't necessarily
my favorite because it's somewhat hard
to match with the rest of your wardrobe
so at least for me it's not exactly an
everyday kind of watch there are a
couple of things though about the design
that I really do like they might sound
minor but I really believe it'll make a
huge difference in the appeal of the
watch one is how easy it is to remove
the watch straps instead of having to
use a tool like you would with most
other Android wear watches on the Zen
watch all you have to do is pull on the
tiny little lever and the strap comes
right off so it's going to be really
easy and quick to put on any watch strap
of your choice - is the metal clasp it
just snaps together on your wrist with a
press so not only does it make it very
quick to put on the watch but unlike the
tug and fastened variety that you get
with the G watch R or the Moto 360 it's
not going to damage the leather strap
over time the only thing that I found
slightly odd about the design is the
power button is placed on the back
making it really hard to get to when
you're wearing it although it shouldn't
pose too much of a problem since there
aren't many instances where you'll need
it except for powering it on
the rest of the hardware on the Zen
watch is pretty standard stuff for an
Android wear watch its ip55 so it's dust
and water resistant and you've got the
usual heart rate monitor and pedometer
built in overall though I would
definitely say the design and build
quality of the Zen watch ranks it up
there with the best of what Android wear
currently has to offer next up is the
display and with the Zen watch you're
looking at a 1.6 3 inch AMOLED display
with 320 by 320 resolution and for a
SmartWatch display it looks pretty good
colors are nice and vibrant viewing
angles are good and it gets pretty
bright so it's easy to see outdoors one
thing I really like about the screen
itself is the fact that there's a slight
curvature to it so when you're swiping
or scrolling your fingers just glide
across the screen so it feels a lot
nicer and more natural to interact with
the bezels on the display however are
extremely thick due to the built-in bio
sensor which we'll talk about a little
bit later but since it's an AMOLED
display you're going to get those really
deep blacks so darker colored watch
faces are going to blend in a lot better
with those bezels taking a look at the
specs design watch is being powered by a
Snapdragon 400 and half a gig of ram
pretty typical specs for an Android wear
watch right now and considering how the
Android wear OS is the same across all
Android wear smartwatches the
performance is on par with any other
Android wear SmartWatch with the
Snapdragon 400 it's fast and responsive
with no lag or drop frames obviously
there aren't a ton of things you can do
on Android wear that is going to stress
the CPU but navigating through the OS
swiping through cards and interacting
with notifications has been a very
smooth experience so there's not a whole
lot to say here about the performance
except that it runs Android wear about
as well as any other wear SmartWatch
with Google not allowing OEMs to skinned
Android wear the overall experience is
pretty much going to be the same from
one wear watch to another so there's
very little that om s can do right now
on the software side to differentiate
themselves but a soos has done what they
can by adding a few custom watch faces
some of them show very useful
information like the date battery life
missed calls weather and your daily
steps a soos has also built a few
applications that integrate
with these and watch the main one being
the Zen watch manager so what the Zen
watch manager you can customize your
watch faces by changing the colors and
the information you want to be displayed
you can also use the Zen watch to unlock
your phone so if your phone sees that
your watch is nearby
it'll bypass the pin or pattern and let
you unlock directly into the phone you
can also cover the watch with your hand
to mute incoming calls or alarms send
out SOS messages to emergency contacts
find your watch with your phone or vice
versa have they watched vibrate if you
stray too far away from your phone and
use it as a flashlight or compass
although it's not really a flashlight
it just illuminates the display of the
Zen watch a solid color so you can use
it as a makeshift flashlight there's a
remote camera application and that lets
you control the camera on your phone
with your watch and you can take a photo
by tapping on the display or simply just
twisting your wrist a soos has also
created a wellness application for
tracking your daily step goals calories
burned and measuring your relaxation and
heart rate with the built-in bio sensor
hidden in the bezels it's a little bit
clunky and cumbersome to have to put two
fingers on the display but it does work
and seems to be fairly accurate finally
let's talk about the battery life so
it's a three hundred and sixty milliamp
hour battery and I would say the battery
life is pretty solid a soos claims that
you will get a day's worth of battery
out of it but I was actually getting at
least two days worth of battery life
even with the always screen on feature
turned on and since this is an AMOLED
display the entire screen isn't lit up
even when it's in its dim state and you
could probably squeeze a little bit of
extra battery life out of it if you use
a watch face with a black background
charging the Zen watch however is a
little bit clunky it doesn't use a dock
or wireless charger instead it uses a
large cradle that kind of reminds me of
the original Galaxy gear it's not the
prettiest or most elegant way of
charging a SmartWatch and it's not going
to look all that great sitting on your
desk but it gets the job done
the ascend watch is available now on the
Google Play Store for two hundred bucks
so it's one of the cheaper options at
least in terms of price when you compare
it to the competition and there you have
it for the asou
Zen watch with the stainless steel
construction the curved display and the
leather watch strap this makes these n
watch one of the more elegant and classy
Android wear watches that we've seen
thus far and the additional Zen watch
specific apps give this watch a lot of
extra functionality the best part is
you're getting all of this for only 200
bucks making these n watch a serious
competitor in the Android wear space as
