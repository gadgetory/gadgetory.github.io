Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 148 and a surprisingly
busy week considering that it's the
middle of the summer so let's get right
into it if anyone was curious about why
third party launchers don't have Google
now integrated directly into them the
creator of nova launcher wrote up a post
this week explaining why the long and
short of it is that Google only allows
integration with system applications
that's why Sony was able to do it with
their built-in launcher regular
applications aren't installed to the
system partition and therefore cannot do
it he is hopeful that the API will be
expanded someday but until then you can
always use gesture controls to directly
open the application Square Enix
Montreal decided to poke some fun at the
naming scheme of Pokemon go and its
similarity to SCS Laura Croft go hit man
go and the upcoming Deus Ex go it's a
goofy little video that shows ash
ketchum punching Pikachu in the face
well played square enix well played with
the release of Pokemon go one of the
most common topics of conversation has
been safety there have been some
unconfirmed reports of people already
getting mugged while wandering into the
wrong part of town and police and fire
departments the world over are reminding
people to stay safe especially while
driving and walking to avoid injury will
join in with that call to safety don't
drive while playing pokemon go it's just
not a good idea snapchat will be
introducing a new feature to the mix
here sometime soon called memories
memories will introduce the ability to
save your snaps and then organize them
this includes a my eyes only section
where you can save your snaps behind a
password to prevent snooping eyes from
seeing it the new feature has rolled out
to select residents in California with a
more widespread release scheduled soon
badland 2 is quickly approaching a
release date on Android and that may not
be the best of news word is that cheetah
mobile makers of clean master have
licensed the game from the makers which
released it on iOS for a cool three
dollars and ninety-nine cents they have
turned it from a pay once game into a
freemium game with energy video ads and
tons of in-app purchases which taker
with the core mechanics of the game this
is depressing and badland tube will
likely not live up to its predecessor at
least not on Android for even more
Android apps and games news really
and updates don't forget to check out
this week's newsletter which is linked
in the video description below you can
sign up for it if you want to on the
written companion which is also linked
in the video description below and we'll
send it to you every Sunday you can also
check out our official application if
you want the news even faster okay folks
let's take a look at the absent games
that made a big splash this week as
usual if you want to check out any of
these apps or games for yourself we'll
have all of those links for you in the
video description below titan quest is
an action RPG that originally came out
on pc in 2006 emu has ported the game to
android in all of its glory and without
hardly any changes the controls have
been translated to touch screens but the
rest of it remains mostly faithful it
features a large open world with over
1,200 items to discover 80 different
creatures to fight a variety of skills
and it boasts a playtime of over 60
hours this is one of the few action RPGs
available that comes with a price tag
and no in-app purchases and that makes
it worth checking out the TV is a new
launcher application that tries to make
things simple you're restricted to two
home screens but one of them is a
universal phone search we can find your
apps games contacts and other
information the idea is that you put the
most important stuff on your regular
home screen and then you use the search
for everything else it's a bit like iOS
minus the Siri integration and it's
great for those who want something dead
simple and easy to use it's also
completely free with no in-app purchases
it's been a long 10 months of waiting
but Square Enix has finally released
final fantasy 7 on Android it features
the full game without any changes to the
storyline or the soundtrack the controls
have obviously been made for
touchscreens and there are some extra
features such as the ability to max out
your characters with just the tap of a
button it's having a rough release since
it's only been tested on a handful of
devices and people didn't read the
warnings before downloading the game we
also wish it had Google Play game
services but Square Enix generally adds
that stuff in later the visor was
officially released to the google play
store this week for those who don't know
this is an application that when paired
with its chrome extension allows you to
mirror your devices to your computer
screen you'll also be able to control it
using your mouse and keyboard it has a
variety of uses from app testing to
presentations you can even play some
games on it but that's not really what
it's useful for the app is free to
download and you can pick up the chrome
extension using the link
the video description below the most
anticipated mobile game of the summer
has been launched Pokemon go went live
this week in several countries including
New Zealand Japan and the United States
in case you've been living under a rock
Pokemon go is an augmented reality
location-based game that was created by
the same people who did ingress the idea
is that you walk around capture Pokemon
battle people at jims and do a bunch of
stuff out in the real world the game
works pretty well so far but there have
been some server issues along with a few
release date bugs once you get into the
game though it's actually pretty fun and
that about does it for this one folks if
you want to keep watching we have
launched review of the xperia x
performance linked up on the screen
there and in the video description below
