Android authority and about a year and a
half ago I had the bright idea to
install the Nexus 7 in the dash of my
FRS fast forward a couple of months and
Google decided to announce Android auto
at i/o and it kind of crushed all of my
dreams and ruined the project for me but
I wasn't gonna let that stop me
now that I have a truck that only comes
with a cassette deck and a six disc
changer I decided I wanted to finish
this project I was gonna install the
tablet in the f-150 so it did this is
how I did it like I said I originally
installed this very Nexus 7 in my car
last year and ultimately removed it to
reinstall the original head unit plus
aftermarket Android auto head units are
starting to pop up which provide just a
sleek and appearance so I'd do this
again why not just go the way of Android
auto and call it a day
well for one Android auto head units are
kind of expensive and my truck doesn't
have a true double tin head unit slot
also because the Nexus 7 fits almost
perfectly into the opening behind the
faceplate and I already had the parts
and they were only collecting more and
more dust the thing is installing a
tablet in your dash doesn't have to be
difficult you can do this in just a few
hours and for relatively cheap around
150 dollars or less if you already have
a nexus 7 laying around here's what
you'll need a small head unit amplifier
this is the most expensive thing I chose
the Alpine KTP 4 v 5u 4 channel power
pack last year because it's cheap and
perfect for the job it also easily fits
inside the dash without any problems
you'll also need a 12 volt socket a 2
port USB charger a fuse tap with a 10
amp fuse all of mine are still connected
from the last install and you can go
check out that video to see more detail
on how everything was connected an RCA 2
3.5 millimeter adapter bluetooth adapter
which is optional I went with bluetooth
so I can connect multiple devices
without having to rip open the dash a
wireless charger a handful of zip ties
and a compatible wiring harness for your
vehicle you'll also need several cables
Weiser's some people prefer to use wire
nuts
some prefer soldering and others choose
the crimp method any will do finding the
appropriate wiring harness for your
vehicle can be either extremely easy or
very cumbersome I just so happen to fall
into the latter group and you will
notice that there will be
tiny differences between your vehicle
and mine all throughout this tutorial
you'll have to do some research and
planning on your own as every car is a
little bit different but for the most
part this is a very easily adaptable
tablet install tools needed our scissors
a small screwdriver wire cutters and
strippers a crimping tool if you have
one needlenose pliers
and potentially some wrenches and a
multimeter depending on your vehicle
first things first
you'll want to find the proper wiring
map for your car there are several great
resources for finding this information
which are all linked below before you do
anything though it's probably best to
open up the - unhook the current radio
and see what you're dealing with
make sure the wiring harness you
purchased matches up perfectly with the
connections inside your dash if not you
have the wrong wiring harness period I
had quite a bit of trouble finding the
proper harness for my truck it turns out
there is very little documentation on
the exact configuration I have and I
ended up having to uninstall the factory
amp and splice the factory wires to make
this work there's a very good chance you
will not have to do this but no promises
if everything matches up you're ready to
start splicing use the color codes on
the wiring harness packaging to match up
the wires from the head unit chances are
they all have the same colors yellow to
yellow for power green for left rear
speaker positive Rheem with black for
left rear or negative you get the idea
once you've connected all the wires
together remove the pins and wires from
the plastic connectors this can usually
be done pretty easily with a small
screwdriver then take the wiring from
your car that you found and repin your
wiring harness to match up with the
wires inside the car left front speaker
positive - left front speaker positive
and so on and so forth
it can be pretty daunting doing this
your first time but it gets easier as
you go this is probably the hardest part
of the whole entire thing I found it
best to cross-reference the color codes
for the picture I took of the wires in
the dash what you'll end up with is a
total mess of wires coming out of your
amp just use a few zip ties to clean it
up before it gets tangled next you're
gonna want to test it out remove the
stereo from your cars - disconnect all
the hookups and attach your new wiring
harness and amp connect the RCA to 3.5
millimeter adapter to the amp input plug
the Bluetooth adapter into this connect
your phone or tablet
to the Bluetooth adapter and play some
music if you're hearing that music
you're doing great
next you will want to wire the new 12
volt socket into the cars internal fuse
box which usually resides underneath the
steering wheel remove the cover
reference your owners manual and find a
10 amp fuse that is only powered when
the key is turned on otherwise your
tablet and Bluetooth adapter will
constantly drain your car's battery even
when it's off to do this first ground
the negative wire from the 12 volt
socket any exposed frame of the car will
- then remove a 10 amp fuse from the
fuse box insert it into one of the empty
slots on your fuse tap insert an
additional 10 F fuse into the fuse tab
plug the fuse tap into the empty slot
plug in the car charger turn the key and
look for any signs of life if the car
charger works with the ignition off look
for another fuse to tab after you found
a fuse you can piggyback off of
permanently ground your 12-volt sockets
negative lead by finding a random screw
and screwing it into the frame somewhere
and find a nice convenient and hidden
location to attach the new power source
I fortunately have a covered panel in my
floor board that's close enough to the
head unit that I can just leave it there
drop the two USB cables from the
wireless charger and the Bluetooth
adapter through the hole in the dash
down to the car charger and plug them in
next look for a place to semi
permanently attach the Bluetooth adapter
I drilled a hole in the side of a small
unused compartment under my steering
wheel and used some velcro to attach the
adapter then you want to do a little
more cable management secure the amp
inside the dash with some zip ties and
attach the wireless charger to the nexus
7 I originally wanted to use velcro for
this but it was too thick and the nexus
wouldn't charge through both sides of
the velcro so I used some double-sided
foam mounting tape instead the final
step is mounting the tablet inside the
dash panel for this I'm using some sugru
which may not be the most polished
option but it is a nice temporary fix
until I can find something more
permanent plus I want to be able to
remove the tablet so I can do upgrades
or tweak it overnight rather than
letting it sit in the truck all the time
sugru makes this possible but I'm still
in search of a better option I remove
the dash and apply it sugru to either
side of the tablet near the bottom let's
sit and reinstall the dash with the
tablet inside my only concern is that
the sugru isn't going to hold firm
enough the tablet seems to move
just slightly when I tap it so I will
definitely need to look into a better
mechanism to secure the tablet but for
now it works and looks fantastic
best of all with the automate beta the
Nexus 7 emulates Android auto perfectly
without sacrificing its true tablet
nature automate also keeps the screen on
when the tablet is charging and closes
when it's not charging in other words if
the truck is on the screen is on when
the truck is turned off the screen goes
off and there you have it a Nexus 7
installed in the dash of my truck just
in time for my road trip on Thursday
that is gonna do it for this Nexus 7 -
