Authority and welcome back to another
episode of camera 360 on this show we
attempt to break down a smartphone
camera in about three minutes time we're
gonna give you the gist of everything
that you need to know while keeping
everything short and sweet we're gonna
talk about the camera app its features
and of course the image quality today
smartphone is the LG G 8 so let's go
ahead and dive right in before we get
started let's quickly go over the camera
specs the LG G 8 has a 12 megapixel
primary shooter at F 1.5 with optical
image stabilization and a 16 megapixel
wide-angle secondary lens the
front-facing shooter is 8 megapixel and
is also paired with a 3d time-of-flight
sensor moving right along the LG G 8 has
a pretty standard camera app the shutter
button is on the bottom and is flanked
by a video recording button and image
preview above these you've got a
rotating set of shooting modes to pick
from with a bunch of extra ones under
the more tab the camera settings can be
accessed in the top left and a few other
settings are lined along the top that
will change depending on which mode
you're in you can switch between the
modes on the bottom by swiping left or
right some camera apps usually let you
switch modes by swiping on the
viewfinder as well but the LG G 8
doesn't do that instead swiping on the
viewfinder regardless of direction
simply flips between the front and rear
cameras it would have been nice if
swiping left or right was reserved for
switching camera modes but minor
complaint aside the app works smoothly
generally most smartphone cameras tend
to perform well in daylight conditions
but in the case of the LG G 8 the camera
had quite a few issues it sometimes was
a little off with white balance in
certain scenes and with shots leaning
towards a very blue or cold color cast
as you can see in a couple of these
examples here exposure is usually pretty
spot-on and photos are crisp but shadows
are a little darker than we'd like
even with Auto HDR turned on HDR is
something we rely on fairly often with
smartphone cameras but the G ace HDR
processing could use some work
you can still wind up with shots that
have a lot of overexposed highlights and
darker areas are underexposed giving you
a lot less detail than you might expect
production from the LGG a is vibrant but
they look a tad artificial and over
processed if the white balance is right
the shots still look pretty attractive
but if the white balance is off well
then you just get an extremely blue
looking image the LGG 8 does its best
with capturing detail when there's
plenty of light you can still see a lot
of texture and detail in the print of
these book pages and if you take a
closer look at these meat kabobs it
retains a lot of detail on the chili
flakes low-light shots do generally look
quite nice with fairly good exposure and
colors remain vibrant it also seems like
the LGG eight favours a much warmer
white balance and darker situations
again you'll really only spot problems
like softening and motion blur when you
look closer but the results are good
given the circumstances the LGG eight
won't knock your socks off with its
selfie photos but it's capable of
grabbing good shots with natural colors
good skin tones and exposure
LG's notification features are on by
default and while you can turn them off
you still get some amount of skin
softening regardless on the video side
of things it's great being able to
record 4k at 60fps which is something
that still isn't available on every
flagship the 60fps makes for a much
smoother looking video but you will be
sacrificing image stabilization when
shooting at these higher settings which
is the biggest downside because of that
you'll get a lot of jitters and shakes
unless you get some sort of stabilizer
like a gimbal over all the LGG eight
produces great imagery but trails behind
some of its competition giving it a
total score of seven point four out of
ten if you want to find out why make
sure to check out the written version
linked in the description below which
covers the camera much more in depth and
provides a more detailed breakdown of
the overall score if you want to see the
full resolution images for yourself
we'll also have that link below as well
thanks for watching and we'll see you
guys in the next episode of camera 360</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
