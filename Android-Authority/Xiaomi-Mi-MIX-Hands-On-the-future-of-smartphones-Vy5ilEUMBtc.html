Authority what's going on everybody and
no your eyes do not deceive you this is
essentially a bezel-less
phone there's only room on the bottom
for some of the technology that still
has to be available in a smartphone but
you're looking at a device that's trying
to be all display all the time and this
is the Jean Mimi mix now there are a
couple of questions to be answered right
off the bat and no there are no parts on
the top of this device everything has
been moved to the bottom including the
front-facing camera which now has a more
downward or rather up facing perspective
because of its location
however the phone's speaker is now found
underneath the screen and it is emoting
sound based upon a ceramic vibration
that is found on the internals and there
are no speaker grilles on the top for
you to lay your ear on but you should
still be able to hear the audio from a
call and finally the proximity sensor is
now sonar based so there's sonar always
firing in the top portion of the device
so it knows when it moves to get close
to your face but of course it's all
about that screen this is a six point
four inch screen and IPS screen that
comes in at a resolution of 2048 n80 now
that's a lot of screen a lot of space to
do a lot of things whether it's work or
play and it's just a sight to behold
this job me really wanted to move
forward into the future with a phone
that hopefully moves to that space where
we're thinking our phones are going to
be all display all the time and the
jhemini mix is of course going to be
very eye-catching because of that
display the rest of the phone also has
some very nice materials to it it's made
completely of ceramic which gives it a
very elegant and very shiny look but
it's also a little bit unwieldy not just
because of the very large size of this
device but also because the ceramic
slips about very easily in the hands
thankfully zsa me included a soft
leather case a very high-quality one
actually that comes with the device
heading provides it with a lot more grip
now the phone itself comes with all of
the different internals of flagship
should have including the Snapdragon 820
one and in the premium version six
gigabytes of RAM however the premium
version does come with 256 gigabytes of
on-board storage which is a
and the less premium version has four
gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes in
either case you should have more than
enough performance and more than enough
storage for everything from your apps to
your photos and videos photos and videos
on the other hand are done with a 16
megapixel main camera with a 5 megapixel
front-facing camera for the most part a
bit of a more conventional camera
package for the mean mix and everything
is powered by a battery that is 4400
milliamp hours large and can be charged
quickly with quick charge 3.0 overall
the experience of using this phone is
something that we really can't wait to
kind of put through its paces and
luckily we do have our hands on a review
unit we will bring you our full review
pretty soon on this device but because
this phone is only going to be made in
small quantities and only made in China
we're only going to be able to bring you
the concept of using this device some of
you out there might be able to import
the phone here in the West but for
anybody out in Asia this phone is only
going to be made available in China so
again this is a concept device that
Johnny hopes will prove very useful in
maybe putting these features in future
devices that are more accessible but
speaking of accessibility this phone is
actually not all that crazily priced for
everything that it is supposed to
provide even 18 karat gold that can be
found in the accents of the fingerprint
reader and the camera optics on the back
for the very premium version it only
comes in at around six hundred and
ninety nine dollars when converted from
R and B and the main reason why we
they're able to keep the price low is
because it's only made in small
quantities so a lot of us may not ever
be able to use this device on the daily
but we will be able to give you our
thoughts on what it's like to have a
foam that is almost all display and if
that is going to be the future Johnny
might be on the forefront of providing
us with this experience that might
become our reality so keep it tuned to
Android 30 for all of the best including
our review coming soon of the me mix and
more from Johnny's event here in Beijing
China because we are your source for all
things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
