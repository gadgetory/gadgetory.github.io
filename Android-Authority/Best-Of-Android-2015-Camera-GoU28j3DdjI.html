everybody always wonders what's the best
phone to buy but here at Android
authority we're taking the guesswork out
of it for this installment of best of
Android 2015 we're taking a look at the
camera which phone takes the best
pictures our very own nerve and Rob went
around taking pictures with six of what
we think are the best Android smartphone
cameras and then all of us here at under
authority took a closer look and voted
on which phone's camera we enjoyed the
most and that's really important because
everybody has their own opinion as to
what makes a good picture is a sharpness
saturation exposure but overall there's
a very clear winner here so let's take a
closer look and see which 2015 Android
smartphone has the best camera let's
take a look
make sure after you're done watching
this part of the best of Android series
to check out the rest here on YouTube or
our website Android authority comm where
we pick the best phones when it comes to
battery display and more let's introduce
the contestants we have the BlackBerry
Prive LG v10 galaxy note 5 droid turbo 2
Nexus 6p and the Sony Xperia z5 premium
now these pictures were all taken in
Auto mode with HDR set to auto however
on the z5 premium auto HDR is always on
so keep that in mind also we shot in a
43 aspect ratio due to the BlackBerry
Prive only allowing 43 aspect ratios and
make sure you're watching this video at
the maximum quality your computer or
internet speeds can handle and make a
full screen to see all those extra
little details let's start with some
daytime shots on an overcast day
overcast days are a little tricky for
cameras due to that very bright white
sky and the darker subjects it creates
but these are the best 2015 Android
cameras so they do a pretty good job at
exposing both so keep these couple
things in mind when determining which
photo is better in your opinion which
has the best exposure sharpness color
temperature and saturation
the main difference you can tell right
off the bat and will be the same for the
rest of these daylight photos is that
the LG v10 Nexus 6p and z5 premium have
a cooler bluish color tone to them while
the blackberry turbo 2 and the no 5 have
a warmer orangish tone so which one's
more realistic well probably the cooler
blue colors but then again which one do
you prefer I mean it's hard to say maybe
a tie with a blackberry and 6p well
let's move on to a similar shot and
really dissect it immediately we can
rule out the Droid turbo 2 it's not
necessarily blurry but it's just very
soft but the z5 premium details are
pretty lacking although the colors are
quite nice the note 5 has a lot of
processing going on including sharpening
which does help in some situations but
with all these small tiles and windows
very far away it does lose some of his
depth
that leaves us with a v10 6p and
Blackberry all look really good the
clouds are better exposed with the
BlackBerry although the color
temperature may not be of preference it
does look very nice though the v10 s
exposes a little more making the clouds
a little brighter and then
using some of them not much shopping
going on as we look at the tiles
creating a very soft image on the 6p our
clouds are better exposed not as much as
the blackberries but still nice and
there is some sharpening going on but
not too much
just the right amount I would say in my
opinion when considering exposure
sharpening and color temperature I'll
pick the 6p as a winner here but it's
still very close with the other two
everything that I just mentioned will
become a theme for the rest of these
daylight images here we have a subject
up-close this statue of something and
the focal point is International Brigade
plaque and as we browse through these
shots you'll notice a lot of
overexposing on the background really
the only phone that manages to do a good
job of keeping the background with the
sky is a z5 premium the colors of the
sky are actually present and these trees
and buildings are exposed very nice the
problem is the actual subject is not as
clear as the other shots and when you're
taking a picture like this the subject
you're shooting is more of a priority
than an evenly exposed background sit
with the droid turbo 2 is to runner up
in terms of exposure but still it's a
very soft and almost blurry image let's
jump to the v10 and see that statue
suddenly becomes a lot sharper and
clearer even with the background
starting to get lost the note 5 looks
similar but it's sharpened a lot almost
too much once again the 6p doesn't have
as nice colors as a v10 although seems a
bit sharper but still is probably one of
the worst exposed photos with that HDR
mode not triggering taking a look at the
blackberry it seems to be the best of
both worlds the trees are exposed better
than the other shots colors are nice and
the subject is quite clear and sharp
without being too sharp the BlackBerry
really looks great here here's the
BlackBerry on a different shot focus
point is a clock big bend in the
distance doesn't seem to be the clearest
here the v10 is miles clearer with
better colors although the droid turbo 2
actually manages to create a sharper
image and here's an o-5 huge color shift
but isn't too bad it's even more sharp
than the turbo 2 and in my opinion once
again maybe just a tad too much
sharpening going on the z5 maybe not
enough and 6p has a lot of sharpening
going on as well almost too much both a
better color temperature and better
exposed image
I think the 6p is a winner here again
let's go in a selfie of our boy here
blackberry is quite fuzzy same with
z5 premium while the droid turbo - isn't
fuzzy is just blurry the 6p looks like
it has some nice detail going on but
seems not to be the best focused image
and here's a no.5 once again huge color
change very very warm and even without
the beauty mode the no.5 seems to really
soften the skin too much that leaves us
with the v10 although not the best
detail I do think it has the best colors
and exposure now let's get into the
low-light shots here's a blackberry
looks alright but then when switching to
the v10 it's not even comparable
although some like flares start to show
up and then you switch to the 6p and
once again the v10 isn't comparable much
better colors and when looking at the
wood much better detail as well the
turbo 2 is OK but loses some color in
detail the note 5 does a good job but
seems a little too foggy almost when
compared to the 6p and a z5 just very
dark the 6p is a clear winner here
here's a low-light shot with something
bright in it and we focus on the light
as you can see the z5 really has trouble
keeping the lyse exposed correctly same
with the turbo 2 and the blackberry does
a good job although the overall image is
quite dark the note 5 looks very good -
although you do have that extra
sharpening which loses details in the
leaves and here's a v10 it looks
fantastic
just the right amount of sharpening so
you can still see the leaves perfectly
but there's still a better picture I
have to show you and that comes from the
Nexus 6p
yeah it's darker but you don't lose
anything in the darkness the lights are
exposed perfectly the detail is
incredible as well I mean this really is
an amazing photo here now let's try
something a little different here I'm
not going to label these so you can
decide for yourself which is a better
image without any given facts here we
have a pitch-black night with the only
lights coming from this carousel we
didn't pick a focal point so it should
default to the actual right itself as
you can see some are blurry and some of
these phones do not have optical image
stabilization which can really make
photo suffer in low-light alright I'm
guessing you probably picked image 4
right yep that was the Nexus 6p now
there is no optical image stabilization
here but the HDR plus feature on the 6p
is fantastic
and when it's on in low-light there
really is no competition with this fire
shot we can get a good idea of how each
camera processes colors and how well
they process motion we focused on the
fire pit with the note 5 being washed
out
the BlackBerry being dark the droid
turbo tubing overexposed and the z5
lacking loss of detail now we're left
with the v10 and the 6p but when we take
a closer look you can really get a lot
more detail with the six PS image here's
one instance where the 6p isn't the
preferred picture this is where we see
all the faults of the six PS lack of
image civilization and we have a bit of
a blurry image and the same can be said
for the Droid turbo to the note 5s
remains study if that crazy color shift
really takes away from the atmosphere of
this area the z5 creates a very nice
image
nice colors in the sky and really
captures the atmosphere the BlackBerry
is very similar it seems a little
sharper and the v10 has a different
color temperature but take a look at the
difference in noise there's a lot less
with the v10 and overall I think the v10
takes the crown here now that we
understand the themes of these cameras
images the pros and the cons let's take
a look at only the best here's a nice
shot with a lot going on a sky lust
lights and a building in the back the
BlackBerry Prive followed by the z5
premium beat out all the others which is
very interesting we're still in
low-light here but this time with a much
more close-up view with such a close-up
image a lot of phones fail to focus
properly in the slow light and with the
subject being words it's important to
make sure the words are clear and once
again the BlackBerry paired made for the
clearest rendering of the words on the
sign with the runner up being the note 5
here's another selfie shot in low-light
and the Nexus 6p was a clear winner here
with tons of detail and nice colors even
the runner-up the droid turbo 2 is way
behind the Nexus 6p in terms of quality
that just shows how tough of a shot this
was to capture all these films are
capable of 4k video but we do have to
say the 6p is the worse it's just way
too dark the note 5 is a close runner-up
with it just not being very sharp at all
the no effects camera without all that
extra sharpening processing makes for a
very soft image no doubt we're going to
give the edge to the LG v10 it looks
fantastic and definitely creates a more
sharper picture colours are very good
too everything is exposed correctly
without being too dark or too bright
when it comes to panorama in daylight
the Nexus 6p is a clear winner with a
turbo to being in dead last due to the
strange grid appearing throughout the
image the 6p pieces together the images
flawlessly while even the runner-up no.5
seems to have
robble creating some uneven subjects
like this pipe here with the same shot
but at night time is almost funny to
look at the z5s attempt while the Nexus
6p destroys every single other shot sure
there's some noise and some parts are a
little blurry but the amount of
brightness and saturation of colors
makes for a beautiful image and here's a
runner-up the LG v10 not even comparable
and that's a great place to end this
comparison all of us here at Android
authority voted and the Nexus 6p was a
clear winner and that's awesome to say
that a Nexus phone has the best camera
on the market right now and this mostly
thanks to his HDR plus mode and not only
takes two shots of different exposures
and pieces them together but it has tons
of post-processing and it doesn't just
write to boost the color and brightness
the no.5 came in second place although
far behind the 6p with the v10 falling
very close after that so these three
phones are definitely the best Android
smartphones that you can pick up if
you're looking for the best camera
alright everybody thanks for watching

smartphone camera is right for you and
