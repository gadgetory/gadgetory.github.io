Android Authority we're here at the s4
launch event in New York at Radio City
Music Hall now what we've got here is
the newly announced Samsung Galaxy s4
and the now kind of old hat Samsung
Galaxy s3 now looking up the - as they
step up basically the Samsung Galaxy s4
is more of everything except for or less
of what you don't want for example it's
lighter than the samsung galaxy s3 and I
believe 130 grams compared to the s3 is
133 grams looking at pluses this runs
Android 4.2.2 whereas the s3 runs 4.1.2
now getting into the hardware we
actually went ahead and ran some
benchmarks to see how the different
processors work how they hold up to each
other now the Samsung Galaxy s4 we're
not sure exactly what processor is in
here but we know that it's a Qualcomm
processor with an arm v7 architecture
and it's clocked at 1.9 gigahertz the
Samsung Galaxy s3 came with two
different chips depending on where you
bought it you either ended up with a
dual-core Snapdragon Plus or a dual core
Exynos depending on which chip you had
the the Exynos for example was clocked
at 1.4 gigahertz and the Snapdragon was
clocked at 1.5 gigahertz now looking at
the benchmarks you can see that in terms
of performance
the s4 blew the s3 away looking at
battery life the s3
had a substantial 2100 milliamp hour
battery but in the s4 that gets an
upgrade as well - 2600 milliamp
looking at the cameras the s4 has a 13
megapixel camera up in the rear and a 2
megapixel camera in the front whereas
the s3 had an 8 megapixel camera looking
at the screens
it's another upgrade in favor of the s4
the s3 had a 720p screen whereas the s4
has a 1080p screen with both of them
being 5 inch displays you're looking at
a dramatic increase in pixel density for
the s4 looking at features at the s4 has
that the s3 doesn't one of the most
impressive is its new hopper touch
feature which if you simply hover above
a gallery or a movie that brings it up
much like pressing the button or
hovering on the s-pen did with any s-pen
enabled devices alright that's about it
for that we're going to keep bringing
you coverage from the s4 launch event we
have even more devices to compare for
you and stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
