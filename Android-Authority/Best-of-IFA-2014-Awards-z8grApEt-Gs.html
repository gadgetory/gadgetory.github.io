help but be intrigued by the Sony Xperia
z3 tablet compact that might be a bit of
a mouthful to say but with this slim
profile this is definitely a tablet that
you should be take pay attention to we
already loved it the larger offering by
Sony in their tablet line but now we
have the 8-inch form factor that is
actually gripple as you can see here in
my hand and it's actually really thin
which makes this one of the slimmest
profiles we've ever seen on the tablet
actually we noticed that any thinner and
there's not going to be any more room
for that silver power button but
underneath you get all the power that
you need and with this 8-inch screen you
the full HD resolution allows for all of
the media video games and text to be
exactly where you need it to be to enjoy
everything that you need now one of the
best parts about this tablet and its
counterparts in the smartphone game is
the fact that you are able to connect to
your playstation 4 and be able to play
games remotely and on a tablet like this
we're sure it's going to be an enjoyable
time and that's the reason why we give
the Sony Xperia z3 tablet compact our
best tablet award for the best of Aoife
2014 when you think about the term of
SmartWatch you get two parts smart or
watch but unfortunately as far as
Android wear goes current currently we
have a lot of watches that really focus
on the smart area and not so much the
watch area but he ready for 2014 you saw
a couple of iterations on the show floor
that really got closer to the watch part
of Smart Watch and that's why we love
them and gave them our award for best
wearable at the best point of Eva 2014
and those are the asustas and watch end
the LG G watch are now the Zen watch is
an iteration from assumes that is very
affordable which is what we love most
about a point well it doesn't have you
perfectly round to a perfectly square
face it still has a nice little curve to
it that makes it really looked like you
would you have taken a analog watch and
giving it a digital life but from there
we also have the LG G watch our and the
G watch our is LG's premium version of
the g watch that has even more girth on
the unit itself that includes a
chronograph that goes around the actual
perfectly round face
and what that face is able to do is
really make it look like a watch that
you would buy at a time p store for
example and gives it a very fashionable
high-fashion look and that that is the
reason why the G watch our along with
the Zen watch have gotten our award for
best wearables here at Aoife 2014
because they include more of the
vegetable watch area without focusing
too hard but still not compromising on
the smart area that's exactly why they
get our words for this year is wearable
at ethan 2014 mid-tier hero that's
exactly what HTC is calling their brand
new handset in the desire line the 820
which continues what we already liked in
the 816 of earlier this year which did
already receive an award for the best
mid-range phone during that event and
now the 820 receives the award for best
mid-range here at Aoife in Berlin 2014
you get a pretty good design on here
that is that feels quite sturdy and a
large screen in order to do whatever you
need on there but the power underneath
that you need in order to perform all
the tasks from here and beyond with a
64-bit processor that will be able to
handle the evolutions of Android along
with a camera package that should be
able to give you a very good rear-facing
camera experience but also a wonderful
selfie experience that's exactly what we
love about the desired 820 and that's
the reason why it gets the best
mid-range award here at Aoife 2014 in
Berlin in the growing trend of
smartphones that are starting to get too
big for our hands it's hard to find a
compact offering or a mini offering that
is available with no compromises but
that's exactly what sony has been able
to do with you hacked line and in this
case we have an Xperia z3 compact and
what we have here is a small screen easy
to use by anybody in one hand that has
all of the power underneath that you
would want out of a flagship device the
Snapdragon 801 complete with the 20.7
megapixel camera on the back and it
actually comes and quite a few colors
that you can have in order to really fit
your style if you look at the compact
and consider it more of a flagship than
other phones that are larger than it we
wouldn't really be surprised and that's
the reason why it gets it because with
that power you still get so nice Thai
speaking of style it's not every day
that you get to have style and power all
in one beautiful package and
lenovo vibe x 2 that is exactly what you
get not only do get a powerful octa core
MediaTek processor that is the heart of
what is actually a very light body and
flat all around making it very easy to
handle you also get the styling that we
really loved here at you for 2014 not
only with this bamboo version but also
with plenty of the other colors that are
available you have we multi-tone on the
side and of course the one that I love
the most is bamboo edition of p 5 x 2
but at the same time this flagship
smartphone by Lenovo is one that you
should definitely look out for as mushy
as it continues to grow in its markets
around the world so with the style that
we love so much but also the power ones
are need to be able to withstand all of
the tests that you throw at it we give
the lenovo vibe x to one of our awards
for best flagship phone here at e for
2014 it's not easy to make a very large
handset but still keep it as accessible
as possible but that's exactly what
Huawei has been able to do with the
ascend mate 7 not only do you get all of
the different features and specs that
you need in order to perform all of the
top to your experiences here on this
handset but they have also improved on
what has already been a pretty common
trope in the smartphone game and that's
fingerprint scanning a small area on the
back of the phone of this metal device
that has a very nice look to it and
feels very sturdy will allow you to just
tap on the area and unlock your phone
from the prone position in no time and
that is exactly what we thought
fingerprint scanning should eventually
become and faster way but also safer way
for you to unlock your phone couple that
with everything underneath in the user
interface that is available and you have
an experience that is not only easy to
activate but easy to use and those are
the reasons why we give the huawei
ascend mate 7 one of our awards for
flagship here at Aoife 2014 and for our
final award here at the best of you for
2014 we're talking about the phone that
all of you are talking about and if it's
not already obvious behind me ever
is lining up to see it its of course new
samsung galaxy known for it gets the
award primarily because it is an upgrade
in every single way of mt galaxy note 3
which is already a wonderful device and
it only continues a tradition now in the
Samsung Galaxy Note line we of course
have the S Pen which is right here and
it has been enhanced to provide even
more capabilities on top of all of the
brand new tasking features that are
available you can seamlessly go between
all the different modes of multitasking
so everything that you have to do
especially at the same time you will be
able to do in the way that you need it
to be dug out but when we talk about the
design in the textured bag returns from
the Galaxy Note 3 but the sides are
where you see something old changes this
metal design that comprises the frame
all around the phone really makes us
feel like a premium device it definitely
is one of the best ones already and you
really have to feel this to believe it
once you get your hands on the Galaxy
Note 4 we're sure you're going to enjoy
exactly what you're looking at and
feeling and that's the reason why it
gets our best flagship award here at the
best of you for 2014 and rollin now we
do have to give a special mention to a
phone that we got to see here at Aoife
in Berlin though everyone else did get
to see it out in Chicago the Moto X now
the release happened out in the States
but we're still able to get a special
presentation on it and really we loved
what we saw the Moto X has been beefed
up in pretty much every sense of the
word and that screen comes in at that
1080p resolution now we have a
Snapdragon 801 processor and the active
display is still great and is able to be
triggered via a wave of the hand over
the infrared sensors that are there
there's a front facing speakers on there
now as well and of course we have the
voice recognition that can be customized
to whatever phrase you want it to be on
top of all of that we still have a great
moto experience with the moto maker and
the ability to customize the experience
to what you really want it to be so for
that reason we want to give a nice
mention to the Moto X and then round out
our best of Aoife 2014 here with these
awards that we wanted to give some of
the best ones that we saw here at the
show so keep it tuned to android
authority for all of the best coverage
