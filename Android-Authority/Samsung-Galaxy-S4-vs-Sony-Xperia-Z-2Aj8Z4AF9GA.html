with a ton of new capabilities on the
other you've got some unique style
covering a more simplistic outlook aged
Rauschenberg are from Android Authority
what's going on everybody and this is
the Samsung Galaxy s4 versus the Sony
Xperia Z from a quick glance you see
that both of these phones are quite
different Samsung's new flagship phone
is all too familiar with a similar
rounded look and the same button layout
as the galaxy s3 it is however one of
the best handling 5-inch phones with its
smaller bezel then profile and light
handling Sony's flagship might be larger
heavier and it requires a bit more ham
gymnastics but it is definitely a looker
with a rectangular black slate look and
angular corners this is a look we don't
see often enough its handling is helped
by having its buttons all on the same
side and halfway down the device that
big silver button is a great focal point
that really pops flat sides benefit both
devices though the Z's sides are flat
primarily because of the flaps that
close all the ports for water resistance
Samsung's plastic material is starting
to get old but the all glass finish of
the Xperia Z gives it the same slickness
in the hand either phone will require a
good wipe down from time to time so the
s4 will please those who look for
familiarity while the Xperia Z will
likely turn more heads
due to its throwback design the displays
on both devices have largely the same
specs as both alford 1080p resolution at
441 PPI the TFT capacitive display found
on the Xperia Z has been widely
publicized for having poor viewing
angles though this isn't a big deal to
everyone being backed by the Bravia
Engine makes dead on viewing pretty
amazing as it makes the Xperia Z look
like a small Sony TV its color
production is a little more on the
subtle side compared to the very
saturated capabilities of the Galaxy s4
samsung Super AMOLED technology returns
and makes colors from the s4 really jump
out luckily if you don't like this
barrage on the eyes you can change the
screens motif in the display settings
the galaxy s4 does have much better
viewing angles but when it comes down to
it you'll likely choose the right phone
for you based on more than just the
displays after all either one will bring
you a wonderful experience when it comes
to performance it's a battle of past
verses present while the Sony Xperia Z
definitely has great performance and is
one of the most optimized users of the
Snapdragon s4 pro it has to contend with
the next Qualcomm evolution Western
versions of the Samsung Galaxy s4 will
have the Snapdragon 600 that clocks in
at 1.9 gigahertz a real bump up from the
1.5 gigahertz s4 pro found in the Xperia
Z while the Xperia Z was the first phone
I tested to clear the 20,000 mark in
antutu easily the s4 surpasses it
Adreno 320 graphics and 2 gigabytes of
RAM back these processors up so gaming
and multitasking are great experiences
either way both phones will give you
great performance as the s4 pro still
holds up so really only the specs
ticklers will truly notice the
difference in speed the galaxy s4 has
over the Xperia Z here's where things
get tricky aside from the usual bells
and whistles both phones offer different
things in extra hardware the Xperia Z
might not have a removable back but one
of the flaps covers a microSD card slot
to bolster it's 16 gigabytes of usage
its battery is not removable but the Z
does have one great thing going for it
water resistance while it might not seem
completely practical it can be your
phone Savior if something unfortunate
happens the galaxy s4 is not water
resistance but that back plastic cover
allows you to get to the battery and the
microSD card slot the main additions and
the galaxy s4 involves sensors for
enhanced navigation like air gestures
and an IR blaster that can control your
TV finally it has a much better speaker
see our full galaxy s4 review for the
rest of the new bits and pieces the new
editions give the galaxy s4 a lot to
offer though they're no good if they get
wet and damaged something the experience
he has no worry of if that is important
to you
the Nifty water resistance might make
sony's phone the one for you we already
mentioned that the battery in the Xperia
Z is not removable which is a big deal
to people who like to have a spare unit
handy one needed the longevity of the
Xperia Z's 2330 milliamp hour battery
has proven mixed with web and general
browsing faring better than media
consumption there are however a lot of
power saving options to help you
comfortably get through a day's work the
galaxy s4 on the other hand allows you
to keep that spare available but for
most days it might not be necessary
the 2600 milliamp hour battery can last
for quite a while if you're not a power
user you might even get a couple days
out of a single charge
while some frugality might be required
in the Xperia Z it should still get the
job done otherwise the power paranoid
can take advantage of the larger unit in
the s4 maybe with a spare handy just in
case and now for the cameras both phones
support 13 megapixel shooters with the
Xperia Z packing and Exmor RS sensor
sony cybershot pedigree shows with the
inclusion of superior auto that
automatically sets the appropriate mode
for the scene added features include HDR
and sweeping panorama picture quality is
quite good with accurate reproduction
despite colors tending toward a cooler
motif much like the displays pictures
aren't as saturated as those the s4
creates samsung's camera does produce
very nice photos as well and its colour
reproduction brings vibrancy to just
about any photo but the s4 s additions
come with the new modes in the app
itself without listing all of them
certain modes like drama shot and the
dual capture do add more potential fun
to your smartphone photography you can
see our new features explained video for
a better look at these new options those
looking for more ways of getting a
quirky Instagram photo might opt for the
Galaxy S 4 either phone however will
prove a very capable shooter and finally
we have the software we'll start with
the galaxy s4 as it has the more heavily
modified user interface TouchWiz is
something you love or hate but at least
the s4 makes it more bearable
with the larger screen that better suits
its bloated elements app additions
include the remote controller watch on
and the helpful tracker s health
bolstering other well-known capabilities
like s voice and multi window in
navigation you can now use your floating
finger like an S Pen to get previews and
wave your hand or use your eyes to
scroll again see our other two videos
for a more in-depth look these might all
be more options than you can handle but
they are available for usage whenever
you fancy compare all this to the Xperia
Z which takes a much simpler approach it
looks a lot more like stock Android Ice
Cream Sandwich in particular and opts
for darker tones over the colorful Sony
does have its classics in there like the
Walkman but also adds in small apps for
further multitasking if you dislike
TouchWiz the s4 probably won't help with
that in that case the more
simplistic and low-key Xperia you I
might better suit you
however the galaxy s4 does take
advantage of its new hardware features
to bring you a navigation experience
that feels fresh despite not being
particularly revolutionary as premium
phones both of these top-tier devices
will set you back a pretty penny
unlocked either smartphone will get
close to $700 u.s.
although the Xperia Z has been around a
little longer and can possibly be found
for cheaper prices the Xperia Z isn't
widely available on US carriers yet but
it will likely be at the typical $1.99
on two-year plans just like the galaxy
s4 and so there you have it Sony's best
against Samsung's best Samsung put a lot
of effort into making the s4 a tough
package to beat and while it may be the
easiest handling five-inch screen device
it may also prove overwhelming to those
looking for a simpler software
experience enter the complete opposite
the Xperia Z despite being closer to
stock Android in its user interface the
water-resistant design also brings a
slightly bigger profile and much more
unique looks in the end you're choosing
between familiarity with new
capabilities or a phone with a new look
that is very good at everything you're
already used to drop a like on this
edition of vs. and then check out all
