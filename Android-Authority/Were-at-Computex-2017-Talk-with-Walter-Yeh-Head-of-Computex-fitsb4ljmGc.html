everybody and I want to come to you live
from the Computex 2017 press conference
where we got a look at what Computex has
to offer this year now the one thing
that you guys are probably asking is
well as Android Authority what do we
have to look forward to at Computex
after all there aren't that many Android
announcements that are typically made at
the show last year when lawn in Arad
were able to go they did have a few
different Android announcements but this
year it's actually a little bit more
bear compared to previous times a Seuss
in particular will have a zenfone AR
that they're going to be showing but we
saw that already and they're just going
to continue the marketing and also the
exposure of that tango enabled phone and
I'm hoping to be able to get my hands on
it pretty soon to bring you guys a full
review however here at the press
conference what I'm going to be doing
here in Taipei is basically figuring out
what Computex has to offer for the
mobile centric users like myself and
like a lot of you who watch our channel
so with that in mind I actually got the
privilege of speaking to Walter yeah the
head of Computex
and I was able to ask them a few
questions and give his perspective on
what Computex has to offer for users
like you and me so we'll go ahead and
get right into the interview and this is
our way of letting you know that I am
here in Taipei in Taiwan for Computex
2017 what would I be able to look
forward to at Computex primarily since
this is a computer show when I'm more
mobile technically actually Computex the
last 37 years change from long products
to mobile and now to in artificial
intelligence so this year our Computex
repositioned as a global technology
ecosystem building global technology
ecosystem so we transform from product
to solution to application and so you
will find more IOT application
and also the business solution during
the show and of course startup is our
focus we invited startup from all over
the world to join our compute X this
year we have 270 to start up for the our
innovates and we hope we become the good
platform for start-up and also compute X
is the leading treasures in the world
for gaming also IOT application and
gaming we have the full supply chain of
gaming companies along 60 world renowned
companies join our compute X so you see
of them you okay so in in the world of
mobile I do go to a lot of different
shows like MWC in Barcelona Aoife in
Berlin in September and CES what role
would you say Computex
has in the let's say global and
year-long round of different text shows
that people like me would end up going
to yeah in Computex you can find the
Friars you can find the partner for the
ecosystem and we joined all the trade
shows o leading trade shows I see yes my
MW teams Barcelona Aoife in Berlin and
and of course other small cities shows
in India Singapore everywhere and we
promote our computing we hope Computex
become a leading platform for start-up
for IOT application so we we are happy
that we have about 30% of our exhibitors
coming from abroad
so shifting gears a little bit it's
obvious from from looking at the kinds
of vendors you have here at Computex
that there's a lot of representation
from Taiwan and of course in East Asia
but looking at Taiwan in particular when
you have companies like Samsung and LG
coming out of Korea and there are so
many companies coming out of let's say
mainland China itself where do you see
Taiwan in the grand scale of the
different tech companies that are coming
into the tech industry I I one is the
major supplier for instance for we had
this year we we also have the MFI
certificate companies this unique only
in Taiwan because we have so many Apple
companies component companies for Apple
yes is here in Taiwan so Taiwan produce
components solutions and also startup so
that is different from other our
partners in Korea and Japan so even
Korean then the startup dedication to
Taiwan because Taiwan Computex
is a good platform for their startup to
collaborate with other companies from
everywhere of the world okay you've been
able to see so many companies especially
as ahead of Computex for 2017 in
particular what trends are you most
excited about after seeing them all come
here for Taipei's of show and the train
is AI artificial intelligence of course
and also gaming and AR so this year if
for for gaming for AR we have experience
from our pallets music we corporate
partner with our National Palace Museum
so they can experience the art world
from even from our value is there oh yes
lovely yeah a lot of companies are
hedging their bets on virtual reality
and artificial intelligence and I'm
really excited to see all of these
companies that in the u.s. we don't
really get to hear about a lot too often
at leaves because they don't import into
the u.s. all the time
kind of seeing where they would go with
artificial intelligence on VR we have a
VR website that I'm going to be
reporting for so good so one last
question you mentioned the ten years
that they have had the awards in
particular but you mentioned someone
mentioned on stage also what we can look
forward to in ten years about where
technology will go and what 10 years
from now Computex would look like do you
have any idea what you might want ten
years from now to look like four
Computex no it's difficult for kids
yeah in ten years so we just transform
yeah according to the trend we have to
change every year every day mm-hmm and
even two years ago we didn't have
artificial intelligence as ramen is now
or virtual reality so I think I like I
love your philosophy on that I think
that's a wonderful way of what thank you
well Walter thank you so much for a
great night yeah thank you all right
well you're going to be see a lot from
us here at Computex 2017 so make sure
you stay tuned to Andrews already and
all of our other properties for even
more all right so hopefully you guys
enjoyed that interview and it was a
wonderful way for me to get started at
this show and Computex 2017 so hopefully
you guys will stay tuned to and rotary
for any announcements that we have but a
lot of what I will be able to cover here
at the show will deal with things like
VR and artificial intelligence and
because of that you can head over to our
other properties as well VR source
charge do tab times sound guys and of
course you can keep it tuned here to
Andhra thority for more about the world
of Android if I'm able to get into it
