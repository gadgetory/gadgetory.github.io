show is brought to you by aquarium 3d
live wallpapers hello again ladies and
gentlemen I'm Joe Hindy the android
authority app guy and welcome back to
Google Play weekly this week we're going
to talk about Google's picks for the
best android apps and games of 2014
Google and Microsoft going head-to-head
in Santa tracking and a whole lot more
so let's get started in our first bit of
news this week google has shared their
picks for the best android apps and
games of 2014 both lists are huge and
include well over a hundred applications
and games some of the games include
instant classics like Monument Valley
and Sky Force 2014 along with more
predictable titles like Leo's fortune
and don't tap the white tile on the
application side of things you'll find
stuff like the official Ted application
I have TTT swiftkey Disney movies
anywhere and a whole lot more the links
are in the written companion which is in
the video description below if you want
to see both lists for yourself this last
week Nintendo received a patent that
allows it to emulate its Game Boy
platform on a number of other platforms
and that can be both good or bad the
patent covers the emulation of the Game
Boy for various purposes including
smartphone computers and some unusual
places like the headrest screens you see
on airplanes this can be good or bad if
Nintendo wants to be good about it they
can publish an official emulator and
finally have a chance to enter into the
smartphone gaming world or they can use
the patent to for school to remove
existing emulators which would be very
bad only time will tell us what Nintendo
intends on doing google messenger got an
update this last week that lets you
customize your theme i wanted to mention
this because a lot of people i've talked
to express grief that the google
messenger texting app was too simple and
i thought they'd like to see that Google
is spicing things up a little bit the
update is rolling out soon so if you
pick it up now or already habits you may
have to wait a little bit for the
updates you'll have control over what
conversations have what colors and it's
a fun way to kind of color code your
conversations as usual the application
is still free this last week Microsoft
purchased a calendar an email
application called a comp I for a
reported two hundred million dollars the
app itself is a calendar and email
hybrid application with an imaginative
UI and some fun features that bring
something a little bit different to the
table we're not sure why Microsoft
bought them because they do have their
own email and calendar clients but
Microsoft has expressed that they plan
on using this application to help their
cross-platform efforts we're sure we'll
see some follow-up to this over the next
but for now the application will remain
in development just as it is now so if
you want to try it out you absolutely
can it is free in our last bit of news
this week Google and Microsoft go
head-to-head in the battle of the Santa
trackers up until last year nor adding
Google used to work together to bring us
our yearly Santa tracker after last year
the pair decided to break up and this
year Google has their own while NORAD
has kind of sort of partnered with
Microsoft on their own what we get is a
brilliant analogy of the texting as a
whole as two of the biggest tech giants
in history go head-to-head buying over
children's love of Santa no you can't
make this stuff up folks both versions
have some pretty fun features so it's
not like one is better than the other so
go ahead and take your pick before we
get into the trending apps this week
let's take a quick look at aquarium 3d
live wallpapers this app gives you a
beautiful and colorful underwater scene
complete with equally colorful swimming
fish you can purchase additional scenes
and fish as in-app purchases or you can
buy the pro version which includes
everything including everything included
in all future updates it's free to
download in the Google Play Store so you
can try it out without paying anything
and we'll have a link to that in the
video description below and we'd like to
thank the developers for supporting
Google Play weekly so who wants to see
some trending applications as usual if
you want to check any of these
applications out you can find the links
in the written companion which is in the
video description below google has
released a new application called device
assist that helps people become more
acclimated with the features of their
devices it is only for nexus google play
experience and android one devices and
helps you learn things like Google now
and other various Google features it's
free and if you know someone getting a
google phone for Christmas this is a
great application to have them try
google news and weather is getting an
update very soon then add some new
features and UI changes there is now a
dark you I option for those that like
their apps a little bit darker as well
as some fun graphs for things like
whether you can also now use the search
bar to delve into topics in more depth
the update is rolling out so if you
don't have it yet have a little bit of
patience because it is coming status is
a new application that is designed to
automatically update your status when
you do things most adults may not have a
use for this but this is a great
application for parents who want to keep
an eye on their kids without forcing
their kids to do well anything it
updates automatically in the background
so kids can keep doing what they do and
parents can keep doing what they do and
no one has to do any additional work oh
and it's free gota is a fun new
free-to-play game where you get to play
God you'll
control over everything in your little
world including what it looks like and
the people who live there you can do
things like cast miracles and nurture
growth and stuff like that it's a little
bit buggy because it is a new release
but it is free to play so it won't cost
you anything to try it out last up this
week is a new app called ghost three
privacy browser this app allows you to
surf the web like any other browser but
it also allows you to see what trackers
website used to track your usage habits
