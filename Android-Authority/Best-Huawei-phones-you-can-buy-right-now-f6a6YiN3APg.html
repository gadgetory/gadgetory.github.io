you're already gonna know about but
there are some hidden goodies too now
we've got a clarify first that this list
consists of Huawei branded smartphones
there are honor phones at our
manufactured back wall way that are not
in this list also always coming out with
a lot of new phones all the time so this
is the best Huawei smartphone options
for today and the best all-around option
regardless of price has got to be the
Huawei P 10 and P 10 plus which launched
earlier this year and are the successors
to the company's highly successful p9 +
p9 + phones both devices pack a lot of
high-end hardware and relative average
sized phones but Huawei P 10 uses a 5.1
inch IPS LCD display with 1920 by 1080
resolution while the P 10 plus is a bit
bigger with a 5.5 inch IPS LCD display
and a resolution of 2560 by 1440 inside
both phones so Huawei uses their own
home-grown 2.4 gigahertz octa-core kuren
960 processor the P 10 has 4 gigabytes
of RAM and 64 gigabytes of on-board
storage while the P 10 plus comes with 6
gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes of
on-board storage both devices also have
microSD card slots which lets owners
expand the storage of those phones up to
256 gigs now for honourable mentions for
this best all-around category has got to
be not only the Huawei p9 + p9 + but the
huawei mate 9 now what if you don't want
to spend that much cheddar and you're
really looking for a solid mid tier
option for that we got a look at the
Huawei p10 light also launched earlier
this year the Huawei p10 light packs
some respectable hardware inside it's
5.2 inch display but at about half the
cost of the regular P 10 and P 10 + the
biggest difference in the specs is that
the P 10 light has the slower cure and
658 chipset rather than the 960 found in
the P 10 and P 10 + also there's just a
12 megapixel rear camera sensor with the
P 10 light versus the dual camera setup
for the P 10 and P 10 plus nonetheless
the P 10 light still manages to pack in
either three gigabytes or four gigabytes
of RAM depending on your specific region
along with 32 gigabytes of on-board
storage which of course is also
expandable via the micro SD card slot it
has a 3000 milliamp hour battery with
charging support which should last most
people a full day's charge the
fingerprint sensor is placed on the back
of the p10 light and the phone comes
with Android 7.0 and Huawei's own UI out
of the box the phone has a metal frame
but lacks a physical home button on the
bottom now I haven't had any first-hand
experience with this device but on paper
the specs look fantastic and for the
price that's damn right sexy at two
hundred and seventy nine dollars us
again honorable mentions here you got a
look at the Huawei p9 light and the
hallway Nova and Nova plus now I know
what some of you are thinking you're
thinking Jase come on I need an even
better deal than that well then you want
to look at the Huawei p8 light now if
you live in the UK or in parts of Europe
you've been able to purchase the oddly
named Huawei p8 light in 2017 for
several months now you can get this
member of the Huawei phone family for
just 185 pounds or 240 dollars u.s.
without a contract in the UK while folks
in other parts of Europe can buy it for
240 euros without a contract now if you
really want to get your hands on this
phone but you live in the u.s. don't
worry about it we expect that it will
make its way west very soon and if you
can't wait you can always search on eBay
but really I want to hear from you
current Huawei device owners is it
really all that it's touted to be are
they great best bang for your buck
options like so many people talk about
let me know in the comments below or
right there on Twitter now my audience
is smart so smart that sometimes you're
inspired by a business idea and then you
try and get the name of that business in
a domain name and your next perspective
customer is searching your business name
and they assume you have the dot-com and
if you don't you're giving your business
away to the one who does that's the
power of a.com now why is that exactly
well no domain name extension tells your
story with the same degree of trust as a
dot-com or dotnet domain name.com and
dotnet domain name extensions and jet
credibility and your online presence and
who doesn't want to be credible and
don't forget you get 15% off when you
use our coupon code
Android when you think domain names
think domain.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
