know what that means for our end of the
show coverage we have a lot of awards to
give out and we want to present all of
those devices to you in this hour best
of MWC 2017 hey guys John Belasco here
I'm going to quickly talk about some of
the best of MWC 2017 awards that we gave
up for tab times now the first one goes
to the Samsung Galaxy Book 2 models
available 10 inch 12 inch models and
these are 2 convertible tablets Windows
10 tablets that have a lot of
productivity they come with the S Pen
and if you want a lot of horsepower you
probably want to go with a 12 inch model
because it features a Core i5 processor
and it's pretty much a great competitor
to the surface pro 4 and the other board
goes to the Lenovo mix 320 also another
Windows 10 power tablet featuring an
Intel x5 processor up to 4 gigabytes of
RAM and up to 128 gigabytes of internal
storage it's pretty compact because it
has a 10.1 inch 1920 by 1200 display
also comes with Dolby advanced audio
speakers and a detachable keyboard so
you have that productivity element in
play and they do claim up to 10 hours of
battery life with it now we can move
into the Android Authority Awards and
what better phone to start off with than
the LG G 6 the previous LG g5 was not a
bad device but it wasn't necessarily
received with the best reception and now
with the LG G 6 we have what can only be
described as the company's return to
form one of the best parts about the G 6
is that it takes some of the best parts
of the V 20 and the G 5 and then
improves upon it in a number of
different ways but if you haven't
already seen our video on the LG G 6 you
only have to know one thing about it
that screen with an 18 by 9 aspect ratio
we also have a screen on the g 6 that
bleeds over to the very edges of the
device basically making the bezel one of
the most minimalistic parts of the phone
it's a sight to behold
and we think the LG G 6 is going to be
one hell of a contender for 2017
while we continue a great line of
devices would be Huawei P 10 and P 10
plus both the P 10 models are evolutions
of the p9 with elements of the Huawei
may 9 thrown in new features include the
like a dual camera 2.0 under glass
fingerprint sensor and in the case of
the Huawei P 10 plus the first quad HD
screen widely available on a Huawei
flagship while we continues their
prowess in creating very solid handsets
and we give huawei aides a lot of credit
for creating a very easy to use p10 and
then a more premium feeling and more
premium featured p10 plus and now this
one shouldn't be too much of a surprise
as we give an award to the BlackBerry ki
one the ki one technically is it a new
phone as we already saw at CES 2017
under the moniker mercury however it was
still worth showing up for the key one
because we get to see the full QWERTY
keyboard in all of its glory once again
and we see that the latest Android
nougat OS and several BlackBerry iconic
features are going to be making it into
the device including the BlackBerry hub
at blackberry tasks and a number of
other blackberry applications that help
get productivity out of the way and for
any blackberry fans from the past you
can indeed program shortcuts for all 52
different keys the key one is an
exciting return to form for blackberry
and we can't wait to get our hands on
this particular device even with a bit
of its nostalgia factor baked in the
Sony Xperia XD premium is not the first
4k handset after all the first 4k
handset was also created by Sony last
year however it looks and feels like a
Sony smartphone and it provides an
excellent user experience that we've
come to expect from the Xperia line as
4k HDR in its triluminos display a great
build in the future said that is up
there with the flagships that you see in
the rest of this festive video
unsurprisingly sony puts a lot of great
features in the Xperia XZ premium
including the ability to run 1080p
natively to save battery and then hop
over to 4k HDR when you really want to
get some awesome content out of that
screen one other great feature is a 960
frames per second slow motion recording
which is part of sony's new camera
sensor which we cannot wait to get our
hands on and try out for a camera
shootout and to see how it fares against
the rest of the Android cameras
space we throw it back to tablets for a
little bit with the Lenovo tab 4 plus
now it's an award that you may not have
expected us to hand out but they created
a tablet that is not only wonderful but
it makes it clear that Lenovo still have
space in the tablet ecosystem
however they have created a bunch of
tablets here that should be able to
satisfy pretty much anyone looking for a
larger screen experience all the way
down to having 10-inch to 8-inch to
premium versions of all of these fed
tablets - even a kid's version that is
available for children so that you can
have them distracted while you try to
play with your own tablet features
include fingerprint sensors for the plus
editions and a possible 64 gigabytes of
storage with microSD card expansion now
these tablets may not be the most
powerful ones out there but we do
applaud Lenovo for bringing back a
smaller 8 inch form that we think is a
bit of a dying art in the tablet game
now we're always going to be happy to
see the S Pen return to any Samsung
devices and the Galaxy Tab s 3 was the
marquee device for samsung here at MWC
2017 now while the S Pen is something
that we're looking forward to in the
next note device whenever it comes back
it is arguably still the most refined
and feature-rich stylus on any consumer
device and we love to see it come to an
even larger screen Android nukid OS
comes here on a Snapdragon 820 chipset
for the tab s3 and its 9.7 inch HD
already quad HD AMOLED display provides
all of the color that you would want
coming from a large screen experience
like this in the tab s3 we bring it on
back to smartphones and over to Oppo
which we actually haven't seen a whole
lot of in recent months however Oppo has
come out of the woodwork at MWC 2017
with the 5x zoom now the 5x zoom camera
prototype provides optical zoom not
digital zoom and the result is a
lossless quality as you zoom in without
needing a bulky camera lens this
seamless and high-quality zoom on a
small form factor for a phone is one of
the first for mobile phones and it's
possible that Oppo is thinking rather
cleverly about how to circumvent the
usual problem with a thick optical zoom
lens we can't wait for the first phone's
potentially from Oppo to ship with this
new camera array and finally perhaps the
most unconventional of them all but we
still saved the best for last
if you're looking for a nostalgia factor
look no
further than the Nokia 3310 pretty much
anybody with the smartphone these days
can probably trace their origins back to
Nokia's original virtually
undestructible device and while Nokia
did have a show where they announced
major flagships it was a sub 50 euro
feature phone that everyone was really
enamored with Nokia remade the 33 10 and
in doing so confirms they know how to
generate the hype now even if the
circumstances surrounding the Nokia 3310
don't necessarily scream Nokia's own
doing it is still a phone that a lot of
people have already said at this show
that they want their hands on and it's
not the most feature packed phone
obviously because it's not a smart phone
but you can still play snake on it and
with that sub 50 euro price point pretty
much everybody wants to have it as their
secondary device the 3310 won the award
because we felt it was the best
representation of Nokia at MWC while
they are back in the smartphone game
there's no better way for them to bring
back all of the hype surrounding the
company than with a phone that we all
want to get our hands on and so there
you have it our picks for best of MWC
2017 it's in a great show and of course
beautiful barcelona was a wonderful
backdrop for a lot of these devices that
we were really happy to have at the
Mobile World Congress show of 2017
mainly because we have things like the
g6
we returning Nokia the blackberry q10 a
lot to love at this show so keep it
tuned to Android authority for even more
about all of these devices and don't
forget to head over to tab time so you
can see further coverage of those two
products that we gave awards to here in
