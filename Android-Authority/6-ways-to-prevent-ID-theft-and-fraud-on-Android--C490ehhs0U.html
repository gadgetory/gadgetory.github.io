brought to you by Norton security hello
again ladies and gentlemen I'm Joe Hindy
from android authority calm and in this
video we're going to take a quick look
at some ways to keep you and your device
safe from ID theft and fraud the first
thing we'll talk about is fishing
phishing websites are made to look like
legitimate websites that you may
actually use like PayPal your banking
website or other websites like Facebook
these are generally easy to avoid make
sure when you're browsing you check the
web address and if it doesn't look
natural don't enter your credentials in
many cases banks in places like PayPal
have official applications in the Google
Play Store and you should use those
whenever possible never side load a
banking or money application for any
reason ever if you use the website make
sure you check and make sure you're on
the actual official website before
signing in this will prevent phishing
sites from stealing your financial
information every now and then we make a
boo-boo lure hackers actually do figure
out a way to get to our password without
any wrongdoing on our part the best way
to make sure this one problem doesn't
turn into many problems is to have a
unique password for every website you
log into it doesn't have to be wildly
different but when you have a huge list
of websites and they all have the same
password you're practically inviting
hackers into your life a good way to do
this is to keep a hard copy as in using
a pen and paper of your logins and
passwords hackers can't steal something
that isn't on your computer another
really good option is to use a password
manager like LastPass and secure or
Norton identity safe will have a list of
the best password managers for Android
in the video description below for your
reference shopping at reputable websites
is perhaps the best advice that I can
give these places require your payment
information to process orders so it's
really easy to get suckered into giving
that info up on a shopping website you
should stick to sites like ebay amazon
newegg and other well known and well
vetted shopping websites if you're
wondering if a site is reputable Google
search them if someone has been scammed
chances are that information is
available somewhere and you can easily
find it if you search for it it's also
true that many reputable shopping
websites have applications that are
available in the Google Play Store
they're about as safe as you can
possibly get when you're shopping online
we recommend that you use those and like
the banking apps never ever side load a
shopping application will have a list of
reputa
shopping apps in the video description
below not divulging too much info on
your social media pages is more good
advice never ever post details about
your banking info credit cards or any
sensitive information a lot of people
make this mistake and it has cost them a
lot just be cautious your friends on
facebook instagram or twitter don't need
a picture of your new credit card the
only people who do need that info or
identity thieves so don't post anything
ridiculous i cannot stress enough that
you should never do things like banking
or shopping while you're on a public
Wi-Fi network when you're at home you're
almost certainly okay but at places like
cafes airports and other sources of
public Wi-Fi there may be untrustworthy
people trying to sniff at your packets
packet sniffers have the ability to
monitor web traffic over a specific
network so let's say there's a packet
sniffer at the airport that person can
see everything that everyone is doing
when they're connected to the airport's
Wi-Fi this is very bad and things like
passwords and banking info can easily be
intercepted save your shopping and
banking for when you're on a secure data
connection a lot of people would
recommend something like a VPN
application for these kinds of instances
but frankly if you can you should
definitely wait a lot of the android
elite look down their nose at things
like anti-virus applications because if
you're careful you don't really need one
but for those of us who don't want to
think about these things all day long an
antivirus application can go a long way
to protecting you behind the scenes
without you having to worry about it so
much a good one to try out is Norton
security their antivirus suite includes
all the basic stuff like antivirus and
anti-fraud ulit sites from accessing
your data as well as the ability to lock
your phone remotely or even wipe it
remotely in case it's stolen so that no
one can get at your personal information
and steal it once again I'm Joe Hindy
