Samsung Galaxy S nine plus if you're
looking for a smartphone with the modern
design modern features flagship
specifications and provides incredible
value for its money
then you can stop watching this video
right now and go buy the one plus six
but if you're looking for our phone that
comes with some extra bells and whistles
then the extra cost of the samsung
galaxy s 9 plus might be worth your
money let's take a look at the 1 plus 6
and see how well it stacks up to the
Samsung Galaxy S 9 plus so the 1 plus 6
and galaxy s 9 plus are two competing
flagship smartphones that offer a very
similar set of specifications they're
both powered by snapdragon 845
processors and have plenty of RAM
weather just casually browsing the web
checking social media or playing games
these phones are both extremely fast at
everything they do they also both
provide incredible battery life you've
got a 3300 milliamp hour battery on the
oneplus 6 and a 3,500 milliamp hour
battery on the s9 Plus and you can
easily get 5 to 6 hours of screen on
time on either phone which is great for
light and heavy usage you've also got
rear-facing fingerprint sensors and face
unlocked for security but in addition to
that the s9 Plus has iris scanning to
make the face unlock a little more
secure they also come with headphone
jacks which is a rarity for smartphones
in 2018 but the s9 plus does have some
extra hardware features that the oneplus
6 doesn't and depending on how important
they are to you they could be worth the
extra cost the s9 Plus has wireless
charging a micro SD card slot for extra
storage and ip68 certification against
water and dust the lack of wireless
charging is a deal breaker by any means
and - charging more than makes up for it
but with one plus 6 switching to a
mostly glass design that's similar to
the s9 plus it feels like a missed
opportunity and having some sort of
official IP so vacation would have been
nice when so many flagship phones out
there have it now on the front the 1 + 6
+ s9 + feature large AMOLED displays
that have excellent contrast deep blacks
and vibrant colors
the main difference here is the one plus
six uses a 1080p panel whereas the s9
plus is quad HD even though a ton of
manufacturers have made the move to quad
HD I've never found the 1080p resolution
on the 1 plus 6 or any previous 1 plus
device to be problematic what people
might have a problem with though is the
notch on the 1 plus 6 it's becoming one
of those popular unpopular trends and
I'm not the biggest fan of notches to be
honest but it doesn't really bother me
all that much and doesn't ruin the
display experience in any way but if you
really hate notches the s9 plus is one
of the few flagship choices that you
have this year that doesn't have a notch
on the backside the one plus 6 and s9 +
have dual cameras which is pretty much
becoming a standard thing on smartphones
the 1 plus 6 has a 16 and 20 megapixel
combo and the s9 plus has 2 12 megapixel
sensors the second sensor on both
smartphones allow for portrait mode or
background blurring effects and also 2x
zoom but the zoom on the 1 plus 6 is
digital whereas the s9 Plus gives you a
real optical zoom what makes the s9
pluses camera a little more unique than
most other dual cameras is its
mechanical aperture this gives you a
real aperture switch between F 1.5 and F
2.4 which is really useful for
controlling how much light enters the
lens and changing the depth of field as
far as picture quality is concerned you
might be pretty surprised at how well
the 1 + 6 keeps up with the s 9 plus in
terms of color reproduction sharpness
and overall dynamic range they're both
pretty similar there are some minor
differences like the Reds for example
the 1 plus 6 tends to over saturate and
make them look a little unnatural while
Reds on the s9 plus are more accurate
and true to life in low-light the s9
plus produces cleaner results with less
noise but it isn't always the clear
winner sometimes I prefer the results
from the 1 plus 6 and it usually does
much better with white balance and
producing more accurate colors even if
the images aren't quite as sharp now the
software is where these two devices
differ the most they're running Android
or EO but you've got oxygen OS on the
oneplus 6 and the Samsung experience on
the s9 plus personally I like oxygen to
west better because it keeps that stock
like look and feel and gives
a lot of customization for changing the
appearance of the UI and there's also a
variety of gesture controls for
navigating the software or quickly
launching apps even with all the options
that oxygen West gives you it isn't
overwhelming because of how close it
feels to stock Android Samsung software
isn't bad either though it's easy to use
also offers a ton of customization and
you've got some pretty valuable features
like Samsung pay and the secure folder
for keeping information safe and private
so like I mentioned earlier if price
plays a big factor in your decision
making the one plus six is the best way
to go but the one plus six is missing
some key features that I think are
pretty important so if I had to pick
between the two I'd go with the Galaxy S
9 plus I like having wireless charging
expandable storage and IP certification
and as a smart phone overall it isn't
really lacking in any department it's
got a great screen that doesn't have a
knotch
great performance battery life and
camera it's expensive but it's a phone
that provides me with everything I want
in need out of a smart phone and to me
that's really what matters the most and
that pretty much wraps it up for this
