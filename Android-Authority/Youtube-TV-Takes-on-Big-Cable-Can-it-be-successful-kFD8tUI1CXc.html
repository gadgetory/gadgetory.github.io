table
big time google has announced that it
plans to launch YouTube TV in the u.s.
an internet-based television service
that will offer access to local
broadcast networks like ABC CBS NBC Fox
and CW along with a bunch of cable
networks for 35 bucks a month the
service will first launched later this
year in the largest TV markets in the US
and will expand to more metro areas in
the future pretty exciting for us cord
cutters right yeah but it doesn't
include HBO's Game of Thrones I checked
in addition to the broadcast networks
YouTube TV will also offer access to
over 40 cable channels like USA FX
sci-fi ESPN Fox Sports 1 and even Fox
News and MSNBC the service will also
offer access to YouTube's original shows
which are available for subscribers in
its YouTube read service YouTube TV will
also offer access to the short time and
fox soccer plus premium channels for an
additional fee now that's all very
exciting but let's get real for a moment
Google is entering a very crowded market
let me read the list there's already
sling TV PlayStation View DirecTV now
and Hulu it plans to launch a similar
service very soon that's going to be
tough
Google plans to release a separate
YouTube TV app for Android and iOS and
you'll also be able to stream the video
from those apps to your big TV with a
chromecast dongle or with a chromecast
built in smart TV there's no word yet if
a YouTube TV subscription will also
include support for YouTube red features
like getting rid of ads or offline
viewing of video now this could work but
I do have some doubts you see the next
generation they consume videos that are
made in completely different formats
right I mean they love their Walking
Dead and Game of Thrones I don't want my
kids watch Game of Thrones but they do
watch The Walking Dead and you know big
massive dramas like that people like
that and they might pay for a
subscription to watch something like
that I know I would but
the whole next generation doesn't like
sitcoms rom-coms traditional newscast
and stuff like that
is it really worth $35 a month or more
to pay for those select shows that you
like that only happen you know 12 weeks
of the year I don't know what do you
think let me know in the comments below
I would pay 40 bucks a month maybe in 50
bucks a month to be able to watch Game
of Thrones The Walking Dead when it
comes out on any device I want in
high-definition and I don't have to go
to nefarious sites to consume it but I'm
not so sure those of you who are under
20 would do that let me know educate me
