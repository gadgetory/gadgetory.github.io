we're just talking about the details you
can see on this lady's face is a really
bright screen but you may notice if you
look at the sign here this has smart
display let it switch over off of my
Windows machine over to and you're going
to see pop up kit test this is our new
smart display and in terms of the actual
design and the different elements that
are here on the MX leave the best way
for me to describe it is this is kind of
what an iphone 3 would look like a data
5-inch screen
starting at 99 u.s. dollars thank you
and now at ces2014 we've moved over to
huawei and looked at an updated version
of a phone that we really loved one year
ago at CES 2013
but now they've taken the great package
of the c1 and brought it down to size in
a package that is not only accessible
but is incredibly powerful and should be
one of our favorites on this show

for me as well jon rettinger
