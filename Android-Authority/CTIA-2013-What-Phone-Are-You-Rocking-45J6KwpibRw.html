phone are you rocking so I have three
phones that I use regular basis said i
have an iphone i have an android phone
and i actually have a nokia 364 yes what
phone are you rocking right now i have
an iphone 4s rest and i'm here with jen
who is with toast as you can see behind
us I gotta ask the question what fun are
you rocking right now i'm currently
using an iphone 4 and i love it it's
really small fits in my pocket my kids
love it as well so you know when we have
those moments where we need to kill some
time you know my three and five year old
love it as well i'm rocking an iphone 4s
right now i am just way behind the times
always have been you know it's one of
those things where every time i get
really close to upgrading and getting a
new device something else comes out and
kind of makes me want it so it's just a
matter to be really really indecisive
yeah iphone 5 yep obviously with a toast
cover on it so what brought you to the
iphone 5 um i went through a 4 and you
know I honestly didn't think I'd be
needed the five until I actually held
one and obviously because I developed
covers I needed the new one to develop
cover for so it's a good excuse to buy
one I still like actually nokia phones a
lot and because it's a it allows me to
do all kinds the customization of course
you know i under an iphone you can you
know you can down you know you can
install a lot of phones or you can root
it you know you can do you can mess with
your phones but i've been doing this for
the c64 quite a long time so so you know
it's a phone that i really like but i
would say you know it's getting a little
bit dated so uh okay exactly so right
now i think that a probably android
phone is is what I like the best yeah
why are you using iphone for us i would
like to say because it has great
features and i love it and it's so cool
but it's mostly because it's fur
popular a lot of people use it they've
showed me how to use it properly and
correctly all my friends do it and it's
easy to use and I know it's really
reliable that's what I need cuz I travel
a lot is there a phone out there that
you really want the one that I have not
played with a whole lot that I hear
really great things about I'm really
intrigued with is the HTC One so I've
been hearing that from everybody so far
yeah I actually like to get the HTC One
if you want oh yeah looking forward to
doing the HTC One it looks like a nice
industrial design pro product and it's
going to be good application for our
products I think the HTC One anyone is
super interesting and I really find it
pretty cool and the screen resolution is
pretty amazing and I like the dual
speakers and I just feel like it's a
very awesome phone so that's something
i'd like to try out first I've seen it
one time here at the show I haven't
played with it outside of that just
couple of minutes of dancing around with
it it's a really really great device
feels really good in the hand and it's
one of those where it's like I can see
myself maybe upgrading to it but it's
again it's making a decision and
sometimes I'm not the best at that is
there a phone out there right now that
you just really want i guess i would say
the next generation of an iphone but I'm
totally open to something else what I'm
a little worried is that I've gotten so
used to this platform that it's like
something new is scary and so I would be
totally open to something else if if
it's a way better than what i'm working
with now i think if i had to upgrade I'd
probably just go straight to the iphone
5 maybe wait for the 5s to come out but
that's my next step well 5s or hopefully
60 know their do we don't even know yet
all right well Jen thank you very much
thank you once again is Josh a are
from the floor at ctia 2013 i'm here
with toast we're having some fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
