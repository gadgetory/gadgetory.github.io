handy the Android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly this
last week we saw a lot of stuff about
Android L and the latest Nexus devices
but there were still some awesome app
things that happened and we're gonna
check them out first up this week
CyanogenMod has released their official
camera application to the Google Play
Store the good news is that it's in the
Play Store of course the bad news is
that you have to be running cm 11 s in
order to download and install it for
those who don't know CM 11 s is the
software that runs on the oneplus one
ostensibly this is so cm can update
their camera application faster without
issuing system updates much like how
other OEMs namely HTC are doing with
their proprietary apps if you're using
cm 11s then you can pick this up in the
Google Play Store right now of all the
companies that could be working on
Android wear keyboard right now did you
expect any of them to be Microsoft yeah
me either yes friends Microsoft is
working on a keyboard for Android wear
it's still in the alpha beta stage but
it is available for download for those
tech-savvy individuals who want to try
it out it's essentially a handwriting
recognition keyboard that lets you write
words on your Android wear device we
don't know how useful it'll be but with
a good prediction engine so people only
have to write a few letters at a time we
could see this being something that
people use fairly often
best of luck Microsoft I'm rootin for ya
over this last weekend a developer
figured out a way to play fallout 1 and
fallout 2 on Android we recommend that
only the tech savvy among our viewership
try it out because there is some
assembly required and it does require
one to be a little bit knowledgeable in
software essentially you'll be using a
modified Windows 95 virtual disk which
will then run on an emulator on your
device there is a tutorial video for
those who want to follow along and we'll
have that link in the written companion
which is in the video description below
so when we covered that fallout thing I
just talked about jonathan pryce said
that there was no way that fallout 1 or
fallout 2 could run on Android wear like
Windows 95 did last week the guy who got
windows 95 running on Android wear last
week was all like
challenge accepted we're not kidding
either this is something that actually
happened
the developers name is Corbin Davenport
and about three days after we postulated
that fallout 1 &amp;amp; 2 couldn't be run
Android where he made us eat our words
by running fallout 1 on Android wear now
you may be wondering if this is useful
and the answer is no these sorts of
projects are really just proof of
concept to show that they can be done
and the developers that do them do so
because they can and it's fun well
played Mr Davenport well played oh and
before I forget Corbin Davenport also
got Game Boy Color games running on
Android wear and those actually run
pretty well unlike fallout in Windows 95
Game Boy Color games actually run fairly
well on Android wear arguably the more
interesting part of this video is that
the Moga controller seems to work just
fine on at least one Android wear device
it's a complicated process to get
everything up and running but if you've
always wanted to play Game Boy Color
games on a watch that's attached to a
Bluetooth controller that's now
something that can be done so who wants
to see some trending applications as
usual if you want to check any of these
applications out you can find the links
in the written companion which is in the
video description below
pretty contact list has only been out
for a couple of weeks but it seems to be
growing in popularity by the moment it's
a contact and dialer application that
fuses card UI with the little material
design and that makes the app look
really good there are also a number of
features that you can get here that you
don't see in regular contact
applications it's free to use with
in-app purchases camera 51 is a newer
camera application and it's aimed at
people who are not very good at
photography the app uses a proprietary
engine to help you aim your camera where
it needs to be aimed at to get
everything you should need in a photo
this is also fairly useful for people
who take a lot of selfies it's totally
free with no in-app purchases and if
you're pretty bad with a camera you
should definitely try this one out notes
if widget is a unique application that
allows you to check your notifications
almost anywhere it comes with a home
screen widget as well as a lockscreen
widget that allow you to check and
dismiss notifications there is also
daydream support so you can check and
dismiss notifications without waking up
your device from daydream mode it's just
over a buck which is a good price if
you're interested check it out
supersu got a huge update this last week
to prepare itself for a lot of exciting
things that are coming up including
Android L and Android TV there is of
course a huge list of other things
including bug fixes performance
improvements and architecture-specific
binaries for all versions of Android it
also has Amazon App Store support now
which is always good news a while back
the original Dragon Quest was
re-released on Android by Square Enix
and we figured it was only a matter of
time before they started porting more of
them as per the norm people who are huge
fans of Square Enix games JRPGs in
general or retro graphics would probably
get a kick out of this title it takes
place 100 years after the end of the
first Dragon Quest so you should
probably play that one first
it's $5 in the Google Play Store which
isn't bad because this game is pretty
long if you want to see the latest and
greatest in Android app news and reviews
