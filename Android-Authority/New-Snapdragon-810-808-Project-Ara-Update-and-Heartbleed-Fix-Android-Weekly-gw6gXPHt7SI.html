brought to you by Linda calm go to
lynda.com forward slash Android to learn
more welcome back to Android weekly my
name is Jason in this past week we saw a
boost in power with two new snapdragons
for all those of you who are still
hungry for some but we also had some bad
news about the heartbleed vulnerability
we're gonna talk about what it means for
you and how to protect yourself from it
but there is little that can get me down
this weekend because on friday i got a
new girlfriend she came in a package and
i haven't been able to keep my hands off
her all weekend and why I call her name
she listens ok Google I love you I never
get sick of that that's right puppy's
neck sir sighs I'm so happy I'm in love
with Android again Andrew it actually
works that's great I must say this is a
amazeballs phone I in love with it I'm
going to talk about my experience with
it in detail at the next Android QA but
I'm happy let's get to the knees
alrighty then so Qualcomm just lifted
the veil on two new systems on a chip
that will power the new flagship phones
for 2015 and they are the Snapdragon 808
and the Snapdragon 810 now the
Snapdragon 810 is the higher end of the
pair and its main features include for
cortex a57 cores and for cortex a53
cores now these octo cores provide a
twenty-five to fifty five percent
performance boost over the cortex a15
along with a twenty percent increase in
the power draw now before you battery
bugs get too concerned you should know
that both the 808 and the 810 are built
on a 20 nanometer process instead of a
28 nanometer process which means that
that smaller die should offset the
increased power consumption for those of
you concerned with graphics the adrenal
418 GPU on the Snapdragon 808 should
provide a 20-percent performance boost
over the audrina 330 that's currently in
the galaxy s5 and the HTC
One m8 the Audrina 430 GPU on the 810 is
even faster with an estimated eighty
percent increase over the Snapdragon 801
oh it's alright you still have a fine
Snapdragon 800 you've been on to
confirmation about the beast of a phone
called the oneplus one recent news
regarding the oneplus one confirms three
important things one it has the fastest
system-on-a-chip currently on the market
to the GPU on the 801 is faster because
it's clocked at 578 megahertz the
Snapdragon 801 features the newer emmc
five-point oh stand ered this means that
copying and moving data to internal
storage could be significantly faster so
for those of you who may have been
living in our rock dust past week I need
to tell you about something called
heartbleed heartbleed is not a virus
contrary to what some people are
reporting it is simply a vulnerability
in the open SSL encryption library in
translated geek speek that means that
cyber criminals or even government
agencies can eavesdrop on your traffic
or otherwise private data that should
have been going through a supposedly so
obscure connection not so secure though
so there's three things that you need to
do about that soon as soon as possible
one when and only when a service like
bitcasa for example I'm subscriber to
picasa because they emailed me and said
okay we're aware of this vulnerability
we patched it on our end and we've
logged you out of the service so you can
log back in and change your password if
you do it before that service has
patched it on their end and you log in
with your password and change it you're
just leaving yourself to further
vulnerabilities so make sure that
service has patched it on their end
google has done all this already so
that's not a concern the second thing
you need to do is use a service called
LastPass LastPass allows you to create
one strong password and then generates
other passwords on its own for all your
other social profiles you only have to
remember one password that's a great
thing number three please pass this on
to your non geek friends and show them
what to do because we all need to
protect our personal privacy
hey Linda yeah Jace here listen you know
how people are busting blood vessels
over this heartbleed bug yeah it's the
openssl vulnerability that has people
going yeah well do you have tutorials
that teach people how to properly secure
a server because that would help a lot
and boy does she ever lynda.com has
tutorials on best practices for physical
instance network and file system
security you can learn all bat for free
trial indicom for seven days by visiting
Linda calm /and droid moving on the news
that's going to make many of you happy
about project ara so for those of you
who don't know what project ara is it is
an initiative by Google that allows you
to upgrade individual components of your
phone so for example if I have a phone
and I've had it for you know 18 months
and the system other chips getting a
little slow I could then go to a
marketplace and buy a new system on a
chip and install that on the phone as a
module instead of buying a whole new
phone fantastic very exciting now as we
reported in the past project ara
employees and endoskeleton of sorts that
allows you to plug in these various
modules but what is new is that now we
know project ara will support three
different form factors a mini and medium
and a large that's pretty cool and if
you'd like to read the article on
android authority com you'll see that
they go into detail explaining how the
project re intends to go far beyond just
customizing the typical ram cpu and
storage looking forward to it
