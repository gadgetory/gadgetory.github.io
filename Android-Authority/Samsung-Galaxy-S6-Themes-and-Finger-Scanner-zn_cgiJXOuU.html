authority what's going on everybody and
here I have the Samsung Galaxy s6 back
in my hands this metal-clad phone that
has one made a bit of a splash not just
because of the fact that it has a
different design that allows you no
longer to get into the battery and the
micro SD card slot because they don't
exist at this point in this unibody
design that has has a dual glass panel
construction but also because the
software underneath and that's exactly
we're going to be looking at right now I
just wanted to go through some of the
elements here and sort of showcase once
again just how fluid this version of
TouchWiz is and actually we have been
told that TouchWiz isn't necessarily
going to be what they're going to be
calling this software all over the place
anymore there's kind of rebranding
themselves if you haven't noticed
already there is a different font to the
logo itself for a galaxy and whatnot and
you know there's some changes going on
very subtle ones and is really the best
way to describe how the software
experience has kind of gotten better on
the s6 you'll see these transitions all
going quite nicely in and out of
everything these lollipop additions like
the card view inside of the recent apps
screen you have a notification drop-down
that very light nicely comes down from
there if you hit an application it'll
come up from the bottom and then if you
go away it'll come back down that way
now these animations are very slightly
different than the ones that were in the
samsung galaxy note 4 for example which
I just did a versus on and you should be
able to see it here on the channel but
really just all these little animations
just all look quite nice and really it
they all kind of go through very easily
I have had no problems with performance
thus far and a few times that I have
used this particular device and honestly
when I first get my hands on a review
unit I'm really looking forward to
putting its performance through its
paces because it has an exceedance
underneath I'm just kind of going
through the elements here I did want to
show you one particular edition that is
here called the theme store now the
theme store is a little bit different
added into TouchWiz this time around and
you are able to finally change the look
and feel of your
Android OS using all of the all of the
things that are inside of their theme
store you can also go through a menu
area here and look at the purchase ones
that you have and also see some of the
settings here but really it's just a
matter of changing the look all around
I'll go to the my themes area and here
we are with a few that are already
pre-installed including an Avengers 1
and I'll show you that one right now
applying the theme quite nicely
and there it is like all of the
different elements are now changed in
terms of their color the icons are also
different as well as you can see down
here going through the elements on the
side you could already see that a lot of
the elements are definitely the same but
the look the wallpaper the background
icons the colors all over the place are
all different now which is actually kind
of nice
theming not necessarily a very big
aspect to previous versions of this
operating system but now it looks like
it's going to be a very big feature
going forward for a lot of these OEMs
let's go back to the default one this is
just the regular touch ways that
everyone is very familiar with but I
also want to show you another feature
that is in here as well now it's not
necessarily new but they did change it
around this time and it is the
fingerprint scanning head down here to
the
lock screen of security and then to the
fingerprint now this is a touch version
you can see the tactile home button is
down here on the bottom and we will be
able to use it just by pressing our
finger down there you can verify a
Samsung Account do some web sign ins
here you could enter in the username and
password in order to make your
fingerprint your website in four place
is quite nice and then paying with
paypal samsung pay will also be a thing
but that is something we're going to
figure you out later on when we get our
review unit so let's add a fingerprint
place finger on the HOME key lift it off
and repeat we're going to keep changing
it over and over again I'm going to go
ahead and do it in this angle a little
bit more practical and there you go we
have the fingerprint lock set up right
here so we also put in a password and as
a backup but if we go over here one of
the great parts about this particular
form of locking the phone is that if you
want to press your your button your
button right here just using your thumb
that is already put in there as a
fingerprint you will usually unlock the
phone just leave your finger on there
and it unlocks quite easily and we've
seen this kind of iteration on
particular phones already like the oppo
n3 with its rear facing fingerprint
scanner and now we have one on the front
right here and it's a really great
implementation makes it really easy to
just unlock it unlock a device and get
in there quite quickly now obviously
you're going to be putting multiple
fingerprints on here from time to time
and yes you have to have it on there
just right in order for it to work but
nonetheless once you do it's really not
that difficult at all so that was just a
look at the software on here I just
wanted to give you a quick look in this
one angled shot in order to show you the
different features that are inside of
here that might be a little bit
different from previous versions of
TouchWiz like I said already there's
already a nice fluidity to it and it's
really just it feels like it's really
fast I don't have any problems with a
stutter or anything like that very few
if any but definitely a lot less than I
have ever experienced before in
version from Samsung's operating system
so keep it in to Android only for off
the best coverage and don't forget to
keep it tuned here for a future review
of the Samsung Galaxy s6 and qubit
