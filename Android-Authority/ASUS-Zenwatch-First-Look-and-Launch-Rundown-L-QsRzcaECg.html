coming out with Android wear on them
which is no surprise but a soos just
came out with one today and we actually
think it looks pretty damn great hey
it's Josh magar from Android authority
what's going on everybody and this is
your a soos premiere event rundown now
before I even get into the launch of the
actual devices we did have a few of them
there were some laptops and also a new
memo pad which we'll take a look at
pretty soon but these n watches what
we're looking at here but I did want to
just put a couple words out there about
the venue that we're in you can see all
these classic cars behind me I am in
heaven right now because we're seeing so
many of these awesomeness everything
from Mercedes to Lotus to all these
beautiful Lamborghinis and everything
inside of this wonderful venue I don't
even know the name of the building we're
in but once we got in here and we tried
to get registered I just saw all the
cars I knew I had to do the rundown out
here but anyway let's go ahead and take
a look at the actual event itself it was
pretty much a standard affair from a
soos they always have some pretty flashy
effects when it comes to their
unveilings and whatnot and it's always
really high-energy which I thought was
great
but from there we also had even the Zen
watch the premiere itself where after
they announced a couple of laptops and a
new Asuza memo pad 7 the watch itself
was unveiled which was really what
everyone was here for after all
wearables are a big thing this year and
we're really looking to see what the
different companies are going to be
putting out in terms of the designs and
these software enhancements on top of
Android wear and a sous definitely did
that with their Zen watch so what we
have here is a pretty nice body and
you're gonna see some clips right here
the devices themselves were actually
tethered so I'm giving you a live look
at what we're looking at here with the
Zen watch pretty much maybe in a couple
days I'm going to try and give you a
more hands-on look a more in-depth look
at the actual watch itself but for now
take a look at these clips where we have
a metal design around the actual watch
face itself and the unit is actually not
too big and it actually is a little bit
thinner than some of the other ones that
I've seen at least by my estimation it
really does contour to the wrist a
little bit and the glass I think is what
I what I really like about this
particular watch what we're seeing here
is the term coined a 2.5 D glass which
kind of curves around it's a little bit
more akin to the kind of watches you
would see aside from these smart watches
if you have if you're a big watch
connoisseur you'll kind of see that bit
of Mo motif on the Zen watch here but
after that the metal actually has a bit
of a brown color to it to match what we
saw which was the brown leather strap
that they said was Italian leather which
i think is pretty interesting but it
actually looks really nice all around it
actually really looks like what a watch
would look like except it's not analog
it is purely digital with Android wear
underneath now the connection to the
different Zen phones and the Zen or
merit rather than email pad and what not
that you can have between the watch and
those particular devices will allow for
a little bit more functionality you will
probably have some extra functions the
ones we saw was a tap tap in order to
find your phone and a remote shutter
application that was in there but it's
really just those are really just
enhancements on top of what is already
basically an Android wear device and you
can see here the Android wear is pretty
much what you would expect it to be it
stole is it still looks about the same
what you would expect with all of the
different cards and notifications the
ability to reply to messages and do a
couple of extra things depending on the
particular notifications that you have
but all in all we do see some really
great things coming from as soon as we
continue to at least and the Zen watch
is no exception it also if you look at
the backing of it it does have those
pins on the bottom that will probably
that probably means that it will be
laying down on a particular charging
dock which is perfectly fine but we also
have a heart rate monitor on there
because health isn't yet another focus
that masseuse has when it comes to the
Zen watch but anyway that's just a quick
look at the Asus is the Zen watch and of
course like I said I'm gonna try to give
you guys an in-depth look at the watch
it south or I'll probably have that
Android wear demo on its tail so we're
not gonna see too much by way of its
usage
but nonetheless I do want to give you
sort of a better look at it by actually
putting it on and whatnot but for now we
have this live look once again we are
here at the asou spre meer event and
we're here at Aoife in berlin the show
hasn't even started but we have all of
these events leading up to it so keep it
tuned to android authority because we
are your source for all things Eva</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
