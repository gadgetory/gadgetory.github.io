Android Authority calm today I've got an
app review of the adapt text beta
keyboard now we're just going to be
using the lg optimus 4x HD and I'm gonna
compose a memo to show you the adapt
text keyboard now as you can see here it
has a nice clean layout it's very cool
looking and you can see that we have our
suggestion bar on top which is one of
the main features of the adapt X
keyboard it is really pushing for the
suggestions and the predictions and then
we also have automatic text replacement
which is a very cool intuitive feature
but we'll just walk through some of
these simple steps with the adapt X
keyboard to start off now this is our
adapt text menu if we long press but if
we don't long press we can just access
our numbers and our punctuation and
we've got two pages of that
I'll just go through there we can go
back as you can see every single key if
you long press it accesses the icon in
blue above the letter or the piece of
punctuation whenever you're using we
have our voice input we've got our
capitalization this is a very cool share
to networks social media sort of option
that I'll show you here in a second and
then we have our suggestion bar with
drop-down menu to show us the rest of
these suggestions now I'll go into the
Adaptec settings before actually done
with the keyboard by long pressing the
adapt X button there see we have our
private mode off which stops the
keyboard from learning the words you
type so if you want to type some naughty
messages to your girlfriend or whatnot
um we've got our layouts we can remove
the accents and diacritics we can access
our settings and we can access our ATR
options so I'll just go to the settings
super quick we have our my dictionary
which is the list of words that the
adapt X keyboard has learned from your
use we have our add-on manager and the
add-ons have a lot of different options
we can see here that we have the English
us selected as the current keyboard
language you can also choose a business
us and because they're Industry specific
there's like medical and there's IT
industry also got our English for the UK
there's a bunch of different languages
you can all download from the Play Store
and then we can print out prioritize our
add-ons so if we have more than one we
can choose which one is actually the
priority in which one it will predict
more than often than not so we can go
back we can personalize our suggestions
by logging
into some social accounts such as
Facebook or Twitter or we can also
import the Android keyboard into learn
such as the words we've already typed on
the Android keyboard before using the
adapt X beta we have our automatic text
replacement on which I'll show you here
in a minute where we can go to our
shortcuts and expansions so as you see
here HR you when you type it in would
expand to how are you but I'll actually
add one just so we can demo it in the
video and I'll do I AF loops a which
will expand to I am fine so we'll just
save that for further use here in a
minute
anyways we have our auto correction and
we have the auto correction mode we can
have extended character bubbles and we
can choose our interactive feedback
settings whether we want the haptic
feedback the vibrate or the sound on
press then we can go to a liking adapt
text on Facebook and we can rate them
but anyways we'll just demo some of the
actual keyboards use on the memo here so
I as I begin typing we can actually see
that it'll protect typing and I'll put a
comma the adapt text keyboard learns
what I type as you can see there it
suggested some stuff there in the
suggestion bar and we can also drop it
down to some just more but we cannot go
down here and I'll show you some of the
ATR the automatic text replacement where
we can press each are you and will just
press the one with the plus button and
expands to hi how are you and we can do
the iaf whoops always hitting you know I
AF I'm fine so we have our automatic
text replacement feature which is very
cool it's an intuitive feature by the
adapt text keyboard now to access the
languages we're actually doing this in
we can long press the English there and
if we have more download that we can
access them there or we can drop down
the keyboard and if we've long press
here it will just go away but anyways
you can um let's see have a status
worthy sentence and if I want to post
that I can long press the social media
button and we can post to Facebook
Twitter and more now if you want to log
in with your Facebook you can do so or
you can log in with your Twitter but you
can simply just click one of those and
it will post to your social network of
choice so that's basically the adapt
text keyboard guys you can check out the
beta version of the Play Store right now
and so I would suggest checking it out
and if you like the videos stay updated
