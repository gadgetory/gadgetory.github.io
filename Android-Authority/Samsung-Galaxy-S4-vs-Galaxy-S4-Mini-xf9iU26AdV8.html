latest iteration and as a result got
shrunken down but how does the little
sibling stack up against the big one hey
it's Josh of a guard from Android 30
what's going on everybody and this is
the Samsung Galaxy s4 versus the Samsung
Galaxy s4 mini even at a first glance
design is a bit of a no-brainer the
Galaxy s4 mini is literally the smaller
version of the s4 everything from the
plastic build of the rounded corners the
silver spine and even the button layout
has been brought down to size the s4
mini is a little bit slimmer a little
thinner and a little shorter than the s4
making it also lighter all around and
that would be the main difference the
4.3 inch screen makes the entire body
easy to handle in one hand which is a
very refreshing feeling compared to all
of the larger devices out there in the
hand it is easy to throw around because
of its light profile if you thought idly
tossing around the s4 was a little
dangerous you might feel more
comfortable doing so with the mini
overall if it comes down to your
personal comfort the Galaxy s4 is the
best handling five-inch screen device
out there but in reality it really isn't
for everyone so then maybe that's where
the s4 mini comes in the displays are
both Super AMOLED performers with the
usual high saturation and good contrast
the galaxy s4 has the 5 inch screen
capable of 1080p resolution and 441 PPI
a larger screen makes it easier to play
games view movies and read text
especially considering the high pixel
density lending to good sharpness the s4
is a great example of why 5-inch screens
are pretty damn cool but then again the
s4 mini is a good example of how good a
smaller screen can be this 4.3 inch
display is capable of 960 by 540
resolution at 256 PPI I still think a
720p resolution screen could have been
possible here but this screen is
nonetheless a good performer the lowered
pixel density definitely makes smaller
text harder to read and if you view
media and play games the smallest screen
might not be the most comfortable for
getting pretty much any typical tasks
done the Mini is more than capable
though and when it's so easy to use that
just might be a good trade-off the
performance aspect is a battle of mid
and top-tier packages what is nice is
that the changes are
leaves proportional the galaxy s4 has
the Snapdragon 600 clocked in at 1.9
gigahertz backed by the audrina 320 and
2 gigabytes of RAM this is the package
that powers all of the top phones these
days and works wonderfully no lag
whatsoever in the UI and intensive apps
are handled with ease the mini gets the
Snapdragon 400 the dual-core variant
that is clocked in at 1.7 gigahertz you
then get the audrina 305 and 1.5
gigabytes of ram even if it is a lower
performer overall I didn't have much
trouble using the mini for just about
any task very intensive games obviously
did show a little lag at some points but
it wasn't anything drastic nor did it
hinder from the experience scores put
the mini about 10,000 points below the
s4 which really comes as no surprise but
ultimately if you really need the best
of the best out of everything you do the
s4 is the obvious choice otherwise most
regular users will find the mini capable
of doing just about anything they might
need the hardware department is where
things really change up Samsung did want
to make a smaller version of their
flagship phone but in the end the s4
remains the king of the galaxy line
afterall the s4 comes with all of the
sensors and extras that you kind of
didn't really maybe sort of asked for
sensors for temperature a barometer
motion sensors for hand gestures and
even a sensitive screen for air viewing
all accompanied this device perhaps the
most sought after features are the
removable battery and the micro SD card
slot those are features that do return
in the mini only 8 gigabytes of storage
come here so that micro SD card
definitely helps all those sensors are
absent though so that means no hand or
air gestures no eye scrolling none of
that so the mini is a little more
simplistic in its approach the IR
blaster does return though so you can
control your TV or related devices with
this phone this version of the s4 mini
is capable of handling 2 SIM cards which
is great for travelers multiple versions
of either phone are available so be sure
of which one you get for your network in
the end it comes down to what you want
all the extras in the original s4 might
be appealing to you but for a more
classical way of navigating your phone
the s4 minis got your back size matters
once again in the battery department the
galaxy s4 had a very impressive battery
life with its 2600 milliamp hour
removable unit while the s4 mini comes
with a 1900 milliamp
our removable battery spares are always
pretty handy for power users when it
comes to pure battery life it seems that
the lowered specs over all of the main e
do help it even out coupled with battery
saving features both of these phones are
easily able to get through a normal
day's work the galaxy s4 might get a
little more than a day with the right
usage something that the s4 mini may
fall just short of need as much juice as
possible well the s4 may be the choice
for you and now we come to the cameras
which is another example of the
proportional change from the s4 to the
Mini 13 megapixels are what you get with
the original s4 along with a full
featured app you get pretty much
anything you could want to make your
smartphone photography more fun drama
modes eraser modes dual recording the
works picture quality puts it among the
best with great detail and color
reproduction and then you get the 8
megapixel shooter in the s4 mini
essentially a performer much like the
flagships of yesteryear its app does get
stripped down and doesn't include as
many extras as the one in the s4 no dual
recording or drama and eraser modes
pictures are obviously smaller for the
mini but they provide just about the
same level of quality you can rest
assured that the pictures you get from
either phone will be satisfactory if you
want to get creative with what the s4
gives you to play with then you can go
for the original but the simpler
approach of the mini manages to still
bring very good quality finally the
software you get the love it or hated
user interface of TouchWiz here only
either is bigger or smaller otherwise
there's not much difference obviously
because of the hardware aspect the
original s4 gets all of the extra
navigational features like ham gestures
and air view apps bundled in include s
voice group play watch on and s-health
it is a very complete package that
thankfully benefited from the larger
screen they usually bloated an Oubre
colourful interface works well on the
5-inch screen which is why it's actually
nice that TouchWiz has scaled down well
enough to look good on the minis smaller
screen it doesn't turn out too crowded
and is still easy enough on the eyes for
easy usage it doesn't come with all of
the extra navigation options and as far
as apps go it doesn't include s-health
pre-installed but other than that you're
looking at pretty much the same general
experience this one comes down to
whether or not you
the new ways introduced by the s4 to
navigate with the galaxy s4 having been
out for a little while already its price
has come down but still remains as much
as $700 unlocked or up to 199 dollars
with a contract we don't know as much
about the minis price points but it may
likely come around the $500 mark
unlocked and so there you have it the
galaxy s4 is no doubt one of the top
phones on the market today but Samsung
isn't about to rest on its laurels with
so many different versions of the s4
soon to come out the Mini is admittedly
a very refreshing experience
today's general offerings in yesterday's
form factor and you know what it works
pretty well the s4 mini is a phone that
anyone can easily use and thus has its
place but if you really want to be on
the cutting edge the s4 is still king if
