what's going on everybody and we're here
with motorola kicking it with them so we
can take a look at to the Moto 360 the
Moto X the brand new one but this is
also in their lineup the brand new Moto
G now a lot of people really love to the
Moto G from last year especially because
it brought an affordable price point for
us some very powerful features and was
one of the most accessible Android
packages I was available at the time and
it continues to do so now we have the
Moto G right here now we're not going to
be getting 4g on this particular version
but pretty much everything else has been
beefed up this 5 inch screen has the
720p resolution but underneath we have
these stab dragon 400 which is exactly
what you need for all of the general
tasks throughout the day now if you look
at the front here we also have the front
facing speakers which provide a nice
media experience for those of you who
want to share your media to with other
people rather than just having the
headset available and underneath we have
the available stock Android build that
does have some moto additions that are
available as well but for all in all
this is one of the most accessible
handsets that are available and now
comes in a larger size which is
beautiful now what we have on the sides
is a bit of a sort of really curved look
kind of a pebble light curve and we have
the buttons right here which all feel
really medium that's perfectly fine and
then on the back we have this black
version now there are going to be shells
of all different kinds of colors I will
be available this is black we saw white
and there were a bunch of shells that
were detached from their phones with
various colors like turquoise and plenty
of the ones from there looking a little
bit more around the sides we have even
more right there and basically what we
have here oh you're seeing Motorola
alert that returns as well here on the
Moto G but essentially what is
underneath includes also an eight
megapixel camera and a micro SD card
slot that is underneath this removable
cover and you also have the front facing
camera obviously for your selfie game
but the Moto G once again returns and it
looks like it's going to be a great
offering and we're really excited to see
it hit the market and be one of the most
affordable and really accessible devices
are available out there i have seen
plenty of people using the original moto
g and this upgrade will probably be
entice them just as much as it entices
us in the budget market so keep it tuned
to android authority for even more
coverage not adjust of Aoife but also of
all of these great Motorola devices that
we have been checking out here at Aoife
in Berlin and we're going
to continue to do so because we are your
source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
