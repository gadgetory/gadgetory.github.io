MWC 2018 but you do have to give them
credit for pushing the boundaries on
what's possible in a smartphone we
already did a hands-on with the new Sony
xz2 but we wanted to give you a rundown
of the coolest new features of the
device so let's get started first up
we've got ultra slow motion 960 FPS
video at 1080p resolution we first saw
this framerate in last year's xz1 but
only recorded 720p resolutions so this
is a huge step up in video fidelity you
did need a huge amount of light to get a
good quality image and you probably
still do but this would be great for
video producers who are trying to shoot
some experimental video without the need
for a super expensive camera rig next
we've got the newly redesigned vibration
motor Sony is using a new proprietary
algorithm which analyzes the audio data
from your movies music and games to help
you become more immersed in the content
sony says this idea is taken in part
from the dual shot controllers on the
PlayStation 4 but I would characterize
it more similarly to the HD Rumble
capabilities of the Nintendo switch you
can adjust this motor with an additional
slider in the system so you won't have
to hear your YouTube videos rumbling if
you're watching them on the table third
we've got an updated 3d imaging feature
the XZ 1 gave us the ability to scan
people's faces with the bat camera to
create a 3d model but the XZ 2 is making
this even easier with the addition of
the front camera you only have to pass
the phone by your face a few times to
get an accurate model of yourself and
somebody says this iteration should have
more detail as well you can still use
the back camera to scan other objects
and you can bring any of these models
into programs like blender Maya and
unity to use as assets in your projects
even though this is a pretty niche
feature it could be really valuable for
3d oriented creatives next we have the
ability to record 10 bit 4k HDR video
now this is pretty crazy because we're
just now getting this feature in
high-end mirrorless bodies like the
Panasonic gh4 cording on
now you can playback this content on the
phone and on other HT are capable
screens and the phone can even convert
regular content into faux HDR content
using a special upscaling algorithm it's
also certified to play official HD are
certified shows from streaming services
like Netflix Amazon Prime video and
YouTube that means there's finally a
device to compete with the razor phone
in terms of streaming fidelity lastly
we've got front-facing speakers with a
built-in DAC for high resolution audio
now Sony did remove the headphone jack
on this phone but that DAC and front
speaker combo will hopefully make you
feel better about needing to use a
dongle for Wired listening
it also supports high res Bluetooth
codecs like apdex HD so as long as
you're using supported Bluetooth
headphones you should get some great
sound quality there are a few other new
features in the XC 2 and XZ 2 compact
but we'll be addressing those in the
full review when we've got some more
time with the device until then make
sure you check out the rest of our MWC
coverage and stay tuned to our social
channels for more content like this
because of course we are your source for
all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
