for making really good value devices so
much so that every time I've reviewed
any kind of fitness tracker from the
likes of Garmin or from Fitbit there's
usually tons of comments down below from
people saying what about the me band it
can do everything that those devices can
but for a fraction of the price and it's
also true when it comes to smart phones
Xiaomi makes a whole host of really
impressively powerful and well-designed
phones considering the very low asking
prices in many cases so the redmi note 5
is the sequel to the redmi note 4 which
was india's best selling phone last year
owing largely to the fact that it could
do so much for such a low asking price
the note 5 pro is a slightly more
premium and feature-packed version of
the note 5 and i'm gonna be looking at
them both here but focusing
predominantly on the note 5 pro because
that one's much more exciting it has a
lot more cool features and it's still
incredibly good value so just what kind
of great value can Xiaomi offer here
well I thought a fun experiment would be
to use the phone for a bit the redmi
note 5 pro to see how i found it and
whether i enjoyed using it and then to
give it a price that I thought would be
fair for that device that I'd be willing
to pay I've been watching too much for
and abed apparently we would expect to
pay 50 powers to thousands in the night
look up the price and see how far off
the mark I was so I gave this device a
price that I would be happy to pay a 400
quid and then I looked up and found that
it was actually thirteen thousand nine
hundred and ninety nine rupees and that
actually equates to about a hundred and
fifty quid so significantly cheaper to
put into perspective that's about two
hundred and fifteen dollars was I
thought it was worth about five hundred
and fifty dollars so that's very
impressive but it's not perfect and it
might not be for you so let's take a
look at where it cut corners and where
it manages to excel at such a low asking
price so this is the redmi note 5 pro in
terms of the design I think it makes a
pretty good first impression I really
like this sheen on it it's made from
aluminium so it feels good quality and
weighty in the hand it's got nice curves
to it
the dual lens here is quite iPhone ish
the front on the other hand I find
a little bit uninspired it's quite flat
quite white and it doesn't really stand
out I think this is a nicely made phone
but if you're coming from something
really premium oh hello if you're coming
from something really premium I don't
think that it's gonna blow your socks
off that said what is quite impressive
for a budget device is the aspect ratio
this is an 18 by 9 aspect ratio the
screen is 5.99 inches but it still
manages to be nice and slim in the hand
and easy to use with one hand so that's
a very big plus and it's a great to see
on a more budget device it's not bezel
this but they're nice slim bezels and
that gives it a slightly more 2018 look
the screen itself is an IPS LCD display
it's Full HD it has really good colors
it's got good viewing angles nice
brightness you can view it well in
direct sunlight and dark settings so on
the whole it's great for viewing media
and it gets a win in that column one
negative in terms of the screen though
is that it uses an unspecified version
of Gorilla Glass and I have notice that
mine's already picked up some light
scratches and scuffs of course you can
mitigate this by using a screen
protector but not everyone likes they
say that's up to you and part of the
reason they're able to offer that nice
big screen while still having decent
performance is that it's packing the
Snapdragon 6-3 six of the first phone to
debut that chipset this means that you
should get great performance across most
apps swiping through multiple apps and
multitasking isn't a problem I'm using
the four gigabyte of RAM variant but it
also comes with 6 gigabytes of RAM which
of course should provide even better
memory management etc on the whole you
should find that day-to-day use is
perfectly fine I have had it stutter a
couple of times and frees up a couple of
times but again for the price
performance is very nippy the graphics
are provided by an Adreno 509 GPU and
there should be ample for the majority
of games and experiences on the Play
Store with decent performance and frame
rates of course not going to be
competing with those top-end devices
when it comes to benchmark scores but
for real world use that doesn't really
matter so the screens really good for
the price and the performance is ok but
another real standout feature is the
battery you're getting a 4000
our battery here which of course means
excellent longevity long time between
charges I'm getting roughly nine hours
of screen on time which is fantastic
with moderate to even slightly heavy use
you can often get one and a half to two
days without having to charge that's all
great one downside is micro USB which
it's starting to feel really outdated at
this point also means slower transfer
speeds of course and whilst it does in
theory support quick charge account you
don't get an actual quick charger in the
box so you'll have to play around with
that yourself
really though having a four thousand
meter power battery is a really nice
feature on a budget device on any device
I love being able to watch YouTube
without worrying about sapping my power
love being able to leave whatsapp open
so that I can respond to messages whilst
I'm working that's a really cool feature
it's something I'd like to see on more
high-end devices definitely
but what Shambhu I wonder what's got
scratches but what chamois really wants
to promote is the camera in fact they're
calling this India's camera beast
whatever that means at the rear you get
a 12 megapixel primary shooter backed up
by a five megapixel secondary lens and
the reasoning behind that secondary lens
is that you can pull off those bouquet
affects those portrait mode photos that
are so in vogue at the moment around the
front you get a very generous 20
megapixel lens which is perfect for
taking very sharp and crisp looking
selfies in terms of general performance
the camera is somewhat mixed and I
wouldn't say it necessarily lives up to
the title of camera beast in fact I'm
not sure that any phone would live up to
that title the amount of detail in shots
is good but they can look a little bit
washed out and white balance isn't great
you get those gray dull looking skies
and scenery doesn't look quite as eye
popping as it does on a flagship device
of course it's not fair to compare this
with the flagship device the price is
very different but I personally find the
honor 7x which is only slightly more
expensive to have a more interesting and
impressive camera if you're willing to
put in the work the app is also a little
bit uninspiring for instance there's a
manual mode but it actually only gives
you two different options to change the
white balance in the ISO so that could
definitely be improved that Bakke effect
is similarly hit-or-miss
in some photos it can look fantastic
with nicely blurred out backgrounds
looks like you've been to a professional
photo shoot but in other photos the edge
detection isn't so good you might lose
an ear
though you're being painted by Van Gogh
there's also a portrait mode on the
front-facing camera which obviously is
entirely digital but this is more miss
than hit so I'd say give that one a Miss
really though at the moment I think
portrait mode on a device this expensive
is almost always going to be more of a
gimmick than something you actually end
up using a lot and it's certainly fun to
have it there it's nice to play around
with and especially something that isn't
present on a lot of other cameras video
here is also something of a mixed bag
there's no optical stabilization but
electronic stabilization is really quite
impressive actually the big letdown is
that you can only record at 1080p and 30
frames per second even though the
chipset and the lens should support 4k
and in fact if you download a
third-party app like open camera then
you can access the 4k filming that your
camera is natively able to perform the
only thing is then you lose the
stabilization so this is something I'd
like to see in a future update otherwise
quality of life and other features on
this device are actually pretty good on
the whole so you've got fingerprint
unlocking which works really well
there's also face detection which is
surprisingly quick although Xiaomi
themselves admit that it's not very
secure so depends on whether you want
speed or security there's an IR blaster
which I'm really happy to see make of a
turn it never gets old
turning off televisions and frustrating
people why don't manufacturers include
this in their phones anymore there's
also a headphone jack speaking of those
backwards-facing features not all
progressed as forwards as they say
obviously that's going to make a lot of
people very happy in terms of storage
you get either 32 gigabytes or 64
gigabytes depending on whether you
choose the four gig or six gig of ram
variant there is expandable storage and
there's also dual SIM that you can't do
both at the same time so either you'll
have a sim and a hybrid sim or a sim and
an SD card but there should be some
setup there some combination that most
people are happy with by the way the six
and 64 gigabyte edition is sixteen
thousand nine hundred and ninety nine
Indian rupees versus thirteen thousand
nine hundred and ninety nine one
unfortunate letdown on the other hand
though is that this is still running
Android nuga 7.1 which is a bit of a
shame at this point hopefully there's an
update rolled out soon to be honest my
Galaxy S 8 plus is still running new
girl as well here in the UK we're just
used to that
thing it also comes with a skin called
nuit 9 which you know some people like
but personally I'm not a huge fan I
don't think it adds that much other than
a few widgets and things apparently
there's speed optimizations but I'm not
seeing it
myself personally I would prefer to see
stock Android on here and up-to-date
stock Android at that but on the whole I
think that's a pretty darn good showing
for the price so for considerably less
than 200 quid you're getting an 18 by 9
ratio of big full HD screen you're
getting a dual lens camera you get a
four thousand milliamp hour battery and
an IR blaster but on the downside
betraying its status as a budget end
device you've got Android 7 you've got a
skin over the top which you may or may
not like and a camera that produces
slightly washed out photos and a lower
end chipset in there aesthetically it
won't turn heads and you can get some
more premium looking devices even at the
lower end of the price spectrum from the
likes of hmd they've got some really
nice stuff on the way but if you're
happy with those compromises then
there's no denying this really is good
value for money and in terms of the
performance and the features it's right
up there with the best
those flagship manufacturers are going
to really have to watch their backs if
they want to keep justifying those price
hikes and if you want to save even more
money then you have the option of the
redmi note 5 and not pro so this is a
very similar device in terms of the
looks are still 18 by 9 still got the
same 5.9 9 inch screen the same
resolution the camera on the back is
single lens of course but it's very
similar it's still 12 megapixels got the
same aperture etc photos are still great
in terms of detail but a little bit
washed out on the front you get a big
downgrade of sony 5 megapixels but the
video recording on the rear facing
camera is actually an upgrade you can
record in 4k on this one which is a bit
strange but it does inspire hope that
there will be 4k video recording on the
pro soon with an update the chipset is a
downgrade it's the snapdragon 65 with
the Adreno 506 GPU and you might notice
this browsing through the UI is starting
to get a little bit older and you've got
to think in terms of future proofing for
most people if you're picking between
these two devices is worth spending just
that little bit more to get the v pro
and there's enough features and
performance improvements to make that
worthwhile if I had to pick a budget
device myself though I think I'd still
only just go with the honor 7x only
because I really like all this camera
features and the design a little bit
more but again there's more and more
great options for budget phones and the
future is looking very bright for this
price category so thanks ton for
watching guys hope found something
useful and interesting if you did then
