versus the Sony Xperia z2 in terms of
design both of these smartphones retain
quite a bit from their previous
iterations more so for the Xperia z2 but
it does have a few subtle changes and
refinements overall the z2 boasts the
angular design that is something you'd
pretty much only get with Sony devices
the all-glass designed the signature
Sony button layout with the silver power
button and dedicated camera button and
of course the dust and water resistance
features all make a return with the z2
on the other hand the g3 moves away from
the glossy plastic of the g2 to a still
plastic but beautiful metallic finish
back cover
LG's pushed towards a bezel this phone
continues here with the ultra thin
bezels and thin top and bottom borders
allowing for a relatively sleek device
the rear button layout is back as well
but is a lot flatter this time around
but still has a nice refined feel with a
more meaty click to the buttons in terms
of dimensions the g3 is actually a touch
shorter and just a smidge wider than the
z2 which is certainly impressive when
you realize that the g3 has a 5.5 inch
screen and is one of the best-handling
ones of that size with similar sizes the
handling experience is actually what you
would kind of expect them one-handed use
is definitely pushing it on either
device more often than not especially in
the g3 but this is definitely something
that you're going to have to get used to
in either phone anyway so the design
aspect this is definitely after personal
taste but we do have to say that you're
getting a beautiful premium phone no
matter which one of these you choose
Sony's improvements upon the Xperia z2
display comes in at a 5.2 inch IPS LCD
display with a 1080p resolution
resulting in a pixel density of 424
pixels per inch Sony managed to address
a lot of the issues that plagued the
previous versions before the z2 now
offering a fantastic display experience
with good brightness and viewing angles
but as good as that may be the edge does
have to be given to the g3 courtesy of a
great 5.5 inch IPS LCD display with a
resolution of quad HD that's 2560 by
1440 and a pixel density resulting in
534 pixels per inch the signature
brightness and great viewing angles of
the g3 screen are available here and the
display which is in a lot of ways the
hero feature of this device really does
shine through
in terms of performance the g3 and the
z2 feature the best processing package
currently available with the Snapdragon
801 clocked in at 2.5 gigahertz for the
g3 and 2.3 gigahertz for the z2 backed
by the audrina 330 and 2 gigabytes of
RAM for the g3 and 3 for the Xperia z2
as you would expect performance is about
as smooth as it could ever be helped
along with the minimalistic UI of Sony's
device and in this case the revamped and
far smoother software experience found
on the new version of LG's flagship on
the hardware front a lot remains the
same with both of these phones offering
internal storage that is further
expandable via microSD cards of up to
128 gigabytes the g3 also does have a 32
gigabyte version available which will
have the added benefit of 3 gigabytes of
RAM so that is a bit of a change up
there the full suite of connectivity
options also make their way here with
everything ranging from Bluetooth to NFC
to LTE mobile network connections but
when it comes to the speaker Sony has
changed things up a bit by introducing
front-facing speakers on the z2 the
quality is quite good but it's not
mind-blowing but it definitely gets
quite loud and has a quite a bit of
clarity to them the speakers of the g3
remain at the back and I wasn't able to
really test them but they should still
be a little bit more impressive than
what was found in previous LG iterations
the Xperia z2 does pack the larger 32
hundred million power battery compared
to the 3000 milliamp hour unit of the g3
and considering that the g3 needs to
power a larger display and a higher
resolution the battery life out of the
z2 is probably going to be a bit better
at least on paper it's entirely possible
that LG's optimizations will still make
battery life on the g3 at least average
so we're going to have to see what the
battery life tests are like once we get
our hands on a review unit when it comes
to the cameras the Xperia z2 features
the same 20.7 megapixel camera of the z1
but some improvements across the board
now talking about the app you get a ton
of new features like time shift 4k and
selective focus modes the picture
quality is quite good without any of the
smudge enos in the dark areas that we
originally saw in the z1 definitely
improved here the level of grain is
still pretty high though and sharpness
could use a little bit more refinement
but - the colors are captured quite well
and you still get a pretty good photo
what is really kind of a downer at least
for me in the z2 is that you're limited
to 8 megapixels to be able to use all
that it has
offer and the 20-point mega 20.7
megapixel photos rather are really just
a novelty more than ultimately useful
for plenty of users out there
the g3 features a camera setup that is
quite similar to what we found on the G
pro 2 with a 13 megapixel rear shooter
with OIS plus as we've seen before this
camera should perform quite well and the
newly added autofocus laser should also
make a big difference in allowing for
quick autofocus especially when compared
to the g2 when it comes to the software
Sony does believe in keeping things
pretty simple and elegant and that's
something we really like about the
Xperia UI it is pretty much a stock like
experience with Sony quintessential
style and their own additions like the
Walkman the gallery and the small apps
ultimately what we like about the Sony
UI is that when you keep it simple you
keep it fast and they happen to do that
quite well on the Xperia z2 on the other
hand LG is kind of looking to go in that
direction it seems as they're doing away
with the more bloated operating system
from before and now is leaning and now
they're leaning towards a flatter
smoother cleaner and therefore faster
interface LG still packs a ton of
features in though like the qslide apps
the multitasking with the multi window
the NOC code which we saw originally in
the G pro 2 and new additions like LG's
own version kind of of the Google now
card system it's like a concierge
service with a lot of smart abilities
that allow you to get your information
in a nice and clean way a revamped
keyboard and even the ability to use a
quick circle feature that can be seen
inside of the quick circle case that you
can get as an accessory and so there you
have it for this quick look at the LG g3
versus the Sony Xperia z2 these are two
of the best phones out there and then
again all of the flagships are looking
really great this year and once we get
our hands on the review unit of the LG
g3 we will be pitting that phone against
all of the flagship including the z2 in
more in-depth coverage so stay tuned to
android authority for all of that and
future coverage of the LG g3 because we
