manufacturer teams up with the Chinese
smartphone maker well you get a phone
that's both very sexy and all fully
familiar hey guys it's Chris Colin
Phandroid authority here with an
unboxing and first impressions of the
porsche design huawei mate 9 the box the
porsche design mate 9 comes in is pretty
hefty and you'll see why in just a
moment
lifting the lid reveals the beautiful
porsche design mate 9 with its curved
qHD display alongside a certification
card emphasizing Porsches involvement in
the design process portion while we have
been working on this collaboration for
four years and Porsches influence at
least in terms of making a high-priced
object of desire is clear but it's all
highway underneath presentation is
important here because other than a
smaller higher resolution display
additional few gigs of ram relocated
finger scanner and more built-in storage
looks at the only difference between the
regular mate nine and the Porsche
designed version both run the exact same
software and all other specs are
identical let's just take this top layer
up and see what else is in the box
now there's a lot going on here all very
nicely presented for the high-flying
type this phone is arguably targeted at
there's some nice Porsche branded
earbuds equipped with a traditional 3.5
ml jack rather than a USB type-c cable
and there's a little micro USB to USB C
adapter in case you want to keep using
your existing USB cables there's also a
couple of power bricks here both a
European version and one for the UK
these are both the new supercharged
power adapters capable of 3.5 to 5 volt
5 amp charging that'll get you a fully
charged four thousand milliamp hour
battery in just 19 minutes there's also
a USB cable with type a on one end and
type C on the other and there's that
nifty leather case with a darkened
transparent window open it up and you'll
see it's very nicely put together made
of leather with a cutout on the back for
the camera lens to peek out
it's got porsche design stamped on the
front below the window and the Huawei
branding gets relegated to the rear as
far as cases go it's one you might
actually want to use if you get around
to buying this phone finally there's a
box containing manuals a sim eject tool
and your warranty card of course
now if you've already seen our mate nine
hands on an emu i-5 article you'll know
exactly what to expect from the software
on the porsche design variant so we
won't cover that here one of the most
noticeable differences between the
porsche design and the regular made nine
is of course that curve display but it's
worth noting that the curve is much less
pronounced than it is on the galaxy s7
edge it's almost unnoticeable on the
regular may 9 it's a 5.9 inch full HD
screen but the porsche version drops the
size of 5.5 inches but ups the
resolution to qHD interestingly enough
the emui software doesn't have any
specific features directed at the edge
screen below the display is the new
capacitive finger scanner and home
button it works just as quickly as all
flyaway scanners and the lack of a
physical click is a welcome change from
Samsung's physical button navigation
buttons are tiny illuminated dots with
recent apps on the right and back on the
left but you can change this in the
settings or remove the capacitive keys
all together and handle navigation
purely through the home button via
gestures other superficial changes
between the Porsche and regular mate
nines are a redesigned bottom edge with
one following the familiar mate pattern
while the Porsche zooms and iphone6
layout with a headphone jack on one side
and speaker on the other the sensor
layout at the top of the screen is a
little different too and the earpiece is
a little wider than on the normal mate 9
there's also an IR blaster up top in
case you were wondering on the back
things are different again with the
fingerprint scanner replaced by a
Porsche design logo and the dual LEDs
and sensors sitting on top and below the
camera array rather than on either side
of it like on the mate 9 at this point
it's hard to tell if these were
conscious design choices or simply about
making things different to the normal
maintenance on version does away with
plastic antenna caps found on the mate 9
and has antenna bands running
horizontally across the phone instead
just like a real Porsche you're going to
find yourself cleaning this thing all
the time because it collects finger
smudges like a boss and they're much
harder to wipe away fully then on a
glass packed phone like the s7
the only other differences are that huge
256 gig of internal storage which
negates the need for a microSD card slot
and the addition of 6 gig of ram
there's no denying the course design
mate 9 is desirable it looks great
performs great has a display we wish the
regular made 9 had and delivers all the
same benefits you find on the normal may
9 like fast charging onboard machine
learning to keep your phone running
faster for longer dual Leica cameras
with two times lossless zoom 65
scenarios of accidental touch rejection
and 50% smaller 4k video files but did
why we really need to partner with
Porsche designs to basically come up
with a galaxy s7 edge somehow I don't
think so the other problem is that by
setting out to make the porsche design
maintain the absolute best of the best
it also has an astronomical price tag at
1395 euros it's double the price of the
regular maintenance and will only appeal
to a very limited group of people but
that's exactly the point it wasn't made
to be a mass consumer product just as
Porsche cars aren't it's an object of
desire no doubt but by scooping features
like a qHD display and six gig of ram it
also sort of gimp's the regular main
line by comparison making it less
desirable in the process the problem
with that is that the may 9 is supposed
to appeal to the masses what are your
thoughts on the porsche design mate 9 if
