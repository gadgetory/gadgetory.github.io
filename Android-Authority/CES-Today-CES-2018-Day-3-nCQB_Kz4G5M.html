you speak well whose fault is that did
you just say we're live in a second okay
you got it
I'll start it like that okay perfect are
we live now it's not a hyper Bennett way
yeah I'm wearing an Apple watch on a
podcast yeah oh they can hear us where
is it
well then hello everybody in in the chat
stream
wait a minute we'll get the video up and
runner fights I feel like gonna have to
talk pretty loudly for me to hear you
yeah that's me yelling already that's my
best vice depression no it's not great
nice gonna go a little deeper where'd
you find this I mean hey wait is this
thing on arjan we're good hey everybody
Jonathan vice chair with Android
authority again revenue at CES 2018 Las
Vegas and we're doing another live show
here to talk about everything we've seen
on the floor of course add everything we
haven't seen because there's so much
going on a great panel here today I'll
let you guys introduce yourselves
I'm lon from Andrew authority you guys
might have seen me before
that's it oh I'm Adam from sound guys
this is the side of Android Authority
and to my left is Lily also from sound
gasps Stella sister side band right
according to this day yeah never changes
very good at the beginning of this dream
couldn't hide you see boy alright I
don't want to spoil anything but I just
lied the breakdown of the audio technica
be our 9zt QRS or whatever they're about
30 new products that we were here at the
event watch those launched last year I
still want these five hundred and fifty
dollar headphones but I was the pure
digital drive the pure didn't arrive
guys get the chance to check those out
this year yes and he tried to explain it
to us Frank Doris the guy over there and
he pretty much said that it keeps the
audio signal clean to the headphones and
then the headphones do the processing
like after the DAC it was
somehow they've managed to keep the
signal clean until the drivers
themselves get pushed out by the zeros
and warnings pretty neat I was just
trying the demo unit again but somebody
broke the volume button and it's cranked
that full blindly oh really
that was 100% one of us yeah I mean if
our Technic was watching this it was a
random person but if that random person
were here it would be Adam you guys
there we go crazy lawn and put you on
the spot tell me about your underwear
yes I spent probably like an hour and a
half trying to get b-roll this underwear
it's only because there's a guy there's
only one guy there and he was there was
only one guy from the company they're
like demoing or whatever and there's
another guy that was asking like a ton
of questions so we were waiting on him
to be done asking his yeah and plus when
he was there for like an hour just
asking questions
but really one Degas yeah it's a smart
underwear from energies and like it okay
it basically just measures like your
heart rate your body temp through your
underwear yeah through your honor
there's a little modules on there so I
think that's how it works I'm getting a
demo unit but yeah I just went there for
the b-roll now it's stuck there
half it seems like a cool idea like very
good well we've already got a nice
question in the in the chapel I all
control the live chat that's the word I
sorry the live chat the live chat for
those of us that have been here before
how is CES LAN I'll let you start this
off I think you've been I think it's
like my fourth CES now so I don't know
I'm just kind of like in autopilot I
guess I I don't mean that it sound like
in a negative way but it's just like
I've been here it's like it it's always
cool to see the tank before everybody
else sees it and
cool that you get to see it before it
even comes out right so I mean there's a
lot of cool stuff here I just kind of
wish we had the opportunity to actually
explore it more but the stuff that we
have seen is pretty cool like I saw a
lot of really cool stuff from JBL
because I went there to just check out
like the the length view the one that
Google's just sent one with those screen
yeah it's the speaker guys like dual
speakers in front and it has the screen
for Google assistant so only the LG one
yeah it's kind of like the LG okay this
most JBL but they had like a bunch of
other ones too there were people a
system that didn't have a screen and
that's where I saw the headset or the
headphone very good okay well before we
move on it most CEOs event they have
like an underlying tone to the last year
for me there was a LexA it was just it
was kind of everywhere this years ago
though since then we'll go sisters all
right my question is will it matter than
any alexa product that came out last
year really blow up the market there was
a lot of them no nothing like washing
machines are like slowly
there's no alexa products this year too
came out with a sound bar that there was
a CEO or seen that headline that was
like oh it looks like the echo dot or
the folks on board just swallowed an
echo dot yeah it's literally a sound bar
with like the echo dot just like over it
right in the middle that's a couple
millimeters let's be lazy about it yeah
also I would say drones there's been a
lot of drones this year mr. drone rush
guy is serving it now what's been your
favorite oh that is well my favorite is
easy the new Typhoon H+
this is the big news city and type
colored device it is a kind of a
gorgeous drone and highly capable I mean
it's a two thousand dollar drug it's not
mm it's like 1800 but it's an expensive
drone attack its high-end it's good
great camera on it it's it's not a toy
it's not the $200 drones that are
everywhere here at CES I play a clip up
with a $200 droids
no no welcome to drone rush there's a
plethora of $200 $300 drones out there
they have these neat little things where
you can fly them by hand
you know gestures and Android apps and
stuff yeah but when you get up into the
serious drone it's a whole new ballgame
and for anybody paying attention to
drone rush watch this here we're gonna
be covering commercial drones a whole
bunch more and just it's a whole new
world it's a big world than this crazy
things coming so stay tuned for that
but here at CES of course consumer
electronics I can't keep up honestly
there are so many neat little drones I
cannot see them all so I hate to say I'm
gonna miss things but I'm gonna miss
things yeah we were looking around for
this booth today and we're just walking
through North Hall which we had in
and to at all and there's just like
drones everything like what is happening
there's so many things here for sure
yeah all right before we get your
thoughts on the event Michael Murphy do
we get sleep a little bit for yourself I
have not gotten too much sleep I'm
running out like five hours a night
that's it's not a big deal but it's you
know no big deal I just I don't need to
sleep robot so without spoiling your
pick for best product of CES what if you
had to talk about one thing right now
you're most excited about what would it
be that I'm most excited about or that I
liked the most either aren't they the
same thing
no different I'm very good yeah all
right okay so I'm gonna take this one
okay okay maybe you can jump on after
having a good segue so I just took notes
I mean my paper are you guys a good
advice LG had these giant like dual
speakers that were literally like maybe
this high but they're turntables it's
like up top is built-in turntable so
whatever you're playing you could just
scratch along with it I don't even know
do you know what the price was on those
oh no they didn't I don't think they
display yeah it was that expensive it
was insane yeah that was mad fun we like
walked up and we were like we were going
for something completely different and
we just ended up stopping like yeah
and then we walked up slowly to it
anyway and that was it we were just
there for like 10 minutes getting b-roll
like this autonomous when he turned up
the music shakes it enough head bounces
itself yeah it'd be like very authentic
of the record you started skipping
it's a feature not not a malfunction
yeah Dave Wineland just walked in that
was what we got yeah that's pretty good
did you like that at all oh oh I love
that we get over to Lily for sure yeah
that's some script with that so it's
pretty good
all right time out I have a story to
tell so my favorite thing was we were at
LG and we're like demoing oh and they're
like they're playing Drake you know
regular popular music whatever and they
give the aux basically to Lily now they
play something and they're like okay
and then I'm like talking to the guy
whatever I love back and she's blasting
me goes yeah just like straight thug rap
coming out the room to the so yeah Lily
this is your first CD yes yeah how I
mean I remember mine there was only a
few years ago what's you what's going
through your head well one it's awesome
to meet everybody in person before this
you were all just hedged headshots and
slack so are you pretty headshots on my
beautiful headshot especially this guy
but yeah and it's I took his photo
well that props great light that was a
CES last year yeah excellent mood
lighting but yeah it's been good I feel
like I've seen a lot of really cool
lots of robots actually I'm living in
the digit house right now so I've been
able to hear about all the crazy robots
and Ali's been stealing from the show
floor running away with everywhere but
yeah there's been some cool
announcements I loved listening to the
new Sennheiser HD 820 s what you talked
about earlier those who are just saying
why does the video and sound guys if you
haven't already first right first people
get a video of it shameless
self-promotion shameless open ocean yeah
well yeah it is it has been really
wonderful super tiring I'm pretty much
just a vehicle for coffee but yeah it's
been good ya know very good and have you
noticed any underlying tones to the show
this year yeah a lot of what we already
covered in terms of you know virtual
assistants a lot of Google and Alexa
slapped onto things and in terms of
audio I've noticed that a lot of people
are moving towards kind of this
all-encompassing mobile aspect so even
what really surprised me even son Heiser
was kind of pushing in their press
release part of the reason they made the
HD 820 supposed back is so you can have
audio file sound accessible to you
anywhere and it's surprising because I
don't know who it's gonna travel with
those huge moms especially since they at
300 homes but yes so and we've got the
Jabra elite that came out on the elite
lineup which is also oriented towards
the everyday so I think that's kind of
yeah anything else you noticed with
sound
not really I know
well not really a theme or like a
underlying tone really but just we had
like giant announcements in legacy
companies like audio technica and
Sennheiser with two crazy new headphones
like audio technica has the 88 5,000 X's
they're like two thousand dollars I
think they're right over there because
I'm tryna certainly do yes they're open
back though so you'll hear everything
that's okay room yeah yeah those are
pretty crazy in this Sennheiser oh you
heard the eighty ones yeah or if you
said like $65,000 headphones yeah yeah
that was pretty sick goodbye you guys
that you are what was the big like thing
for Android what was the one I like this
is the news what we're doing Android
thing there's a couple issues a couple
there couple answers
yeah and I've read yeah let's bring this
back yes it is Android authority let's
talk Android phones I've seen a couple
devices I'm not entirely familiar what's
under embargo and yet not so long can
you what's the best the phone coming out
of this event
right now the best phone best Android
smartphone I know this is show I don't
know there's really been like a phone
that has come out of this show but I
mean
I guess the the vivo I don't know I
don't know but the they didn't really
the phone wasn't really like the
centerpiece it was actually the
fingerprint sensor because like in the
glass it's like the in the screen
fingerprint sensor so really yeah it's
like the first one
so like the front's based on all bezel
is and you just have a thing for
something like in the display which is
really cool so I didn't get a chance to
try it out but it looked at him yeah I
mean those look like they're gonna put
it in their own phone or they're just
showcasing the technology to sell it I
think this particular phone is gonna
come to market but as far as I know they
didn't like to talk about it wasn't
about the phone it was just about
technology that's in it because it's
made from synaptics and they have like
this whole little that's or underneath
the screen that makes all work or the
circuit board or whatever so it's great
it's like there's like a little thing of
route sensor like graphic on there show
you where you put your finger that's me
there works just like any normal finger
protector just hi is it like a different
kind of glass to use or just that
section it only works was like OLED
right now because like the way that it
like it illuminates the screen it
requires an OLED panel because if it's
like an LCD I think it's like there's
too much light leader while
but yeah I mean it works like a normal
one but it's a little bit slower right
now but otherwise workers plan well do
you think it's slow because like I
remember I'm like the pixel and stuff
the more you use it and like remembers
their fingerprinting gets used to do you
think that did they mention anything
like that like it'll get faster over
time or I mean I wasn't any slow I
wasn't there but I assume it's just slow
because it's like newer technology and
your friend it's probably been faster
like over time what they fully developed
it or whatever it is
was it just like a proof of concept once
again I don't know because I think this
phone actually is gonna go on sale
but it works so yeah that's pretty crazy
in a job when it's when we see it in
like a samsung phone I think our pond is
gonna be like yeah there's something to
be said for having that fingerprint
scanner on the front of the device it's
convenient on the back but sometimes
when it's mounted in my car I've seen
you do that when you're like driving
around you this one's bigger so I can I
can read I can get it now but yeah yeah
yeah it's all stuck in the backyard I
mean the only other Android product I
can think of is the project Linda I
don't know if you want to talk about
that I got three of us saying sir what
is that my god but you basically just
plug your phone it's like where your
trackpad well only the razor phone the
other
yes you guys seeing much you know
accessories and stuff promoted to any
phone I'm seeing a lot of not
necessarily drones but I'm seeing a lot
of accessories competing with like moto
mods and then attached to phones that's
that they haven't quite figured out how
to make a universal case you have to
have a specific set of phones to be able
to get the base case where these things
can attach to it you guys see anything
else that's stepping out we're at
yeah we've also been had some vision
yeah it's audio only we just want to
mask you know I'm walking around my head
up drones right we did see a couple of I
mean teaser for I guess I can probably
get in trouble for this but oh well
teaser for the best of CES thing that
we're gonna talk about later ashore
actually announced USB type-c cable for
all of their headphones so like their
whole IEM lineup now is available pretty
much for USB type-c which just blows
everything that's available right now
out of the water because it's like one
of the greatest manufacturers of ie ends
oh yeah decades in our USBC best list
yeah sure people there in all of their
options yeah yeah not sponsored right I
let this go too long before I threw my
drove you're like sure nuts I'm like
sure they did you're gonna laugh at me
it's alright yeah they said that was a
terrible joke I got a leg you sure they
did you're on a 20-second delay you'll
see that I will say I did hit that one
of the shirt booths at Capcom one of the
smaller events yeah and I saw the thing
that Annie my I know what you're talking
about I saw there's a pretty exciting
yes just the whole idea that the earbud
itself disconnects from the cable and
okay change abilities pretty slick
without uh dropping any names what was
the worst thing you've seen at sea yes
getting negative I can't answer that
several ways but one of them is kind of
a reality of the business and almost any
accessory business right now but I'll
talk about drones there was a lot of
products that were at different
companies but they were the exact same
thing with the different sticker on them
not saying they're bad not saying that's
bad business it just
well for some of them it was just like
here's our flagship and also we have
these ones yeah but for other ones it
was that duplicate of light device that
was their flagship I don't know if I
feel bad for them or just yeah let it
slide
otherwise something I'm really impressed
with not sexbots weavers who said oh my
god there's there's a this company just
down the way here and they've got this
these humans aside but I didn't need to
see that yeah it's like uncanny valley
maybe we should explain for the people
there's a booth like right over there
that has gotten a lot of attention
because in the front of it they have
cases like yay hi did I yeah I don't
know it said like it was like that big
but it's like life-sized dummies almost
right like of a male and a female and it
looks like reloading but it looks so
real it's like on candy value like it's
a person just there yeah all the details
there like even like the hair except the
six-pack because we don't
yeah where's the beer belly yeah it's
not very realistic it's like the ideal
human just floating there it's really
creepy and maybe that's it maybe it's
the presentation we've all seen the
humanoid robots before greeters at doors
remind me to segue off of that into
something I saw this morning but you
know just they put them in like these
floating test tubes like yeah it was
yeah it's interesting it definitely
worked though everyone's stopping in
front looking at lit his very shock
value but that was my least favorite
that's how I want to see you guys I mean
it's it's my least favorite because like
when I walk past it like I thought it
was like some piece of tank like a
hyperbolic chamber I don't know like I
thought it was like a piece of tech but
you walk inside of it I don't know
there's like a there's like a dead one
in a body bag and so that's yeah it's
like that's a good clear body bag so you
can like poke it so this is like an
episode of black mirror now I touched it
yeah
keeping your boundaries though I need a
big vitamin I did yeah I touched it a
little bit but yeah I thought it was
like tech is like at CES you know but
you walk in there it's it's just like a
big ol ad for a Netflix
yeah yes Thank You JP are out altered
carbon all today there we go I believe I
think that's the promo let's know what
the name of the booth is though I don't
have his name of the booth I think it's
just why it's there
everybody sneaking up the back door of
the booth that's the name written above
not really a thing but an event that
power outage was was pretty rough we
were at the Venetian funda we heard
stories today any was Sony LG yeah oh
yeah we were actually we were here yep
yep turned off yeah yeah that was were
you here for that I was not here for
that but
or maybe I was just in the wrong mood
there are so many halls I was saying
like when the lights go off just grab
the closest thing sorry boss the
Internet's down take it away so I
realized something this morning when I
was at a Honda event I think we've all
heard of that Honda Izumo their little
robot that goes around little they've
got rolling sound world's this is older
they've had this for 10 12 years old and
they've been working on their robotics
semi-humanoid walking talking that sort
of thing no no that's those are I don't
know what I want to say ripoffs but
those are newer iterations there's is an
actual that looks like an astronaut but
but anyways I got to attend an event
with this morning with Honda they've got
three new robot type creatures one of
them is like an outdoor ATV kind of help
you in the workforce but two of them are
great for in the home one of them was
like a mobile caddy with a you can put a
bar in it or the cooler that sort of
thing and the other one is like a hero
six or whatever that character it's not
inflatable but it stands about three
four feet tall this is cute and friendly
so this is what I realized when I was
watching the media you know ten years
ago with Honda and there as a Moen and
even with newer generation with like the
walking dogs and robotics and stuff you
always look at it on the screen and
you're like wow that's but I attended
the event here today and then had a
different feel to it it's just like yeah
there was
all the years of engineering just goes
out the window okay that's that was good
you don't think you're jaded from seeing
a million it's gonna you know maybe two
months from now I'll be talking to
somebody they'll be like you got to see
I'm waiting for a real BBA so yeah
that's what I want
there you go there you go Spiros great
and all but it's not like a cat I want
like a baby baby so have you guys have
you experienced that here it will start
with you LAN you've been to the most of
these shows again but have you
experienced that like yeah I saw that in
real life and then later on it's just
like holy lon you got to see that whole
alone I don't think I've had an
experience like that yes I'd almost like
the first time I got to meet the entire
Android authority I will say though like
I I did experience something pretty cool
and if you get the chance to like you
got some free time you should definitely
check it out it's like you know Google
has like their home
set up like then not waterproof or yeah
they have said that rain it's actually
really cool it's a lot of fun like they
take you on this little tour like it
starts off like you're in this room and
it's like this big uterus of like round
couch or whatever it is everybody just
like lays down on it and you just look
up the ceiling I'm like they they like
broadcast is like little little little
movie like I'm on the ceiling so we're
just watching it right and then they
take you to another room where you like
to do a bunch of like Google assistants
like you stand on like a little podium
and whatever comes up you just read it
there's like a google just set off like
at the end of it like like one of the
things like it's like baking and you
actually get a real cookie I got a shot
by there yeah they open the oven like
it's like what's going to be their
chocolate but after they get a glass of
milk but after that like you go upstairs
well you have the option to go upstairs
and then they cried like the little
slide down
so we wanted slide yeah so we went up
there and it didn't like to see one of
the CES recaps like we all took the
slide out like the building so it's
pretty cool it's a lot of fun
I'm imagining the altered carbon booth
with a slide at the back people good
look at this humanoid yeah all right
Adam what's your you you said you had
that you got to see something that later
everybody was like I've only been to one
see yes no last year I was helping out
with one of the properties but we did a
self-driving car was like my first demo
with Chris Carlin and grossie I think it
was and we were just like we got into
BMW I think the i-5 series I got the
self-driving one and like you see the
concept car it looks really futuristic
cuz they don't think there's gonna be
like a driver's seat in it whatever
we're like okay this is cool like
they're taking me ro they're like
alright you guys want to ride in it
we're like yeah in this and they're like
no no we have the self-driving
technology and like an actual being
government we're like okay cool so like
we get in it and I was driving the car
in the highway and the PR guy is like oh
yeah I just take your hands off the
wheel and I was like not getting like 55
on a highway in Vegas I'm like I don't
think I will
he's like no no really it's okay so I'm
like and I'm like it's going straight
whatever no big deal like it notices
when people are in the lanes next to you
it slows down the sort of fun my god
then he's like yeah in the future no
one's gonna be driving you could just
have conversations like turn around and
talk to me and I was like driving
talking to the guy in the backseat and
it was the most like weird situation
I've been in a while and then I got home
like it was cool for me I was there I
was like okay this is cool whatever
then I got home and I was telling people
and they're like what he drove in a
self-driving car like that
that was my big thing I was like yeah I
guess that was kind of like 60 on a
highway look hard though the guy behind
me like I could have been texting like
those bad commercials like his last text
was this car can do all by itself
yeah yeah exactly yeah that's really
cool that was before I'm sorry
anybody got out to the BMW cart tent out
front here now they're just doing donuts
in the car Oh smoke so it's just we were
wondering like do the drivers just get
nauseous after a while it's like eight
hours of going in a circle just drifting
around and oh yeah that's my figure
eight keeps your balance - yeah trust me
I mean I don't know your first show so
you see anything you think would be that
like you know everybody's gonna be
clamoring over it and you're you're
special you got to see it I think what's
gonna be really cool it's actually uh
something that we saw from creative
which is pretty much they what they do
is they have this app that you pretty
much photographed your ear your face and
then your other ear
assuming you're so fortunate to have to
and and they they measure the take those
measurements and they predict they kind
of like give you this reading of how you
hear the world through the measurements
that they take and it they're condensing
it into this very small form factor
which is pretty much able to go on you
know your regular cable and
I'm sorry man with the pics but yeah so
it just gives you the ability to pretty
much emulate dolby atmos type of sound
through headphones you just have to have
compatible headphones with the den it is
gonna be a crowdsourcing project as a
right now unless they change the status
of that so we're kind of just waiting to
see how that turns out because you know
crowdsourcing can either be really cool
or really non-existent the technologies
are yeah the track is there and I mean I
got passion it was it was awesome Chris
and I couldn't tell when the headphones
are on versus when the surround sound
speakers were playing yes I was the one
doing the b-roll for that and it's like
they have all the surround sound
speakers playing like a song or movie
and then as they take off the headphones
and turns on and when they put on two
headphones the speaker's turn off but it
continues playing in their headphones
and they couldn't tell the difference so
we hope that's all fun bad yeah it would
be really cool ended on write a new
dongle they like to say if it brings
like actually brings something to the
data let's react I mean there's no
reason to still not have a headphone
