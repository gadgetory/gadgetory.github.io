Android authority and I'm here in New
York City at Samsung's first look event
taking a look at the different colors
that users will be able to choose
between when picking up the Galaxy s7
edge there's also a color comparison
live on this channel for the standard
galaxy s7 so be sure to check that out
as well and of course we have lots of
coverage on the phones themselves so we
hope you're enjoying those too but for
now let's take a closer look at the
different color choices we have for the
galaxy s7 edge now when it comes to the
s7 edge we have some different and more
interesting colors to choose from the
galaxy s7 edge will come in three colors
black onyx gold platinum and silver
titanium these are all very beautiful
colors however this year Samsung ditched
any crazy bright colors like the bright
blues and greens of last year here's a
black onyx version and no it's not the
camera deceiving you this is actually
black not blueish like last year's
Galaxy phones no matter which light you
hold the black onyx s7 edge it's color
will be black which I think looks
fantastic much better than last year's
black sapphire it's still very
reflective and will be prone to
fingerprints even though I couldn't
replicate this today but it could be due
to the temperature next we have the gold
platinum which is one of the most
reflective colors with almost a
mirror-like quality to it this flashy
reflective gold mixed with the curved
size of the s7 edge make for a very I'd
say fancy looking phone no doubt we'll
turn some heads although since all these
colors also change the color below and
above the display I can see some people
not liking this as it could be quite
distracting now we have my favorite
color silver titanium this is pretty
much just a straight-up mirror stuck on
to the back of the s7 edge is just as
reflective as a gold platinum version
but of course with a more greyish hue it
looks gorgeous and it's splashing in a
sense but with a more tonal color it's
not as gaudy as some may say about the
gold platinum each color looks fantastic
and I don't find any of them to be too
much or too gaudy although I'm sure some
people may not feel the same and some
may be disappointed that a white model
isn't available for the edge version but
anyway that'll do it for this color
comparison of the galaxy s7 edge in the
comments below tell us what your
favorite color is and also stay tuned
here at Android authority for more
coverage on the
Galaxy s7 edge as we are your source for
