answered Authority and today we're gonna
take a look at the Oppo f9 and oboes
been doing some pretty interesting
things with their smartphones lately we
had the find X that came out a few
months ago with the rising cameras and
the facial recognition stuff and now we
have the F 9 and the F 9 is not quite as
powerful as the find X but it does do a
couple of pretty interesting things the
first thing is the new water-drop knotch
and this knotch is a lot smaller than
notches that we see on other smartphones
this is probably the smallest notch that
we've seen since the essential phone and
it's called a water drop notch because
it kind of looks like a water drop and
the engineering behind this is actually
pretty clever it only houses the
front-facing camera and that's basically
how they were able to make this not so
small whereas other notches typically
have the front-facing camera a few other
sensors and the earpiece and this phone
still hasn't earpiece but it's been
cleverly repositioned into the outer
bezel of the phone so that's how this
notch is as small as it is and I'm
personally not a big fan of notches but
I do like the way this knotch looks it
is one of the more attractive looking
notches out there and it takes up a lot
less space on your screen the screen
itself is a six point three inch LCD
display with 1080p resolution and it's a
pretty good-looking screen it goes
nearly edge to edge has pretty vibrant
colors and excellent viewing angles but
the other thing that's interesting about
the screen is that it actually uses
Gorilla Glass 6 and it's the first
smartphone to have Gorilla Glass 6 and
this is supposedly Corning's most
durable glass to date corning says it
can survive an average of 15 drops of
one meter in height which sounds pretty
impressive I didn't actually drop this
phone to test that though so I'm just
gonna take Corning's word for it the
other thing that might catch your
attention with this phone is the colors
that it comes in so the version that I
have is called sunrise red which starts
off as a
and then fades into purple and if you
look at this phone and an angle you'll
notice this very unique diamond pattern
and I actually like the way this phone
looks simply because of the color but if
you're not really into the bright red
and bright purple it also comes in a
blue version that starts off as blue and
fades into black and also has the same
diamond pattern aside from the notch and
the unique color options that you get
with this phone there's not really a
whole lot going on with the f9 the
design is very I phone II but it doesn't
feel like an iPhone it's not made of
metal or glass it's actually made of
plastic which is perfectly fine because
plastic is still a very sturdy material
it's just not gonna have that luxurious
feel that you would get from metal or
glass it also has a headphone jack which
is good to see in 2018 but oddly enough
it comes with a micro USB port instead
of USB type-c but that Mark USB port
does support Buch fast charging and if
you're not familiar with a Buch fast
charging it's pretty much the same thing
as - charging that we see on oneplus
phones which is very good to see on the
f9 because this phone does have a pretty
decently sized battery at 3500 milliamp
hours so it's very quick to charge and
that big battery does get this phone
through a full day perfectly fine I've
had no issues with the battery life on
this phone I would show you screen on
time numbers but Oppo software doesn't
necessarily make it easy to show those
numbers now on the inside the Oppo f9
has a mediatek processor with either 4
or 6 gigabytes of RAM and generally
performance on this phone is pretty good
it's pretty smooth when launching
applications browsing the web or
multitasking but where it starts to bog
down is with gaming even really simple
games like clash rau was a choppy and
laggy experience and this phone has a
dedicated gaming mode built into the
software that is supposed to make gaming
a really good experience but I didn't
actually notice a difference with this
turned on or off so I just ended up
leaving it off entirely so I'm not
exactly sure what the bottleneck is here
when it comes to the gaming performance
on the f9 like pretty much every other
smartphone on the market the Oppo f9 has
cameras on the back you have a primary
16 megapixel shooter that's paired with
a 2 megapixel depth sensor for portrait
mode effects and on the front you have a
whopping 25 megapixel camera which is
pretty nice for selfies especially if
you want to zoom in crop you can do that
without losing a whole lot of detail and
the front-facing camera is pretty good
it also comes with an AI Beauty mode but
I wasn't really a fan of this I kind of
felt it was a little bit too aggressive
in softening the details in your face so
I just left this feature turned off
image quality from the rear camera I
would say is OK at best in good lighting
conditions you can get some images with
great color good dynamic range and
pretty good detail but the camera is
pretty quick to fall apart in low-light
images start to look really muddy and
there's not a whole lot of detail in the
highlights but I wasn't really too
surprised by this considering the lack
of optical image stabilization my least
favorite part about the Oppo f9 would
have to be the software it's running
Android 8.1 Oreo which is fine but it
has color OS sitting on top of it which
is an extremely heavy skin and also
mimics a lot of the things that we see
in Apple's iOS like the way the icons
look the wallpapers and the features and
there's certain things that color OS
changes from stock Android that don't
necessarily feel that intuitive like the
notifications for example you can't just
simply swipe them away to dismiss them
instead you have to swipe it to the left
and hit the trashcan icon to dismiss a
notification and this just feels very
slow and clunky when compared to the way
that stock Android handles them the last
thing that you're probably going to want
to know about the Oppo f9 is its
availability it's not coming to the US
and I probably would never expect it to
it's only available in a few select
regions like Vietnam the Philippines and
India and even if you could get your
hands on one I wouldn't recommend it
because it doesn't support us LTE bands
so that is the Opel f9 in a nutshell it
has some pretty cool color options and a
very unique notch but otherwise it's a
pretty average smartphone but it's still
really cool see that Oppo is continuing
to do very innovative thing
with their smartphones but that's pretty
much it for this review hopefully you
all enjoyed it if you did please give it
