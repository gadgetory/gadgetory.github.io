headlines MasterCard is working on a new
application that will let you take

few instances where selfies are actually
useful in an interesting twist Shadowgun

the modding will allow people to change
characters weapons levels and even some
of the game mechanics all you have to do
is download the dead zone GM kit which
will have linked in the video
description below sony and twitch have
teamed up together to allow broadcasting
gameplay from Sony Xperia devices right
now it's limited to only the most recent
xperia including the z3 plus and z4 but
this gives mobile gamers more ways to
stream on twitch microsoft has rebranded
their entertainment apps to lose the
Xbox moniker from now on xbox music will
be known as groove while xbox video will
be called movies and TV this is likely
in anticipation for the windows 10
launch later next month last up this
week telltale games has released the
first trailer for the highly anticipated
minecraft story mode game it definitely
looks like a minecraft game except this
one will have a storyline in classic
telltale games fashion this will be an
episodic adventure and it should be
pretty good before even more Android

Friday ok folks let's take a look at the
apps and games that made a big splash
this week as usual if you want to check

below the popular keyboard flexy made a
huge announcement this last week they
have lowered the price of their
application of free and it will now be
supported with in-app purchases flexi
had a huge year in 2014 and it's
considered one of the best and most
popular keyboards around we anticipate
it being free will only help to continue
that endeavor along with going free it
will also be receiving an update to
bring some new features soon action
launcher got a fairly significant update
this last week a new feature called
quick bar was added that allows users to
customize the search bar at the top this
allows fast access to applications along
with a little more functional
the update also included some minor
tweaks and changes along with the
boulder play bug fixes and performance
improvements it's a good launcher if
you're ever in the market for another
one the Disney has released an official
Star Wars application that's meant to be
your one-stop shop for all things Star
Wars the application includes
notifications for big announcements and
releases content from the Star Wars blog
and even Star Wars gifs the application
can also be themed based on your
preference of the force the application
is experiencing some release date issues
that Disney is working through but it's
a good download for fans with Rambo is a
surprisingly intense game that's kind of
a parody of the Rambo series this is a
2d side-scrolling shooter you must race
up and down rivers and mowed down bad
guys the graphics aren't amazing but
they definitely aren't bad and it even
includes a poker game mechanic it's
definitely a time waster type of game
but let's face it there's gambling and
guns what else could you possibly need
the toss-up is a new application out of
Microsoft garage and it's a fun little
app what it does is help you plan events
and gather opinions about things using
this application you can ask people if
they plan on attending an event and get
answers back very quickly you can also
use it to find things like restaurants
or even individual opinions about
something it's a bit simple and there
are some release date bugs but it's
definitely worth a shot this week's
