working from home for a number of years
now and I needed my own space and in my
searches I found a 500 square foot
office at a reasonable price however as
I sat in the middle of that office with
nothing inside of it I realized I don't
know what the heck I'm doing when it
comes to furnishing this place
luckily around the time I was given a
tool that was going to help a traffic
are what's going on everybody and this
is my brand-new office or studio
furnished thanks to the assist sent
phone AR and Google tango before I get
started a quick disclaimer the zenfone
AR that you're seeing and that was used
in order to get this project done is in
Asian unit this phone actually has been
out for a little while now in other
markets and I was lucky enough to get my
hands on one in order to do this office
project before the Verizon announcement
so we are going to get a unit that is
made for Verizon made for US carriers
and it's at that point after about a
week or so that I'm going to give you my
full review of the phone as a daily
driver but before we get to that let's
talk about tango in general it's
actually a little bit tough to explain
the camera array on the back provides a
clue but there's definitely a lot more
happening than just a few more optical
packages motion tracking is achieved
through the accelerometer and the
gyroscope sensors depth perception
happens thanks to a proprietary camera
built alongside the phone's existing
shooter and then area learning entails
the recording of it all for real-time or
rendered data the result is a phone that
not only knows where it is in relation
to all of the objects in the space but
it also can make that area easily seen
in a 3d rendered way and with high-end
specifications included like the
Snapdragon 820 160 gigabytes of RAM and
plenty of storage the zenfone AR is
capable of holding all of that data into
one small package definitely smaller
than other tango packages that came
before it there are a lot of
applications inside the tango area of
the Google Play Store but compared to
the entire Google Play Store it still
only takes up a small percentage of
everything that you can do however the
different applications range from
utilitarian to entertaining we've
already seen a number of augmented
reality game demos I tried to impose
objects on top of real life elements but
with tango additions these elements can
take into account walls objects and
space in order to provide a more
of experience users can inject a
life-sized version of a soccer player
for example in order to juggle a soccer
ball render a board onto a table in
order to play a virtual game and my
personal favorite actually have a
virtual puppy that you have to raise and
play with that will run around the room
that you have rendered a number of new
applications have appeared in the tango
area of the Play Store especially since
this phone was going to be announced
today so when I was doing this little
office project plotting out all of the
furniture in this new studio space that
I have I was using a limited amount of
applications but I did try to make the
best of it so with that in mind the
first thing that I'm probably going to
end up doing is popping into the
constructor app now the constructor app
is a developer app available for tango
that allows you to plot out an entire
area now I have a completely open space
which means that there isn't too much
texture that I have to capture here and
I don't have to get below different
objects in order to get them to be
plotted correctly I might have to do
that with the chair but overall we're
just looking at an empty space so this
should end up being a 3d rendering of
essentially an empty room the objective
was to get a bird's-eye 3d rendered view
of the entire space so that I can
actually see where I could place things
inside of that virtual area to get the
best render possible I had to mull over
as much of the room as I could with more
passes required one object slowly
started to populate the area basically
when I had furniture that was slowly
getting into this place I had to walk
around in multiple times to get the most
well rendered scene but it was in this
situation when I tried to get the most
data points that I could that the tango
camera actually lost its place and I had
to reset before I could continue this
was an issue that came up from time to
time not only in the constructor app but
with a couple of other applications that
I used later on so after going through
the constructor app I downloaded Wayfair
which is a furniture catalog but
unfortunately I found the wayfarer
catalog to be a little bit too limiting
and in a lot of ways way too specific
for my needs I didn't necessarily want
very specific furniture from the way for
a catalog I wanted generic items that I
could put into the space basically so
that I knew what kind of area I would be
able to create so that brought me to a
our home now a our home does not really
pull from a specific catalog and thus it
provides generic items that I could put
into the virtual space so I knew how
much space I was taking up with all the
different furniture I would find out
what pieces of furniture would fit in
the space and then figure out
to get the appropriately sized real-life
pieces obviously with a budget like mine
ended up going to places like IKEA and
that was the main place that I went to
for all of my furniture and it would
have been awesome to actually have an
IKEA application powered by tango so
IKEA if you're listening get on that the
actual camera came into use at this
point as I took pictures of all of the
different pieces of furniture and took
note of where I would be able to buy
them in the warehouse and with that the
real work began
it took about two to three weeks but I
was finally able to make the office take
shape I did try to use the constructor
app to get more renders but like I
mentioned before it was actually hard to
make a 3d space using that app to their
credit however the constructor app is
made only for developers and actually it
is still in beta so I can't really fault
it too much but the office behind me
started to take shape based upon the
render I made in a our home you can see
the gaming area to my right here where I
have a TV already and to the couch of
course is right behind me so I can take
breaks and then over to my left you can
see the workstation that I use for
filming a lot of the footage that you
are seeing in more recent videos and way
in the back you'll be able to see I have
the editing Bay with my computer
you might recognize that standing desk
and of course my shelf that I still use
as a set from time to time so I am able
to do all of my work in this space
already and I'm happy that I was able to
use tango to at least know that I wasn't
going to be just buying a lot of
different furnitures and then realize I
didn't have any space at all but it all
comes back to this issue of content
tango definitely feels like the future
and there are going to be applications
for it that make tango indispensable but
those are still niche areas and even
then there are those technical issues
that I mentioned earlier when using the
constructor app the app would actually
crash from time to time and then when
using the brand new BMW visualizer I was
finding the i3 and the i8 in virtual
space rendered in a place that it
shouldn't be now I get it being inside
of an office is not ideal for actually
putting a car but when I went outside to
try and put the car into the parking lot
outside of my office it actually
rendered inside of the gate which was
really odd those technical issues aside
what tango really needs right now is
more support and a bit more imagination
from developers to bring their visions
to life especially from big names that
would realize an augmented reality
version of their existing properties is
literally the future of this platform so
I am actually pretty thankful that I had
the Zen phone AR with me and because of
project tango I was able to get into
this office and start furnishing it
without having to do it blindly I was
able to figure out where all of my
furniture would go and how much space I
would have left and actually I have a
lot of space that is still unoccupied so
there's a lot of room for improvement
and a lot of room for even more things
for me to do in this space and without
project tango that wouldn't have been a
reality so when I get my full US unit
I'll be using the zenfone AR on the
daily and see how tango fits into the
life of an average user stay tuned to
Android 30 for that and even more about
project tango the zenfone AR and even
more because we are your source for all
things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
