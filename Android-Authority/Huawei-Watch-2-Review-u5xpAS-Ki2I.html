Android wear 1.0 wearable with the leap
into the active lifestyle and wear 2.0
however in doing so they also change its
identity just a little bit it's Joshua
Vergara what's going on everybody and
this is a review of the Huawei watch 2
now for anybody that was looking for a
true follow up to the original Huawei
watch this 2.0 edition might seem like a
pretty drastic change gone or the gold
and silver and in is the sporty plastic
build that's not to say that this is a
bad looking watch by any means but it
did leave us wanting for the previous
generation that wasn't so sport oriented
the large bezel also has minute
designations that generally make us feel
obligated to use analog watch faces and
also having those numbers on a dial that
doesn't even move well it just feels
like a little more than a cosmetic
addition the side of the device houses
two buttons the upper button opens the
app drawer or Google assistant while the
bottom button can be customized but
starts workouts by default the entire
watch body is also water-resistant so
you'll be able to let this watch take a
splash and it will still keep working
the only part of the body that I really
don't like is the lack of an extra
method of input the screen is of good
quality and there is little to dislike
about it but relying on taps and swipes
to get everywhere is so Android wear 1.0
and even though the design of the Huawei
watch 2 did sort of grow on us after a
little while but one thing I just can't
stand is this watch strap it just
doesn't scream good quality and it is
also what kind of undercuts that price
point that they're asking for this
Android wear 2.0 SmartWatch even though
you are able to change the watch strap
but it might be a little bit tough to
find watch straps that actually fit well
with this body as mentioned already the
1.2 inch 390 by 390 AMOLED screen is a
good quality display and there's very
little wrong with it in fact having a
p.m. OLED seems to help a great deal
with battery life which we'll cover in a
little bit always-on screen options are
available and the included watch faces
leverage it quite well I actually like
to keep always on display on but turn
off all of the wrist gestures including
details awake that way the watch only
activates if notifications come in and
then otherwise I have to tap
the top button in order to activate it
and all other times it's just well a
watch
underneath that surface they already
tried and true Snapdragon wear 2100
powers the Huawei watch 2 backed by 768
megabytes of RAM 4 gigabytes of storage
is available for filling and all of the
different sensors are available to NFC
GPS Bluetooth and heart rate sensor the
NFC implementation brings Android pay
which I really enjoyed using while on
holiday in the UK where it was great to
use for all contactless payments and yes
a SIM card can be installed for mobile
network connectivity and also for calls
now battery life is actually the
brightest spot when it comes to the
Huawei watch 2 it's probably the only
wearable that I've ever used that
consistently got about 2 days worth of
battery life and that's what options
turned off like the tilts awake even
with those options on I was still able
to get about a day and a half there's
also a bit of a hybrid mode that's
included with the watch a watch mode if
you will that automatically activates
when it's at very low battery
now it's an ultra low power consumption
mode that pretty much just makes the
watch well a watch the one thing I'm not
a big fan of though is the magnetic
charging clasp which is kind of an
elegant but charging up the watch
doesn't take too long thankfully so
certain tasks like sleep tracking or
actually more possible here than on any
other Android wear SmartWatch that I
think I've ever used which does bring it
for the software and Android wear 2.0
much of what we didn't like in the
previous wear interface has been changed
for the better and that starts with
notifications there are no longer cards
and they take up their own screens and
when you tap on them you can go through
the entire notification and also find
the actionable options the app drawer is
also easy on the eyes now and with wear
2.0 apps can be installed locally on the
watch so there's less dependency on the
paired smartphone fitness capabilities
of the Huawei watch 2 are also kind of
robust especially for distance based
activities where 2.0 brings a lot of
features to the table and yes some of
them are fin is based
however the while we watch to kind of
goes a little bit too far in that
direction while simultaneously falling
short of it without that extra method of
navigation input while we automatically
positions itself behind any other wear
2.0 devices that do take advantage of
that capability but with this great
battery life and stellar
said otherwise the only real detractor
from the overall watch to experiences
its design why not have a watch that has
all of these capabilities but still make
sense to be worn outside of the gym or
off the hiking trail
if the LG watch sport and law weighs
follow-up attempt or any indication we
may not get a very positive answer to
that question just yet and for $349 the
lolly watch - still makes even excited
users take a little bit of pause
especially if they prefer the design of
the original unlike its predecessor
conforming to a specific general purpose
for smartwatches actually takes away
from what could have been a wonderful
proper wear 2.0 follow-up as always
thank you guys very much for watching
and hope you enjoyed this review of the
Huawei watch - it's a decent device and
there's plenty to like about it however
if the trend this year is that wear 2.0
devices all have to look really sporty
in order to have all of those features
well the lolly watch - unfortunately is
a precursor to that but hopefully this
year we'll see some wear 2.0 devices
that have all those features and still
look pretty awesome like we've seen in
previous devices keep it tuned to
android authority for this and all of
