recording live from CES 2016 here with
Android authority and I have a real good
time and my pleasure and privilege to
introduce Giovanni Mancini he's I had a
global marketing with eing sir how are
you today
I'm fine Darci honey very well very well
I have to apologize both of our voices
are a little bit blown out we've been
working really hard here at CES yes
having a good CES sir so far grants been
great you've got a lot of traffic a lot
of interest and hopefully that will
share some of the interesting products
with the audience today absolutely so
what are we looking at here today sir
what is the ink so in a very simple form
a ink basically encapsulates black and
white ink pigments and we make this
place out of it okay so if you look at
this display it's very flexible the
image stays on it there's really no
power to this display this display right
now so if you think about it what we
tell our customers is what is possible
in terms of product design came a
display that uses little to no power
it's flexible and lightweight and can be
viewed and they're all lighting
conditions and from there we grow into
many product categories and many
capabilities that we provide to our
customers so my question to you is how
does the ink display stay on without
using any power well you know that's
some of the magic that behind the ink
but when you think about it the magic is
really based in the science like I said
we we basically take black and white ink
particles or colored ink particles we
encapsulate them a little microspheres
that are about 50 microns in diameter
and and we laminate that to make a
display from that when you apply an
electric field those pigments move when
you remove the electric field those
pigments stay where they are so in this
case with a new electric field the
pigment stays were almost like a i/o
like a switch exactly very very cool so
what are some products that consumers
would be familiar with you know that are
on the market that you're currently
using technology
probably the products that consumers are
most familiar with or a meters so if you
think about an Amazon Kindle okay Kobo
e-reader tulino shine pocketbook those
are all in readers yeah basically most
of the leaders on the market today use
ink displays best thing you know I
bought my father a tablet and he was
asking for a Kindle and he actually
prefers the Kindle because it's letter
and it's easy on the eyes frankly you
know because what Annie and display does
is actually replicate the same Vegas
paper it looks like paper it actually
operates the same as paper it reflects
light that's in the room famous paper
compared to a tablet type of display or
a smartphone type of display which has a
very strong backlight behind the display
that's kind of shining in your eyes and
that's why you feel tired when you're
using a computer or reading on tablet
versus enemy ink display so what would
you like to say is people that read for
long periods of time long form reading
prefer Ian displays overwhelmingly to
reading on a tablet or other devices
yeah so we we had the pleasure and
privilege of visiting a Wolfman in San
Francisco and in my opinion is a game
changer for wearables
you know extremely long battery life
touch screen flexible customizable right
can we just talk about the world ban for
a little bit so what the wolf band does
is it's a perfect example of a product
that is really enabled by Inc and takes
full advantage of inks capability so
what you have with the wolf Bank is not
only the fact that it's taking advantage
of being slow power capabilities because
of its battery life it's also taking
advantage of the fact that it can be cut
to any size and it's a fully flexible
display yeah so you can wrap it around
your wrist as a large display at your
wrapping around your wrist
you know some of the displays you can
actually twist so you know that's why
the wolf bands such a great product
because it has a large display very low
power and it can actually be you know
wrapped in to how you're dressed exactly
yeah right yeah I just I can't help but
be so excited for it to hit the market
and I think so are we well you know E&amp;amp;K
like many other incredible technology
it's kind of an unsung hero you know and
a lot of consumers they don't really I
mean we all take all this magic for
granted
well let's talk about a couple of other
product categories like what we have
here and you show me this really cool
product packaging here man that that's
really incredible
so just take it away sir good the fact
that it doesn't consume any power
essentially you know I say but like this
luggage sure
she just said yes so you know the Super
Furry example of a product that it's
possible with the ink and virtually
impossible as any other display
technology so what this product does is
addresses the issue of how long does
checking in your luggage take at the
airport Airlines today we want to speed
up the check-in process they want to
reduce their costs for y greater values
of the customers and so what Rimowa and
let's come up with is an integrated
display system into the luggage so that
when you're checking in at home and you
get your boarding pass you can also
check in your luggage at the same time
so to quickly demonstrate what what what
happen is while you're at home and
you're using your favorite app to check
into to your airline you get to the
point where you now want to provide the
luggage information so at that point in
time you would open up your but your bag
inside the bag there's a small button at
that point the screen goes into pairing
mode listening to what's coming in at
that point you choose your itinerary the
attiny has chosen the bag now identifies
itself to the app because you might have
multiple bags that you want to check in
so you choose which bag you're checking
into your training information to and
there you have it within a matter of
seconds through bluetooth the
information is now transferred to the
display on the bag your boarding pass
your information so it's all trackable
so what you have here is a fully
complete I had a compliant luggage tag
it has barcodes for the optical scanners
it has a tracking code it has the
routing information it can identify
whether you have a short connection so
that your luggage should take priority
and it also identifies your priority
status with the airline so cool also you
notice it has some green bars that means
that you're traveling through the EU and
the EU requires that so but this allows
you to do is it solves a number of
problems one is when you're checking
into the airport you're now no longer
have to wait in line you simply go to
the bag drop-off section show your ID
drops after bag and you're done
so whenever life points of view it also
speeds up their information because they
no longer have long
oh man having done to almost two hundred
forty eight thousand miles last year a
lot of long lines a lot of boarding
passes you know I would really be
interested in this particular option but
let's talk about the core technology
itself now referencing back just to the
Walkman for a quick one minute I believe
it was a 848 by 240 pixel wide display
they told me I think you can do around
eight frames a second I believe a
refresh rate but the technology itself
like what kind of limitations or
possibilities are we looking at a future
displays in terms of the gradations of
black and gray
what were the potential maybe to
introduce other colors like what are we
looking at ian has had color Aleutians
for a number of years and so what what
we found is that Ian
shines better when you focus on specific
applications just like for example the
luggage here right so in our booth at
CES this year worship for example was
showing a 32 inch color display well
because we focus on digital signage we
can actually use larger pixels and
provide more saturated colors cool we
also are doing constant ongoing research
and developing you know better color
solutions so the color is richer and
more vibrant we also have a product
called prism which is an is our color
changing film and then it's picot
specifically for the architecture and
design market because you know the MER
working with architects for a few years
now and the architects are looking for
is solutions that they can turn their
environments into more of a dynamic
nature you know introduce some changing
capability that you know they could use
to add cosmetics and designs necessary
schematic to design but for example a
wall that can change color
well wall that can change pattern but
based on the ambient motion of the room
for example here at CES we kind of have
very stark you know bland walls
wouldn't it be great if the walls can
reflect the activity that's going on
within CES so we actually have an
example of this with a company called
uber all is a
a concept protocol D flow which is a
kind of an architectural structure which
animates and the animation change
allowed based on the ambient motion of
the crowd so you know this was a
showcase that make a neocon in 2015 and
it's you know been installed on a couple
of public spaces to to show that
capability that's so cool now is he any
expensive for manufacturers to use it
relative to other display technologies
well you know as we say you know eating
sometimes those it is the charge a
premium price compared to other
technologies you know that's because of
the technology and the value that we
provide we believe we provided unique
value absolute product design and you
know that's why some sometimes we're
more expensive but in some applications
we can meet the pricing of other
solutions that are available in the
market that's it I mean there's no
question in terms of the competitive
positioning of the ink it is absolutely
unique and it's offering so what product
are you most excited to sort of have
come out in 2016 that will use the ink
you think well I can't speak about
what's in the pipeline but you know as I
said you know we are doing research in a
number of different areas which was our
core technology in the court and the
coring we always have been focusing on
color we've been focusing the
flexibility of our film and we've been
focusing on kind of the readability and
the contrast steps of our film so expect
to see new product abilities from me
inked in that area but the most excited
about is the customers today the new
customers are coming on like we're going
that are using our base technology and
finding big new applications for it
using the technology we have today well
I am so excited to see what you guys
have in store for 2016 we're big fans
being
I just want to say huge thank you for
visiting our booth mr. Mancini
thank you very much excited good talking
to you Giovanni Mancini I don't go in
marketing for me a Android Authority
