becoming mainstream for Android devices
but they aren't only for the big-name
OEMs elephone has just released its
first 64-bit smartphone hello there my
name is Gary Sims from and/or authority
and this is the elephone p2000 if you
haven't heard of le phone that's not
surprising because they're not that big
here in the West yet
however this Hong kong-based company has
been producing some interesting phones
recently if you want to know about my
feelings about the name le phone then
please check out my review of the
elephone p2000 nuff satan okay moving on
to the design and build the first thing
that struck me about this device was how
solid it felt the weight the case and
the construction make the device feel
sturdy this is also helped by the
thickness at 8.9 millimeters it isn't
overly thin which in my book makes some
devices feel too delicate but it isn't
overly thick either in terms of design
language we are talking about black and
gray with rounded edges
most of the fold exterior is made up of
the back battery cover there are no
separate edges per se but rather a deep
removable casing that includes these
edges even the volume rocker is part of
the cover interestingly any phone has
tried to make this little more elegant
by sloping the cover edges towards the
corners this gives the side of the
phonus like curved look as the cover
slice downwards and the screen takes
over on the front is the five inch 720p
display the front-facing camera and I
said a blue capacitive keys at the
bottom the HOME key glows when used and
also flashes when you have a
notification but the back and the main
new keys don't have a backlight down the
right-hand side of the volume rocker and
the power button both are easily
accessible when the phone is held in
your left hand however they might be a
little bit too close together sometimes
I found myself to turn the phone off by
mistake when actually all I wanted to do
was adjust the volume on the top you'll
find the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
while on the bottom edge is the microUSB
port le phone has placed the microUSB
port off to one side rather than placing
it in the middle it looks different but
the end of the date makes no difference
for
or for worse flipping the phone over
you'll see the prominent elephone logo
the speaker grille the flash and the
camera lens the five each display on the
P 6000 is very good considering the
price point of this device the IPS
display has a resolution of 1280 by 720
and that works out about 293 dpi overall
the color reproduction is good and the
definition is great as are the viewing
angles
some people like full HD displays for v
in smartphones however for a budget
device 720p is more than adequate at the
heart of the p6000 is a mediatek mt6752
it is a quad-core cortex a53 based
processor which is coupled with a mali
t760 GPU this is the first time I've
tested a phone with this combination of
GPU and CPU and overall I've been very
impressed during 2015 this kind of CPU
GPU combination will become the norm for
low and mid-range phones the cortex a53
is almost a super power efficient
variant in its first generation of
64-bit processors the mt6 7:32 uses four
cortex a53 cores or cropped 1.5
gigahertz according to le phone this
processor is 20% faster than media Tex
optic or 32-bit cortex a7 based
processors but yet with 30% less battery
consumption my experience of using the P
6000 is that the processor package is
fast the UI is smooth and rapid in fact
it offers the fastest UI that I've
personally seen on a Chinese OEM phone
the p6000 handled everything I asked a
bit including gaming and video for a
breakdown of the individual benchmarks
please check out the written review ok
on to the hardware the phone comes with
the 2700 milliamp hour battery which is
slightly less than I expected
I guess the rationale is that the 64-bit
cortex a53 is more power efficient than
the 32-bit cortex a7 once you factor in
a 720p display rather than a full HD
display then this size of battery should
be ok
however I've been using the P 6000 now
for several days and I've come to the
conclusion that the battery life can
really only be considered at
liquid it will last from morning through
to evening around 15 or 16 hours but
you'll only get about three and a half
to four hours of on-screen time and
that's if you avoid intensive tasks like
3d gaming talking of 3d gaming I also
found that when you're doing lots of
gaming and lots of other intensive tasks
the back of the device can become quite
warm according to my individual app
testing you'll be able to play 3d games
like Riptide for around three and a half
hours on one charge or you can watch
YouTube for about four and a half hours
also on one charge as for audio the
phone has a single speaker on the back
of the device probably shouldn't expect
too much from it however it can
certainly say that it is loud here is a
sample so you can judge for yourself
however one irritation is that the
speaker is completely flush with the
back cover which means the sound becomes
muffled quite easily let me show you
in terms of selling the network the
p6000 supports 2g 3G and 4G LTE the 2g
support is probably global however the
3G and 4G frequencies are aimed mainly
at Europe Asia and the Middle East
please check out the written review for
more details now looking at the memory
the p6000 comes with two gigabytes of
RAM which is excellent for a phone in
this price range in terms of internal
storage the device comes with 16
gigabytes of flash and has an SD card
slot which can accept cards up to 64
gigabytes thank for that unlike other
media tech based devices the internal
storage isn't divided up you get access
to the whole lot which is around 12
gigabytes once you leave space for
Android etc now let's turn our attention
to the optics the phone has a 13
megapixel rear facing camera and a 2
megapixel front facing camera the
pictures are crisp and the color
reproduction is good the sense of
struggles a bit in low-light situations
but for outdoor shots I was quite
impressed the included camera app which
is probably just the standard AOSP app
offers a few interesting features
including HDR and panorama in the
settings you can change things like the
exposure level the scene type the white
balance face detection and so on overall
the app is fairly comprehensive but it
doesn't have any advanced mode or
filters you can also install and use
third-party apps including Google's
camera if you'd like to see more sample
shots then you should check out the
written review on the Android or thority
website you'll find the link in the
description below in terms of software
the p6000 runs stock Android 4.4 you get
access to Google Play and all of googles
services including YouTube Gmail and
maps interestingly the device is rooted
by default and comes with chain five
super su pre-installed however what is
more interesting is that le phone is
promised to release an over-the-air
update to upgrade this phone - and with
5.0 lollipop there is no actual official
release date however it is expected soon
and so what about the price well you can
pick up a telephone p6000 for less than
a hundred and sixty dollars which is
amazing when you consider the overall
specification of this device and so
there you have it the le phone peace
Ickx thousand is
$60 4G LTE phone with a 64-bit processor
package the price is good the
performance is good and the promise of
an upgrade to Android 5.0 lollipop is
quite enticing my name is Gary Sims
