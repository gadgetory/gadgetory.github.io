it compare to the competition it's a
spec showdown so how does the quote
flagship killer compare to the
competition let's look at the numbers
taking off with a processing package the
1+5 joins a growing list of handsets
that pack the snapdragon 835 system and
a chip boasting an energy-efficient
octa-core cryo - 80 CPU and 25% faster
Adreno 540 GPU these phones offer up
extra performance and battery life over
the last year's flagships the same
cutting edge specifications can't be
said for one plus 5s display though
which sticks with the same 1080p
resolution as the company's previous
models at 5.5 inches the most discerning
eyes will probably have preferred a quad
HD 2560 by 1440 resolution but 1080p is
by no means a poor choice if it helps
you save on power consumption and most
importantly price seriously though guys
it's a 5.5 inch screen
can you really discern the difference
between 1080p and qHD and if so do you
value that q HD over a better battery
life and if so go outside and get a dog
oh my goodness I've never been happier
now the use of an AMOLED panel will
certainly lend to some vibrant colors
and Gorilla Glass 5 offers up some
additional protection from scratches and
breaks however if you're after future
proofing HD are capable displays and a
slightly sharper resolution the Galaxy
s8 and the LG G six hold an advantage
here as for memory the one plus five is
aiming to separate itself from the
competition with the inclusion of a
minimum six gigabytes of RAM and 64
gigabytes of UFC flash up to a whopping
eight gigabytes of RAM with the 128
flash storage option the oneplus 5 isn't
the first phone to feature such a huge
pool of RAM the title belongs to the
zenfone AR and we are skeptical that
this much RAM has any meaningful
improvement on the device performance
whatsoever
why you ask well it's my understanding
because most programs are not designed
to utilize that much RAM go ask gary
he'll tell you more in terms of camera
capabilities this is an area where the
1+5 is really aiming to compete the
handset offers up a 16 and 20 megapixel
dual-camera combination for improved
low-light performance along with a 2
time optical zoom capability that so far
has only been seen inside the iPhone 7
plus and the new Oppo are 11 of course
we won't comment on actual quality
before we can see a side-by-side
shootout now - charge
aka oboes luke fast charging makes a
return which is paired with a large 3300
milliamp hour battery to keep the
handset juiced up all day fast charging
and large cell sizes are common in this
form factor but - charge has proven to
be one of the fastest and cooler
charging solutions around however the
use of a proprietary connector might
make finding replacement a pain in the
butt and third-party accessory support
such as power banks will be more limited
than more universally adopted standards
like Qualcomm quick charge the oneplus 5
also includes NFC HD Bluetooth audio
streaming a USB type-c connector while
retaining the 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack and a fingerprint scanner built
into the home button all of which we've
come to expect from top-tier devices
other more expensive models do include
some additional
no extra features though such as more
advanced mobile payment options wireless
charging and modular accessories now the
HTC u 11 and the galaxy s 8 and the LG G
6 all include an IP ratings for water
and dust resistance but the oneplus 5
does not neither do many other top-tier
models from last year but it is becoming
an increasingly popular feature this
year similarly the oneplus 5 arrives
sans wireless charging capabilities with
the galaxy s 8 and LG G 6 blowing the
only two flagships offering this feature
right of the box however many customers
will be willing to forego those extras
to save a dollar now let's talk about
price and you're looking at anywhere
from four seventy nine to five thirty
nine dollars u.s. now that is a
reasonably priced device considering all
that you're getting now I would have
preferred that they had forgone some of
those extra features and made it even
cheaper but hey compared to the s8 it's
a bargain
right so what do you guys think my
question is I really want to know how
oneplus is going to try and tackle the
marketing and distribution challenge
because this is a great deal if people
like my mother-in-law people like her
knew more about oneplus they would jump
on this but it's harder for them to get
these phones unless they're going to go
on eBay and buy these phones I mean you
can't easily go buy a oneplus device at
a store here like you can buy an iPhone
or a Samsung device it's harder to do
and if they could solve that
distribution or marketing problem you
can make a massive dent here in the West
what do you think let me know down there
or right there
you
