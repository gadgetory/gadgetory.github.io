handy the Android authority app guy do
you like making calls over voice over
Internet Protocol or s IP I know I do
and after the intro will show you some
of the best VoIP and sip apps for
Android first on our list is Kakao Talk
this solid and popular VoIP app allows
you to make calls and texts over
networks free of charge
like many on this list people you call
and text require having a Kakao account
of their very own
but if you can get a lot of your friends
to join it's no big deal the interface
is simple and user friendly no one
should have any trouble navigating
around the app aside from making calls
and text you can change your themes play
games see notices and check out the item
store most extras cost money but you can
get some fun customizations with just a
few bucks
tango actually doesn't market itself as
a voice or a sip app but more of a
social network you can make free calls
send free texts and even use picture
messages and video chats it's won a
number of awards so it's obviously
pretty good and even boasts decent
quality on 3G 4G and Wi-Fi the app
itself is easy to use account creation
is simple an app navigation was easy as
I mentioned earlier you can only
communicate with others with tango
memberships so you'll have to round up
your friends if you want to have people
to talk to
with video chat and picture messages it
also has more features than most on this
list as has been the pattern so far
viber is yet another voice app that
allows for free calling over a network
along with that you can send messages
stickers emoticons and other in app
goodies to improve your user experience
as usual your friends have to be using
Vibram for calls and messages to work
like the others so far the app itself is
easy to navigate and easy to use the
only real problem is you have to set up
your account using SMS so if you don't
already have SMS with your device you'll
have to find another way to activate
viber aside from that people like the
app and it seems to work pretty well
with Fox we start getting into the more
simple solutions for VoIP and sip
applications box is little more than a
dialer app that calls people from your
box account unlike the others you have
to pay for it but Fox keeps a pretty
extensive rate list for various
countries for how simple it is it takes
a minute to get used to the main
interface is a dialer and you have to
use the Menu button to see the rest of
the app you can also send SMS messages
from your box account and it deducts
from your minutes last but certainly
not least is why call like box this is a
dialer interface except you cannot send
text messages so this is strictly for
calling also like box it's a paid
service so you must add money to your
account which is deducted when you make
phone calls the interface is really
simple and all you really need to learn
to use the app is how to add money to
your account once that's done is just
using the dialer to call people with
your why call number so it's really
simple if a little lacking in features
if you take a look at our leaderboard
you can see how these apps stack up
against one another keep in mind that
this is not our personal rating system
it's how you the people have rated them
in the Google Play Store there is no
bias on our part if you want to try
these apps out for yourself we put links
in the video description when it comes
right down to it finding the right VoIP
or sip app for you is all about finding
what you need some really good ones that
didn't quite make the list include groov
IP Google Voice Skype and mobile VoIP if
we happen to miss a really good one and
it's entirely possible let us know in
the comments once again i'm joe hindi
the android authority app guy feel free
to subscribe to our youtube channel and
check out the social media links in the
video description</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
