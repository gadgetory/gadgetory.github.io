pixel 2 changes up the formula from last
year's pixel it's jajaja gara what's
going on everybody and this is a
comparison a look into the Google pixel
to excel and the pixel Excel Google set
a precedent last year with the pixel
forgoing the Nexus program to provide
what is basically a home branded by
Google for Android the device was
regarded pretty well whether you got the
small version the large version the
really blue version or what have you
but there were a few caveats mainly in
the design a glass panel on the upper
back portion of either device seemed
like an odd choice and there wasn't much
else that was exciting about the look
maybe it just took a little bit of time
for us to get used to it but the glass
panel has definitely become a stable of
the pixel line smartphone or not it
looks a lot better this time around
probably because they've dialed it back
a little bit by not making it take up so
much of the back but we actually think
that the new pixels are not just streets
ahead compared to the originals we also
really just in general enjoy the updated
aesthetic the feel in the handling of
the new pixels has been helped along by
a pretty simple change a texture that
has been coated onto the aluminum so
that it doesn't slip around after all
the pixel to excel is pretty much the
same size in the hand as the original
pixel XL there aren't really any bells
and whistles on this phone and you have
pretty much the essentials all in places
that you would expect them however
minimalism might be a bit of an Achilles
heel for this year's pixels as it has
shaved off the headphone jack this is
still a controversial issue no matter
what phone it happens to and it might be
one of the reasons for you not to
upgrade if you have the original pixel
we do think you might be missing out a
little bit though because the pixel 2 XL
does have that 18 by 9 aspect ratio
screen that takes up a lot of the device
and has very respectable bezels on the
sides even if the top and bottom are
still kind of sizable considering they
have front-facing speakers this time
around but let's talk about that screen
the larger pixel phones both support
quad HD displays but the shift to an
OLED screen is the main story for the
pixel 2 XL the shift has been a bit
rocky though there are a few things that
are obvious off the bat the saturation
is dialed back on the pixel 2 XL even
with the vivid colors setting turned on
but yet another problem with the pixel 2
XL has to do with its viewing angles
there's a color drop-off or rather the
colors get cooler and a little bit
bluish as you move the phone around and
look at it at an angle and it gets even
worse the more acute you go now as
reviewers we are able to notice these
things and be able to actively comment
on them but I don't think that this is
such a deal breaker that anybody out
there looking at the pixel to excel as
their newest phone should view it as a
huge problem and it doesn't fall very
far behind the original pixel but if
you're heading into VR this might be a
bit of a consideration but even then
it's still not that huge of a deal so
let's get underneath that surface both
of these phones have performance that is
indicative of their times with the
Snapdragon 820 one being on lashes pixel
and the Snapdragon 835 being part of
this year's pixel the rest of the specs
are unsurprising including 4 gigabytes
of RAM and on-board storage that can
change depending on how much you pay for
the device and then you have no SD card
slot which is something we see in plenty
of other devices but it's still not a
thing in the pixel the batteries are
obviously larger on either excel device
and a tiny bit more is found in the tube
but we didn't have much trouble with the
original pixel XL and so far we haven't
had any trouble with the pixel to these
specs are supported by a greatly
streamlined version of Android which
many users agree is the point of any
Google branded device and while you can
always update the original pixel to have
Android Oreo what we really like about
the pixel 2 is how it adds capabilities
in order to take advantage of some of
oreos features case in point the active
edge squeeze the bottom half of the
device and the phone will automatically
launch Google assistance now you can
only launch google assistant with this
but using your voice or just typing in
your command you can actually get a lot
of stuff done and even though you have
the search bar at the bottom of the
pixel to launcher and you can always use
a google hot word or you can just hold
the home button there are a bunch of
ways of opening up the assistant but we
would argue that the active edge is
probably the fastest and the most fun
other software additions include the now
playing feature in the always-on display
and both of those things I just
mentioned are available on the pixel 2
and not in the original pixel and those
songs definitely sound better on the
front-facing speakers of the pixel 2
which finally brings us to the cameras
last year's pixel was lauded for having
a great picture experience and this
year's pixel 2 continues those accolades
the point of last year's camera was
the addition of HDR a mode that was
basically always on in order to add
maybe more saturation but definitely
more detail to all of your photos no
matter what you were taking Gugu
continues that with issues devices
integrate effects that mega pixel counts
stay the same but the apertures are
better this year there are no dual
cameras on the pixel two devices either
because a Google really believes in its
computational photography data and all
of that data is actually working to
wonderful effect pictures from the pixel
two are simply stunning photos are
greatly detailed even when zooming in
and then an added level of saturation
keeps all shots more than social media
worthy portrait mode in particular is a
wonderful addition that actually
replaces the lens blur from last year
you no longer have to move the phone
ever so slightly in order to achieve a
background bokeh effect instead the
camera is just able to make that happen
on its own and the best part is that the
portrait mode is available on the
front-facing camera if you just want to
press a button and get some great
results you kind of can't go wrong with
either of these devices it's just that
the pixel 2 provides just that little
bit more that puts it over the top of
the original pixel and so there you have
it the pixel to excel in this quick look
against the original pixel excel the
choice is mostly simple when you factor
in the improved camera experience and
the additions that Google added to the
already established pixel formula they
even managed to make the phone look at
least halfway decent this year the
little missteps like the now gone
headphone jack and the weird screen
issues might sway some but they are
greatly outweighed by the textured
experience of the pixel too now if you
want a reliable speedy and simply great
Android experience for a more affordable
price getting your hands on a discounted
pixel excel is still a steal but for
everyone else that can handle the cost
the pixel 2 and the pixel 2 XL are the
clear winners drop us some likes on our
videos go ahead and jump into the
comments below and let me know what you
think if you are a original pixel owner
let us know if your going to upgrade for
example and I'll be in the comments
ready to discuss the pixel 2 phones with
you keep it tuned to Andrew 30 for even
more because we are your source for all
things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
