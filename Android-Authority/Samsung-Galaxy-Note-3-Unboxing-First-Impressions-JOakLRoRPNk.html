what's going on everybody and let's just
get right on into it it's time to unbox
the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 alright so we
have what has become Samsung's general
Forte when it comes to boxes this would
like cardboard that is etched with soy
ink very environmentalist of them though
we're going to just rip it open and see
what goodies are inside anyway taking
off the lid we already see the phone in
all of its glory let's put that aside
for now and when we get under the flap
in the box we get a bunch of manuals
this is the phone made for the Americas
so we have English and Spanish booklets
respectively get underneath and mostly
the standard fares found wall plug in
typical earbuds with extra ear pieces
the battery is a large 3200 milliamp
hour unit that should give a good amount
of juice however as this is a note
device there is a bag with extra tips
for the s-pen and the tools needed to
install them and then when you look at
the micro USB cord you see that it is
substantially bigger for this phone
matching the larger port on the bottom
of the phone this is because the note 3
supports USB 3.0 for faster transfers it
is important to note however that you
can still use regular micro USB cords as
they will simply plug into the one
portion of the port finally we put
everything extra aside and we can start
playing around with the phone itself the
note 3 marks a new beginning for Samsung
as they have done away with glossy
plastic and went textured they wanted to
invoke the feeling of leather-bound
notebooks with this material so not only
is a texture there is an etching all
around the rim the site even has a lined
texture of its own mimicking pages of a
book and there is a pattern design
within the flat glass of the front panel
I have my trusty sim kit here to adapt
my nano SIM into the micro SIM slot and
that's how we're gonna get our note 3
life started ok
so first impressions well my first
impressions basically center around the
new material choice just like back
Editha
I am still pretty enamored with this new
direction that Samsung has decided to go
it just feels is much nicer you think
you're getting a typical fingerprint
prone and slippery Samsung device but
instead you get something that might not
be too much different from all of that
but it's still very welcome my
excitement for this phone abounds even
more because truth be told I am a new
note user the note 3 will be my first
foray into the s-pen world
even from just a short time using the
s-pen in the note to back Editha with
this phone and even now I'm looking
forward to making it a part of my
smartphone lexicon even just taking out
the s-pen for this particular unboxing
and first impressions I already felt
excited to have a stylus experience and
it seems like it's going to be a good
time all right well we have a plethora
of upcoming coverage on the note 3 so
make sure you stay tuned for it all once
again this was Josh of a guard from
