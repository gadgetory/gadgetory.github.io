going
top and Neville
phone in everyday life and the first way
we do that with
I
alright and as you can see behind me we
have our co's now if you don't know our
coast and should probably brush up on
your tech history because a lot of the
portable media that we have these days
especially the fact that we can watch
movies and stream a bunch of stuff to
our phones in a bunch of different
formats and codecs kind of who's our
coast was sort of at the forefront of
that back in the day they had these
little portable media players and one of
the first pieces of tech that I would
consider pretty much the gateway to what
I do now is the archos AV 300 now I bet
you want to talk to these guys and I
talked about the AV 300 they're going to
be like what's that because basically
it's an old old old peripheral that was
like yay thick and without that wide and
then it would look like basically
probably the probably the fattest phone
you can think of right now and it was
definitely not very portable but you
know what it had like I think a 6 16 or
32 gigabyte hard drive a full laptop
hard drive in there that was Howard
stored media and I watched a lot of
movies on there during my years my first
couple years in high school like way
back dance was like 10 years ago so I
got that for like my eighth-grade
graduation present I took it all the
time to school I remember watching kill
bill on it at school because we had
nothing to do in one of my classes and
it was definitely one of those pieces of
technology that I really cherish it's
from way back in the day and it's it's
one of my favorites and that was when I
got the first phone that you could
pretty much consider to be one of the
coolest phones that I ever had it was
the w800 by sony ericsson now Sony and
Ericsson aren't necessarily partners
anymore which
to me very sad because they used to make
great phones get a line of phones I was
just for the Walkman which is what the
phone that I have and then they also had
the cyber-shot line which was sort of
what you can see is the inspiration or
the ancestor to the QX line of lenses
that they have here at so Nina right now
but that that walkman phone I'm telling
you man it was like the top phone on a
bunch of different magazines a bunch of
different shows and then after that was
the w 8 50 which is a white slider phone
hopefully I'll be able to get a couple
pictures of those as you could see him
right now but yeah those were the first
phone so it started off with archos as a
portable media player and then I got a
phone that was made for listening to
music and those were kind of the first
couple devices that I really got into
that helped me get into tagging
eventually into smartphones and
eventually to where I am today
and I just want to kind of show you what
has pretty much become the safe haven
for me and a bunch of other bloggers
intel has created this space which is
this big pretty much metal and glass Hut
that has Wi-Fi connectivity endless
supply of red bulls and a lot well not a
lot of food but enough and it's mostly
sweet so you know I like that anyway so
it is called the blog loot and it's
basically where we all come by to get a
little bit of work done and take a break
sit down have a have a redbull get our
energy back and get right back on to the
grind gonna be chilling out here for a
little while we're actually going to be
doing a live stream a little bit so I'm
going to be filming a little bit of that
as well
yes
ok
you
