ranger authority we've got some really
good feedback when we did the review of
the MIPS EIA 20 creator that single
board computer that rivals the Raspberry
Pi but uses a mix based processor rather
than an ARM based one today we're going
to be looking at another single board
computer this time with an ARM based
processor it comes from solid run and
it's called a humming board okay let's
just quickly take a look at the board
itself as you can see it's a very small
form factor here is a heatsink above the
dual-core processor which is buried
beneath it here we have the set of GPIO
pins here we have the audio out we have
an infrared detector two USB port the
ethernet connector the HDMI port and
then the power port here which is a
micro USB port there's also lots of
several advanced different ports for
things like LVDS displays and so on that
you can find more about on humming
boards website one interesting thing
about the humming board is it has the
same form factor as the Raspberry Pi
here at the back I have a Raspberry Pi
model B that's the right width PI one
because of course the right way PI 2 has
now also been announced and here is the
humming board from solid run I've got a
box over here and I'm now going to try
and put this humming board into my
Raspberry Pi box and see whether it fits
and there you have it the humming board
inside the case that used to house to my
Raspberry Pi as a pretty good deal you
can be able to find some accessories
like for the Raspberry Pi that will work
just as well on the humming board
ok connecting out the humming board is
quite simple first of all we're going to
need the HDMI cable from a television
which we plug just here in the HDMI port
then we're going to I've already
included the SD card that I put in
earlier I'll talk about later how you
can put different operating systems onto
the SD card including Linux as well as
Android we're going to need a Ethernet
cable which I got over here just to plug
that in there
so there's the Ethernet cable this
particular model doesn't have Wi-Fi by
default though of course it is an option
I'm also going to plug in a wireless
mouse because if I'm using Android I
want to be able to you navigate around
the screen so there's my wireless mouse
and finally it's powered by microUSB so
all we do is connect in the microUSB and
here and that's it we have the lock
screen here so to use the mouse to drag
that across to unlock and then we have a
fairly standard desktop home screen we
have the Play Store we have a whole
bunch of Google Apps including Gmail and
G+ and maps and so on some of these of
course won't make much sense on a
development board like this with max for
example really won't be of much use but
YouTube and Google Plus and so on really
quite useful and as we can see there are
many so there are multiple squeeze of a
desktop here I've already installed a
few applications which we're going to be
looking at in a few minutes and here we
have the app drawer this is using Google
now launcher so we can see the kind of
Android L type arrangement here and here
is the interesting application the
Ethernet app that comes in bundled by
default it allows me to configure the
Ethernet and if I this first window here
this first icon lets me see that the
Ethernet has in fact got an address from
my router and then I can also do things
like configure a static IP or stay on
DHCP so on so that means now the
ethernet is running on here which means
I could probably go to something like
google play and it should all come up
and work without any problem there we
have it
Google Play coming up so there it is
that's the initial things on what you
get when you boot up the humming board
into Android in terms of performance you
aren't going to get any earth-shattering
records out of this little device
remember it's only a dual-core cortex a9
based device and has a Vivante GC 2000
GPU as you can see here on the screen
the results from Epic Citadel showed
just twenty four point four frames per
second
720p HD and the highest performance
level so this is gonna be good enough
for Home Media it could be good enough
as a desktop it's even to be good enough
for love 2d games but don't expect
anything really serious in terms of 3d
gaming the Epic Citadel results are also
reflected in the antutu score this
particularly device scores just twelve
thousand one hundred and ninety eight as
a far cry from the quad-core an
octa-core devices that were seeing in
smartphones and tablets a day
however again I just like to underline
that for media consumption as a smart TV
as a simple desktop and for 2d games
that is more than sufficient however it
isn't a powerhouse although the humming
board doesn't do too well in 3d graphics
and can't be compared with today's
high-end smartphones and tablets when it
comes to multimedia the board paves
actually well there are two types of
meter I suppose we need to consider one
is streaming media like YouTube and
Netflix and the other is media that is
stored locally as you can see the
YouTube streaming works absolutely fine
now let's have a look at how it handles
Netflix so the Netflix app installs and
runs without any problem and as you can
see I've been able to get into the
Netflix and to what a bit of Doctor Who
without any problem whatsoever
it's also worth noticing that the sound
comes through the HDMI cable and works
on the television without any problem
whatsoever
I just want to quickly mention that you
can run more than just Android on the
humming board I'm going to cover this
more when I come to review the cubox but
basically you can run things like Arch
Linux Debian Fedora Ubuntu and several
other media orientated distributions
like openelec and geek box the way you
put new software onto the humming board
issue download solid runs special
firmware called ignition you download
that from their website when you copy it
onto an SD card using the
win32diskimager program full
instructions are again on solid runs
website once you've copied it onto the
flash drive you boot your humming board
from the special firmware and you'll
then get a menu that tells you all the
different distributions that are
available to be downloaded you need to
have the Ethernet working you need to
have the cable plugged in and then it
will download and overwrite the ignition
firmware with the Linux distribution
that you want once the right is complete
reboot the board and everything should
come up as expected the humming board
comes in three versions there's the
humming board I won which is the
entry-level board which has just 512
megabytes of memory and a single core
cortex a9 CPU it supports Linux but
unfortunate doesn't support Android
however you do get Android on the
humming board I - and the I - II X both
of these have dual core cortex a9
processors the I - has a GC 8 800 GPU
while the a2e
X has the GC 2,000 GPU both have one
gigabytes of RAM and the e X version has
a hole more load of extra ports for
connecting different things like
displays and so on to the board which
aren't in the cheaper I to the i1 costs
just $70 the i2 $80 and the i2 e X a
hundred and ten dollars and so there it
is the humming board the same size as a
Raspberry Pi they're a lot more powerful
and with a lot more option
