sharks lack of a reporting live from CES
2013 we're here at from digital
experience kind of a little bit of an
exclusive event we were trying hard to
avoid the open bar and we're having a
first hands-on look at the Sony
experience that or Z if you're in the
States
anyway these is it going to take you
through it she looked a little bit
better than me
so let let us know about this new smart
sure since I am from the States I do
call it the Xperia Z so this year is
actually one of the devices we announced
here at CES the Xperia Z is known to be
a premium device made by Sony and we
like to highlight four key elements
about the best of Sony you'll find in a
smartphone I'd actually like to lead
with design Xperia Z is actually
features what we call an omni balanced
design so when you actually notice the
size of the design it's a skeleton
skeleton frame and when it comes to Omni
balance design you'll actually notice as
we take a look at 360 look of the device
itself you see all the parallel lines
the smooth round edges which basically
make the device very beautiful we also
talked about the precision craftsmanship
of the device when we talk about the
design aspect you'll notice here is the
power button it's very prominent very
beautiful very easy to see and actually
when held in your hand it's in the right
place so that's the elements when we
talk about design in terms of the best
of Sony and a smart phone then we'll go
into the display aspect so what you see
here in terms of the display obviously
it's a large display it's a 5-inch
display that utilizes Mobile BRAVIA
Engine 2 technology
what Mobile BRAVIA Engine show
technology will do is it will basically
utilize Sony intelligence and kind of
identify the type of environment that
you're in and really enhance what you're
viewing in terms of whether you're
viewing folders or videos
and just really makes those images nice
and clear
so that's the the display aspect just
kind of a another informational piece
it's pretty smooth and fast because it
is a quad-core processor
it's a 1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon s4 pro
processor so again very fast and very
smooth then now let's talk about the
camera so I'm going to turn it over here
and actually here the primary camera is
a 13 megapixel camera the camera
actually utilizes again another great
piece of Sony technology it's the Exmor
RS image sensor so the X bar RS image
sensor actually the really great
benefits of it will allow it allows you
to utilize or take rather HDR photos and
videos it is actually one of one of the
first mobile device that enables you to
do HDR videos and when you take HDR
videos it actually does it in real time
so there's really no delay once you take
the shot and then or take a video and
then I'll try to watch it right away
and what superior auto mode will allow
you to do is again another piece of you
know intelligence on the phone depending
on what you're looking at so as you see
I'm moving it around it actually knows
that there's motion going on if I'm
pointing at things that has small text
it'll notice that there's macro settings
and there's all white I don't know it'll
notice that there's text so it always
it'll always change if I'm actually kind
of showing a person we're gonna see if
we can get you here a face as you move
too quickly but it also do a they'll do
a little face for like self portrait so
again it's something where it's
automated so the user won't have to or
the you know
yep the user I won't have to manually
change the modes themselves and then the
last piece really is the NFC portion so
I am actually going to utilize this is a
wonder of our NFC headset so when I tap
it gives me a slight vibration it's
double confirming that it wants to pair
to a Bluetooth device tells me I'm
pairing and it'll basically tell me that
it's all that's good to go
so once it's done you can listen to your
music on the NFC devices the Xperia Z is
actually water-resistant so the ZL is
not so if I were to put both phones in
this thing here which I will not do with
the CL but I can easily put in the Z on
there you can still pull it out a long
time to get your phone back yeah you can
still pull it out and
and it still works awesome
on the door here it has a microSD slot
card and that actually also goes for the
DL as well so it's a 16 gigs of internal
memory plus a microSD expansion slot
let's not forget obviously obviously it
just 9.8 millimeters the thinness yeah
we're looking at a twenty three hundred
million battery on the inside which
makes it larger than a lot of his
counterparts at its size and then
actually speaking of battery because in
addition to a great sized battery both
devices have built in again intelligence
in terms of battery management so what
we have here is let me just quickly we
have what's called battery stamina mode
what battery stamina mode is known for
is it can actually increase your standby
time for up to four times when you turn
it on at its default so as you say you
wanna it's off right now two days 15
hours just letting me know what I'm
doing four days 11 hours so when I say
at its default that's basically when
well it's not it's when you do not
select other applications to run because
what happens with battery stamina mode
is when you turn off the screen so
basically I think they're saying most
users will turn off the screen 90% of
the time it will deactivate any
erroneous things that are going on in
the background and that's how it's able
to keep that standby mode there are
abilities in power amount and battery
stamina mode that allows you to
whitelist certain applications so once
you make those customizations you know
them but the standby time changes but
it's still a pretty pretty meet in terms
of battery management
that's a pretty thorough uh first look
what it's likely to be Sony's flagship
device or 2013 hopefully you guys can
price it aggressively we've heard that
it's gonna be released rather quickly on
the international market towards the end
of January hopefully only February and
obviously we're looking at they do claim
in the documentation provided that there
will be an LTE variants as well so
we're really looking forward to getting
one of these in our labs and having a
closer look and reviewing it great well
thanks for stopping by very much all
right guys
