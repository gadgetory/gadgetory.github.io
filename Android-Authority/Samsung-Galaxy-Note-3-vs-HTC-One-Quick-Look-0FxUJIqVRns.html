Authority what's going on everybody and
this is the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 versus
the HTC One in this quick look when it
comes to design this is another battle
of sizes as the Galaxy Note 3 is of
course almost a whole inch larger with
its 5.7 inch screen over the 4.7 inch
HTC One while the HTC One makes some
headway by adding those boom sound
speakers to make up for the size it is
still the smaller phone the one is the
aluminum clad Android smartphone that
brought a very well-received and
refreshing design what you see is
essentially what you get with the HTC
One but what you do get is pretty great
at the button layout is pretty classic
HTC with the power button up top and the
volume rockers on the side and nothing
is removable one-handed operation is
definitely more possible with the HTC
One compared to the galaxy note 3 but
then again the note 3 was never supposed
to be just a one-hand device after all
it comes with the s-pen that facilitates
two-handed operation but design wise we
are seeing a new philosophy with the
note line in this third iteration mainly
in the new material choice it's a point
you're going to hear a lot but that
textured plastic really is so much
better than the fingerprint prone and
slippery glossy plastic the 5.7 inch
screen especially with those thinner
bezels is a joy to use and benefits
greatly from s-pen usage these 1080p
displays both represent their companies
very well the Super AMOLED 5.7 inch
screen brings everything the galaxy s4
brought in its screen high saturation
great colors and adequate brightness the
HTC One on the other hand has a LCD
display that might not be as vibrant or
bright but it handles the darker Sense
UI very well again it's a battle of
sizes if you want the bigger screen for
all media just know what you have to go
through with the note 3's overall larger
size otherwise the HTC One has the
smaller screen and form factor on lock
performance does favour the later
released Note 3 as it has the Snapdragon
800 and Adreno 330 over the Snapdragon
600 and the audrina 320 of the HTC One
performance is given a big increase but
while the note might have a little bit
of an edge here performance on both
phones is still very good the note 3
benefits from its plastic design by
having a removable back allowing it a
replaceable 3200 milliamp hour battery
and expandable memory its main Hardware
trump card is obviously that S Pen the
HTC One does
allow you to swap its 2300 milliamp-hour
battery nor expand its memory but in
hardware you do get the boom sound
speakers that are honestly so much
better than the vast majority of
built-in speakers available elsewhere in
the camera department the note 3 takes
all of the additions that the galaxy s4
had and brings them to its own 13
megapixel shooter everything from drama
to eraser modes are included here
meanwhile the HTC One has the four
ultrapixels for enhancing primarily
low-light performance but also includes
Zoe for elegantly putting them together
it's a battle very much like the one the
HTC One in the galaxy s4 hat and the
winner depends on your photography needs
in software TouchWiz is Samsung's way of
adding in loads of new functionality to
the typical Android experience
everything from air gestures to s-pen
functions bolstered the experience in
this case the s-pen is the gateway to
using the note 3 to its greatest
potential and is a pretty beloved
addition HTC's additions in the sense UI
involve primarily the blinkfeed ii
homescreen that consolidates news and
social media outlets in a very elegant
fashion when you need to get updated
that it's there for you but a more
classical Android experience is just a
swipe away TouchWiz is the incredibly
robust experience while sense keeps
things simpler and more classical and so
there you have it the note 3 is the
behemoth of a device but the smaller and
simpler HTC one is definitely still able
to hold its own size function and
practicality dictate this battle stay
tuned for more note 3 at Aoife in berlin
and beyond here at android authority
