brought to you by domain.com now this
will not devolve in some fruitless
fanboy fapping this is by the numbers
despite the gross and lower-cost
competitors and the mid-range Android
phones this past year we still turn to
the major brands for the very top of the
line hardware and for this comparison
we're bringing out the Xperia z5 premium
the galaxy note 5 the galaxy s6 edge the
LG g4 and the HTC One m9 display
technology has seen some major advances
in the past year samsung has brought its
curved QH AMOLED to the mainstream with
its edge range sony has pushed out the
first 4k smartphone with the experience
at five premium and Huawei announced its
force touch display with the mate s
Apple remains behind the leading Android
smartphones when it comes to display
resolution as more manufacturers push to
qHD and beyond for their major flagships
instead Apple's big display feature is
3d touch which appears to be a rebranded
form of the forced touch from the Apple
watch this new feature allows users to
interact with the screen through deeper
presses as well as just regular touches
the deep touch allows for features that
are baked throughout iOS like the
ability to launch the camera into selfie
mode by deep pressing its shortcut or
the ability to preview images and other
elements without opening them if this
sounds familiar it's because many of
these UI features have been used on
Android in various forms with long
presses as a trigger there's also a
similar divisive split between the two
groups approaches to processing
technology while all of this year's
Android flagship phones have bumped up
the core count to at least 6 Apple is
sticking with just two high performing
CPU cores in its a nine system-on-a-chip
the new a9 processor is toted to be 70%
faster at CPU tasks and 90% faster at
GPU tasks compared to the a8 from last
year there's no confirmation yet but
it's believed that Apple has decided to
bump up the amount of RAM to 2 gigabytes
in its latest iPhone which would bring
it closer to this
we gigabyte standard found in most
android flagships the iPhone 6s also
features bigger numbers when we look at
the phone's camera sensors the 8
megapixel rear camera has been bumped up
to 12 megapixels although it still falls
short of the resolution of excellent
sensors found in handsets like LG
Samsung and Sony that said more pixels
don't always result in better pictures
and it's likely that the iPhone 6s
camera will remain one of the best
around the iPhone 6s also vastly
improves its front-facing camera
offering a more competitive 5 megapixels
with a resolution that catches up to
most Android flagships the LG g4
slightly ahead with the impressive 8
megapixel sensor on the front now when
it comes to additional features there's
quite a bit of diversity between the big
Android brands let alone Apple's iPhone
6s Sony remains firmly committed to
water and dust resistance which you
won't find in any of the other major
flagships Samsung still has the only
dual mode wireless charging phone in our
flagship selection here and with battery
life still questionable apple's choice
for a small 1810 milliamp hour battery
might not suit many power users who are
accustomed through 3000 milliamp hour
battery cells for many Android phones
extras like quick charging are useful to
make up the gap but Apple doesn't appear
to be adopting similar technology just
yet fingerprint scanners seem almost
like a must-have feature these days but
you won't find one on every Android
flagship phone Sony has joined the party
recently with the experience at 5:00
range but LG HTC didn't include one on
their flagship this year extra services
that use the fingerprint scanner such as
Apple's pay and Samsung pay are
certainly worth considering when you're
spending big cash on an expensive
flagship smartphone now I can already
hear some Apple people saying oh yeah
you don't get it it's about the whole
user experience hmm yeah I've heard
something like that before I've also
heard something like why do you want 4k
resolution on a smart phone when it just
drained your battery unnecessarily well
because we can we're geeks and we like
spec
no as I said I don't want an endless
fruitless iOS versus Android debate but
I will tell you this if you want a
smartphone to just kind of work now get
an iPhone please but if you want options
power and love to customize welcome to
the beloved world of Android do you hear
that crying that's someone who bought a
domain name for their business and
failed to get the dot-com why because no
domain name extension tells your story
with the same level of trust as a.com
or.net domain name dot-com and dotnet
domain name extensions and Jack
credibility into your online presence

watching edward army my name is Jace but
I did want to clear up something that
happened last week on Android weekly
where I reported the Samsung gear 2
would likely be supported by select
Samsung devices a couple of you in the
comments criticized me for not doing
fact-checking and provided a link to a
Samsung site where it clearly indicated
that Samsung would propor table Android
devices not just Samsung devices so
there's two things I wanted to say with
this one that information was accurate
at the time that the video was published
that's absolutely true and in the
article I did choose the words while our
editor did choose the words very
carefully where it said likely be
supported it wasn't 100% sure and then a
few hours later samsung clarified and
provided information on what would be
supported and what weren't and it turns
out that they would support multiple
Android devices
to Samsung generally has a history of
providing conflicting or confusing
information on multiple channels so
they'll say one thing on Twitter another
thing on their website case in point two
weeks ago when we were talking about the
Galaxy Note 5 and I criticized them for
not providing 128 gigabyte version and
then the comments you provided a link to
a Samsung website where it said no there
would be 128 gigabyte version but
we knew that that was incorrect and a
few hours later Samsung clarified it
that no there would not be 128 gigabyte
version they corrected themselves so
it's real-time news it's not like 20
years ago
where it was just we all go to a press
conference we all get the same
information and it doesn't change now
it's constantly fluid and the article
that the show is based on will be
updated so if you click on the link
below that article will be updated when
new information comes along so I wanted
to clarify that that's how it works
that's what happened okay there's any
questions please put in the comments
below
you don't wanna forget about my brothers
and sister Ann and Rud we're working
super hard to be your source for all
things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
