everything we need to know about the LG
g5 and the Samsung Galaxy s7 but all we
can do for now is sit back relax and get
excited hello everybody its crystal aura
from android authority and this month
we're finally going to know everything
we need to know about the two popular
android phones the LG g5 and the samsung
galaxy s7 they both will be announced at
around mobile world congress in a little
under week now but our question to you
guys is which one are you most excited
about they both seem like they're going
to be very nice phones that will fix
what they previously got wrong whether
that be mediocre battery life or lack of
SD card expansion but anyway let's take
a closer look and see which phone sounds
the most promising it appears that the
galaxy s7 is going to look almost
identical to the s6 with his glass
backing and metal design that a lot of
us really enjoyed although this did
leave a lot of people upset with a lack
of removable battery and lack of SD card
slot but we're seeing lots of signs for
SD card expansion this time around on
the s7 which is great news unfortunately
no removable battery still with this
glass backing we can expect the galaxy
s7 to sport a 5.1 inch Super AMOLED quad
HD display also the device will almost
certainly use welcome to use Snapdragon
820 in the United States and China with
the Exynos 88-90 being used in the s7
sold in Europe and Asia we should have 4
gigs of RAM here along with 32 gigs and
64 gigs of internal storage as for the
camera is looking more likely that a 20
megapixel sensor is going to be used
with rumors saying that we can expect to
take much better and brighter low-light
photos and there are some rumors saying
that perhaps we can expect a lower
megapixel count with bright cell
technology but that's hard to say at
this point and the same can be said with
battery some say it will be larger at
three thousand million Bowers but there
really isn't enough information to truly
say that at this point waterproofing is
also feature that may make a return to
the galaxy s7 but with no flaps over the
different ports is hard to say this is
confirmed now for pricing there
some speculation that the Galaxy s7 will
cost about ten percent less than the s6
was that release date but that seems a
little unlikely either way the Galaxy s7
will probably cost around six hundred
and fifty dollars so that's what it's
looking like for the Galaxy s7 very
similar design but this time we'll have
SD card expansion a better camera for
low-light photos and faster processing
power and on top of that the galaxy s7
edge will also be released which is
pretty much the same phone but bigger at
5.5 inches and curved at all the edges
this time is that enough for you guys to
get excited about well we'll have to see
but let's compare this to the LG g5 now
while we've seen lots of leaked images
of the galaxy s7 we haven't really seen
any of the LG g5 but from what we've
been hearing from people who supposedly
have seen it it seems LG is going to be
pulling a Samsung this year totally
reinventing their phone making the
switch from plastic to metal but before
we start moaning and groaning about this
no this doesn't mean that LG g5 will
loses replaceable battery and microSD
card slot well how is that possible well
rumors point to the g5 having a bottom
cap the slides off that will allow you
to swap the battery and even microSD
card something similar to a remote
control battery or a DSLR battery the
volume and power buttons I used to be on
the back will most likely move to the
more traditional size of the phone which
may have said some people who took the
time to get used to it but will probably
end up bringing in more users the
displays on the LG G Series seem to be
growing year after year but is expected
that this year the g5 will sport a
smaller 5.3 inch LCD display instead now
this may be because an additional ticker
display will be writing above similar to
the v10 secondary screen that being said
other sources are claiming a 5.6 inch
display is being used here so it's
really up to speculation at the moment
but either way we should expect a g5 to
be the larger phone internally we should
expect the same setup as the s7
Snapdragon 820 processor but with three
gigs of RAM and 32 gigs of internal
storage and now for the camera the g5 is
rumored to take a page out of the v10s
book with that dual camera setup but
where the v10 have them in the front for
creating some interesting selfie shots
the G
five may have them on the back instead
perhaps similar to the HTC One m8 this
could create some really beautiful wide
angle shots and other front features
we're looking at 16 megapixels for the
main camera and 8 megapixels for the
selfie camera now with the g5 being a
lot thinner and made from metal there's
a lot of disappointing evidence that
shows that the g5 may have a smaller
battery at two thousand eight hundred
million Bowers which could be
troublesome as battery life on the g4
was an issue for a lot of people however
it may be with a smaller screen size and
better processing power we will see a
decrease in battery life and perhaps
maybe more of what we're familiar with
on the g4 we're thinking that the LG g5
will cost around 600 to 650 dollars
although it might be a little bit more
with a full metal body design but once
again we'll have to wait to the official
LG g5 announcement on februari 21st at
Mobile World Congress so now that we've
examined the possibilities of each phone
which one are you more excited about
price shouldn't be an issue here as
they're probably going to end up
crossing about the same performance-wise
both phones will run very similarly with
their Snapdragon 820 s but an extra gig
of ram front of the s7 and some people
may lean a little more towards the s7
having better performance we're looking
at amulet vs LCD preferences here and
i'm guessing the majority of us will
enjoy the acclaimed amla displays found
on the samsung devices both devices seem
to be fantastic devices if these rumors
are indeed true so now we like to know
which one are you more excited by last
year was Samsung's here to reinvent
themselves and with this year looking to
be LG's year to do the same we are
really excited to see what the LG g5 has
to offer and it appears that you guys
are too we've ran a pull on our website

overwhelmingly the LG g5 seems to be
creating the most excitement at sixty
percent over the s7 twenty one percent
