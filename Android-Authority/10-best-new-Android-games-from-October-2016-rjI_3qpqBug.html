handy the Android authority app guy and
it's about that time of month to round
up the best new Android games as usual
if you want to check out any of these
games for yourself you can find those
links in the video description below
Vander Saga 2 is the sequel to one of
the best strategy RPG titles out there
it features a lot of the same artwork
styles and gameplay mechanics as the
first one that may sound bad but both of
those things were absolutely amazing in
the first one so it's nice to see them
return again decisions you make in the
game will affect the storyline and that
includes whether or not a character dies
in combat it's a must-have for any
strategy RPG fan that also cost less
than its predecessor the bug butcher is
the latest title out of noodle cake
studios this one is an arcade shooter
where you must kill tons of bugs it
sounds easy but the bugs are gigantic
and there are plenty of them the
mechanics are simple to learn because
you can only point your gun in one
direction your job will be to run from
room to room and exterminate all of the
bugs it's suffering from some early
release issues at the moment however
those should be cleared up soon it's
$3.99 with no in-app purchases burly men
at sea is one of the more unique
releases from the last month it's an
adventure game that takes place in 20th
century Scandinavia the game is actually
pretty short instead of giving you a big
long adventure the game instead branches
out players are then supposed to replay
the game and explore the various
branches the game utilizes a flat
storybook style of graphics which gives
it a certain charm it also boasts no
in-app purchases and no advertising crap
I'm broke out of pocket is a life
management game your job is to live what
amounts to a fairly normal life you'll
need to get a job pay the bills and
avoid dying from things like starvation
it features a colorful flat graphical
style that plays really nicely with all
the times you're going to check and see
how much debt you've accrued there are
tons of jobs plenty of minigames and a
karma system that has no problems with
punishing you it's also relatively
inexpensive dan the man is the latest
game out of half brick studios for those
who don't know that's the company that
did fruit ninja and jetpack joyride dan
the man bills itself as an action
platformer you'll be hopping around
various levels beating up bad guys and
taking on bosses dan the man also
contains daily events secret areas and
support for Hardware game
it's a freemium game which isn't that
great however it's not half bad even for
a freemium game FIFA mobile soccer is
the latest annual release of the famed
at fief of franchise it features updated
rosters teams and gameplay mechanics
compared to last year's game otherwise
the game offers up 30 leagues 650 real
teams and 17,000 real players there are
also a variety of game modes in order to
keep you busy
it's an EA Sports title which means the
in-app purchase strategy is going to be
fairly aggressive the good news is that
it's a fairly decent game if you can get
past all of that Laura Croft guardians
of light is a new release of an old game
it plays a lot like other games in the
franchise where you'll be wandering
around various levels while solving
puzzles avoiding certain death and
taking on bad guys it also includes
things like co-op multiplayer unlockable
content and boss fights you'll be using
an on-screen gamepad to control your
movements and it works pretty well but
we wish it had come with Hardware
controller support as well there are no
in-app purchases for now but there may
be in the future
legend of the skyfish is an adventure
game that features a little girl and a
fishing pole your job will be to make it
to the end in order to defeat the evil
sky fish the game contains 45 levels
complete with puzzles enemies and boss
fights the main mechanic in this game is
the use of your fishing pole it gets
used for everything from feeding on bad
guys to transportation as sort of a
grappling hook it's a fun little title
and relatively inexpensive Ludi dungeon
is the latest game out of Yoda won games
they're the ones that made Crossy Road
in case you had forgotten in this title
you'll be walking through an endless
dungeon in each level you must avoid
traps defeat bad guys and race against
the clock to make it to the next level
the game ends when you inevitably die
there are 50 unlockable heroes 8 boss
fights and more stuff for you to do it's
a decent little time killer although it
does suffer from a lack of depth like
other Yoda won titles it's also a
freemium game Plants vs Zombies Heroes
is unlike most pvz titles this one has a
much larger focus on PvP combat you'll
have 20 characters that you can collect
and then you take a few of them and go
into battle against other players it
plays a lot like hearthstone or clash
Royale but with less of an emphasis on
card collecting in any case it's a good
time killer and fans of the series
should be able to get comfortable with
this game rather quickly
like other pvz titles this one is also a
freemium game and that about does it for
this one folks if you want to keep
watching
have our selections for the best new
Android apps that were released in
October linked up there on the screen
and in the video description below don't
forget to check that out and keep it
tuned to Android Authority because we
are your source for all things Android
thanks again for watching everybody and
have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
