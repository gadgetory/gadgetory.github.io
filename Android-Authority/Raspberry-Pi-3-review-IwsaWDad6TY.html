authority now it was only four years ago
the Raspberry Pi foundation released the
original Raspberry Pi model B and
absolutely a revolutionary product it
was a small single board computer that
could run Linux you've got things like a
desktop compilers Java C Python you can
run an internet browser you had a set of
GPIO pins general purpose input output
pins that you can connect the sensors
you could control robots you could light
up lights and it was only thirty five
twenty five or thirty five dollars
depending on which modules you picked
absolutely started a whole new
revolution then after that came the
Raspberry Pi 2 same form factor the same
compatibility the same general design
but this time with a quad-core processor
but still sticking at that $35 price
point and then for a while the Raspberry
Pi foundation took things in a different
direction they lowered the price and we
have the Raspberry Pi 0 now that was a
tiny tiny little board using the same
protists as the original Raspberry Pi
but only cost $5 that now the new latest
thing is that the Raspberry Pi
foundation have released the raspberry
Pryde 3 and what's different about this
one this one has got a 64-bit quad-core
processor on it and it's got Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth so let's take a deeper look at
it
now when it comes to the design of the
Raspberry Pi there's no getting away
from it you're just buying a circuit
board and actually that's the intention
now you can buy some third party cases
you can even buy some case some official
cases from the Raspberry Pi foundation
however at the end of the day what you
buy is a circuit board but a circuit
board that can do a whole bunch of
things let's have a look around the
board so looking around the board
towards the bottom you'll find the HDMI
port the 3.5 millimeter audio jack and
the microUSB port which is used to power
the board and to the right-hand side
you'll find the USB ports as four of
those and the Ethernet port and along
the top you'll find the GPIO pins the
general purpose input output pins should
out clip the Raspberry Pi to a whole
variety of different things including
sensors and motors and so on now the
real star attraction on the Raspberry Pi
3 is the new 64-bit cortex a53 processor
from Broadcom that also includes the
video core GPU the original Raspberry Pi
and the Raspberry Pi 0 both use a single
core ARM v6 processor from Broadcom
along with the video core GPU the
Raspberry Pi 2 uses a quad core cortex
a7 CPU also from Broadcom using the same
GPU and now the raspberry pi 3 uses the
64-bit ARM v8 our picture this time the
cortex a53 chip again with the same GPU
so we've gone from RB 6 to RB 7 32-bit
up to arm v 8 64-bit in just four years
and the pricing has remained the same
just $35 absolutely fantastic so now
looking at the hardware why is this the
Raspberry Pi 3 rather than say a
Raspberry Pi 2 plus well first of all
course we've got the new processor that
changed from a cortex a7 processor which
was 32 bits to the cortex a53 processor
which is 64 bits but also you have now
built-in Wi-Fi and built-in Bluetooth
now the buzzword for 2015 and it looks
like for 2016 is the Internet of Things
IOT
now the addition of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
makes this an excellent prototyping
board an excellent development board for
IOT so what about software
well the operating system of choice for
the Raspberry Pi 3 is Linux however it
isn't the only operating system
available you can also run Windows 10
IOT core and you can run riscos now when
it comes to MOOCs there are a plethora
of different distributions available
that you can run on your Raspberry Pi
however there is an official one called
raspbian which is supported by the
Raspberry Pi foundation and installing
it really is a breeze use downloaded zip
file from the Raspberry Pi website you
extract its contents onto an SD card and
then you boot your PI with the SD card
following a few more on-screen
instructions and everything will be
installed with all this talk of 64-bit
processors you might think that the
version of Linux that comes with the
Raspberry Pi 3 is in fact a 64-bit
version well unfortunately it isn't at
the moment all of the major links
distributions for the Raspberry Pi 3 are
still 32-bit however I'm sure that's
going to change in the future now when
it comes to perform as the Raspberry Pi
3 is faster than the Raspberry Pi 2 no
small part because the new CPU is
clocked at 1.2 gigahertz compared to 900
megahertz of the Raspberry Pi 2 now I
did some testing using the speed
benchmark of OpenSSL and my figures show
that the Raspberry Pi 3 is around 35 to
40 percent faster than the Raspberry Pi
2 as for real-world desktop performance
the Raspberry Pi 3 has certainly noticed
the PI a step closer to becoming a true
desktop alternative loading a webpage
like Andrew Northridge EECOM is about 50
percent slower on the Raspberry Pi when
compared to a modern desktop computer
launching a program like libreoffice
writer' is around three times slower
however at the moment though the idea of
the Raspberry Pi 3 isn't to replace the
desktop is it at all for hobbyists and
educators and as such the performance is
excellent limits comes pre-installed
with tools like Python 3 wolfram
mathematica there are office suites like
Libre Office and you get access to C C++
golang and Java compilers unlike the PI
1 and the PI 0 which really had to be
use from the command line if you wanted
to keep your sanity the pi3 is a
pleasure to use from the desktop as well
as the standard desktop distributions
there are also some specialist Linux
distributions available for the
Raspberry Pi 3 and that includes OS MCV
open source media center which is
basically a version of Linux allows you
to boot straight up into the Kodi Media
Player now to test this I connected up
an external hard drive to my Raspberry
Pi I booted up into Cody and I was
easily able to find the files and play
the video my test video was a high
bitrate Full HD video that came straight
out of Premiere Pro and it was able to
be played on the Raspberry Pi without
any trouble whatsoever so when i scary
sim from andhra thority i hope you've
enjoyed this look at the Raspberry Pi 3
if you did please do give it a thumbs up
also please use a comments below tell me
what you think about the PI 3 do have a
PI 2 or a PI 0 and you're going to get
yourself a PI 3 let us know into this
what you think also don't forget to
subscribe to and rathore ities youtube
channel also you can follow me on
twitter and social media and also if you
use this link here you can find me on
the android authority forums there's a
place where you can ask me questions
about the Raspberry Pi 3 about any of
the other videos that I've done and if I
know the answer I'll try to help you as
much as I can also don't forget to stay
tuned to and/or Authority calm because
we are your source for all things
