and we're here at the Samsung unpacked
event the experience centre is right
below and it's going to close in a
couple of minutes but thankfully as I
was walking around and vlogging for this
and then I was able to get a bunch of
our friends to give us their thoughts in
20 seconds on the Galaxy S a so why
don't we go ahead and get started with
that smash-cut
nirvan is a do one so here we go 20
seconds on the Galaxy S a starting now
really nice phone they've recovered
hahaha really nice phone they you know
it's an iteration of the edge they the
eighteen point five by nine means you've
got lots of more screen no bezel
thankfully I love the home button under
the screen that's kind of cool you know
it's different you won't really
recognize it think we're in sensor on
the back what the hell are you thinking
otherwise I want one
it looks bloody good now okay I love it
I think we got it as they
so I can't wait to like actually the
drivers green is amazing that was the
most beautiful thing of all but
everything else going big time haha
ricky ha ha ha all right 20 seconds to
tell me everything or anything you want
about the galaxy si and go I love this
plane that is very cool
we fighting the affecting how the
doctors work that would I be able to
work out that moment
I know what else there is and
everything's already been like that well
that's time anyway
Thomas receipt oh not everyone all right
20 seconds tell me what you want about
the galaxy are you tight are you timing
it are you counting I'm Thunder yeah
okay all right
start now cool display slim body no
camera bump really battery life is kinda
unknown but I assume it's going to be
pretty average I do like the new
assistant Big B we'll see how that plays
out you know serious kind of been a flop
to be honest
Google assistant is very promising but
big be fun the next day and it's mr.
mobile himself it is he wasn't ready
though he's going to go to do as have
another take
and it's mr. Mullins a liquid like sexy
design and artificial intelligence
I didn't say sorry yeah oh god well I'm
doing it alright last time you cheated
me out of like six seconds all right
well here yeah let's go Sarge
now a sexy design that could only be
described as liquid like artificial
intelligence and the capability to turn
into a fake computer it's a very very
Samsung phone it is everything you
expect from a samsung phone and you
might end up buying one today Mobile my
breath
from last night there's no way I'm
letting you cut me off haha bill nigut
I didn't mean to startle you there all
right well it's a phone it does phone
things the display looks gorgeous right
looks beautiful maybe this will be the
year that we finally get desktop dock to
work for phones I've been seeing people
promise that forever it's not going to
happen
stop making it happen but damn sexy
looking phone almost the SEC needs mr.
Bobo Michael Josh from gadget mags
great to see Michael bionaire nope
the display the infinite infinity
display having nothing up there nope
order no home buttons just a camera and
a big-screen I think that's enough for
users to kind of want to consider the
phone iOS users even switch
oh really you're gonna go you're gonna
cut it there well that was the 22nd
sorry right now well no it was like 15
but one what's up guys
le the only buddy I never seen the LA
brother from another mother dad we need
to spend time another to get together
this feels a lot smaller in the hand and
you think that ring sizing might
indicate and also this is a really
interesting story from Samsung in a sort
of redemption you know sort of learning
from the mistakes in the past and really
making sure they can maximize features
we care about all high five off the
market zombie twenty seconds on the job
CSA and go it's well I guess after
spending all the time it deals better it
looks better design tonight we need its
little good camera I'm kind of hoping
about low-light will see and just
everyone a bone while charging get your
sample storage quits I'm done
hey there you go so foot then I hope
that it works well but yeah it's time
for my twenty seconds so we can round
out this video and those will start
right now the Galaxy S II feels sublime
especially as the smaller device it's
definitely the one that you want because
it's 5.7 inches with that screen but it
still feels incredibly small and then
the SI plus it's a little bit bigger the
only thing that I think is missing on
these phones is an extra land to be
great if there was a dual camera on here
and that is my twenty seconds ending
right now alright hopefully you guys
enjoyed the twenty seconds on the galaxy
s 8 and the f8 + C between two and
recording that which we are for all of
the best coverage on the Galaxy s8 yes
least less than all the Samsung devices
including the free one we got at the
event like this bad boy here keep it
tuned here and remember that Andrew
authority is your source for all things
and
hahaha</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
