new emerging technology just around the
corner that is going to revolutionize
everything sometimes nothing happens
will that be true when it comes to
foldable or bendable displays I think
not
why because there are nearly countless
practical applications for bendable
displays oh you want me to count them
one two three four five six seven eight
nine well now this very promising report
is all about the exciting possibilities
of bendable displays just around the
corner and it was given to us by an
executive of Collin industries now I
know it's spelled : but I'm not saying :
because that's a whole other type of
bendable by 2019 foldable devices are
expected to have skyrocketed in
popularity just after our short term on
the market this according to an
executive at Collin industries which
makes a critical component for foldable
displays they told Korean Herald this
last week and they also expect foldable
devices to have a 20% market share in
South Korea during the same year so I
know what you're thinking who is this
guy and why should we listen to him well
: Industries is currently the only
company in the whole world that is able
to mass-produce colorless polymide an
essential ingredient in foldable devices
: Industries is already working closely
with big names like Samsung and LG by
supplying them with the already
mentioned material based on their
insider information
Colin Industries expects that between
three and five companies will begin mass
producing foldable smartphones by 2018
and they believe that the first devices
will hit the market will have a bend
radius of 5 millimeters instead of just
one millimeter as have been previously
predicted now a Bend radius is simply
the minimum radius something can be bent
without causing damage to it therefore a
smaller radius means that a certain
material is more flexible obviously a
very important consideration when
talking about folding devices but
according to Colin industries that
radius will improve over time the Bend
radius of one millimetre is the most
ideal but that may cause a safety issue
so tech companies are likely to unveil
the Bend radius of 5 millimeters first
and then gradually unveil devices with
less Bend radius now will this actually
become a reality in the foreseeable
future I don't know I know that it seems
really amazing and it just seems like
the next logical step for many people
but here's the thing a lot of early
adopters and tech geeks like us get
really excited about any new possible
innovation but to the mainstream it may
seem like more of a hassle than it's
worth or try and solve a problem that
just isn't a problem does it make things
more convenient does it make things
quicker and easier I don't know I can
think of many practical applications
like the most obvious is bendable
displays that are on your clothes so in
an emergency situation for example you
know clothes that are monitoring all
your vitals can show that information to
emergency personnel it can be on cars on
windshields on a whole bunch of stuff I
mean there's just endless examples about
it what do you guys think what are the
practical applications for bendable
displays that are actually really useful
and don't just make it cool you know I'm
talking about let me know in the
