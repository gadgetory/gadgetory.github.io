Jason this is where we try and answer
your most pressing Android questions and
sometimes those questions are of a more
human nature is it possible to become
addicted to tweaking my android phone
well sadly I wish I could tell you this
was not a real condition but sadly it is
it is called Hindi Vitus and if you're
not careful you could end up looking
like this poor Hindi he's still sore
after the Americans lost the Canadians
in Olympic hockey again first question
comes from Mohammad where he asks about
the best camera on an Android smartphone
so Mohammad it should be said here that
I haven't personally had my hands on all
of these phones Josh has or he will and
you know you really need to check his
reviews where he goes into the camera in
some detail but if having a camera on
your smartphone is really important and
you want to take the best best pictures
possible I can give you the benefit of
all the reviews and and reading that I
do on the subject so you don't have to
so generally speaking you know
all-around good quality cameras right
now people are talking about the Galaxy
s5 and the LG G pro okay so that you
know they're quite high megapixel count
decent lowlights technology and
performance but you know it doesn't have
the waterproof and high megapixel count
that the experience C Series does but
all around general performance those two
are considered pretty high but again a
lot of people ask these questions and I
don't know the priority so I'm giving my
personal opinion what I really like is
you know being able to crop to my
heart's content so the high megapixel
counts are really important for me the
experience series is fantastic and it's
waterproof underwater you know taking
pictures is just fun I like that kind of
thing so you want to consider all those
things but you can search our Channel
and search and rotary comm for some more
details on camera reviews hello Jay
speaking I was in the met all right next
question deals with iPhone and V why is
it that an iPhone performs as well or
better than an Android flagship phone
even though the iPhone 5s only has a
dual-core processor
well you should know Apple has two major
advantages when it comes to this kind of
thing and one is that they control both
the hardware and the software and it
makes it much easier for them to create
a cohesive user experience when they
control both ends of the spectrum unlike
Google the second factor is that up
until this year 2014 iOS developers have
only had one phone form factor to
optimize for only one screen size one
type of battery one type of you know
chipset all that kind of thing so it's
much easier for them to economize the
apps resources streamlining the apps
user experience that makes it faster and
smoother for the most part but of course
this all these advantages haven't
carried over to a battery optimization
because the iPhones battery usage sucks
next up is an Android update question
hey Jason I own a nexus 7 2013 and with
all the rumors about the upcoming 4.4.3
Android update
do I need to unroot and lock the
bootloader again in order to get a clean
install or will Unruh ting be okay
so christian if you want to get Android
updates OTA OTA means over-the-air then
you need to be running a carrier
supported version of Android now if you
are running a custom ROM and you want to
keep it then you need to wait until that
roms developer integrates the latest
version of Android that was a long show
today guys but thanks for watching
please connect with me here on Google+
or Twitter I will respond I should point
out that it was a lot of you who are
trying to open up a private hangout with
me and ask questions I chose not to do
that because it's not public and then
no-one else can benefit from it and I
can't possibly answer individual
responses like that it's just too many
and it doesn't help anybody else so if
you want me to help you please on
Twitter or in the YouTube comments
because then it's public and if you had
that question I know many other people
have that question and that helps them
out too
alright alright don't forget about my
brothers in andhra josh jo and the tech
ninja Kevin and Chris I shall see you
next week on Android Q&amp;amp;A</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
