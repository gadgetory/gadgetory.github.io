we got a brand new Galaxy Note 2 and it
kills me to do this but it's drop test
time so we have a brand new Galaxy Note
2 here for you to device a lot of people
are excited about the galaxy s3 did
break open basically in our previous
drop test this one has a similar build
and it is heavier and bigger let's see
how it holds up in our drop test we want
to make this the most realistic drop
test possible so I just want to explain
the philosophy for you really quickly
first we're going to be letting a fall
out of the pocket as naturally as
possible at 2 feet 6 inches then from
there I'm going to raise it up to my
chest at around 4 feet and we're gonna
let it drop as well
finally we're going to end with the
dropping for my ear which is around 5
foot 6 inches all of these drops
combined will portray the most realistic
drop scenario possible now we're going
to do the first drop from 2 feet 6
inches so it actually did really really
well it just hit it on the side here we
can see a little bit of damage obviously
to the vest the exterior bezel but the
display is still working everything's
intact so it looks like fared really
really well for the first drop test it's
time for the second part of the drop
test we're going to be dropping it from
around 4 feet of the chest so here goes
whoo okay all right this is the battery
fell out obviously poor galaxy note 2
man I'm so sorry all right so yeah
obviously the case is fine in terms of
the display yeah it wasn't compromised
where's the point of impact here so
obviously that's the first point of
impact and just a little bit here to the
left but you know in terms of how it
feels with the Flex and everything it
does appear to be stronger than the s3
so I won't be surprised if it doesn't
break the display still intact there's
no cracking on it whatsoever and just a
few minor scuffs to the periphery so for
the second drop test for four feet is
held up remarkably well so the Galaxy
Note 2 is held up really well so far now
it's the moment of truth we're going to
be dropping it from 5 feet 6 inches
let's see how it goes
you know what even though the battery
just loves to fall out really sorry
galaxy don't to my little precious
really sorry to do this to you baby you
know it's still in great shape guys five
foot six inches where the galaxy s3
fractured already twice there's no
cracking to the display just a few minor
scuffs on the side you know really
really impressed with the Galaxy Note 2
it's held up remarkably well there's
nothing wrong with it at all in the
display is totally working
YouTube great news Galaxy Note 2 held up
really well we've dropped it three times
so pretty hard impacts no cracking of
the display just a little bit of
scratches and scuffing to the side so we
have to add to the Samsung that looks
like they really improved on the build
quality for this one is Android
authority here bringing you the world's
first drop test of the Galaxy Note 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
