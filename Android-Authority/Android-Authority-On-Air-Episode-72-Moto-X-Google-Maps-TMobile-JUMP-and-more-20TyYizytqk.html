original android hangout show on google+
I'm Derek Ross I'm Scott Anderson and
I'm Johnathan Franklin this week we are
going to hit up some app updates such as
Maps chrome Facebook we're going to talk
about the Moto X we have some
information about the specs we talked to
one of our close and personal friends
that actually got to use the device
pretty exciting we have some information
on motorola's droids I hate that name
we'll talk about some other phones some
other rumors mother leaks we're going to
talk about some exciting carrier news
and how if you're on t-mobile they just
gave you a way to save a ton of
money excuse my language and we're gonna
finish up with basically Apple getting
screwed yeah a little bit he'll clapping
her hands to that one all right um so so
let's get started Scott I see you don't
have your bed made yeah thank you uh
Bobby Joe for pointing that out I
appreciate it and no we will not get
that trending oh come on now you know it
was I you know you know what's not these
years he'll do it on here if you plus
what you'll see if I tell you what right
now if Scott make your bed becomes
trending on google+ now i will give away
a twenty-dollar google play gift card
how about that ooh to who though to who
to a lucky winner on next show to a
lucky winner on the next show that we
will figure out how to give it away to
them now and then turbine browser that
is terribly embarrassing with maybe you
don't make memes of me or anything
actually make means make that idea don't
give it a my way fun of the scott is
made the more compelled i will be to
give away gift cards I am fueled by his
humiliation it's always so since that's
do your thing talk about some apps okay
so Google Maps we've been waiting for it
for a long time got updated awesome uh
the UI is kind of reflect
of what they came out with an iOS it's a
basically a full screen they did away
with the lower bar the navigation bar
which kind of I don't know some people
are but heard about it but there's a
slide-out menu to the side and it's
basically an action button and the
search bar on the top brings up many
things if the results it's nice card you
I and google latitude is retiring on
August ninth which in return location
will be through Google+ which I have a
bone to pick with Google+ i think Derek
does too if you have a rom oh yeah
that's that's a little interesting so if
you're on a rooted the phone uh if
you're running a custom rom let's say an
AOSP rom and you go into locations on
google+ you'll see all your friends
locations without a map you'll just see
their faces their profile pics you won't
actually see a map it's it's horrible in
the longest time I never knew why I all
my nexus Stevan i see a beautiful map i
see where everybody's at and then I go
over to my DNA that's running cm10 and
boom I have no mappers it's just blank
and I always wondered why in this week
we found out that it's due to as well
something we don't know exactly why but
we found the fix you move the app into
the system app directory and then you
move all of the libs all the library
files associated with the Google+ app
you move them into system lib restart
your phone and wha-la I did it on my DNA
and now I have a beautiful map showing
all my friends locations but I shouldn't
have to do that so google+ and you know
you guys need to fix your app for rooted
users on custom roms you know we're a
big force here you know we shouldn't
have to do this silly little workarounds
there has to be some reason as to why
that that fixes it so yeah anyways
so pretty much Scott why bullying you I
very nice um what do you guys think
about it is like it yeah I haven't tried
it yet i'm doing the Scott Anderson move
right now I'm waiting to see how long it
takes Google to push it out to me I
haven't side loaded yet haha I I don't
have it I'm waiting I mean all they go
the chrome stable build for Android full
screen on tablets transit translate
language bar pops up when reading ages
and different languages new layout for
right-to-left languages in the usual
stability and performance updates as
every update does and then Facebook beta
seems to be a server-side push their
testing out a version of the app that
removes the slide-out menu and adds the
bottom based tabs which is irritating it
goes against all hollow Yolo designs
yeah if there's no action overflow and
the legacy menu button is still there
well you know John you're down with the
hollow Yolo what do you think of that
new design for your facebook well it's
you know not just the tabs I mean don't
get it's still the tabs too they have
the perfect like the action bar up top
it just shows newsfeed and the whole
group thing it's the only thing that
shows on his text like that I mean it
just takes off so much screen real
estate it's ridiculous I mean they got
there you know status photo location
like the bar that slides out of the way
and the action bar and bottom tab so
means it just wastes I mean I hope you
like scrolling you know and then I hope
you like if your on-screen button device
doesn't have a action overflow either
because that and they kind of have the
perfect excuse to fix that with a new
layout but I guess that's just not how
Facebook rules there's a boy maybe
they're just doing it because they you
know they did the slide-out menu for a
long time now that that's really getting
popular with
apparently they must just hate Google's
designs almost they decided to screw it
up ugh again like absolutely I don't
know I mean it's it would make sense to
differentiate themselves but it would
not make sense to not be fluid with
everything else it differentiating is
fine but their apps is terrible still I
mean that's the thing yeah if they're f
was competent and useful you know that's
one thing but if you're just breaking
stuff and guidelines for you know no
reason in your app sucks till then
that's kind of a it almost reminds you
of the Instagram though in the design
the layout of it does but it just
doesn't work well and then also Google+
update if you +1 something then your
followers by oh by default your extended
circles will be shown at their own
algorithm that you +1 something and so
it's a way to discover new content a lot
of people on google+ or bun heard about
it a lot of people like it I like it
yeah you know it gives the +1 button
actually relevancy and actually means
something more than just up hey I'm
gonna + bomb somebody we won't say what
other people really call it you know
like Plus Ones actually mean something
you know so if I plus something it's
because I i I'd like it and I want to
show my appreciation for it I want other
people to see it means something so it
has value I like it and you know I've
had actually a few people messaged me
saying hey Derek your Plus Ones are
showing we can I'm getting
recommendations from you just one let
you notice you can turn it off I'm like
yeah thanks it's working great yeah I'm
not going to turn it off that's what
it's there for it's I was scared that it
was gonna make this dream really noisy
you know kind of like Facebook does it
with like shears use articles but yeah
I've been kind of pleasantly surprised
because the stuff that has shown from
other friends hasn't really been you
know it's
usually been stuff that I was interested
to see and also you know it's it's only
every once in a while in my stream it's
not at all noisy you know and nothing
they must have had you know had to taken
that into account because google+ tend
to be more noisy than facebook anyway
because you follow so many more people
in your circles but it's it hasn't been
you know as scary as I thought it could
be and it's actually been a pretty good
improvement in a lot of ways that's nice
okay so let's talk about some devices
those of you that bought google play
edition devices they started shipping
this week so once you get it you know
once you get your HTC One Google Play
edition all your samsung galaxy s4
Google Play edition let us know what you
think let us know if you know you like
it and leave a comment you know I'm sure
these devices are going to be a hit
amongst fans that want them but they're
not gonna break any sales numbers by any
means they're more of an enthusiast
device I Frank all right uh let's talk
about some big news let's talk about the
motorola x so we have a friend that was
able to play with the sprint version of
the motorola x and some things are
exciting about it and some things kind
of upset me personally about it so let's
just run down some information that we
got from him he said that the camera is
awesome it's great you know it's it's 10
pixels it's a really very good camera it
might not be as good as the HTC One but
very capable so it's very it does very
well in low light situations which is
what we had heard about he said battery
life is great at the time talking to him
he said that
it had been on for four hours with 90
minutes of screen on time and he was at
sixty-eight percent battery so an hour
and a half of screen on time phone had
been off the charger for four hours and
sixty-eight percent on battery said
don't know what he was doing you know
besides the screen activity but still
that's that's not horrible saying okay
Google now opens up the google now opens
up search it's an always-on feature so
you don't have to turn the screen on
unlock the screen and then say or and
then start Google search or tap the mic
or flick up anything like that you just
look at it and say okay Google now and
then you just start doing your search or
that brings up Google now and then from
there you start searching there's a
motorola idea moto ID account which is
similar to samsung and HTC their
accounts you can use your google account
to science there's no need to create a
special profile remember Google and
Motorola the same company so you don't
need to do anything special to do that
um the software was just a test version
right now obviously it's not ready to go
but the test version that they were
running was Android 4.2 point to the
latest version of Android it's typical
Motorola build quality you know nice and
sturdy it's a well-built phone now now
really get to the part that makes
d'eryka a sad panda I was going to
convince myself to buy this phone
because it was rumored to maybe be a 7 a
4.7 inch screen my buddy said it's not
he said it's a four point four inch
screen 720p 320 pixels per inch so with
that screen sides John and I were
talking earlier saying this is going
after the iphone I mean you know it's a
smaller phone a lot of people don't like
the big phones
people do i do but it really seems like
that's who that they're targeting
they're competing with at that small
screen size and that you know that type
of resolution no there is a market for
there's a huge market for it where if
you see people that try out a hit
anything really a galaxy s4 HTC One and
is this home so big and my hand was
playing with you know she saw my galaxy
nexus in my note 2 as well and she's
like I just don't know yes you know you
can tell people well you're going to get
used to it but first impressions make a
big deal and she's like I just couldn't
use a phone this big yeah it's like an
instant you know for some people you
know they want that sighs it's not
pulling a big size you know some people
love it so there's definitely market for
it as you said so back to some of the
specs that we know well we were told
that the battery is somewhere around
2000 milliamp hours or maybe 2100
milliamp hours one hundred percent sure
yet the model that they're testing right
now has 16 gigs of storage available I'm
sorry is it a 16 gigabytes of storage
with 11.9 available as I said earlier
the 10 megapixel camera does great in
low light situations and a leaked
verizon road map says that this device
moto X will be available on the
twenty-third and previous reports from
The Wall Street Journal said that the
device will be launching on all carriers
at the same time whenever the device
launches so we might not have to wait
you know a few weeks where to show up on
this carrier a few weeks to show up in
this carrier months you know and so
forth so that's good if they're all
going to be made available roughly at
the same time and the wall street
journal also said an interesting point
this week that the Moto X was going to
be very heavily marketed that google /
motorola were prepared to spend 500
million dollar
marketing blitz a marketing campaign
that's a lot of money so they're
definitely trying to make this device a
success I mean they're they're gonna
market the hell out of this device
they're gonna know where Eddie saw them
put it in the major news publications in
the United States so they're obviously
gonna take this whole motox you straight
to the bank they're their gun and hard
for it the biggest thing that excites me
about this phone is the fact that it
will probably cost less a significant
amount less than the nexus 4 off
contract that's the current rumor that
it might be 200 bucks off contract if
this is 200 bucks off contract very
interesting so this might be a free
phone with contract or maybe 50 bucks
huh yeah I don't know what they'll do it
launched but well how much was the
facebook phone 100 laughter laughter a
week it was free days off contract
that's that's one thing worth you know
with it being so cheap off contract and
there's no rumors to say maybe 300 or so
good that's what the carriers are going
to buy it for so they've got the leeway
to really subsidize it down to free and
still make a ton of money and that's
probably why you know the other rumors
are that Google really talk them out of
a lot of bloatware on the device and
everything the fact that they're giving
that phone to the carrier where they get
this me probably insane profit margins
just by offering it it kind of opens up
leeway to make those kind of
negotiations so in the best part of it
and the other thing I mean I like the
idea of this device because for a
hundred bucks if you send your mom or
sister aunt whomever into a carrier
store and they're probably not wanting
to spend on a flagship device and they
want to spend say a hundred bucks or
fifty bucks the phone that they get is a
little bit piece of crap yep
realistically and this you know really
the screen size everything is
approachable to average consumers and
its stock Android I'm a aside from
Motorola's contextual stuff this thing's
pretty much running bone stock for
point-to-point too so you can put that
and good build quality in the hands of
you know that everybody kind of consumer
and it'd be a device that you know yeah
in other kind of hits that balance this
device really could potentially be huge
for them because iphone 5 isn't really
meeting the expectations they set out in
the samsung galaxy s4 isn't but the
thing that's getting more popular are
people elected to get the galaxy s3 now
or the iOS now there are more people
actually of a close group of friends
people that bought an iphone only one of
them sprung for the five the rest of
them got the foreheads I mean people
just the hardware is getting to the
point where mid-range is the new
battleground and remember Apple is
rumored to this fall be putting out a
budget lower build quality cheaper
iPhone so the Moto X could be you know
competing with that as well why is it's
not gonna appease the spec hunters but a
500 million dollar marketing budget I
don't think you have to now you know I I
said it when the galaxy s3 launched and
I said on the galaxy s4 launch that you
know we really are almost besides you
know the techie geek people that care
about this kind of stuff are really
passed the the age of the spec you know
it's a dram things are fast I mean you
know what I mean phones of if you get a
mid-range film will submit mid-range
compare the specs that's still pretty
that's still pretty fast I mean you get
a the Snapdragon s4 that's still a fast
processor you know is it as fast as the
600 or 800 no but do you what do you
really need to run like them why do you
really need something that fast to run
that something I fast besides benchmarks
and numbers so that's just like saying
why would you need LTE if if you 3g
suffices but that's that designs well
the other side of it is though most of
the performance of differences
when devices right now we're all in
software it's all if you somewhat
hardware too well I mean like the s4 is
a benchmark queen but if you compared to
the google play edition device to google
play edition feels faster substantially
faster because right yes the software is
more optimized so it's a that doesn't
mean you can get away with crap hardware
you know you're never going to get away
with band hardware but you can take good
hardware and make it worse with a
software implementation so you know
that's where benchmarks get kicked out
of the way is if the software doesn't do
the hardware justice then it doesn't
matter with what the benchmark says it
just does kind of like the droid x2 when
we had dual core on gingerbread and
gingerbread just didn't take advantage
of dual core at all you know i mean the
spec was there but it really wasn't any
better than the droid x from a year
before then so so let's talk about some
more droids um we mentioned last week on
the show the motorola droid ultra droid
maxx to admitting yeah you know we're
not going to go through all the specs
again real quick you know the max and
the mini we don't really have any
knowledge on the mini but the max and
the ultra are probably going to be the
same minus the battery size they're both
going to be 5 inch screens probably
roughly something like that probably
1080p and probably a Snapdragon 800 you
know probably an amazing camera in a
flagship feeling type film um so anyways
uh you want to find out more to check
android authority calmed and find out
the more about the the leaks of the
specs and in guesstimation of what the
specs will be but the big thing about
these phones this week is we saw all
three of them leak two side by side
thanks to industry insider evleaks also
a storyboard was leaked for an upcoming
verizon droid commercial you know we
haven't seen a new droid commercial a
long time so supposedly the new one is a
couple riding on the ocean and all know
their boat malfunctions and breaks down
and they get stranded on an
Island when they're on the island they
say you know apparently they have
wherever they're at they have signal out
there but it's like oh no we're only on
the island what are we going to do don't
worry my phone lasts for two days
without a charge like wow two days then
there's a voiceover saying that they in
a blah blah best battery blah blah
Verizon's awesome only available through
verizon august eight so apparently if
you reading this the Droid Maxx is going
to have 48 hours of battery life um that
that's pretty amazing the last one they
said was 36 so so yeah say whatever
you've gotten a debuff not quite fifty
fifty percent to it yeah why not to add
another 12 hours to it yeah so so that
so they keep they kept adding you know
battery life so apparently it's going to
last for two full days um that Lee or
that's what Verizon is telling us in the
latest commercial that we'll probably
see very soon if the device is going to
be available august eighth you know we
would start seeing in the next you know
that's a month away so we'd start seeing
it in the next couple weeks you'd assume
so we'll see what happens with that a
another leak from verizon showed a
roadmap earlier we mentioned that the
roadmap was on there for the HR for the
Moto X well the roadmap also showed the
verizon HTC One and apparently that
little guy is coming August first so if
if that is the case so the verizon is
going to launch a lot of phone three
four five phones in August so August
first will be the verizon HTC one if the
rumor is right then comes August eighth
with the three new droids that we just
mentioned and then if they're leaks hold
true the end of the month on the
twenty-third we will see the Moto X so
that's five phones in a month
that that's a lot of phones in one month
four of them being motorola phones we
get interesting but AT&amp;amp;T has like four
versions of the galaxy series I guess
it's not too far yeah yeah um some other
some more rumors will talk about here
real quick so just today we got some
reports out of Asia and yeah yeah I was
going to take these with a grain of salt
you know especially when you have to use
google translate to to figure out what
they say um supposedly the nexus 7 will
just be called the new Nexus 7 and it
will launch the end of this month
fingers crossed confidence high which
could make a lot of sense for launching
but in the month because it's a year old
now so you know no time like to update
it when the device is a year old that's
usually what the norm is yeah we know
it's launching soon we sitting at the
FCC the FCC model numbers had it marked
as the asus k 009 in k 0 0 8 LTE and
Wi-Fi respectively um the leak that we
heard today though says it'll be a
Snapdragon s4 processor it won't rock a
Snapdragon 600 which was you know or an
800 which was previously rumored um
cameras the front back five megapixel in
1.2 na 39 50 million power battery two
gigs ram the 32 gigs stored it seems a
lot I don't know about that I'm they are
actually a little bit smaller than the
current Nexus 7 is yeah I've said Emily
excuse me rumored leaked back yeah
that's why I take these with a grain of
salt you know what I mean like somebody
post something halfway around the world
that says they know they talk to source
and then you know who knows I guess
we'll find out the end of the month
right some more leaks but this is a leak
we can actually actually take home the
bank you know are taking you can't take
it home to banks and you won't be taking
it home huh you can't do that you can't
do that is it you can take home or take
to the bank right either work wherever
you want to take your money you can take
it there so this league for the LG
optimus g2 first though we this week we
saw some images leaked lakay image
is but oh wait there's more the next day
a full 1080p video of the g two linked
showed a 5.2 inch screen a snappy
Snapdragon 800 clock to two point three
gigahertz 2 gigs of RAM softkeys a very
thin device very thin bezel you know
pretty much edge to edge
beautiful-looking screen and I'm gonna
guess that the screen that was in there
shown was probably announced the next
day when LG announced the world's
thinnest 1080p LCD display 5.2 inches
very very very thin 2.2 millimeters with
a bezel of 2.3 millimeter so yeah it
kind of sounds like that might be the
one that was shown in that video that's
just a guess we don't really know but it
very well could be it um they're calling
their technology advanced one glass
solution or augs if you will it inserts
a dual flexible printed circuits between
the LCD panel and a firm touch which
results in thirty percent fewer lines on
the panel so yeah besides all the geek
stuff only a few people care about it's
a badass-looking screen um also the
brightest screen on the market it's it's
capable 535 nits of brightness so yeah
it's a very bright brilliant looking
display so yeah that's awesome maybe it
maybe if it comes to verizon they'll get
that and so the Moto X there's so many
phones coming out alright so I'm done
talking about devices somebody else John
talked us about routing and ramen what's
uh what's happened in the world of
routing ramen there's a little bit of
news this week and after all the big
security scares of the master key all
access security bug ah heirs of the NSA
contributing code to Android with people
that don't understand what selinux is
but CM 10.1 point 1 is now available
it's a minor you know step from 10.1
point 0 which
just include security has enhancements
which fixes the master key or the hall
access security bug that's been in the
news so nothing major but it's a enough
for them to justify a virgin bump I
guess to indicate the stuff was been
yeah we'll see what happens I i want the
10-point 1.1 update on my DNA so i'll
have it yet because I'm not official rom
waiting for it still hundred download
your apps from the Play Store yeah
because because I get my apps from like
China and Russia and Zimbabwe market you
know like the Zimbabwe market is
actually my favorite place to get apps
so yeah I just wish America had stores
that you could walk in and buy pirated
apps like you could you know that would
be amazing if I could go in and buy
photoshop for five bucks or something
like that it was so you know it right
this is a big deal but it's not a big
deal you know we kind of mentioned this
on the show before you know it's a big
deal if you get an app from some dude
you know in a trench coat if you will
but if you're getting at you know from
Best Buy you know you're getting to know
to mean like if you're buying for
reputable source such as you know google
play since apps we're talking about you
know you're probably okay that doesn't
mean that some guy couldn't upload
something the google play and do you
find it and download it but oh my god
you know what Google does look for this
stuff and I don't know about you guys
but I don't download apps have never
been downloaded by some that you know
some weird developer you know with typos
and you know you know you only as secure
as you make yourself download reputable
apps from reputable developers from
reputable sources and master key won't
affect you many ways but hey if your
rock and CM 10.1 you get that extra dot
point get one more dot one and you're
good to go right we shake your head for
Scott I love doing that I'm trying to do
it because dance gone you know that's
right dan is actually in Ohio right now
so if you're in ohio and you're near the
turnpike and you have a whole bunch
you're in traffic
yeah so apparently yeah we were talking
to Dan earlier there's construction
going on so he's actually not moving
right now so you could probably go find
him when we talked to him a little bit
ago he was at like mile marker like 140
or 150 so just like just go find him and
just start waving dan might find him who
knows you'll be the one complaining with
his fields on or something like that oh
yeah he'll be he'll be complaining it
being doesn't complain no not at all
okay so let's move on to some carrier
news so big news from T molds and Lester
news from sprint but t-mobile starting
out there getting bolder as a company
they're boldest moves yet that's what
they have stated so just a little bit of
an update LTE footprint covers around
150 million people that's 57 million
more than their major goal so that's
impressive and we cannot heard that
because of a damn ass and uh so they
announced a jump program and that a lot
it's a new service that allows customers
to upgrade their device twice yearly if
they want and the service costs ten
dollars a month so it's like an
insurance plan type things so let's say
I wanted to get two phones new each year
so I would want to jump twice so you got
your monthly payments if you're to do 2
times 2 times a year it'd be about 1,400
to $1,500 annual cost and if you wanted
to buy those phones off contract be
about two thousand to two thousand two
hundred dollars so it's significantly
less expensive which is quite nice if
the I mean if you're just a single
person and you just have one phone
doesn't really help you out that much
but it's nice yeah
so moving on to sprint sprint has the D
basically unlimited my way and my all-in
and basically this they had their
unlimited was the broth was ninety
dollars a month and now it's unlimited
text and talk for fifty dollars plus
smartphone data which is thirty dollars
those are going eighty dollars so ten
dollars less not bad nothing really
special there if if you can get some
kind of bandwidth on sprint then yeah
you can get unlimited data you can find
a towel it's a well so what what what
speeds were put people post an earlier
showing how awesome the new data plans
where um the the data plan they're
really really fast like three four
kilobytes Runaways know if you want to
go look at so you want to go back to
nineteen ninety-eight dial-up speeds you
can yes when it's on it it's a little
limited dial up for your mobile device
through sprint right now there's one guy
that poses a screenshot that had a 4.3
second pain time yeah notnot millisecond
emotional we're not no accelerants is it
not people talk about their pains in
milliseconds not sprint they actually
talk in seconds man and it was six
kilobits down and 8 kilobits up but it's
all-you-can-eat dude you can use as much
of it no you can eat as much as you want
it was a little while to get hungry I
mean I want to hear right now from I'm
sure we have a sprint customer watching
if not watching now listening later feel
free to let us know in the comments of
how excited you are about these new
plans to have all you can eat at you
know 4k down or whatever you know let
let us know how fast Sprint is I have a
buddy down in Nashville that has sprint
and he has told me countless times again
how fast his LTE is
and then he shows me the screenshot and
then I see he's joking it is not fast it
is very slow so Peter if you're watching
let us know let us know John well we did
have some lots of patent news this week
mostly every one of them actually
involved Apple but uh the first one was
apples initial lawsuit on the name App
Store against Amazon because Amazon uses
the amazon appstore too and what if it
start because that's been go out for a
while I forget what year that they went
after amazon it was right after amazon
launch the app store so their app store
so it's like 20 2011 yeah that makes
sense hmm but as far as the difference
is I mean app store for apples two words
and in Amazon that store you know the
App Store part is one word but still
Apple when after amazon stating that
they couldn't use the word app store
claiming it was false advertising and it
could confuse customers trying to buy
you know iOS apps on an android and an
amazon countered saying that app store
was so generic in this day and age so
they've went to court over this they've
sugar-coated the ruling but essentially
apple basically stare down the barrel of
seeing that their argument was
completely hopeless so they decided that
they no longer need to pursue this as
their customers clearly nowhere to go to
my apps with 50 billion downloads so all
chosen ones on their own thing there's a
lot of question you know where to go get
apps when an iOS device can't even get
the amazon appstore but up you know what
do I know and the Apple did now as far
as a ruling on the App Store we don't
know if there's going to be you know
damages that's highly doubt it they just
drop
basically dropped and walked away on
that one but they drove it isn't I mean
the damaged part of the trial hasn't
been covered yet azimu really hasn't
happened yet Oh Apple's getting the
hammer pretty dropped on him pretty hard
though over ebook price-fixing which
they were originally accused of back in
2012 and they were found guilty in a
federal court for fixing ebook prices so
and we had several publishers that
quickly caved in and then all had to
agree to settlements by early you know
2013 and Apple was the only one facing a
trial and there the other one that said
no no no no we didn't do this you know
everybody else said they did but apples
that we know we're not part of this is
to happily pick one to try to play the
innocent one on this one but so the
Department of Justice accused the
companies are banding together to keep
ebooks above amazon you know
traditionally pretty much rock bottom
discounts and try to chip away at the
kind of Kindle fueled ebook market in
increasingly Kendall fueled now that
Barnes and Noble is killed off look but
the damages have not been decided at
this time of course Apple does plan to
appeal this is par for the course
claiming they're not guilty so whether
they will be granted an appeal or not or
you know what damages are going to ensue
I'm sure there are going to be quite a
bit of damages in Sudan this one but uh
let's stay posted and see how that one
turns out alright so we have a report
from Florida saying that that sprint
down there is actually slower than paint
drying I want to screenshot to provo and
then we have another report that from
Ohio that that this guy's sprint data
speed was so bad
that he couldn't send a tweet any other
intensive though you know 140 characters
nut that's a lot of data you know oh man
i'm happy i don't have spread around
here because you know i will art our
data speeds uh aren't the greatest i
mean less you're on verizon i'm sure i'm
sure i wouldn't even go to like connect
to google services which you can barely
do on 2g edge so that's lever up anyways
we've hadded argument before that's why
i have to use verizon because everybody
else is non-existent anyways so any uh
any questions here let's look down the
list um any what Brayden was talking
about the fix earlier for Google+ how
you take all the libs in the app and you
move make them system libs and system
apps so yeah so it until this gets fixed
every time there's an update you're
gonna have to do that now that's kind of
a pain in the butt so yeah unfortunately
I I did the fix yesterday install the
new update today damn it broke had to go
in and move stuff around again so um a
few minutes here let's uh let's make the
last part of the show like just like
last week the glass minute since I'm
Nellie glass Explorer um I've discovered
my favorite thing to do with glass John
and and Scott and you know what that is
mmm it's it's not an app yet and there
are some neat app so i just installed a
new one today but my favorite thing to
do with glass is to share it to share my
experience to take it off let someone
else use it for a minute um i love
seeing people's first reaction you know
when you see that screen out in front of
your face and and just the moment of awe
and the excitement and their voice
excitement there i'd smile on their face
this that feeling to give somebody that
feeling is awesome because i know i felt
that way the very first time I put on
glass so it's very neat to give that
experience to somebody and I've been
you know almost all my co-workers like
you know 30 40 people in my office have
tried it multiple people in my building
a dozens of people in my building every
day I go for a walk at lunch you know
and I people come up to me and I let
them try on glass and everything that's
really cool today I was actually
surrounded by probably like 30 sir so I
don't know how old they were all i'll
just say students I they could have been
like incoming freshmen but penn state
also has some can't have some camps
going on right now so they could have
been the 16 years old I I don't know um
but you know they were they were they
were you know 16 to 19 maybe the most
actually doing some ingress I was
standing outside playing ingress with
one of my co-workers him and I word
hacking a portal / lunch and a couple
girls walked by me and we were staring
at my glass and I said yeah that's
Google glass you know you can go and ask
me about it you know they were shy I
didn't want to say anything so I started
a conversation for him and we talked
about glass for a few seconds and they
thought it was very cool and awesome and
that's well here you can try it on and
they tried it on and then they thought
was awesome and then another group like
four or five guys is coming down the
street and so a bunch of girls uh yes
they option it we got check out the
girls well what the girls doing all the
truth and they're trying on glass so the
guys are there you know trying on my
glass now I have like ten people
standing around me and now it's not all
these people doing so people are I
crossing the street what's going on you
know and before I knew it five minutes
later there's like 30 people standing
around talking about glass with me and
they want to try it on and I'm passing
it around different people tried on and
helping them use it she owned him
commands the touchpad and it was there
you know I was a little scared there for
a few minutes when they were when a few
of the kids uh were getting a little
rowdy and just yanking it off each
others faced so they could try and like
whoa well there's enough glass to go
around here like don't break my sixteen
hundred dollar device that they only
have like ten thousand dollars you know
like Nestle 73 you can hear Derek
talking about who stole his glass and
took off
now I'm over exaggerating I you know
they were fine that they were they were
fine all the kids that they loved it and
they're very excited to see it and they
want to know you know when it's gonna be
available when can they buy it so if
Google hits the right price point on
this they're gonna do very well because
I mean so many people are just so
excited about it um the I installed a
new app as I said today the new app adds
some additional functionality it's
called called glass Genie or just called
genie it allows me to set up where I
parked so you know if you're ever in
that Seinfeld episode you know where you
lose your car in a parking garage or
parking lot you don't remember where you
parked you can set a a GPS location for
you parked and then when you need to go
find your car you tap the card for your
car and you hit directions in it you
know navigates you back to where your
car is you can there's also a shopping
list you soon so you can add like milk
or actually mine says beer but beer my
shopping list tested out um you can view
your shopping list that you can you can
send notes to yourself which I hope that
the features eventually come into glass
you know baked in so i can say note to
self and have it um you know send me an
email or go to Google keep directly
right now you can do note to self and
have it send you an email you can also
do a similar function to do a like to do
like a remind me type thing which you
can't do right now natively which I hope
that functionality comes integrates with
Google now and all that good stuff but I
can do a like a reminder card a note
card just send notes to do list or
something like that to myself it's a
well it's neat ah the apps need is still
in the you know private beta right now
so it's only going to get better as
glass gets better any questions about
glass before we in the show a few
minutes early since I'm not a whole lot
to talk about this week I guess Scott
John you have anything else dad and
we're wrapping
berkeley i guess one question in the
comments of Eric Kaufmann asked if that
has been fixed for the nexus 4 no they
actually kind of quietly fixed it back
in February i'm not sure if it had was
rolled into the most recent update for
the necklace for not but it has already
been patched up in a OSP from a while
back so it's very likely that it is if
not it's you know we will becoming
extremely soon yeah I would say come out
with Google's already passed it up in
the holy hymns like Samsung and HTC
Motorola already working for you know
have even pushed it to some carriers
already so I would think the nexus 4
should be good to go that's interesting
on I would actually be the opposite i
would say that it's probably not because
AOSP was just updated and it's you know
i mean there was a update the other day
for like the visit the galaxy s 4 180 i
would think of AT&amp;amp;T can get the thing
out louisville should have a hearty
pushed it to the nexus cuz because think
about it why would why would cyogen mod
who's been running you know AOSP for
point-to-point to watch this big oh why
would they just need to recently update
so that's a good question cuz on when i
started the branch that is true okay
that's something made for us to find out
for next week we'll find out him if the
nexus 4 is good to go or not okay well
