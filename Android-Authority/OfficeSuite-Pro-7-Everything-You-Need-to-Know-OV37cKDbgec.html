the Android authority app guy do you
like office suite pro seven I know I do
and after the intro we'll show you some
of the newest features with its latest
update office suite seven recently
updated and it came with a plethora of
new features the first one we'll talk
about is the ability to integrate the
Oxford Dictionary of English if you open
the menu you can find the download link
it costs a few bucks to do but if you
want the best of the English language
that's the one you should go with next
up you can now perform Google searches
from within Word documents when you
highlight a word or a phrase a little
box will pop up one of them is a
spellcheck and the other one will take
you to a Google search where you can
search for it this can be a really
useful feature if you don't want to pay
for dictionaries and still want a
spellcheck or if you don't know what a
word means or if you've just won a
Google search something perhaps one of
the more useful features is inserting
images from your camera this can be
helpful if you need a visual aid and
don't already have a picture of it handy
simply open the menu snap your picture
and once it's in the document you can
resize it and move it around to where
you need it to be it's worth noting that
this is not just for word but for Excel
and PowerPoint as well while we're on
the subject images can now be swapped
out as well with this new update in
Excel you can now reorder the sheets
like you can in typical desktop office
software it doesn't seem like that big
of a deal but when you work with
spreadsheets all the time it most
certainly is while we're in Excel you'll
notice the improved user interface as
well as font formatting autofill and
cell dragging improvements a couple of
features we didn't directly test but are
still included include better
compatibility with quick spell dual
screen support and links and shadows are
now supported in PowerPoint so if you've
been waiting for some of those features
they're here and ready to go with these
new features office suite 7 has become
one of the best office apps for Android
it keeps the same old Word Excel and
PowerPoint functionality and with these
new features it's easier than ever to
churn out documents or presentations
that are closer to what you actually
want it's still probably preferable to
do most of these tasks on the computer
especially with things like PowerPoint
presentations because they can get
pretty exorbitant and it would take
forever on an interface like this
however if you must use your Android
device to make documents there are a few
office suite apps out there for Android
they can go toe-to-toe with office suite
7 if you already own it then the update
will have already been released to the
Google Play Store if you want to try it
out for the first time you can either
purchase it for 15 bucks or check out
the free trial' software where you can
the software is all about before you buy
it once again I'm Joe hindi the Android
