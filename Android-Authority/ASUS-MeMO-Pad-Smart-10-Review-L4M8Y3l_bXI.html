place in the increasingly crowded world
of 10-inch tablets find out in our
review hey everybody i'm chris book now
when you think 10 inch tablet you're
probably thinking a full HD display
right that isn't the case here but is
that really such a deal-breaker actually
I'm getting ahead of myself here
why don't we back up and start with the
specs the Asus memo pad smart 10 runs a
1.2 gigahertz quad-core Tegra 3
processor pushing a 1280 by 800 10.1
inch display memory was it has 1 gig of
ram and 16 gigs of internal storage
expandable through the microSD slot it
has a 5 megapixel rear facing camera and
1.2 front facing camera and is capable
of capturing 1080p video more on that
later the memo pad smart 10 is certainly
a well-constructed device with no
flexing or creak enos and a generally
durable albeit plasticky feel it was
definitely designed with landscape mode
in mind and from the button layout to
the branding everything just works
better in this orientation you can use
it in portrait mode but it's clear that
this wasn't the focus during the design
stage it's tricky for tablet
manufacturers to nail down a perfect
bezel size too small and your hands are
all over the screen too big and the
tablet just looks funky with the memo
pad smart 10 asus has opted to go a
little big on the bezel which i like but
your mileage may vary the plastic body
does actually help the sound helping the
relatively small speakers push out
comparatively large sound which works
well for gaming or watching videos not
so much for music the display is
probably going to be the tipping point
for most people for better or for worse
yes with a 10.1 inch display in a
resolution of 1280 by 800 you're not
looking at a particularly high pixel
density 149 pixels per inch in fact
pixelation is definitely noticeable
especially with texts and icons with
text being the worst offender the thing
is that isn't going to matter to
everyone if you want to watch a movie on
a 10
screen that pixel density isn't going to
be nearly as apparent as you might think
if you're going to be reading a lot of
ebooks though you may want to look
elsewhere otherwise colors are fairly
vivid though the display looks a little
on the washed out side when you crank
the brightness above a certain level and
black levels could be better with the
Tegra 3 chipset and a comparatively
small amount of pixels to push the memo
pad smart 10 isn't much of a slouch in
the performance Department though it is
far from the best we've seen to start we
ran and - to benchmark three times in
succession and averaged the scores
ending with a final score of 12,000 447
next up we ran Epic Citadel which
produced average frame rates of 46 point
2 frames per second in high quality mode
and forty nine point eight frames per
second in high performance mode also it
looked pretty next came real-world
performance apps generally launched
quickly and scrolling through home
screens and the app drawer was smooth
but we did notice some slowdown when
scrolling through web pages or in
certain apps like YouTube comiXology
appeared to work fine on the other hand
for gaming we tested Real Racing 3 and
it performed decently though not without
the occasional stutter the Asus memo pad
smart 10 runs Android 4.1.1 jelly bean
and while it's not heavily skinned it's
not quite stock Android either an update
to 4.2 is said to be on the way but
though I did see two updates during
testing my review unit is still at four
point one point one included apps were
generally more on the useful side of the
spectrum than the useless side which is
always a pleasant surprise
press reader is pre-installed for
example as is a file manager some other
apps included app backup app Locker and
Acer studio which is their gallery
replacement for a tablet the included
cameras are fairly decent though nothing
spectacular outside and nice lighting
pictures turned out fairly nice though
inside even in fairly well-lit
situations the quality took a step down
low-light performance definitely isn't
great here 1080p video capture was
similar while playback is occasionally
choppy the video itself looked nice
enough
basically this isn't going to be your go
to camera but really ask to yourself do
you want to be the person who's always
awkwardly holding a tablet to take
photos battery life seemed to vary
wildly with the memo pad smart 10
watching an 80 minute standard
definition movie off of the SD card one
night train the battery to 50% very
quickly while watching a longer Netflix
streaming movie seemed to drain the
battery less on another night running
the antutu tester battery test left us
with a score of 481 though the tablet
was well and fully dead when I came back
to check on it
asus has included power saving modes to
somewhat remedy this situation though
the most aggressive power saving mode
only seemed an add an hour or so at best
with the memo pad smart 10 you're
basically looking at a super-sized Nexus
7 with the same resolution for some
people that's a good thing for other
people well not so much if you want to
spend a little more there are better
tablets out there and if you want to
spend a little less they're cheaper
tablets out there it's kind of hard to
figure out who exactly this is for that
said it is a solid fairly decently
performing tablet if you want to know
more or if you just like reading there
