now recently I did my truth about
Bluetooth 5 video which I did using to
development boards from Nordic
semiconductor and using those
development boards I have to test the
throughput and the range of Bluetooth 5
now after I done that I turn my
attention to the Galaxy s8 because the
Galaxy s8 has a Bluetooth 5 chip inside
of it so I thought to myself I'll write
an app and I'll test the capabilities of
Bluetooth 5 on the Galaxy s8
unfortunately I haven't been able to do
that so the question is why can't you
use Bluetooth 5 on the Galaxy s8 today
and when will you be able to use it well
let me explain okay first of all a bit
of a recap there's lots of
misinformation about Bluetooth 5 kind of
going around is in some very popular
videos made by very popular YouTube
personalities who don't actually know
what they're talking about and the main
problem is this is that this kind of 2 x
speed and 4 x distance that is kind of
being advertised about bluetooth 5 isn't
exactly what people think it is now in
the testing i did in my the truth about
bluetooth 5 video we see that Bluetooth
5 does give you twice the speed when the
devices are close to each other and
that's very good and that's excellent
however when you move the two Bluetooth
devices further apart the further apart
you get abruptly that speed tasks to
drop off and in fact when you get to the
edge of the kind of range between the
two devices you'll find that Bluetooth 5
and Bluetooth 4 le
have the same kind of throughput now the
thing about 4 times the distance is
actually a special mode that's inside
Bluetooth 5 we decoded connection that
send multiple bits to make sure that if
there's an error along the way that data
is still received but it had a very very
low bitrate maybe only 109 kilobits per
second so the idea that you'll be able
to kind of take a Bluetooth 5 speaker
and kick it to your Bluetooth 5
smartphone and then kind of just go out
into the garden out into your yard and
downstair
and then there's this huge distance
between them and you'll still get your
music come out is basically not true at
all you basically get the long distance
if you're using a special connecting
mode but as a very low bitrate if you're
using it just for normal audio or other
types of connections it's going to be
the same as bluetooth 4 but it's going
to be faster when they're closer
together so I wanted to write an app to
the galaxy s 8 to test the throughput
capabilities and the range capabilities
of the galaxy s 8 so the first thing I
did was I went over to Samsung's
developer website and I started to look
amongst their documentation there about
how you access the Bluetooth 5 features
on the Galaxy s8 and there was no
documentation at this point I kind of
did a double-take maybe I'm mistaken
here maybe there isn't Bluetooth 5 in
the Galaxy s8 so I went over to the
Bluetooth website and I found the
certification for the Galaxy S a and it
does say in there that there is
Bluetooth 5 but there are some
conditions first of all it does support
the new 2 megabits per second physical
connection so that's really good works
really what we're looking for but it
doesn't support the coda connection so
there's never going to be there's four
times the range support inside of the
galaxy s 8 but you will get that faster
throughput so now we know the hardware
supported I went back again to
investigate the software now at this
point I started sending emails out and
my colleagues and Android 40 sites any
emails out to various different people
first of all I emailed the Bluetooth
people themselves we also got in contact
with Google and moved to try to get in
contact with Samsung now the Bluetooth
people email me back the next day
very very politely they were not able to
give me any more information other than
what's publicly given almost
dissertation site however they were very
helpful but they were bound by different
agreements they can't talk about what
Samsung have or don't have in their
phone but thank you to the Bluetooth
people for replying and talking to us
also while Chris Karl on my colleague
was at Google i/o he found some pretty
smart Google engineers and he talks them
about Android support for Bluetooth 5
and the situation is the current version
of Android Android n does not have blue
to
five supporting it however Android Oh
will have Bluetooth five support in it
in fact it's already in the developer
previews and it's already in the Android
Open Source project you if you go and
look at the code that good would have
published for handling Bluetooth five
connections but of course you can't just
take Android Oh even the Developer
Preview and put it on an a phone that
only got Bluetooth 4 in it like the
pixel or or a Nexus device and get
Bluetooth 5 to have Bluetooth 5 you have
to have the new hardware so there's no
way to actually test the Google
implementation of Bluetooth 5 on Android
on the current cropper phone you would
be able to do it on the s8 but there is
no developer preview for the s8 for
Android oh we tried several of us tried
contacting Samsung I emailed the people
on their developer portal other
representatives tried going through
their PR people and basically the only
reply we've got back from Samsung is
thanks for your question we're looking
into we get back to now some of these
questions we sent over 2 weeks ago and
Samsung have not said anything to us now
the reality is if there was a solution
for using Bluetooth 5 on Android on the
Galaxy S a they would reply very quickly
with his a link to the documentation
please use this SDK please do this and
it will all work there has been nothing
and that is because there is nothing
basically there is no support for
Bluetooth 5 on the current version
Android running on the galaxy s 8 now it
doesn't mean that Samsung won't publish
something maybe even and I'm publishing
this video they could publish an SDK
they should publish some documentation
but now there is nothing you can use my
feeling is what's going to actually
happen if they're going to wait until
Android officially supports Bluetooth 5
when Android o comes out now what that
means is that if they follow the
PlayBook of last year for winning
Android n was released we're going to
see the new release of Android sometime
this summer maybe August and then it's
going to be a few months while Samsung
take Android N and start shipping on
their phone so in 2018 May
be in January in February we might start
to see Android Oh appearing on the
galaxy sa with Bluetooth 5 capabilities
built into it so until then Bluetooth 5
hardware is in the Galaxy s8 but there's
no software to use it so it remains
effectively dead locked inaccessible
until Android brings us support when and
then that new version Android is
installed on the galaxy s 8 so I'd love
to hear from you in the comments what
you think about the situation should
Samsung have produced some kind of
interim SDK to the Bluetooth side to be
used on the fa should they have been
more upfront about say the support will
come in 2018 should they have maybe just
not even mention the fact that has
Bluetooth 5 and then surprised this next
year when we found it has Bluetooth 5
support please tell me in the comments
below what you think Samsung should have
done and go sim from Android 14 I hope
you enjoyed this video if you did please
do give it a thumbs up also those forget
to subscribe to and authorities YouTube
channel hit that Bell symbol so you get
notifications whenever we publish new
videos and lots of great videos coming
for you over the next few weeks and last
but not least please do go over to
Andrew authority calm because we are
your source sporting Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
