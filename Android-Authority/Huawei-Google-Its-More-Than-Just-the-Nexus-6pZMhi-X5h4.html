brought to you by FreshBooks so you may
have heard the rumor that hallway and
Google might partner up to produce the
next Nexus device but that's not the
half of it you see not only can Huawei
help Google get deeper into China but
Google can help Huawei get out first
let's talk huawei the company has been
growing steadily over the last few years
and according to IDC hallway is now the
fourth largest smartphone vendor in the
world by market share securing 5.2
percent of shipments in the first three
months of 2015 it was third for a while
until rival lenovo acquired motorola
Huawei has been doing well in China and
in a number of other emerging markets
around the world it's also been doing
increasingly well in Europe but has yet
to crack the lucrative US market it's
one thing to sell quality hardware at
knockdown prices and generate a lot of
sales but quite another to sell premium
devices with a huge markup and it's what
most companies is fire to do and Huawei
is no different the hallway watch was
probably the biggest surprise of the
Mobile World Congress few expected
anything to get excited about much less
the best-looking Android wear SmartWatch
today since then we've been hearing
persistent rumors about a hallway Nexus
smartphone now if you listen carefully
you'll hear geeks giving birth over that
news if you look at the ebb and flow of
Google's partnerships in the android
seen you can generally see the
motivation behind them HTC and Samsung
produce smartphones capable of competing
with the iphone LG and Asus offered
lower prices without compromising a lot
of quality could they work out some kind
of deal to include Google services in
Huawei's Chinese smartphones will huawei
wield its influence with the chinese
government to help hammer out some kind
of deal with google maybe hallway will
help Google to gain market share for a
Chinese Play Store if Google does want
to get into China then partnering with
Huawei makes a lot of sense yeah so you
remember that squabble between the
Chinese government in Google a few years
ago China wanted to restrict or control
search results within Google
products Google was not having that and
so they pulled out or seriously limited
their products within China now perhaps
in exchange for hallways influence with
the Chinese government Google may choose
to help Huawei have more influence
outside China ie the North American
market savvy a partnership with Google
could provide design insight marketing
tips and be interpreted as a general
thumbs up for the company that many
Western consumers have little knowledge
of Google could help open doors for
huawei but it won't do so unless it
stands to get something big and my
friends nothing is bigger than the
Chinese market ChaCha there is another
potential attraction for Google with
project Phi if Google was looking to
scale the service up offering seamless
transition between Wi-Fi and LTE it
could do a lot worse than partnering
with hallway it has the technology the
expertise and the patents that Google
may need it's not going to happen in the
short term but in the future who knows
now I was reading in the comments from
yesterday's show where someone expressed
the concern about using Chinese
manufactured smartphones and possibly
being monitored or watched or surveilled
by the Chinese government through those
Chinese manufactured phones and that is
a significant fear for many people it's
been covered in the media here in the
West quite a few times and you know
people are saying they're not going to
buy Chinese manufacturer phones because
of that fear I would argue that once
they see decent quality phones that are
significantly cheaper than a samsung
flagship device or an iPhone those fears
are going to quickly fade away I'm not
saying that the Chinese government
wouldn't do that god knows what
governments do these days with
surveillance and spying it's insane I'm
just saying it's not going to be an
issue when they can get a great phone at
a cheap price what do you think let me
know in the comments below now you guys
know I have no problem paying for a
product that solves a pain point and
FreshBooks solve some serious pain
points I've used it before it allows me
to invoice my clients in an easy simple
way and they pay me in an easy simple
way and who does not like that Matt

calm forward slash android and enter
android authority in be how did you hear
about a section thanks for watching guys
now i want to remind you that i get a
lot of questions a lot of the same
questions both above phones and just
about me personally so next week
probably next wednesday or friday
depending on our editorial calendar one
of those shows will just be about me
kind of answering non tech related
questions all the hosts are going to try
and put this out this month you've been
asked to do that so again I got like two
or three decent questions from last
week's show if you have any question
that you just want to know about me or
android authority or but what i do how i
do it any kind of questions you want to
ask that's non tech related room in the
comments below and i would choose the
best ones and make a whole show of it
like five or six questions or so if you
guys find that interesting you certainly
liked our last bio videos we did last
year don't forget about my brethren my
bros and android we're working super
