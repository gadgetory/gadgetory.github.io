Nexus 5x saying that LG built upon what
was already loved in the Nexus 5 and
even if it wasn't necessarily the full
flagship status that the Nexus 6p was at
least the 5x is still a very good phone
to have on the daily well I've been
using the 5x as my daily driver for a
little while and I have a few things
that I have to say about it it's Josh
regard from Android authority what's
going on everybody
and these are my second opinions on the
Nexus 5x now a lot about what I have to
say about the Nexus 5x in this second
opinion video has to do with the
performance but for now we're going to
just skim through the rest of the
sections and I'll give you a couple of
opinions that I have on them as we go
along the design is still one of my
favorites the Nexus 5 was a very well
received device and even if it wasn't
the sturdiest phone out there it was
still very easy to use especially in one
hand given its materials and also in
size now we have the same thing here in
the Nexus 5x except we have this
two-tone coloration which has grown on
me a little bit but doesn't necessarily
have that more let's say unified look
that the Nexus 5 had but this black and
white still looks pretty good and again
this is not a very sturdy device if
you're going to drop it I'm sure there
are going to be some cracks all over the
place and the soft plastic will get
damaged pretty easily as mine has
already gotten a couple of stains on
this white backing but overall it is a
design that is incredibly enjoyable and
really fits this the lower end of the
two Nexus devices the same will go for
the display we're obviously not going to
be working with quad HD here 1080p
resolution is perfectly fine still
though and this particular display is
still nice to have and is easy to view
in broad daylight and is very fun to use
for everything from work and play
unfortunately it's only when you really
compare the display with another display
like for example the AMOLED display of
the Nexus 6p that you see some of its
shortcomings it doesn't necessarily have
really high contrast the black levels
are a little bit washed out and it's
just a that little bit without the punch
in the colors that the Nexus 6p is
AMOLED screen has but that doesn't
detract from what is already a pretty
good experience to have on the daily and
finally let's get into the performance
which is where most of what I have to
say is in here okay so the Snapdragon
808 is still a good performing processor
and
may not be the 8:10 but it also has one
other detraction from it and that is the
two gigabytes of RAM now when it comes
to general daily tasks you're not really
doing too much on the phone maybe going
through maybe two or three applications
especially not ones that are necessarily
all that demanding you're going to get a
good time
basically just multitasking and going
through all the different elements of
this marshmallow version of Android
while that's all good and dandy what I
found is that when the power user
experience kind of came into it
that's when the ADA weight really showed
its colors there are plenty of times
that I've been able to overload this
device especially with its two gigabytes
of RAM which kind of seems a little bit
paltry especially nowadays when we're
kind of expecting three gigabytes and
ultimately what would happen is I have
three different tasks that are very high
demanding that I do pretty much every
day that's either GPS navigation a lot
of music or podcast playing in the
background and then using the camera for
when I need it what what happened is
when I would load all three of them at
the same time for whatever reason one
situation had me driving along the side
of the road with a podcast playing and I
was being directed to my destination and
then as I was at a stoplight I needed to
take a picture of something that I
thought was pretty funny the camera just
wouldn't load now you're going to see in
this shot right here that there's really
no lag on here and actually I will say
that that's about 80% of the time with
the Nexus 5x you're going to have a
pretty smooth transition from all of the
different applications the performance
will be fine especially when you're in
really good conditions and in this shot
right here that the phone was actually
just refreshed it was turned off and
then turned back on and the other thing
I noticed is that when the device is not
all that warm then it performs at its
peak when the device is warm like many
smart phones that I've used over this
past year or so it does tend to slow
down just a little bit because it's
working a little bit harder under a
warmer condition as far as the other
aspects ago I am focusing mostly on the
performance aspect in the second opinion
now lon is not wrong in terms of saying
that the performance has been pretty
good but it's not something you're going
to get a hundred percent of the time and
while that might be true for a lot of
phones out there the Nexus 5x seemed to
show those colors more often than not
but everything else has been really
great in terms of hardware the
fingerprint reader is definitely
something I'm really used to now and I
actually find myself on other phones
reaching for the back where I would
think the fingerprint reader is because
I got so used to it on these neck
devices the USB type-c standard is still
something I'm trying to get used to if
you have a lot of charging docks and
let's say even external batteries that
have the regular USB connection on there
then you're going to need to get the new
cables in order to actually take
advantage of the USB type-c standard and
charge this properly but fast charging
on this has been great and battery life
has been for the most part standard on
very power heavy days I did get maybe
two and a half hours of battery life on
here which was fine and then I would get
three and a half hours if I wasn't using
the phone quite as much those on the
other hand has been doing a good job but
I did have one thing in here to say
there if you're using any doze enhanced
or doze capable phone make sure that you
put your applications under the priority
list because obviously doze will keep
notifications from coming in during it's
a very low-power state now the reason
why I say that is because cloud magic
which is the app that I use for all of
my email needs was not on that list and
every time I would pick up the phone and
wake it back up a flood of notifications
would come in so maybe that's something
you figured out by now with your
versions of the Nexus or doze capable
devices but I felt like I needed to say
that because it happened on more than
one occasion the camera has also been
really good I have no problems with the
camera here on the Nexus 5x the only
thing that's missing is optical image
stabilization and in tests that I've
done with the Nexus 6p already against
other phones that have oh is we did find
that OAS just sort of had the edge there
though the larger sensor of the Nexus
phones definitely does a great job of
enhancing what in the past was a
lackluster experience in these phones
the camera experience is really good and
when I was at a couple of let's say
events the phone in my pocket was the
Nexus 5x and I was more than happy to
just use that to capture the memories
and that was really great and then
finally in software software has been
honestly one of the best parts about
this not only do you have optimizations
and new features in this marshmallow
version of Android but it all is under
pretty much a very iCandy like appeal
like you have the vertical scroll with
the one line of applications at the top
of the app drawer that you probably use
most and I end up using that all the
time and find myself wishing for it when
I go to other phones Google now on tab
is nice as well but I don't find myself
using it quite as much but nonetheless
what we have here
is a great version of Android probably
one of the best that we've had in a
while because it actually adds some
functionality while making sure that the
optimizations are as good as they can be
and with the Snapdragon 808 in here it
is able to go pretty smoothly it's just
in those small instances and under maybe
less than ideal circumstances that you
might actually get some slowdown I
really wanted to love this phone and in
a lot of ways I do but I have a few main
caveats with it and it has to do with
the performance on way more than a few
occasions did I have an issue of
actually getting the stuff that I wanted
to done and a little bit of lag that
would keep me from let's say even typing
using flexi on here or even the amount
of time that I would have to wait for
certain applications to just load up or
even the times that it would crash when
trying to load cross the road all of
them kind of came up more often than I
really wanted them to and I was really
hoping that the Nexus 5x with the
Snapdragon 808 and the 2 gigabytes of
RAM was still going to prove that with a
good version of Android optimized
properly we were still going to not have
all of those performance issues but
unfortunately they did come up for me
now I'm sure that a lot of you out there
have been using the Nexus 5x and you've
probably experienced these as well and
for the most part given the whole
package it is probably something that
you can sort of put over to the side and
think it's really not all that bad I
agree with you the Nexus 5x is still a
good budget phone if you need to save a
little bit of money and if that is your
prerogative then yes go for this phone
it is a really good one and provides a
lot of the best Android experiences out
there it just slows down from time to
time so keep it tuned to Android
Authority and with this video I am
officially now on my extended break I
will be gone for the month of December
but of course you are in good hands with
the rest of Android authorities so make
sure you swatch all of the content from
my colleagues in Android here and make
sure you stay tuned for all of our
holiday videos we're going to have a lot
of them and when the new year comes
around you're going to see me back at
CES so keep it tuned to Android thority
for that and even more download the
Android or thority app over in the
corner so you can keep in touch with all
of us and keep in touch with all of our
content and when you're done with all of
that stick around for even more because
