brought to you by domain.com so you guys
remember the cryptic teaser from oneplus
called the game-changer well it turns
out it might be a oneplus drone or an
elaborate April Fool's joke no I don't
know for sure whether this is real or
just a joke but I can tell you something
is fishy in a reddit ask me anything
thread oneplus representatives
explicitly said the company would be
selling a drone next month according to
one plus Carl PI and David s the quote
game-changer product that the company
has been teasing over the past few weeks
is actually a drone dubbed dr1
no details about the device have been
shared but PI offered as proof a
screenshot showing a stylized drone icon
suggesting the dr1 will resemble the
parrots ar.drone 2.0 now consider the
timing of this ask me anything thread
besides the dr1 oneplus representatives
haven't shared anything that's truly new
it's almost like oneplus went through
the trouble of doing this AMA to leak
the dr1 ahead of April Fool's Day so yes
this could be an elaborate pranked to
pull on all of us now of course Google
has been the king of April Fools pranks
but the difference is that their pranks
are clearly pranks once you actually
think about it this here is like well
it's sort it could be true but it's kind
of suspicious the way they did it what
do you guys think is it true or is it a
prank now let me give you a little
inside industry secret when you see a
leaked image of a device that has truly
Bessel if displays it is almost always
not genuine except in this case
published by my drivers the two images
below and leged Lee show a new Oppo
smartphone with an edge-to-edge screen
in the vein of the sharp aquos crystal
unlike the sharp phone from last year
this device features ultra thin bezels
only on its lateral sides with the
larger bezels on the top and bottom
though it is hard to tell from these
frontal shots the phone seems to feature
a metallic frame and a thin profile
suggesting that this will be a high-end
offering the fine 7 was released a
little over a year ago so this device
could be its successor in related news
gsm arena recent
reported on a patent request by oppo in
China that details a method of creating
the illusion of a bezel is display the
schematic here shows how the beveled
side of glass can refract light creating
the illusion that the screen is larger
than it is in reality and concealing the
margin that houses electronic components
now for those of you for whom the lack
of micro SD card support on the galaxy
s6 was a deal-breaker it turns out that
the s6 active may be good news for you
while we strongly advise you to treat
this as a rumour one European redditor
named Garr shil claimed that he had an
interview with his Samsung European
representative and in that interview
there was some key details regarding the
Galaxy s6 active there will be no
fingerprint reader or heart rate monitor
the camera will be of a lower resolution
than the s6 but it may have oh is
included it will be similar in specs to
those of the s6 but there will be
buttons on the front micro SD card
support will be included and the battery
will definitely be larger and it will be
released approximately mid summer 2015
now although nothing was said about
waterproofing on the s6 active we expect
that this feature will be retained
because it is the active after all now
moving on the leaks about the LG g4 will
it be plastic or metal the alleged early
g4 renders showcase a back cover that
looks to be removable while this doesn't
mean anything for sure given the
company's history of metal esque
plastics as well as the G flex 2
sporting such hope for an all-metal make
has dwindled now a new report
unofficially confirms that LG will
likely be shifting away from a plastic
build with the LG g4 according to ZDNet
Korea however the logistics are not yet
in place that would allow for such
construction and thus the g4 will likely
still be plastic the report does offer
some hope however and that the upcoming
rumored g4 may in fact use metal given
LG's claim of a new product that exists
above the G Series it seems fairly
likely that LG will consider adopting a
more premium metal design in order to
help justify the high-end status and of
course the high-end
price tag now I've been having a lot of
