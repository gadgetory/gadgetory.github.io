handy here and in this quick video we're
going to show you how to manually
install lollipop on your Nexus devices
before we begin I just want to say that
this process could be potentially
dangerous if done incorrectly as per the
norm Android Authority is not
responsible if something horrible
happens to you or your device ok this
method is essentially universal so it
should work for every Nexus device to
start you'll need the Android SDK
installed and for it to see your device
when you type in fastboot devices and
adb devices in the command line we won't
go over how to do this in this video
because it's its own process entirely
but we do have a tutorial linked up in
the video description below for you to
follow if you need that you will also
need 7-zip or another tool that is
capable of dealing with tgz files and
tar files you'll also need to grab the
update from developers Android comm and
we'll have a link to that in the video
description as well make sure you
download the right image for your device
double and triple-check because they all
have different names and there are
multiple variants of some of them like
the Wi-Fi only version and the mobile
version of the Nexus 7 2013 edition have
two different names finally you'll need
to have a Nexus device obviously before
you start the process your computer
should be able to find your device using
the commands ADB devices and fastboot
devices in the command line I cannot
stress enough how important this is if
it cannot do those things do not
continue with this process until it can
step one is to boot your Nexus device
into bootloader mode you turn the device
off press and hold the up and down
volume buttons and then press the power
button this works on most of the modern
Nexus devices but if it's not working
you may need to search to see how it's
done on your specific device select
bootloader using the volume keys as
navigation and then hit the power button
to enter bootloader mode on your
computer you'll need to unpack the tgz
file to reach the tar file and then
unpack the tar file once more to access
the folder inside of this folder are all
the files that you're going to need ok
this next part is important you're going
to move the contents of this folder into
the platform tools folder in the Android
SDK so select all of them hit copy and
then paste them in the platform tools
folder
at this point your Nexus device should
be nearby still in bootloader mode go
ahead and plug it into your computer the
last step is to simply double-click on
the flash all file if you're in Windows
you'll want to double click on the flash
all file with the little gear icon that
says windows batch file on the right if
you're in a Linux based OS you will want
to use the flash all SH file at this
point a window should open and the
installation process should begin do not
unplug your device during this process
for any reason seriously it's a really
bad idea
once the install is done your device
will reboot on its own and you'll have
lollipop installed if you have any
issues or this video went too fast for
you check out the written version in the
video description below
once again I'm Joe hindi from Android
Authority comm while you're here why not
subscribe to the Android Authority
YouTube channel if you're hanging out
for a minute we have a couple of awesome
videos for you to watch right over there
and they're also linked in the video
description below for you folks on
mobile finally if you need to see this
tutorial again the written version is
linked up in the video description below
as always thanks for watching everybody
and have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
