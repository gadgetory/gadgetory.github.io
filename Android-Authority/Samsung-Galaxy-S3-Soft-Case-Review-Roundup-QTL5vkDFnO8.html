to Android Authority calm today I've got
a galaxy s3 soft case extravaganza got
the seven different soft case I'm gonna
be throwing on the Samsung Galaxy s3 and
I'll let you guys decide which one is
your favorite I know I've got a few
within these pile of cases here anyways
we've got our black cool event case
we've got some sci mo clear soft case
we've got an amaz our jelly silicon case
we've got a fuzz Minh black basically
jelly case we've got a Galaxy s3 k case
white gel case we've got a box wave
silicone clear case and then we finally
have our unicolor samsung galaxy s3
black two-part case there so without
further ado let's just rip into some of
these throw them on our galaxy s3 and
see if it makes it look sexy first off
we're going to go into our k case
dot-com case just tear this open throw
it on the galaxy s3 now a lot of
manufacturers we're making cases before
the flood was even out so I've ran into
a few problems regarding uh the holes
being cut in the right place but most of
these I haven't tried so we'll just give
them a fair chance ways we've got our
samsung galaxy s3 this is the GTI 9300
mind you the gsm unlocked version will
just pop her in here this one's got a
nice tight fit I like the look of the
white on white got our holes cut in all
the right places perfect placement here
for the camera the LED in the speaker
got our headphone jack just fine got a
micro USB here we've got a raised button
for the power and then raised buttons
for the volume rocker they're not
cutouts but they work pretty well a
little bit hard to press not the easiest
thing in the world to press but it's
still really nice the white on white
look is nice gives it some raised edges
here so if it's all right down as long
as there wasn't anything on the ground
that wouldn't puncture the screen so
we'll just take this one off
say this is a nice case for anyone who
wants a slim design some white-on-white
features if you've got the white Galaxy
s3
following up with that one we'll just
try one that's a black that might
basically be the same thing this is our
fossil encase as you can see on the back
this one's pretty cool we've got almost
like an X going on I like the look of
that and then we've got some grip sort
of plastic here not to slide resistant
but it's fine if does the job just pop
our galaxy s3 in there now I'm one who
likes the look of the white on black so
this one looks pretty cool to me our
volume rocker is kind of unresponsive
I can barely press the buttons of this
one and then same with our power button
I'm pressing a few times and I might get
the screen on about once out of every
four times I press it's like we got our
cutouts pretty much in line what's all
of our LED speaker and camera or fine or
headphone jack they're little bikes
everything's fine it's got a nice raised
edge just like the last one falls down
it'll be protected and this is sort of a
nice plastic that has some give to it
that's a little bit of Bounce it'll save
your galaxy s3s from awesome damage
here's our answer it has a really nice
feel you'll be surprised if this one was
a yes this is the silicone skin case
this is silicone it's not really a hard
plastic like these it's gonna be kind of
different this one might attract a few
more debris particles and whatnot but it
does is pretty malleable
it's nice feeling compared to our
pawsome in here this one will have more
bounced protection but it's not as hard
and durable so we'll just slide this one
of the galaxy s3 I like this one it's
fine um the silicone is a little bit of
too soft of a feel for me but it is
pretty impact absorbing
has some nice bounce to it and the
cutouts are really easy to hit power
button simply hit volume rocker easy
cutouts are in the right spot
looking good raised edges take this one
off so this one's a pure clear case here
you can see we've got some on
transparency here and then almost a like
a smoked glass look here
each glass so it's nice kind of
malleable upper Galax has three in there
now I don't love the look of the
clearcase on here it's a little too
sterile for my tastes but I do like it
it's alright the cutouts are on the
right spot got our power button that's
easily pressable this one actually you
can press the power the volume rockers a
little bit easier than the rest of the
ones so far cutouts in the right place
we've got a little loop here that we can
pop a keychain on or a little tether
maybe if you wanted a stylus screens big
enough these will take this off all
these cases are actually pretty easy to
take off and put on I forgot to mention
that but they all are pretty simple to
take off and put on for next one here
there's our unicolor sam galaxy s3 it
actually has a resealable package for
those of you who wanted pristine case
uncontaminated by air particles these
we'll take this out this one is
definitely our hardest so far not really
bendable it's gonna be durable strong
backing we've got our manipulation right
here but we can't really bend to the
back at all so we'll slide our galaxy s3
and this one it was a little tougher to
get on but it's just fine love to look
at the black on white on the front and
then you can still see the white on the
back I'm actually liking this case a lot
feels nice because they'll see the
Samsung cutouts are all in the right
place power button is easy to hit the
volume rockers are easy to use I give
this case an A+ I like this one a lot I
might keep this one on here in fact just
uninstall it real quick really rigid I'm
gonna protect your Samsung Galaxy s3 a
lot so this is our duo suit Sam galaxy
s3 the frosted clear from box wave just
open up from the top here bringing you
tomorrow's products today
one's another sort of transparent extra
class this one looks just like the other
one except for they both aren't box wave
pretty weird huh
that's the manufacturers doing the
similar stuff anyways gonna pop this one
on and just like the other one just fine
power buttons work volume rockers work
well to actually carry those clicked got
our cutouts little tether pork grip here
on the sides take this one off last but
not least save this one because this one
uh you know it's it's suitable for the
galaxy s3 this is our design set for sim
some mobile case any mode better protect
your mobile phone from Knox and
scratches with the case type all the
cases decided combated with a range of
Samsung handsets Seaford for packaging
see front of packaging for compatibility
way so let's open this one up and this
one's pretty rigid I like it um you know
I'm not so sure what other Samsung
products would fit in this size of
galaxy s3 now this makes me a little
leery but the galaxy s3 does fit the
vent case is kind of cool got our little
lanyard or our tether holster here all
of our cutouts are in the right spot so
this right here does look like it's made
for the Samsung Galaxy s3 there's not
too many other camera LED and speaker
configurations like that neither is
there a headphone jack anyways what I
don't like is that this although it does
allow you to see your exposed chrome
accents here there's going to be no
protection for the side impact but you
can still hit the volume of course and
the power buttons very easily also
there's not too much of a raised edge to
provide a protection from a down down
side impact so anyways guys that was our
case of Stravaganza our soft case at
least we've got a few more case
extravaganzas coming at you got our hard
cases and we've got some leather
holsters and sports active wear cases
whatnot coming in
this is a collection of all the ones we
went over today pretty nice amount of
cases and I'd suggest picking your
favorite one up for the Samsung Galaxy
s3 provided with some maximum protection
you don't want your baby getting hurt
anyways stay tuned with Android 30.com
guys and we're bringing you a heck of a
lot more where this came from later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
