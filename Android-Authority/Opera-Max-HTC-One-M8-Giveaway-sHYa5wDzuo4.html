Hindy from android authority you may
have noticed we haven't had a sunday
giveaway in a couple weeks and that is
because we have been preparing for a
most epic giveaway and now here it is
before we look at this week's contest
let's take a brief look at our last
contest the winner of the Moto X was a
one Florence L congratulations to you
Florence we sincerely hope you enjoyed
your brand spanking new Moto X this
contest is going to run through the
entire month of April which means we're
not going to give away just one device
we're going to give away 5 ok so on
March 30th will start the giveaway for a
brand new HTC One m8 on april sixth
marks the beginning of the Sony Xperia
z2 leg of our giveaway journey on April
13th will begin to give away for the
Samsung Galaxy s5 and on April twentieth
will start the giveaway for a second
samsung galaxy s5 at the end of it all
there will be a grand prize winner who
will get their choice of an HTC One m8 a
samsung galaxy s5 or a sony xperia z2
the choice will be yours and we'll talk
here in a moment about how you can win
that if you want to know the specs and
all of the information about these
various powerhouse devices you should
tune in to the official android
authority youtube channel because we've
got feature focus videos reviews hands
on and all of the other info you need to
see these awesome devices in action so i
bet you're wondering how to win this
show Morgus board of awesomeness before
we talk about how to win these prodigies
devices let's take a moment to give a
shout-out to our sponsors this month's
giveaway is sponsored by opera max the
often talked about application has left
beta and to celebrate opera has
sponsored this giveaway we'll have our
full review of opera max linked here at
the end of the video and in the video
description below and also on the
contest page ok so here's how you win
you head on over to our contest page
which is linked in the video description
below where you'll see our familiar
rafflecopter widget using this widget
you'll need to download opera max to
your smartphone which will NAB you 5
contest entries this is mandatory so in
order to enter the contest you'll have
to do it the good news is aside from
trying out a pretty awesome application
you'll also be entered to win all four
weekly contests so you don't have to
come back next week to enter the next
one now technically that's all you need
to do to enter to win the four weekly
contests as
the norm for our giveaways will also
provide you with a unique URL that you
can share with your friends on social
media for each one of them that signs up
using your unique URL you'll get one
bonus entry with a maximum of ten bonus
entries available there is one last way
to get tickets but it's a bit of a
paradox you see opera wants to see opera
max in action so you have the option to
upload a screenshot of your opera max
experience to get an additional 10
entries but wait there's more a pay
attention here because this part is
important the person who uploads the
screenshot with the most data savings
will win the grand prize so you can
upload a screenshot in the first week if
you want a bigger chance to win one of
the weekly contests or you can wait
until the last week and try to go for
the grand prize the decision is yours
but let me remind you the grand prize
winner gets to pick which one of these
awesome flagship devices they walk away
with so there is that and that's it
folks you can follow the link below to
the contest page to get started right
now best of luck to everyone as a final
note it's worth mentioning that this
contest is for residents of the US and
Russia only we're very sorry if you
don't live in those areas but stay tuned
because we have some awesome
international giveaways coming up at the
end of April once again I'm Joe Hindy
