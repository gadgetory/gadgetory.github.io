Hindy the Android a 30 appt guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 152 so let's get
started alright folks is take a look at
the headlines from the last week
swiftkey had bit of a problem this last
week there was a data leak in their
servers and this caused people to have
words emails and phrases that were
recommended to them that they didn't
actually recognize typically it was a
strange email address or words in a
foreign language because of this
swiftkey has stopped their cloud syncing
service until they can get it all
straightened out a report earlier this
week indicated that there were around
200 million yahoo accounts that were up
for sale a hacker named peace of mind
put up the accounts in their store on
the dark web and they are asking for
three bitcoins or just under two
thousand dollars for the entire
collection according to motherboard some
of the accounts are active and some of
them are disabled or inactive either way
if you still have an active yahoo
account you should probably change your
password like right now cheetah mobile
has just finished up a deal where it
purchased News Republic for 57 million
dollars News Republic for those who
don't know as an HTC blinkfeed partner
and they also have a really good news
app this comes in the wake of a number
of other moves such as the release of
bad land two tons of people use cheetah
mobile apps but the company's reputation
is less than stellar and that makes us
wonder what they have in store for news
Republic Google Play is having a massive
game sale this week Final Fantasy 6
oddworld strangers wrath and munch's
oddysee minecraft story mode Laura Croft
go and many others are up for grabs each
game is on sale for a varying amount
with savings occasionally reaching over
fifty percent most of these are really
good games that are definitely worth
checking out google's new nexus launcher
leaked this last week and the APK has
been floating around for everyone to try
out it does things a little differently
like getting rid of the app drawer icon
in favor of a much more minimal arrow
and you can quickly access Google now
with a new google tab widget it is
coming with his fair share of bugs but
it's mostly because it's meant to be
installed as a system application you
can check it out but don't be surprised
if some of the features don't work for
even more Android apps and games news
including the latest Pokemon go news
don't forget to check out this week's
newsletter which is linked in the video
description below if you want the
newsletter sent straight to your email
every
you can fill out the form which is
available in the written companion which
is also linked in the video description
below and we'll send that out to you you
can also check out the android authority
app for even faster updates all right
folks is take a look at the apps and
games that made a big splash over the
last week if you want to download any of
these new apps or games for yourself you
can find those links in the video
description below blackberry hub
services may seem familiar to anyone who
has used a blackberry prive that's
because it's the same hub that's
available on that device because of
their new focus on software blackberry
has deemed it necessary to release the
application to anybody that wants it no
matter which android device they run it
has quick links to other blackberry apps
like it's texting app and it's calendar
app for quick reference the hub actually
manages the data from all of these other
apps so if you want to use the hub
you'll pretty much have to use the other
apps as well if that sounds like
something you want to do you can get the
app for free right now Verne the
Himalayas is an adorable little
application where you can explore the
Himalayan mountains with a Yeti named
Vern basically this is a 3d Google Maps
view of the mountains with some added
elements superimposed on top to provide
additional info you'll explore the
mountains in the application will talk
to you about certain points and why
they're significant you can hang glide
go sledding and explore the mountains at
various other ways it's a fun little
experience and you could learn a thing
or two as well Mobius Final Fantasy was
released this week and it's something a
little bit different from the
long-running franchise you'll be playing
as a guy who has lost his memory and you
enlist the help of friends to help you
find it it features better graphics and
mechanics than were used to seeing in
freemium games and the grand jour
in-game cutscenes are a lot of fun to
watch aside from that this is a combat
based game with a card collecting
mechanic as well as a job system it's
worth a shot especially if you're a fan
of the series Dropbox paper is the
latest application out of the cloud
storage company it is a note-taking app
that seems to live somewhere between
Google keep and Google Drive when it
comes to functionality users will be
able to create nodes and documents
comment on those documents and then of
course reply to those comments people
can invite others to the app to
collaborate on documents as well the
application is in beta which means there
are some bugs here and there and it's
far from complete still it's free if you
want to try it out the olympic games in
rio are in full swing and you may want
to keep up on what's going on NBC is
covering the event and their official
appliqu√©
for the Olympics is now out
unfortunately the application could be
better and it is suffering from some
long load times and an inconsistent
interface however it is the best
application to find this information in
a centralized area realistically any
good sports app should have decent
coverage as well just in case you want
another option that said if you want
something that is specifically for the
Olympics this is a decent app to try and
that about does it for this one folks if
you want to keep watching we have the
nexus launcher hands on linked up there
on the screen and in the video
description below for you folks on
mobile don't forget to subscribe to the
newsletter and keep it tuned to android
authority because we are your source for
all things android thanks again for
watching everybody and have a wonderful
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
