it comes to how long most of us have to
wait for our Android updates most of you
feel something like this why is it that
iOS hipsters receive their updates all
at the same time but Android users have
to wait forever well friends I feel your
pain and we are gonna do something about
it today yes hello may I speak to Larry
Page please yes there is a Larry Page
there you know big gummy tooth guy
friend of Sergey CEO co-founder kind of
guy that Larry Page Thank You Larry
hey chase here from Android authority
how are you buddy oh you watch my shows
love it that's great that's great
no you're thinking it Josh listen Larry
we got some serious frustrated Android
users here and they really want you to
work on the fragmentation and pushing of
those updates all the way really
oh okay I will tell them that but hey
what about the iOS users they receive
all their update okay okay mr. Page I
will tell them I will no I'm not that
Jace from Android authority you got a
restraining order on I was Joe
all righty welcome back Android peeps my
name is Jason and today I share what I
learned about why Android updates take
so long to get out to so many people but
first a brief history lesson so guys if
you look at the Android version chart
below you can see the Android version
history it started with Android 1.0 and
then Android 1.1 but after that Google
called their Android versions by
alphabetical code names they started
with cupcake donut Eclair Froyo
gingerbread honeycomb Ice Cream Sandwich
and jelly bean and a now of course
KitKat but what I want to draw your
attention to is the fact that as of
November 2013 some people some Android
users are still using Froyo that's like
five six versions back that's crazy
that's the love of fragmentation that's
happening on Android and we're going to
talk about why what I learned is that
Android has to go through three major
processes before that update is finally
released
to the end-user and here is step one so
the first thing that needs to happen is
that the chipset makers need to provide
what's called a hook or code that allows
the operating system to communicate and
thus control the hardware components of
course those hardware components are a
little bit different for every device so
that adds time know that but there's
different chipset manufacturers you have
Qualcomm Texas Instruments Samsung
Nvidia etc all of them take their own
separate time to build these hooks but
it's generally accepted that these folks
should take anywhere from four to eight
weeks and thus that takes us to the
second stage in this stage the software
stack is passed on to the manufacturer
of the rest of the phone and of course
each Hardware is a little bit different
it has slightly different components and
that software needs to be customized to
meet those components add to the fact
that they have the carrier related apps
that need to be included so they can't
just take TouchWiz and slap it on all
their devices and push it out those
devices are slightly different
Samsung has how many different devices
and they all have slightly different
needs they can't just push it out all at
once but Nick dark hollow from Samsung
stated that it takes on average six to
eight weeks from when they receive the
release from Google when they can pass
it on to the carrier which is the final
step and by far the most time comes
welcome to the wonderful world of
carrier testing it has been explained to
me that it is pain staking ly tedious
they have to test not only every phone
they plan to offer but every phone that
they've already sold to ensure that the
OS operates as advertised they have to
test not just you know drop testing and
hardware testing all that kind of stuff
but they have to you know test out the
CDMA GSM LTE multiple networks on
multiple providers it's very complex so
it comes down to the bottom line is if
you are a business in the business of
selling new phones where do you want to
apply most of your limited resources on
new phones so if I have you know this
old Galaxy Note here I am going to be at
the end of the update line if I get the
update at all but I know what some of
you are thinking you're thinking Jase
those Apple lovers are getting their
updates roughly all at the same time Tim
Cook announces an update and within 2 or
3 weeks everyone seems to have it if
they can do it why can't we well the
answer is they're not doing it they're
going through all the same hoops that
Android has to go to it's just that
Apple announces those updates at the end
of that process
whereas Google announces it at the
beginning of their release you see
Google is the platform of an open source
or somewhat of an open source operating
system and so they only take it a
quarter of the way although
manufacturers and the carriers have to
take that release update the rest of the
way hence the perception that andr takes
a really long time but Apple is almost
instant well it's not the announcement
just happens at different times
that's the reason alright guys thanks
for watching I had a lot of fun
researching this if you found this
helpful please kindly give us a like and

them down in the comments below and I
should see you next week on androids
