brought to you by domain.com this was my
first mobile phone and I'm sure it was
many of you were first mobile phones too
because at one time Nokia dominated the
mobile phone market now the interesting
question is what would Nokia have to do
to come back today and just rush it now
about a year ago I asked you guys if you
would be excited about an Android
powered Nokia phone and the response was
strong because for an entire generation
the name Nokia will stir up a lot of
emotion from the iconic 3210 to the
symbolic and 95 the pre smartphone years
were Nokia's heyday and a large majority
of current smartphone users will be able
to recall using a Nokia handset in their
past but the obvious question remains
after Apple came and invented the
smartphone market why didn't no Kia
fully commit to Android instead of just
dipping their toe in it and that's
exactly what happened the company
introduced the Android powered Nokia 1
tablet in November 2014
however the n1 isn't quite the nokia
device we've all come to know and love
as it's a tablet that nokia has licensed
their name to rather than made
themselves last week the rumour that
Nokia would fully commit to Android
reared its head again with a new report
suggesting we'd see a Nokia released new
Android powered smartphone at the
beginning of 2016 when the claws in the
Microsoft deal preventing it from making
devices expires however shortly after
the company issued a statement denying
any move to enter the smartphone market
but conceded that it would consider
brand licensing like it has done with
the n1 looking back at Nokia smartphones
in the latter stages of Symbian and the
Windows Phone era and one thing is
painfully clear Nokia's problem was
always its software Symbian inability to
develop an iPhone Challenger and the
failure of Microsoft Windows to capture
the market yet Android can solve all
these issues now for those of you who
believe that Nokia's days are done you
got to remember this the Nokia brand
name is arguably the Finnish company's
biggest asset
as indicated by the 20001 sails in just
four minutes when the tablet went on
sale in China people still want to buy
Nokia products Nokia had a large part to
play in the market share the Windows
Phone and Joyce today and the brand is
still powerful enough to likely make
Nokia's return to mobile successful
remember that marketing history lesson I
gave a couple weeks ago nokia has to
create their own category and dominate
the category who was the first one to
create the tablet category in mobile
devices it was Apple who dominates the
tablet devices market now Apple who
created the new category of phablets
Samsung who dominates the category
Samsung so the question is what category
could Nokia create now this is so hard
to do why because for us humans it's
really difficult to imagine needing or
wanting something that we have no
experience with so for example before
Ford made the first automobile people
didn't say they wanted a new automobile
they said they wanted a faster cheaper
horse and carriage this is why the first
car wasn't called a car it was called a
horseless carriage so for a while there
was just one type of automobile until
eventually you had different categories
of automobiles you had a van and then
boy that opened up a whole new set of
categories
you had minivans passenger vans cargo
vans then a truck half ton truck full
ton truck and before you know it we got
jeeps and endless amounts of categories
nokia has to create a new category of
mobile devices what could that be I have
an idea
now some people may argue that Nokia
needs to make a business phone to
replace the BlackBerry market so to
speak or a prosumer tablet a tablet that
begins to replace you were a laptop for
example but I think they need to go one
step further than that you see there is
one painfully obvious problem with all
smart phones although they have opened
the world to us in one respect they've
also shrunk our world to five inches
you wrote to dinner with your family
everyone's like this
you're walking down the street
everyone's like this Fox is still stuck
under his cars so who knows how long he
was driving with that boxer people even
driving their bloody cars so now imagine
a piece of technology that gives us the
power and access of this but allows us
to open up to the immediate world around
us now I know what you're thinking
you're thinking Jays goggle already
tried this with Google glass no no one
should have Google design hardware it
looks like it was designed from someone
from Revenge of the Nerds never been out
with a girl before we need something
that's both powerful and discreet that's
in obtrusive that doesn't create a
barrier between me in the immediate
world around me so the question for you
is and I want to read him in the
comments below what category could Nokia
create and dominate think outside the
box I look forward to reading now I'm a
big fan of Jeremy Schoemaker otherwise
affectionately known as shoe money and I
was listening to a podcast of his where
he says what I said last week he will
not choose the name for a new business
unless he can get the dot-com why
because no domain name extension tells
your story with the same level of trust
as a.com or.net domain name dot-com and
dotnet domain name extensions and Jack
credibility and your online presence and
who doesn't want more credibility you

forget 15% off when you use our coupon

think domain.com so I wanted to point
out mr. Joe Hindi that I noticed that
not only did you not buck up and be a
man and eat the fruit but you have not
responded to my challenge what's going
on mr. Hindi I'm waiting you guys know
the drill here here down in the comments
and my brothers over here I shall see
you next week
