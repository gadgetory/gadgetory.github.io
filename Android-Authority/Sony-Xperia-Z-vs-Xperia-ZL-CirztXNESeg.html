live on the ground we were at CES 2013
were visiting Sony Mobile we have the
pleasure of speaking with one of the
representatives named Freddie Mendez who
is an expert on the experience that in
the experience that l or Z L or Z this
is it depending where you're from the
biggest difference really between the Z
and the ZL is is going to be the the
compact size of the CEO the CL of course
you're going to lose the water
resistance and the dust resistance so of
course you're gonna gain a little bit of
things back on that what you're gonna
gain really is going to be the dedicated
camera key which is going to be on this
side you'll gain that back which is
known for Sony's being on Sony devices
and you're also gonna gain an IR blaster
that's here it's really hard to see on
the black but on the white you can
clearly see that but so you can control
your TV or remove set-top box whatever
that is anything infrared you can
control yeah if it's infrared Buster
yeah absolutely
you can set that up and then your same
screen same screen size so five inch
real HD rally display 1080p everything
spec wise same again it's just the how
compact it is so we're at a 75% screen
to phone ratio so you're getting a more
compact 5 inch phone basically what it
is and then you're gonna difference is
on the backs here if you go you'll have
the hard tempered glass on the Z but on
the background the Z you're basically
going to have a smooth or not as smooth
but a textured rubber grip what that
feels really nice and when you're
carrying it so it doesn't feel like it's
gonna slip out of your hands in terms of
the internals a lot of guys really
interested so this is a 13 megapixel
sensor on both currents the Exmoor are
Exmor RS it's actually the next the next
level of Exmoor our camera sensors
basically what that does is it enables
HDR photo but it also enables HDR video
too so we're the first to enable the HDR
video and the smartphone and that does
that on the fly as it's recording
impressive educated dedicate ship but
there
right right and it actually it does it
automatically and it's and we call it a
superior Auto mode when you get into the
camera it automatically does it for you
so but this is all one unit you cannot
there's no expandable memory on this
particular one that is expandable yes
both have expandable memory microSD up
to 32 gig microSD cards bring it back to
the front they incorporate Gorilla Glass
2 it's in their heart and they're both
are going to be durable tempered glass
not Gorilla Glass we use a several two
different manufacturers so but it is
going to be a durable tempered glass so
two gigs of ram 1.5 gigahertz welcome s4
pro processor correct and when it comes
out it's going to be released in the 64
gigabyte iteration or just 32 816 this
one's actually gonna be the 1616 get gig
internal on both expandable up to 32 GB
microSD down here actually that's that's
another thing that's different but it's
a front facing cameras now at the bottom
yes yes well on this particular one they
they I said tend to see that you look
down on the display when you're video
chatting you usually see yourself in the
bottom corner so you're always looking
down at yourself there well they if you
have the camera down here you're
actually looking down at the bottom
you're looking at yourself so it looks
like you're actually looking at the
person you're talking to I'm not so much
of a video chatter myself but I'm really
anxious to try it out also I can't wait
to try it out - so when do you think
we're gonna see these on the market
there's not been a release date on that
so far
or a pricing where a majority thing like
that so that's okay well thanks I just
want to say thank you very much for your
time I don't know nice throw
run down no profits android throating
here live from the ground at CES 2013
thanks everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
