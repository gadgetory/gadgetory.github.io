all need from our smart phones
especially when we're doing things like
say work and play at the same time or if
we just let's say work a lot it's a
feature that everyone wants and in a
particular phone like the Samsung Galaxy
Note 4 we have all the screen real
estate to take advantage of multitasking
and that's exactly what Samsung did in
this new version of the note line so
it's Josh from guard from Andhra
Authority what's going on everybody and
it's time to take a look at the
multitasking of the Samsung Galaxy Note
4 and here we are with the Samsung
Galaxy Note 4 we're taking a look at
multitasking and I just held the back
button to show you the list of
applications that can be used with the
multi window multi window should be
pretty familiar for all of you veterans
of the note line and the list is getting
better and better and larger so you'll
be able to use any of your applications
most of them at least in order to make
multi window and I just put the YouTube
application on the bottom and Chrome on
the top which is very familiar again to
a lot of you who have used multi window
before so in this case I'll be able to
use YouTube to watch some media while
browsing the Internet in this case I'll
go to Android authority calm very simple
and very familiar as I keep saying for
anyone who's used a note before but now
there's even an easier way to get to
multi window and that's from the recent
apps screen as you can see here the
recent apps screen already looks a lot
better they've made it cards that are
easy to flip through and to swipe away
it's a very attractive looking recent
apps screen and for a lot of people who
multitask it probably will be one of the
main ways that you're going to use
multitasking but there's a new icon on
the top right of each of the cards on it
is the multi window shortcut that is
available now for any applications that
can be used with multi window you can
hit that icon and you'll see the most
recent applications that were used with
the one that you've selected but if you
swipe over to the right you'll see all
of the other applications that are
available so you'll be able to create
two windows that you'll use at the same
time in a very easy way for anyone that
uses multi window this is a wonderful
new way of doing so and it's an easy way
to get straight to the ones that you
might use most frequently as you can see
here once again Chrome and YouTube
when using multi window you still have
the options by pressing the little
button on the middle that will allow you
to switch the
knows to move content from one to the
other to collapse the selected window to
expand it to be the only one that's
being used and of course to close the
application now the option that I
mentioned collapsing a window allows it
to become a floating head as you can see
there that I did with the YouTube and
you can drag it around and it is
available for you to use on the side by
tapping on it doing so will allow you to
get a floating window which is another
way of multitasking on here that's
available for all the applications in
the same list that you can do multi
window for tap the button on the top and
you'll see that you can still move
content from one to the other collapse
it to another floating head or expand it
and finally if you were to drag the
floating window down to the bottom you
would see a selector come up that is
basically showing you that you can
create that window to be a part of a
dual window multi window application and
now here we're back to the status quo
for me the YouTube and Chrome
combination for an even easier way to
create the floating window just hold the
back button and you'll be able to see
the list of applications and just tap
any of them rather than dragging on to
the multi window grid in order to create
the floating window you can have
multiple ones open at the same time and
from there you can always create little
floating heads from each of the
applications that you have already
floating as windows that way they'll be
easy to put aside for you to use later
it's a really easy way of creating just
a sort of slew of different applications
that you might be using all at once but
you don't want all of them cluttering up
your screen at the same time and then
dragging the icons down to the bottom or
the top of the screen will allow it to
become part of that multi window
combination the final way of activating
some multitasking on the note 4 is by
having a full application already set up
but then dragging from one of the top
corners down to create the size of what
will become a floating window this is
yet another way that you can create a
floating window aside from just hitting
the back button and then tapping on the
application or by doing so from the
multi window combination already set up
but from here you can go back to any of
those other ways of multitasking by
hitting the icon on the top dragging it
down or by creating the floating icon
these are all ways that you can go in
and out of each version of multitasking
on the Galaxy Note 4 which makes it a
seamless multitasking experience if you
weren't already a big fan of the
multitasking or the multi window in
particular of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3
or the no 2 before
then things like even the floating
window or probably things you didn't
really use much before you probably use
the recent apps screen and whatnot and
really if you're stuck in your ways then
I can understand if you don't really use
or want to use this particular feature
but what is great about the multitasking
in the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is the fact
that it's now a lot easier to access the
multi window and you can do it in a lot
of different ways you can have an
application and then quickly make it a
small application that floats on top of
everything else and then make it a small
a floating head that will be able to be
accessed whenever you need it and then
from there from the Unison apps screen
you can even turn on the multi window
just by hitting that small icon and be
able to open the ones that you've used
in the past like say for me usually I do
YouTube and chrome like I showed you in
the example here in this video there
list when it comes to the multi window
is starting to get longer and longer and
yes you will only be able to do these
particular abilities with the
applications that are on this list but
that's actually ok because like I showed
you earlier the list is actually quite
long a lot of key applications like even
Facebook or even the camera or the
calendar all the way down to Chrome and
YouTube are used in this particular
ability and with that already being the
case I'm sure that there are a lot of
applications out there that you use that
you can take advantage of in these
particular ways so make sure you keep it
tuned to Android Authority for all the
best coverage including the coverage of
the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 in my full
review and any videos that come after
