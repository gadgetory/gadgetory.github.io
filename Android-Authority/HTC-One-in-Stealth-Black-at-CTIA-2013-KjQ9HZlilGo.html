what's going on everybody now it's
pretty safe to say that there are plenty
of people out there who love the design
and feel of the HTC One for what happens
when you put a new black coat of paint
on it or this is what you get you get
the black edition of the HTC One and I
gotta say it is a very sleek device I
know that many smart phones these days
do come in a black edition but none make
it look quite as good as the HTC One
this is definitely a wonderful look you
get the same HTC One pretty much all
around you have the 4.7 inch screen with
the two boomsound speakers front-facing
right on the front and you have the
whole ultrapixel capable account on the
back and the aluminum feel that many
people have come to love is still there
so here we are this is the HTC One in
its black edition from what I know this
this phone is going to be available on
sprint and 80 they just came out about a
week ago on those carriers in this color
if i'm not mistaken they were already
available on those carriers so you're
just going to be able to have a choice
here if you were able to wait for just a
little bit before making the plunge into
HTC's new flagship phone so just kind of
going through this a little bit kind of
show you what really comes with the
Black Edition here you have the
blinkfeed that
either lover 8 personally I'm a pretty
big fan of linking myself and coming
through of course the home screens over
on the side and the app drawer and after
within so that's just a really quick
look you really wanted to bring this to
you because we thought that this was a
very nice-looking edition of the HTC One
as one of the hottest phones on the
market right now this really is a nice
way to update the look while retaining
everything that people love about the
agency once again this is josh of the
GAR from android authority and we are
here at ctia 2013 in particular at Pep
com mobile focus here demoing the HTC
One</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
