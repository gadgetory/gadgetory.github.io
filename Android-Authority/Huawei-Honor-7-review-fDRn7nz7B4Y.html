adds a bit more of a luxurious look and
feel and with while way designing one of
the new Nexus phones
maybe we'll get a glimpse of what
they're planning for November hello
everybody I'm crystal and this is a
review of the Huawei honor 7 this year
Huawei took a huge step up in the design
department for their newest addition to
their honor lineup with a ceramic coated
single metallic body this song feels a
lot more premium than last year's honor
6 when holding the honor 7 it feels very
solid and nothing here feels cheap or
clunky gone is a fragile real glass
backing and here instead is a more
durable metallic backing then not only
looks great but feels really nice in the
hand the front glass meets the metal
edges without much of a lip allow you to
swipe things in with ease now if it's
pretty small bezels and 5.2 inch screen
one-handed operation is quite easy even
though the metallic backing can make it
feel a bit slippery sometimes on the
front above the screen we can find the 8
megapixel front facing camera the
speaker grille which has an LED
notification light inside and the
front-facing flash well we'll get to
that later the back of the phone offers
a similar design to something like the
HTC One m9 and is home to the 20
megapixel camera and it's dual tone
flash right below the camera is a
fingerprint scanner which although is
unique placement it's a great idea as
that's where you're pointing your
usually arrest when holding the phone
however this does mean that when the
phone is sitting on a desk you'll have
to revert to a pin code to unlock the
device but the PIN pad is instantly
accessible when turning on the screen
this fingerprint scanner is probably one
of the fastest I've used while way
claims that the scanner can be your
fingerprint and only 0.5 seconds and
that's definitely right if not faster I
found it faster than my Galaxy s6 and it
very rarely failed to read my
fingerprint and you don't have to turn
on the screen for it to read it either
the sensor is more than just a
fingerprint scanner though as it
supports swipe gestures which I actually
found myself relying on when operating
the phone to name a few sliding down can
bring down the Norfolk
in panel sliding up will show you your
recent apps and just by tapping it it
can be used as a back button these are
very handy to have but like I said since
the scanner is located where your
pointer finger usually rests you will
definitely accidentally trigger these
gestures once in a while you can disable
them if you like but I found most of
these gestures useful enough that I try
to get in a habit of not resting my
finger there the top of the phone houses
a headphone jack and IR blaster the
bottom has a micro USB charging port and
what looks like to be two speaker grills
but the left one is the only one that
plays the sound the speakers I would say
are below average
it gets loud enough so you can hear very
well in a quiet room but move beyond
that and you'll probably have some
trouble trying to hear the quality also
seems a bit muffled the volume buttons
are located on the right side of the
phone and they are very responsive and
easy to press same goes for the power
button which is located below it has a
bit of a textured pattern to it although
you can't really feel this but still
it's very easy to differentiate between
the volume buttons and power button as
they are spaced apart just enough the
left side has what looks like to be just
a SIM card tray but it actually doubles
as a micro SD card slot or you can have
two SIM cards active below the tray is a
button and now what is the purpose of
this button well whatever you want you
can launch apps using the button open up
different commands and you can set up to
three different shortcuts by either
clicking the button once twice or
holding it's just so useful
I really wish more phones had this
because it just makes multitasking and
getting work done so much easier and
faster it's a great feature the honor 7
packs a high silicon octa-core chiron
processor with three gigs of RAM there's
two storage models one with 16 gigs and
the other with 64 gigs and inside we
have a 3100 milliamp battery the phone
comes in white black and even a gold
option and yes it supports NFC the
Huawei honor 7 is equipped with a 5.2
inch HD IPS display and it's a very nice
one
there's a huge difference between this
and his competition the meizu mx4 the
honor 7 has a beat by far with 424
pixels per inch viewing content on this
display is great Huawei says the honor 7
display has a 1500 to one high contrast
ratio and 85% color saturation rate this
makes for crisp and clear text and very
vibrant colors viewing angles are quite
good and this screen can get very bright
the phone also supports a tap to wake
feature for easily turning on the screen
with two taps overall it's a great
display and you won't be disappointed by
it the honor 7 is running 5.0 point 2
right out of the box with Huawei skinned
of emotion UI or emui 3.1 there are some
great things about it and some things
that aren't that great what is great is
that the phone is filled with shortcuts
and little features that help navigating
around the phone a lot quicker and fun
besides the nice fingerprint scanner
shortcuts you have the ability to use
your knuckle to take screenshots by
double tapping or even drawing areas to
crop reversing the back and recent apps
button or even adding a fourth button
for notification pulldown there's even
some silly ones like tilting the screen
to move apps around there is no sign of
any of Google's material design anywhere
throughout the software what you
actually have is something similar how
iOS is if it's blurring of background
areas it's all subjective some I love it
but some Android lovers may wish it
didn't steer too far off but hey
whatever rules it follows or doesn't
this UI is very sleek allowing for some
different themes to be chosen with some
really trippy but cool background
animations once again we do have some
more iOS inspired features like pulling
up on the lockscreen
brings up a control center with
shortcuts for apps like flashlight and
camera although there is no way to
change these shortcuts and swiping down
from the middle of the home screen will
open a universal app search there is
also no app drawer so once again this is
a phone that you will have to resort to
folder making to hide your apps also the
recent apps screen is a little more
reminiscent
of android kitkat so users familiar with
lollipop will have to get used to using
this style of recent apps again the
notification panel is chopped up into
sections shortcuts and notifications it
would have been nice to have these two
sections combined but the notification
section is quite nice with a little
timeline on the left side keeping your
notifications very organized
although the UI design choices are
unique is designed very well and the
extra customization of shortcuts
translates to a very nice experience the
hardware does a pretty good job of
making everything run very smooth very
few times will it slow down or take a
second to load something but when you
move on to gaming the GPU doesn't do a
great job of keeping up on more advanced
graphical games it's not really bad but
you do a lot of frames at times and
menus will take a while to load more
simple games like candy crush for
example shouldn't be a problem but if
you're a big gamer the honour 7 might
not be the best choice the camera is a
huge improvement coming from the Huawei
honor 6 if it's 20 megapixels you can
take some really good pictures Huawei is
using a Sony sensor for their rear
facing camera with a 2.0 aperture so
low-light shots should be better and
you'll have a nice depth of field effect
launching the camera is extremely fast
and easy to just by holding the volume
down button the camera will launch and
immediately snap a picture in a flash
it's super fast and even while way seems
proud of this as they fought how much
time it took and yes
picture quality is a great big
improvement pictures have a good amount
of detail and in most environments there
is not much noise once you get into
areas with medium light some grain will
start to show but it's not too much I
guess the theme for this camera is with
lots of light you will take very
colorful pictures with lots of detail
and no noise as you begin to lower the
brightness though these three things
begin to drop so the closer you get to
taking a picture in low-light pictures
will start to get a little grainy and
also colors begin to get a little dull
but besides this the overall quality of
pictures in low light is pretty good the
front-facing camera is wide angled and 8
megapixels with a 2.4 aperture you have
a couple of features here like beauty
mode
and even a front-facing flash which is
more of a dim little flashlight but it
can be good for just adding just a bit
of extra light in the quality is great
with nice colors and even detail and as
you go into moderate to low light once
again some noise will start to show but
pictures are very sharp and good looking
video quality is not that great dynamic
range is pretty poor and a lot of the
times it will be way to overexpose the
honor seven houses a 3100 milliamp
battery you can expect great battery
life on this phone on a typical day of
watching a few videos taking a few
pictures responding to lots of text and
having some long internet browsing
sessions I was able to get around five
and a half hours of screen on time the
honor seven is also capable of quick
charging which wow he claims in just
thirty minutes can charge your phone
from zero to fifty or with a five minute
charge can power enough to have a
one-hour phone call there are no huge
flaws with the honor seven but if you're
a huge gamer this film probably won't be
the best choice and the UI will take
some time getting used to but everybody
will really enjoy the display on this
phone along with the battery life and
pretty nice camera overall it's a really
good phone is it worth buying though
well while we is going to be pricing
this very competitively amongst other
mid-range phones around $400 for that
price point there are definitely better
phones out there that offer more in some
areas but at the end of the day this is
a nice little phone thanks for watching
everybody
