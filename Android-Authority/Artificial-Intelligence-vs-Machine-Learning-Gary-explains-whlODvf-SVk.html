authority now some of the catchphrases
that you hear a lot of today are
artificial intelligence machine learning
and neural networks and they are often
used interchangeably but actually
they're very separate different things
so if you want to know what the
differences are between artificial
intelligence and machine learning then
please let me explain basically it works
like this when a company's trying to
sell a product they call everything
artificial intelligence so my smartphone
has artificial intelligence your your
house has artificial intelligence when
they're talking to maybe to the
engineers or talking about job
descriptions then they may put in the
word machine learning and then when it
comes to actually writing some actual
specifications actually developing the
technology then they're probably going
to be using neural networks so let's
have a look at what these three things
are and see how really they're quite
different but of course very
interconnected we'll start with a
simpler one which is machine learning
simpler in that it's simpler to define
now machine learning is the process by
which a machine can learn from its
experience now I've got a whole video on
this about what is machine learning and
I'll link it up here so you can go and
watch that now basically machine
learning in our context like learning to
recognize voice learning to recognize
images learning to recognize text is
basically you take a data set you feed
it into a program that is capable of
learning from that data set and then of
the output it knows how to use and
recognize things that fit inside that
data set even if they've never actually
seen that specific example before so you
can teach the computer the word you know
hello and you can say in lots of
different accents in British accents
like mine and maybe in an American
accent and a sort of South deep in the
south part of America maybe from
Scotland
you know maybe from Australia and you
can say hello in all these different
ways and because it's actually learnt
these different formats of understanding
the word hello then you can understand
hello when anybody says it all all
around the world that's basically the
idea now the thing about machine
learning is very very
specific so if you teach a computer to
recognize the word hello from America
and with the British accent from
Scotland from Australia that's great but
if you then say goodbye it doesn't
understand doesn't recognize what you're
trying to say so let me give an example
we've got this
alphago system that can play go the
chinese ancient game of go much better
than any human player now the point is
that go is played on a 19 by 19 board
now they trained up this program they
just taught it how to play go it played
millions of games and then it worked out
how to play go but if they actually
present it now this with a twenty by
twenty board the machine learning
program would just fail you would not
know how to play go there's no
creativity there's no abstract thinking
there's no strategy there's no like oh
well I know how to play this I've seen
it similar before Ingo bon a 1919 board
but a human player particularly one
who's an expert at go would have a very
good attempt at playing that game at a
fairly high level so machine learning is
impressive when it's in a very
particular thing and it says well this
computer knows how to play goal this
could be to knows how to recognize
voices but if you give it something
outside of what it's used to that it
just completely fails because a very
specific application now when it comes
to neural network neural networks are
one of the key ways of doing deep
learning today so the idea is and it's
modeled on the way our brain is thought
to function with the idea of neurons and
when the neurons are combining to get
together you can have a set of inputs
and then the signals when those inputs
are propagated further on down the
network if a certain threshold is met
and then that threshold can be tweaked
and trained using a feedback system so
as you present it it's kind of distal
zeros at the beginning as empty and then
as you present it data and as you tell
it what the desired result is it can
kind of have this feedback and it
creates this ability to recognize things
in a general pattern and it's pattern
recognition you know that's a dog that's
the word hello and so on that gives it
its power but neural net was not the
only method of machine know and there
are lots of different algorithms that
can be used for machine learning however
neural networks are the ones that are
being you
maybe for the greatest benefit at the
moment now artificial intelligence is
different intimate intelligence actually
talks about the idea of being able to be
creative to have abstract thinking to be
able to analyze things inside a context
now I've got a whole video on art of
emergence which I will link up here but
basically the thing we have to remember
is that machine learning is very about
pattern recognition about seeing a
particular situation whereas artificial
intelligence is being able to be
intelligent about that and of course we
could have a whole discussion about what
intelligence is but basically you have
to remember that a computer can exhibit
the ideas of intelligence without being
intelligent itself the example that is
often used is if you have a man inside
of a room that has an infinite number of
dictionaries about Chinese Mandarin and
it has an infinite number of responses
that it can give to any number of
questions that if you stick some Chinese
Mandarin under the door of his room he
can pick it up he can look it up in the
book and he can give you the reply and
you would be convinced that the man
inside the room actually is fluent in
speaking Mandarin in fact he's not he's
just looking up an input and giving you
the appropriate output so it exhibits
the idea of intelligence without
actually being intelligent and then
further on we've got the idea that of
course an AI is generalistic so machine
learning is very specific but an AI
would be generalistic so if it was
presented with a 20 by 20 go board it
would have a good crack at saying well I
can play this game I've never seen it
before but I can play this game because
I'm gonna use my sort of abstract
thinking my strategy my context here to
work out what's going on and then AI
you've also got the idea of a weak AI
and strong AI weak AI basically being a
system that exhibits the ideas of
intelligence the characteristics of
intelligence without actually being
self-aware without actually being
sentient whereas strong AI is the idea
that people some people believe that you
can create a computer that actually
forms its consciousness it becomes
self-aware and that cause brings in the
whole issues of morality and ethics
which actually we're going to look at in
another video
soon so to recap machine learning is a
algorithm a technique for recognizing
patterns and then doing something
according to those patterns whether it
be words images you know strategy games
it's just basically pattern recognition
if I was in this position before what
did I do that would lead me to a win
that's the strategy one or if I've seen
this picture before what does it look
like when it renders mbers another
picture I've seen of a cat or a dog or a
car or whatever and neural networks are
a part of machine learning in how you
actually build the software to do that
process of learning artificial tones on
the other hand is the idea of exhibiting
intelligence which includes abstract
thinking creativity strategy context
which is much broader and much more
generalistic so some people even talk
about it as general AI general
artificial intelligence so although the
marketing people will kind of talk about
AI and machine learning and neural
networks all in the same phrase and they
will just mix them up they are actually
very specifically different things of
course neural networks are part of
machine learning machine learning has to
be part of AI but they're not all
exactly the same thing so if you have a
smartphone that claims it has AI because
actually it's got machine learning well
now you know different I'm going to
since render Authority and really hope
you enjoyed this video if you did please
