Clayton Youngberg once again coming at
you from Android authority calm your
number one source for all things Android
today I'm going to be reviewing an
accessory for most Android devices this
is the Jawbone Jambox now this is a
limited edition model and this is just a
Bluetooth or a hard wired speaker system
for any device whatsoever as long as
you've got Bluetooth you can operate it
and as long as your device has a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack output you can
operate this now this operates off of an
internal battery gonna want to charge it
you can see we have our microUSB for
charging this is our power switch of
course our input and then it has
built-in bluetooth the other physical
controls here are the volume up volume
down and then this is the like if you
receive a call you can use this to
answer the call and this is also
Bluetooth functionality anyways it's a
really solid design it's heavy in the
hands it has a nice shock absorbing
value you can take these edges off as
you can see here and the green is the
limited edition now these run for $200
so it's a pretty steep price point but
it's pretty worth it if you're an
audiophile it has some good base great
treble great mid and I'm an audiophile
so I really enjoy this it is a bit steep
of a price but it's great so we'll go
ahead and demo this umm I do have it
connected via bluetooth I'm gonna be
using my Samsung Galaxy s3
now how you connect is you would want to
turn the device on simply by moving the
switch up you get audio confirmation
that the device is on and then you can
put it in pairing mode I'm going to go
ahead and turn the volume down just so
it's known as a lot on our mic you can
put it in pairing mode simply by
grabbing the switch and you just push up
and you'll get audio confirmation one
box is in pairing mode waiting for
device to connect and we have our audio
confirmation we can go into our
Bluetooth on the Samsung Galaxy s3 you
see we are paired with the jam box by
jawbone yeah we're connected through
phone and media audio so now whatever we
play on the device is going to play
through the jam box I'll just set this
down
can get a demo of the sound quality I
have this pointed right at my mic so we
get the full extent of the sound quality
so next we'll open up our Samsung Music
Hub app to demo the songs here and we
can use our audio controls on the phone
increase the volume with the plus
you can really feel the bass when it's
in your hands to excellent quality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
