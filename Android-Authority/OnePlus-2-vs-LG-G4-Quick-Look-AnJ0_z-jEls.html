another flagship as the 1+2 goes
head-to-head in this quick look against
the LG g4 the oneplus 2 retains much of
the design language of its predecessor
but with some minor tweaks and some real
refinements that were added in the big
change comes in the material as the
oneplus 2 now features a metal frame and
steel accents but when it comes to the
rear backing apart from retaining the
sandstone black material which still
feels really nice new options now
include many different offerings
including Kevlar bamboo rosewood and
black apricots the big changes that are
really noticeable is the inclusion of a
home button up front this little divot
in the front portion that is where you
would put your thumb down for a
fingerprint reader but it also acts as a
home button in a capacitive key sense
and it is flanked by two buttons the
back button and the recent apps button
all of these being capacitive another
added button is the alert slider a
notification toggle of sorts found on
the left side that lets you toggle
between the different notification
settings either non-priority or all and
it does so very quickly and easily
without you needing to unlock your phone
and of course the main addition to the 1
plus 2 S connections is a USB type-c
port found at the bottom of the device
making it one of the first devices to
adopt this latest USB standard on the
other hand the LG g4 brings together the
best design elements from the last two
high-end offerings the G flex 2 and the
g3 and you can see that with the subtle
curve to the display that is more
pronounced when turning it over to its
back and this curve helps a little bit
more with the phone's durability there
is also the signature LG rear button
layouts that is below the camera and
holds not only the power button but it
is flanked by the volume rocker now LG
tried to add some uniqueness to this
phone with some new backings which
include not only the plastic finishes
but also leather in a variety of color
options so in a lot of ways the g4 is in
its own way a head turner and both
devices feature 5.5 inch displays with
dimensions that are quite similar and as
such the handing the experience is
actually kind of similar between the two
now we did already mention that there
are 5.5 inch displays in both of these
devices with the subtle curve being on
the g4 but the g4 also has the quad HD
screen which does Trump a 1080p variety
made in the oneplus 2 now we're not
that 1080p resolution is necessarily bad
for the oneplus 2 but if it does call
itself a flagship killer this might be
one place where it's going to fall a
little bit short but nonetheless the LCD
display on the oneplus 2 has a 170
degree viewing angle and the oneplus 2
outperforms most devices in the market
including the LG g4 in its brightness
and its angles while many may be
disappointed with the lack of quad HD
1080p certainly still seems to get the
job done in the oneplus 2 and it is in
performance that we do actually see a
tiny bit of disparity given that both
smartphones are current-generation
high-end flagships it's no surprise to
see that they feature some of the best
that Qualcomm has to offer the oneplus 2
actually comes with the Snapdragon 810
backed by the adrenal 4:30
and while the LG g4 has a Snapdragon 808
and 3 gigabytes of RAM in the case of a
lat the LG g4 with an additional gig of
ram available for the oneplus 2 64
gigabyte storage version and performance
is as smooth as ever for both of these
but it's also because the operating
systems have been made as optimized as
possible for the processors that are
underneath everything from opening to
closing apps and scrolling through
various elements of the you why it's
even multitasking are available here
though we will say that the g4 kind of
trumps the oneplus 2 in terms of
multitasking because it has some extra
features in its operating system now in
hardware we were a little bit bummed out
to see that the LG g4 didn't come with
too many bells and whistles when
compared to its main high-end
counterparts but what the oneplus 2 is
able to boast is the inclusion of a
fingerprint reader that is integrated
into the physical area on the front we
talked about earlier it also packs a
larger 3300 milliamp hour battery
compared to the 3000 milliamp hour unit
of the LG g4
however the removable battery of the LG
g4 allows people who have it the ability
to replace it if they need to have extra
power factor in the action slider and
you have a couple of features that the
oneplus 2 has that plenty of other
flagships do not but one big bummer that
the oneplus 2 doesn't have which has
been highly publicized at this point is
that it does not have NFC something that
all the other phones have and which
makes them equipped for the future of
payments that will be coming to the
Android ecosystem we're reserving our
judgements on the cameras until we get
our own review unit and there will be
camera shootouts between the oneplus 2
and all of the others in the market but
in the case of the g4 we have a 1.8
aperture package that outshines the
competition with the larger
answer over ones found in the other
flagships OAS has also been enhanced
with a wider stabilization range now
color has been a big focus with LG
adding in a color spectrum sensor found
right next to the optics that will
analyze the scene to help achieve the
right white balance automatically and
accurately so there are quite a few
things to really love about the g4
camera including all of the manual
controls that you have in the camera app
the oneplus 2 may not necessarily be
able to provide all of these same
features but it has added in what the LG
eco system has had before and continues
to have now mainly the laser-guided
autofocus that the oneplus 2 is now able
to boast having and on top of that
optical image stabilization which should
give the 2.0 aperture of the oneplus 2 a
little bit extra boost in low-light
performance it is still also capable of
4k video recording and capturing images
in the RAW format as well so we're going
to really put these two cameras through
their paces once we get our hands on a
oneplus 2 for ourselves and finally when
it comes to software we are going to see
a pretty big disparity here and it might
be for the good or bad of either one
because the g4 has the LG UI under the
shell of Android lollipop which provides
a lot of extra features that some might
prove annoying to the general user but
nonetheless has everything from
multitasking to even small app windows
that can be over your main screens and
really a lot of other features
underneath on the other hand oneplus 2
is running oneplus is own oxygen OS now
version 2.0 based on android 5.1.1 now
it brings material design elements to a
mostly stock version of Android which
usually is a great thing and we do
believe that it to be so in the oneplus
2 with a few features baked in made
specifically for the oneplus device
however it doesn't have too many
customization options especially in
changing the look and that really is
only the place that we find the oxygen
always falling behind a bit because if
it looks way too vanilla then that just
doesn't give the oneplus enough
differentiation from the other flagships
it is trying to so-called
kill but killing the flagships obviously
comes down to the main big story here
and it is the price + 1 + continues to
break the mold in this regard by
continuously to bring consumers another
fantastic high-end smartphone with great
specs at less than half the price of its
direct competition and that's definitely
the case here with the oneplus 2 coming
in at $389 for the 64 gigabyte version
and even cheaper 329 dollars for the 16
gigabyte iteration
is more than enough reason to overlook
any flaws that the device might actually
have but we're going to reserve those
judgments for one we actually get to use
the review units throughout the weeks
that we are going to test it against
other phones like the LG g4 for things
like camera shoot us an even more so
make sure you stay tuned to Andhra
thority for even more on the oneplus 2
because we are your source for all
things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
