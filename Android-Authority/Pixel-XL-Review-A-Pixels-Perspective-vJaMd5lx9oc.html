guys it's long hear from Andrew forty
and as Josh Berg our from
authority what's going on everybody and
we've already given you our initial
review of the pixel XL but we wanted to
get lon in here to give us his
perspective as he has been using the
phone as well so instead of just
reiterating a lot of the stuff that we
already said in the initial review we
thought how about we just have a
discussion on this the Google pixel XL
in this final review
so I'm going to go ahead and address the
elephant in the room with a pixel
phone's design and a lot of people seem
really divided on the design right now
and a lot of people have been saying it
a lot of people have been thinking it
the pixel phones look like the iPhone
and whether you like this or not is
going to be a matter of perspective if
you're coming from the Nexus phones
which brought a really unique design to
the table each and every year you're
going to be a little bit disappointed
with the pixel phone's design now on the
flip side of that there's a lot of
people out there that really enjoy the
iPhones hardware but always wish that it
ran Google's software and if you wanted
an iPhone running Android this is the
best iPhone running Android you can buy
another part about the design is that it
looks really generic especially from the
front and a lot of that has to do with
the big bottom chin but not necessarily
the fact that it's a big chin but
because it feels like an empty voided
space it feels very underutilized
I know it's housing some very important
components but there could have been a
button on there or a speaker but instead
the speaker is actually on the bottom
and for a single bottom firing speaker
it actually sounds really good and gets
very loud but it definitely could have
benefitted from being on the front and
that might honestly be one of the only
problems that this phone has is the fact
that its design is so understated even
without the iPhone comparison the Google
pixel XL it just looks kind of generic
that can actually be a good thing for
the pixel mainly because you don't
necessarily assume a whole lot about the
phone and then when you turn on the
phone there's a lot of amazing that can
come out of this device on the other
hand however it's not flashy and not
that any phone has to be flashy but it
also has to be attractive the pixel XL
simply does not seem to be very
attractive to a lot of people and to us
yeah I do say bare-bones understated
generic and pretty much all of those
terms have been used by fans like
yourself so unfortunately for the pixel
XL it just isn't really going to be that
eye catching and unfortunately that
could be a detriment to what is
otherwise a very good phone
so with the display shows looking at a
5-inch 1080p panel on the regular pixel
and a 5.5 inch quad-hd panel on the
pixel XL both of them are Super AMOLED
and display on the pixel XL looks
absolutely fantastic it has excellent
colors great viewing angles and it gets
extremely bright that seeing it outdoors
especially on a sunny day like this is
not an issue whatsoever
and because it's Super AMOLED you get
those inky deep blacks and high contrast
ratio which makes it perfect for
watching movies playing games or
anything that you really want to do on
this phone it's great for it you won't
be disappointed and performance has been
very top-notch especially because of the
Snapdragon 820 1 which we already
alluded to in the initial review but the
thing is we're still dealing with pure
Android here and even though the
Snapdragon 820 one is supposed to be the
most powerful one out there pure Android
doesn't necessarily need too much to
provide a great experience it's up to
Google to make that feel the way it
should be and it definitely does there's
an attention to detail when it comes to
the transitions and all of the different
animations that definitely shows when
you're using this phone and it just
feels like the fastest version of
Android out there and keep in mind also
that Google's going to keep this version
of Android updated for the Google pixel
so that makes this already one of the
most reliable devices out there I even
did some gaming with recent apps and
games like the most recent release in
the Google Play Store don't starve and
it provided again a topmatch experience
rest assured that because of the
Snapdragon 801 but also because of
Android itself this is one of the most
reliable and smoothest experiences out
there now it's probably no surprise that
one of our main gripes with the pixel
phones is the lack of expandable storage
now with a 32 gigabyte base models of
either phone you might run out of space
consistently if you're doing 4k video
recording and taking a lot of pictures
and that has definitely been the case
for me over the last number of days
trying to use this as a vlogging machine
you can also use Google photos in order
to skirt some of that by using their
unlimited full resolution storage in the
cloud but even if you're using mobile
data to upload it it takes a long time
to upload 4k clips and that amount of
time could keep you from getting the
the way that I've sort of remedied this
is using a micro SD card reader that
plugs into the USB C port via OTG but
even then it takes up some time to
transfer all of those files over to the
SD card that I use in that reader you
can always get the 128 gigabyte version
of this phone but that's a lot of money
to put down and I honestly don't think a
lot of people out there will be willing
to put down that much money for that
much storage for me battery life has
been for the most part average maybe a
little bit lower on that spectrum
because I got three and a half hours to
four and a half hours of screen on time
now my usage could be different from
wands but I do GPS navigation I listen
to a lot of music and podcasts and I
also watch a lot of YouTube but with all
of that in mind we did use the Android
authority battery testing app on this
phone and using its most intensive test
which is a gaming test it got four hours
and 45 minutes now that kind of fits
squarely between lawn and I so that
makes this phone for the most part
average maybe slightly above average but
even then if you started to run out of
juice throughout your day which
shouldn't really be an issue then you
can always juice it up real quick using
the quick charging that is involved here
so with the cameras you have an 8
megapixel camera on the front and a 12
point three megapixel camera on the back
and it's crazy to think that Google has
gone from having some of the worst
cameras on a smartphone to having some
of the best cameras on a smartphone and
I would say the pixel phones are easily
in the top three when it comes to image
quality in daylight the images are very
sharp very well detailed and the camera
has excellent dynamic range especially
with that HDR plus mode it does a great
job of toning down the highlights and
the shadows without making the images
look unnatural or fake which is a
problem that some Android cameras tend
to have and the best part about the HDR
image processing is that it's actually
fast now whereas on the Nexus 6p it was
a little bit on the slow side now as the
Sun is coming down on me it's kind of
apropos that I'm going to talk about
low-light photography right now
low-light shots on the Google pixel XL
are still really grainy and they lack
the kind of stabilization that optical
image stabilization brings the is
doesn't really help in this situation so
the photos come out quite grainy and if
your hands are not all that steady you
could get a kind of blurry shot because
of the slower shutter speed that ends up
showing motion blur that said however
this does do a pretty good job in low
light compared to plenty of other
Android the different devices out there
especially given its larger pixel sizes
but of course video capabilities mean a
lot to me personally so on the pixel XL
I use this camera as my vlogging machine
for the last few days and it did a very
good job the stabilization is actually
really good but there are a couple of
things that you have to know about it
the e is on here kind of compensates for
general movements and maybe walking but
it won't be able to perform miracles if
you're running with the device the
reason why is because the camera uses
information from the gyroscope and if
the gyroscope is going haywire and going
all over the place it just won't be able
to keep up and what you end up getting
is video that is trying to search for
the place that it needs to be rather
than actually finding it
you also don't really get any manual
controls to cater the video to the
certain exposure or focus that you want
you have to rely on touch controls in
the rather simplistic application
one of the main gripes that I have here
is that holding the focus points takes a
very long time to finally lock and from
there you can always swipe up and down
in order to change the exposure
compensation which is fine but even then
getting to that point could take a while
after you try and locking the focus and
the exposure
of course with this being a Google made
device you're getting the latest version
of Android that Google has to offer with
Android 7.1 nougat and there's a lot of
great features that are on the pixel
phones and I'm going to go over some of
the main ones and then a couple of minor
ones that I think actually make a pretty
significant impact to the overall
experience first let's talk about the
biggest feature to the pixel phones and
that is Google assistant and Google
assistant is basically an improvement
upon Google now it's a lot smarter it's
much more conversational you can say a
lot more things to it you can joke with
it you can even ask it to read you a
poem if you want but you can still do
all the basic stuff like set a timer an
alarm hate calendar event check sport
scores the weather all the basic stuff
that you would expect it can still do
and it still has all the now on tap
features from before so it can still
analyze your screen and give you
information on what it sees but it's a
lot faster than now on tap which was
always really slow to load because of
that long animation Google assistant
pretty much loads up instantaneously and
it's not perfect but it's definitely a
huge step in the right direction and
overall it works extremely well next
let's talk about the pixel launcher so
the pixel launcher is exclusive to the
pixel phones at least for right now and
it brings a lot of changes you still
have the Google now home screen on the
leftmost home screen but to conduct a
search you just tap on the G logo in the
upper left corner and the app drawer is
now accessible with a swipe up from the
bottom which means there's no app drawer
icon anymore and this frees up an
additional space in your dock for
another app of your choice which is
awesome and the other big change here is
the app icons themselves they're all
circles now and it's not completely
consistent across the board
some of the apps still have their own
icons but it's a huge step in the right
direction and at least all the apps now
are all the same size there's a few
minor features in this new version of
Android but I actually think make a
pretty significant impact to the overall
user experience first Google has finally
added a reboot option after all these
years of refusing to add this feature it
is now baked into stock Android and it
was definitely long overdue
second there's a new long press feature
that is similar to Apple's 3d touch -
the 3d touch basically you long press on
an application and it will give you
access to certain functions without
actually having to open up the app the
last thing I want to mention with the
software is if you have the Verizon
version of the pixel it does come with a
few bloatware applications but all of
them can be easily uninstalled and I
wanted to make one final assertion that
Google assistant is a wonderful layer on
top of Android 7.1 if you haven't used
it in Google a low yet give it a try and
then remember that that is across all of
the Android interface inside of the
Google pixels imagine that kind of
functionality and I've been using it a
lot recently mainly for the daily
briefings which I think are a wonderful
addition and from there I also use it to
add calendar entries now doing add an
event is really easy because the Google
assistant asked me for each piece of
information one by one so nothing gets
left out now Google assistant may not be
the most conversational assistant but
you can find a middle ground if the way
that you say or ask something doesn't
work in the first place say it again in
such a way that it's what you would
probably type in a Google search box and
then after that it'll probably work so
you can find the middle ground or once
you get past that somewhat little bit
steep learning curve it becomes a pretty
invaluable tool especially because the
hot word works so well on this phone and
can wake the phone and just allow Google
assistant to appear immediately and you
just tell it what you need and it will
try its best to get to you so overall
the pixel phones are two very fantastic
smart phones and is a completely new
direction for Google if you want the
best that Google has to offer the pixel
phones are what you're getting for 2016
it really goes to show what Google is
capable of doing when they have control
of both the hardware and the software
that goes into their phones and I can
only imagine how much better it's going
to get from here but as of right now
it's already pretty good as always thank
you guys so much for watching this video
