Android authority and I'm here in New
York City at the Samsung event taking a
closer look at the cool new edge
features that could be found on the
galaxy s7 edge we have some videos
already here on android authority of the
galaxy s7 edge and galaxy s7 so we hope
you're enjoying those but let's just
take a closer look and focus on what's
new here on the galaxy s7 edges display
as we know last year the galaxy s6 edges
curved display was pretty much just for
aesthetics there really weren't many
features that took advantage of the
curved display and even this year we
would say a big reason for the s7 edges
curved display is pretty much just
because it looks cool but they're
actually really helpful and useful
features here samsung said they
recognize that the majority of users use
or try to use our phones one-handed and
it's important to access key features
while multitasking for example while
you're drinking some coffee and checking
the news and so here on the galaxy s7
edge when you're either on the home
screen or the lock screen you can swipe
on one of the sides of the curved screen
to bring up some edge features now last
year we were pretty much stuck to just
people's edge but this year on the s7
edge we have that and more as you can
see we have a little page indicator down
here because there are a lot of pages of
features we can swipe through you have
up to 9 of these little pages or panels
that Samsung calls them with four
different types of pages you can add so
let's start with apps edge where we can
access our favorite apps or most use
apps very quickly which can be very
useful you can also add more apps by
clicking on these little plus signs down
here this could save some time or even
promote less cluttered home screens
especially since you can add up to 10
apps here which is very nice so now we
can swipe again to the left and we'll be
greeted with another page and this one
is kind of similar but is more focused
on app actions this type of page is
called task edge so for example opening
the camera and taking a selfie or
opening a messaging app and creating a
conversation with a certain contact as
possible here and just like any of these
pages you'll always have a little
Settings icon in the corner where you
can add delete or create new shortcuts
this page is very simple but I can
imagine if you got into the habit of
using these and remembering they're
there you would save a lot of time once
again people edge returns which gives
you quick access to your favorite
contacts where you can easily give them
a call
now we have our last type of page which
doesn't really have a specific name but
essentially it's a widget page which is
very cool you can add long vertical
widgets to the edges of your screen
which once again is a way to keep your
homescreen from being cluttered and also
a way to skim news sports scores or
other articles one-handed for example
Yahoo News stocks sports scores
calendar reminders weather and even a
compass another cool widget you can add
is similar to the apps edge page except
you can choose which apps show in
certain locations of course you can
choose to rearrange these panels so
perhaps if you don't want apps edge to
be on panel one you can easily move it
to page four you can also simply disable
it to save room for other types of
panels now when you're within settings
for these pages you can dive a little
deeper and click on edge panel handle
settings and this is where you can
choose if you would like these shortcuts
to be accessible via the left curve or
right curve and even the exact position
from where it pulls out it will take
some extra testing to see if these are
going to be as helpful as Samsung says
but so far there's really no reason to
think otherwise I can definitely see
myself using some of these edge features
to either check things one-handed access
things faster or declutter my home
screen but what do you guys think of
these new edge features on the galaxy s7
edge leave a comment below and stay
tuned here at Android authority for more
coverage on the galaxy s7 and s7 edge
