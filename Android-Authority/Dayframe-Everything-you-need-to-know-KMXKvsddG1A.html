handy the Android authority app guy and
in this video we're going to be taking a
look at de frame de frame is a photo
frame application brought to you by the
same people who did HD widgets it's
pretty unique so let's check it out so
how does this app work it's really very
simple it's a combination photo browser
screensaver and photo slideshow
application that weaves beautiful
pictures on your Android device screen
when you're not using it it does this by
pulling photos off a variety of social
networks including Flickr Picasa or
Google Plus Facebook Dropbox Instagram
and other popular sites when you use
this app it'll show a photo slide it
around for a moment and then transition
to the next one what makes it unique are
the behind-the-scenes settings you can
sign in to a number of services to pull
your own personal photos or if you've
had enough of those you can choose a
number of categories which will populate
your feed with photos from others from
there you can set a timer that will play
the streams as a screensaver when you're
not using your phone interact with the
slideshow in a variety of different ways
or ignore all the social networking
nonsense and just enjoy the photos it's
your choice
the last thing we'll talk about in terms
of functionality is the settings you can
customize it to run only when you want
it to between the timer function the
bandwidth settings the battery settings
and others the stream will only go when
you want them to and that's pretty nifty
in terms of sheer usage this app is all
about making your device interesting
even when you're not using it you can
use this to turn your app into a digital
picture frame if you can think of a
reason or a place to have a digital
picture frame then you can include it
into the large number of reasons to have
an application like this one some uses
that the developer include are using it
at events to show off pictures using it
as a screen saver as a digital picture
frame for your desk or table and others
it's a very simple application but you
have to get creative if you want to use
it for more than the obvious reasons so
here's what we liked first the
simplicity you simply sign in to your
accounts pick a few categories of things
you like and go the settings photo feeds
and other various functions are easy to
find and used in the left and right side
pullout menus it is not difficult
learning how to use this app the built
in categories have a lot of interesting
feeds for you this is a great way to
view photos of things you may not have
otherwise have stumbled upon on your own
it's very well done the moving photo is
the option for social integration the
transition effects and everything put
together make for a high-functioning and
visually appealing app
we like that not all the pictures are
simply one-off pictures that people post
you'll see thumbnail images from link
sharing as well so you may actually find
some good stuff to read this way without
the tedious scrolling through social
networking apps once it's set up it does
all the work on its own which is awesome
and finally the developers have been
amazingly responsive to consumer
critiques so far and new features are
already being worked out in response to
them and here's what we didn't like so
much some of the pictures especially
link shares come up very low-quality
sometimes it doesn't happen often but
when it does it just looks bad a few
people have said that the scrolling
pictures are distracting it's one of our
favorite features but we can see why
people who don't need more distraction
don't like them thankfully the
developers have said that turning off
animations will be a feature soon
according to the developers daydream
integration was turned off on purpose
they had a good reason and that daydream
causes the app to run all night long and
the timer function prevents this however
they have expressed that they may be
turning it back on as well at the end of
the day this application is a huge step
forward in the photo slideshow space it
has a great user interface great options
and it's a fun way to give your device
something to do when it doesn't have
anything else to do if you include the
upcoming features like transition
options daydream support and if it ever
becomes enabled chromecast support date
frame will have a feature set that will
be tough for any future developer to top
it really is the photo frame app we've
all been hoping for so if you haven't
yet give it a shot
