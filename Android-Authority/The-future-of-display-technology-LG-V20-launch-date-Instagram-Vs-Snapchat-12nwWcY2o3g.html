I really hope so and here's why me
mountain view-based Keeks oh and yes
it's pronounced cake so I checked and
they developed the software to enhance
existing Hardware on your displays that
means that these gestures work on
displays on current devices and don't
require expensive upgrades or any brand
new technology that alone is a big deal
for manufacturers and of course for us
users too but it's the awesomeness of
the tools themselves that really make
touch tools stand out touch tools use a
range of natural gestures typically
related to how you would actually use an
object in real life the software layer
recognizes the touchscreen gesture and
brings up the relevant on-screen tool
tools include things as handy as a ruler
or tape measure magnifying glass or a
camera and even a mouse or a racer it's
pretty crazy to watch mostly because it
works so well and it looks like the
on-screen element is actually in the
users hands now I got to talk about this
this makes me just stupid giddy with
excitement because I spend many hours a
week editing video editing right on a
keyboard and a mouse and most of the
time when video editing tools have come
on a tablet it's kind of gimmicky
because it's it's okay but it doesn't
really allow you the granular detailed
control that you get with a keyboard and
mouse but this I would no longer be an
editor I'd be a sculptor that is awesome
that is so exciting what do you guys
think let me know what are the use case
scenarios that you can see for this
awesome tool now LG fans will be happy
to know that the lgb 20 will launch on
September 6th in san francisco now the
taglines of the event are quote the
second story begins LGV 20 and simply
play more but they don't give much
information about the actual device the
playful theme matches the tone of LG g
5s launch campaign though it doesn't
necessarily mean there will be any
similarities between the two phones LG
revealed that the v 20 will sport two
signature features of its predecessor
the dual selfie camera and the dual
screen what
more important is that the v20 will be
the first smartphone to run android
seven point o nougat right out of the
box Google is typically earmark dishonor
for its own Nexus line so winning the
first nougat phone is a real coup for LG
and the stakes are high because LG's
mobile unit is bleeding money at the
moment following the poor reception of
the LG g5 the v20 could be LG saving
grace for 2016 is there hope what do you
think now let's talk about how Instagram
stoled stories from snapchat or did they
stories on Instagram just launched
earlier last week essentially they
create a set of moments that will appear
in a slideshow format just like snapchat
stories which can be viewed by your
followers for up to 24 hours just like
snapchat stories which will then
disappear without remaining on your
permanent profile all together now just
like snapchat stories Instagram claims
that they did this to discourage people
from over posting now you don't have to
worry about spamming all your followers
you can post all your Thai food and cat
selfies into one story and keep on
truckin Instagram is also giving you the
ability to natively add text stickers
and drawings to your photos in your
story just like snapchat well maybe
you're now one of those people who don't

point something out that i have talked
about in the past but i do want to talk
about again after reading some of the
comments from a couple weeks ago anytime

ad for a show or i have been paid in any
way to talk about a product i am going
to tell you that that is a sponsorship

ad
