brought to you by the LG g3 hey what is
going on guys lon here from Android
Authority and today we're taking a look
at the quick circle folio case and how
you can use it to wirelessly charge your
LG g3 so here is the quick circle folio
case for the g3 and we already know by
now that it's a very slim case but it
does a lot more than simply giving your
g3 protection with the quick circle
folio case not only does it
automatically wake up your phone when
opened
but the unique circular window displays
a clock and gives you quick access by a
simple swipe to the music player call
log camera
LG's fitness app and messaging all
without having to open up the case
itself but one thing you might not know
is that there is a version of the quick
circle case that gives your LG g3
wireless charging capabilities it also
comes in a Power Mac compliant model and
a Qi compliant model so you'll want to
pick up the one that is compatible with
your wireless charger I'm using the Qi
compliant version of the quick circle
case so I'll be using a Qi wireless
charger this particular one is LG's own
w CD 100 wireless charger but you can
use any chi or power mat wireless
charger of your choice to wirelessly
charge your g3 just make sure your
wireless charger is connected grab your
LG g3 place it on the charger and it
should automatically start charging it's
super simple easy and convenient all at
the same time but that is it that is how
you wirelessly charge your LG g3 using
the quick circle folio case hopefully
