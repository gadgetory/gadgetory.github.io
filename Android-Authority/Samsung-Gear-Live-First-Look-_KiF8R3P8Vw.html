what's going on everybody and Here I am
with the Samsung gear live now we're
gonna give you your first look on here
just like with the Moto 360 we are
looking at devices that are currently in
demo mode and that means we won't be
able to get a great look at the
operating system we will get a look at
some of the basic functionality of some
of the things that they obviously want
to be able to show us but for the most
part I figured you know what we're going
to have the the LG G watch tomorrow when
I get my hands on it so I might will
show you an in-depth look at the
operating system on Android wear when I
get that but before we even get into the
operating system here is the actual
device itself now one thing I do love
about this is it does have the look of a
gear 2 neo or rather gear neo but it
does retain a look that is very much
like the gear yet has the clasp or
rather the band of the Samsung gear Finn
I think that's a great idea the gear fit
had a very very easy to use class system
as right here and you'll be able to
easily just sort of put it on by doing
that right there and we don't have a
camera on here again this is more like
the Neo than the gear 2
we do have a button on the side that
will go straight to the watch faces and
whatnot and everything will be there so
I'm pressing it right now and of course
if you look on the back right there we
have a heart rate monitor now the heart
rate monitor is something that you're
going to see in a lot of Samsung devices
these days and the gear live made with
Android wear by Android wear is gonna be
no exception so let me go ahead and
throw this on real quick please excuse
my my wristband that I have on right now
that's for the after-hours party that is
happening later today and
go ahead and easily just clasp this
right onto my wrist it's very maybe I'm
putting it too tight there you go and
there you go so what we have here is the
actual device itself with the screen we
do have a pretty sizable bezel on the
around the screen but that's not too bad
it actually doesn't look that bad on my
wrist the way the gears did this a
little bit bigger than your in your
usual watch but then again so was the
Moto 360 and I give I give the gear live
some some good some good points in terms
of its design because it's actually not
too bad
the other thing too is these risks these
bands right here can be removed in order
for you to put on a standard wrist watch
band that you would might want to do
harder to have a little bit of
customization so we'll go ahead and just
press on the home button right there and
here is the first watch face that has
available I can always go through and
here is the oops that's head over here
there is a notification on here let me
just unmute it if you bring down from
the top you'll get the date and you also
get an ability to mute the phone along
with your current battery life so I've
mute unmutes right there so here is the
first notification that I have on here I
didn't have I was a I actually dismissed
the text notification that was there so
what we have here is the weather so
weather in London right here looking to
the right and we have the next four days
so we have a five-day forecast right
there
having done - the pedometer area we do
have the pedometer that we'll be able to
tell you how many steps that you have
walked on this particular day
and of course the notification for
getting home and also the flight
information this is all information that
like that comes from pretty much Google
now so be able to use all the
information from there in order to get
that to get to what you need and then in
and then on here what we have is a music
player if you swipe to the right you'll
be able to change the track to go next
or go previous so that's what you have
there players on one screen next and
previous or on the next couple ones from
there and finally a calendar entry right
here that I just dismissed and from
there that's what we have so if we were
to head over here obviously you'll be
able to have voice-activated searches
and will not be able to say something
like ok Google and there you go it comes
up right away and go straight to this
particular area just sit in a reminder
by time and location as a sense right
there as this is a demo mode and there
you go that's pretty much that pretty
much does it for this at least demo
portion of the gear live now yes the
gear live will be available starting
today and you will be able to get your
hands on it pretty easily at the Google
Play Store and the Moto 360 along with
the LG G watch artists competition as
they are the first three devices to come
with Android wear as their operating
system so that is the Samsung gear live

put up one about the Moto 360 and then
tomorrow when I get my hands on my LG G
watch I'll give you an in-depth review

the operating system so keep it tuned
