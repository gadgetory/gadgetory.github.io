authority I'm doing quick hands-on look
at the Nubia z17 this is the company's
flagship phone it was announced back in
June's available in China right now and
the first thing that really strikes me
is the design it's a substantial looking
phone it has a good amount of weight
it's all metal if a premium handset
every facet and unlike its predecessor
the z17 benefits now with having a
water-resistant construction there's
very minimal bezels on the left and
right sides which is nice and the
overall build quality of the phone is
top-notch so if you guys look at the
spec sheet of the new BSD 17 it's pretty
much in flagship territory except for
one area and that's the resolution of
the screen it's only 1080p which is
unfortunate it features a 5.5 inch IPS
LCD display but at 1080p resolution it's
behind the competition which offer at
least quad HD resolution now it's not
that bad because it's the more detail
and there's a lot of good qualities with
it
but it is a striking thing going back to
the flagship caliber level the new BSD
17 features things you'd expect you have
a fingerprint sensor there's the Dolby
Atmos enhanced speakers as a USB type-c
features up snap attractive deep 35
staggering 60 bytes of RAM and 64
gigabytes of internal storage of course
the Snapdragon t35 is a beast it makes
the phone fly it looks very smooth but
there's two things that we have to point
out with the an set first of all it
doesn't have a 3 and 1/2 millimeter
headset jack and there is no expansion
via microSD card another thing I want to
talk back here is the software now it's
technically running Android 7.1.1 nougat
but when you look into the actual
software there is no Google Play Store
now I did manage to install an apk of
the file but unfortunately you can't run
it so you're stuck with all the native
apps and because it's made for the
Chinese market you're going to have all
this other bloke we're from Nubia that
you're probably not going to use
and the only way to get those google
apps or even the Google Playstore is to
root the phone the last thing I want to
talk about here is the camera in the new
BSD 17 it's pretty impressive it
features a dual camera system much like
the Huawei p10 and the LG G 6 but it's
more in line to the P 10 where achieves
that portrait mode so if you're taking a
lot of portrait shots it's going to do
that really nice bokeh effect and I
check it out for a little bit it looks
really nice does a great job of finding
the borders and outlines and cast that
out-of-focus effect really well now the
dual camera system breaks down to a 23
megapixel camera and a 12 megapixel
combination and like I said it'll choose
those blurry backgrounds when you factor
in expect sheathe the premium design it
makes perfect sense why it's classified
as very flagship it starts at $410 for
the base model that's the model with 6
gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of
internal storage and that by itself is
undercutting the competition let's say
versus the s8 or even the g6 but since
it's only available in China its reach
is going to be limited and it's not for
everyone
unless you know how to route the phone
or you plan on going that route you're
probably better off investing that money
in something else but then again if you
want to try and do that
go right ahead so if you guys won't
learn more about the unit yet
