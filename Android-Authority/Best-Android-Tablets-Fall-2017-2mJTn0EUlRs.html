tablets morphed into part phone part
tablet into the phablet flagship error
that we're currently in but if you're
like me and you want your phone to be
your phone and your tablet to be your
tablet your spunk and if you're looking
for the highest end tablet look no
further than the Samsung Galaxy Tab s3
one of the best tablets you can buy
right now the Galaxy Tab s 3 sports an
HDR enabled Super AMOLED display quad
speakers for stereo audio and a battery
that recharges very quickly making it a
true multimedia powerhouse not only that
the tab f3 also comes with an S Pen
that's perfect for taking notes and even
drawing oh and it is gorgeous too it's
designed with these Samsung Galaxy
smartphones in mind with glass services
on the front and back complete with an
all metal frame around the edges there's
no denying the premium aspect at play
here one that's further accentuated by
its spelt chassis and lightweight feel
all of this of course comes to justify a
more premium price point for this Galaxy
Tab s 3 you're looking at about 600
bucks u.s. now let's talk about Google's
pixel see Mother Google surprised many
of us at its 2015 Nexus event wooden
unveiled the pixel see an in-house built
tablet that's made for productivity
while it may be a tad bit overpriced a
pixel see does a lot right it comes with
a big 10.2 inch display a large battery
and 7.1 nougat all powered by Nvidia's
Tegra x1 processor and three gigabytes
of RAM there's quite a few decent
official accessories available for the
tablet like the official keyboard and
folio keyboard so if you're one of those
people who really value a vanilla
Android experience this may be worth the
price next up let's talk about the
Nvidia shield tablet k1 the direct
successor to the original shield tablet
the specs and design are pretty much the
same with both tablets aside from the
addition of a rubberized surface next to
the speakers and brush metal lettering
on the back of the k1 Nvidia also
removed the stylus holder on the k1
which brings us to our next point the
stylus is gone
or the charging cable and wall adapter
the big news here is that Nvidia is
trying to cut costs and they did this by
not including a stylus or charger with
that said the tablet is now only 200
bones which makes it not only one of the
best tablets out there but also one of
the best bang for your buck options and
last up let's talk about hallways media
pad m3 with its compact yet sizable 8.4
inch display long lasting battery and
dual Harman Kardon speakers this tablets
name says it all from youtube videos to
movies this is one of the best options
out there if you're looking for a tablet
on which to consume media even though we
found gaming to be somewhat choppy at
times it is capable of playing high-end
3d games with few issues now I just
looked on Amazon and saw that the device
is currently going for 687 dollars u.s.
that's pretty high for this device but
it is pretty nice it is well equipped
it's just not as affordable as one might
hope coming from hallway now that price
is going to fluctuate so please search
and find your best deals for all these
options but what do you think of my list
let me know in the comments below and on
twitter verse yes I know there are other
good tablet options out there that
aren't on my list but you gotta cut it
off somewhere now my audience is smart
so smart that sometimes you're inspired
by a business idea and then you try and
get the name of that business in a
domain name and your next prospective
customer is searching your business name
and they assume you have the dot-com and
if you don't you're giving your business
away to the one who does that's the
power of accom now why is that exactly
well no domain name extension tells your
story with the same degree of trust as a
dot-com or dotnet domain name.com and
dotnet domain name extensions and jet
credibility and your online presence and
who doesn't want to be credible and
don't forget you get 15% off when you
