many budget smartphones available from a
wide variety of manufacturers although
the world wide budget smartphone market
is pretty competitive many of the phones
intended for worldwide markets do not
fully support US carriers manufacturers
have found it difficult to enter the US
market with budget smartphones due to
the low cost of subsidized on contract
phones this has left a void in terms of
what you can officially buy for under
$200 in the u.s. Huawei is trying to
fill this void with the huawei snap to a
180 dollar smartphone with support for
both AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile 4G LTE so is the
snap - worth your budget smartphone
buying buck this is Bailey Stein with
Android authority and this is my full
review of the huawei snap - when it
comes to design the snap - takes a
fairly simplistic approach the device is
made completely a matte plastic and the
rear cover has a leather-like texturize
finish the finish does make the phone
feel pretty nice in the hand for a
budget device the edges taper ever so
slightly and the leather finish makes
this transition to smooth plastic the
glossy plastic wrapping around the edges
of the display looks nice and goes well
with the smooth edges both the power and
volume buttons are on the right side of
the phone and have a similar glossy
finish both buttons are responsive but
don't feel incredibly satisfying the
five megapixel rear camera is positioned
towards the top right on the back of the
phone right above the flash the Huawei
logo appears at the center and the
speaker is on the bottom left the
microUSB port is on the bottom right of
the phone next to the device's primary
microphone bad phone jack is at the top
center slightly to the right and the
secondary microphone is on the left on
the front of the phone you can see a bit
of Huawei branding on the bottom chin
and a two megapixel front-facing camera
at the top right there is a notification
LED at the top left corner which I
really appreciate it there does seem to
be a considerable amount of bezel
especially considering that the phone
uses on-screen buttons and 9.14
millimeters it is on the slightly
thicker side that's also an average 150
grams taking off the rear cover you'll
find a single Micro SIM slot and micro
SD card slot you can expand the device's
eight gigabytes of internal storage by
using a mic rest
the card up to 64 gigabytes
unfortunately you can't access the 2200
milliamp battery
there's nothing all that special about
the design and it's clear that Huawei
has instead focused on the device's
internals rather than its design that's
not necessarily a bad thing but if
you're looking for something more
aesthetically pleasing you'll likely be
disappointed the snap 2 is 5 inch 720p
display looks ok but there is a lack of
contrast and the viewing angles are not
very good once you hit about 45 degrees
the brightness and quality drops
significantly sunlight readability also
is not very good as I had trouble
reading text fall outdoors it's also
kind of a fingerprint magnet despite my
best efforts to keep the display free of
smudges it's still managed to collect
fingerprints with a quad-core Snapdragon
400 processor clocked at 1.2 gigahertz
in just one gig of ram the phone does
feel a bit sluggish when it comes to
everyday performance the benchmark
scores accurately reflect the actual
performance of the device as the phone
scored eight seventeen thousand nine
hundred and fifty-one and then two two
and three forty three single core 1150
multi-core and Geekbench the phone is
certainly usable but it's slow to the
point where the slowness is not only
noticeable but also sometimes annoying
for example the preloaded Google
keyboard really kept up with what I was
typing when doing simple tasks like
composing text messages this is an
incredibly frustrating issue that is
annoying and inconvenient there were
also times when I would open an app and
then go back to the launcher to find
that the system removed it from memory
this caused about a two to three second
delay for all of my app icons to
reappear the one gigabyte of ram really
does hinder the performance when opening
more than a couple of apps the Adreno
305 GPU performs well while playing
games over a graphic intensive games
like asphalt 8 had lower frame rates and
the occasional stutter what says the
Huawei snaps you apart from similarly
priced devices is it support for gsm 4G
LTE networks in the United States the
snap to supports quad-band GSM 850 1900
2100 AWS for HSPA+ and LTE bands 2 4 5
17 and 12 this means that the phone
supports up to 4G LTE on all GSM carrier
in the United States including AT&amp;amp;T
t-mobile and they're respectable
MVNOs the snap-to also has the usual GPS
802 11 and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0
support the rear speaker on the snap -
sounds pretty good actually
I wasn't expecting much out of a budget
device but I was pleasantly surprised to
find good sounding audio the speaker is
fairly loud and it isn't as distorted as
some other budget devices one drawback
of the position is that it's easily
blocked when set on a flat surface the
five megapixel rear camera on the Huawei
snap 2 did not perform well one of the
key features of the snap 2 is the
ability to press the volume down key
twice to take a picture this is a really
handy feature but the camera itself is a
very good the pictures they took were
consistently out of focus and lacked
sharpness the camera app is easy to use
with a few different shooting modes to
choose from you can manually adjust
white balance and iso battery life on
the snap to was surprisingly great
although the battery is just 2200
milliamps battery life is incredible my
day starts at 7 a.m. and ends at 1 a.m.
the next day I had no trouble getting
the phone to last through a full day of
use and then some it's not that I wasn't
using the phone during that time either
as I was able to get in just under five
and a half hours of screen on time
battery life is definitely a strong
point of a snap - and I did appreciate
the power saving modes in the system
settings you can set it to normal smart
or endurance they said how long you want
the phone to last the huawei snap 2 runs
Android 4.4.4 kitkat with Huawei's
emotion UI 2.3 it's not too far of a
departure from stock Android but while I
did make a few notable changes the
pre-installed launcher does not have an
app drawer which may annoy some users
you can always download a third-party
launcher like the Google now launcher if
you wish the notification shade also
looks kind of ugly in my opinion
although I do think that putting the
quick toggles at the top instead of on a
separate panel was a good choice
the app icons don't look very good
either and the icons used for setting
items continue this trend while they did
ship the phone with the actual Google
keyboard though not just the AOSP
keyboard but they actually
Google keyboard this is nice because you
can now change the theme to material
light or material dark in the settings
which is what I prefer the recent app
switcher is pretty similar to the stock
app switcher although Huawei has added
individual closed buttons and a one
touch clean button the lockscreen may
not be visually desirable but it does
let users swipe for phone messaging or
camera you can also quickly swipe up to
open tools including calendar calculator
flashlight and clock that's nice and all
but I still prefer being able to see my
notifications quickly and easily so I
installed a see display which sort of
emulates the Motorola active launcher I
did really enjoy the ability to change
each volume profile by pressing the
setting button after adjusting the
volume I really wish that every Android
phone had this feature as it's extremely
annoying to have to go into the system
settings on other devices there are a
few pre-installed apps that come with
the huawei snap 2 but it's not bad and
you do have to keep in mind that you'll
be free of any carrier bloatware while Y
does give users the options to use a
simple home screen mode if you prefer to
have a cleaner looking launcher I did
really enjoy the ability to disable apps
from running when the screen is off I
think this helps with battery life quite
a bit finally there is a notification
manager so you can change which apps can
send you notifications this is again a
really great feature that I'm glad
Huawei brought to Android 4.4 the
ability to turn out that annoying game
that keeps sending you reminders to play
is great on the downside I wasn't very
happy with the default notification
sound or should I say music whenever I
received a notification from apps like
snapchat or Gmail the phone would play a
song
I think that's kind of excessive and I'm
very confused as to why this would be
the default setting I see how some users
may appreciate the option to have the
phone play a one-minute song for their
occasional text messages but for someone
who receives notifications quite
frequently
it's got annoying really quickly luckily
you can change this in the settings you
can pick up the huawei snap shoe in
black or white with a gigabytes of
internal storage for one hundred and
eighty dollars out of Amazon or get
huawei comm that's a pretty good price
but I'm afraid that there may be better
options available for many users while
the snap 2 does have some strong selling
points like LTE support a good sounding
speaker and incredible battery life I
don't think that this is a good choice
for the average user buying a budget
smartphone officially with LTE support
in the u.s. is great but you really have
to ask yourself whether you're willing
to give up a lot of what makes a smart
phone good the snap choose display
performance and camera are all pretty
disappointing and that makes the phone a
tough sell but simply there are
similarly priced options like the Moto G
2nd generation and Asus zenfone 2 there
are just much better phones overall
that's not to say that there isn't a
market for the huawei snap 2 but I want
to recommend it over the above-mentioned
devices thank you for watching this
