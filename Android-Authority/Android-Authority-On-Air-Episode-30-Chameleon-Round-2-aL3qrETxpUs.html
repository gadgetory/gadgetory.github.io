original hangout show for android on
google+ I'm dare cross not a Scot
Anderson this week we are joined by
returning guests John Franklin as well
as film enthusiasts from technician the
company the mastermind behind chameleon
launcher welcome guys glad to have you
again some thangs so Scott what's on the
agenda this week besides chameleon well
we're really talking about some Android
ecosystem news some app updates that
added a lot of functionality over this
long week where we go over a chameleon
launcher and some new updates and some
feature stuff and then we're going to go
over some new and rumored devices
Android devices we're going to be going
over updates for jelly bean ice cream
sandwich we're doing some little bit of
rooted ramen and then Pat whores and
some carrier news you know i like i like
reading interop we're gonna hold off on
that so let's talk about some android
news real quick Google Play continues to
grow the Play Store is still growing
sitting massive they're adding content
all the time and this past week they
added over 600 titles for movies in the
TV shows so if you're the family guy who
is in the family guy a modern family
prometheus and so forth content like
that you can now put that on the Play
Store prometheus actually it's not due
on blu ray/dvd for heather for about
three weeks you can go and get that
right now for was it 1499 HD on the Play
Store so thank you if you're into alien
there Balian blind prometheus is a
pretty good movie asst and you can get
it before any of your friends can on
blu-ray right now yeah I'd be curious to
see if google continues to offer things
like this you know pretty odd DVD and
blu-ray release you're not you know what
not to say that I obtain movies de
legally that's bad but if I did this
might make a person that does that you
know move from the illegal way of
getting movies to paying for them
because
I mean high quality movie you're not you
have to wait six months for to show off
in some online store you're getting it
actually three weeks before you can buy
in a retail that's amazing that's what
we need at Ryerson really as a service
problem yeah yeah it piracy is filling
filling that service problem so I think
that I think this is a good move i'm
happy i didn't buy it yet i guess i
should practice what I preach but but I
uh I am going to do it um speaking of
google play the nexus 7 25 dollar credit
that you got off because everybody has
nexus 7 right well that that $25 credit
that you got there canceling that
promotion promotion is ending in just a
few days on sep tember 30th it's going
away so if you're on the fence about
buying a nexus 7 you might want to do it
very very very soon because that $25
credits going away and if you think
about it you spend in 200 bucks in the
device or 250 depending on 16 gig or
eight gig and you're getting twenty-five
dollars off of that products basically
because they're giving 25 bucks to buy
apps games movies Prometheus you know
they're giving you a lot free money that
you're going to spend anyways chances
are so you're really you know it that's
really bringing the cost of the vice
down to 175 dollars or to $25 as well as
a whole bunch other stuff to bring the
cost down but we don't need to get in
the neck all the nexus 7 any creating so
use it you use it if you have it um and
said if you're on the fence about buying
it you should you should definitely buy
it soon but if you do have them the
money the money isn't going away it's
going to stay there till next June I
believe june thirtieth so you know that
that money is still yours to keep
they're not taking it away or just
stopping the ability for new people new
purchases to get that money hope it
didn't make that confusing um this week
android police posted an article saying
all the different things that were wrong
with stock jelly bean and lead android
designer
matias duarte said he saw it and he said
you know what you're right android is
about a third of the way there where I
want it to be there's a lot of work left
to do okay back to work so I saw what he
did from gingerbread ice cream sandwich
and that was amazing and you know and
you think you really could get a whole
lot better right and then you see from
ice cream sandwich to jelly bean or at
least you know two percent of population
sees that so far so so I me and that's a
mammy not see that's even amazing tiny
little tweaks here and there and a
little bit of polish here and there all
that butter that's amazing so this guy
is what he's talking about he was what
he's doing and if it's only a third of
the way there in his mind wow are we in
for some some major changes over the
next two years or less over the next
year I mean I'm excited a couple months
when chance you know fingers crossed
confidence high when key lime pie comes
out I mean what is this guy gonna do for
us then more butter more he didn't
mention that he did say that even it
wasn't just you I but also
responsiveness he said he was about a
third of the way where he wanted to be
but you never even more responsive I
mean you can't ever improve on anything
if you're going to be an apologist for
the operating system it should always be
in a state where you think everything
could we get better you should pursue
perfection so I'm sure I feel as a
developer probably appreciate that
always trying to make things better
bigger better faster absolutely it's
never good enough you know like love
your baby but it's never good enough
they can always be better there's always
that next feature you know exactly
exactly Oh lastly with the Android news
here this past week the IDC the research
firm that releases quarterly information
on the mobile market they released their
numbers stating that Android has a
massive sixty-eight percent of the
global market share for the past quarter
iOS sorry Phil iOS is only rocking
seventeen percent out of that and now
you're a little bit of a nihilist fan
not rely me where I love them both I've
got I us I've got android chameleons
really made Android sort of my go-to
device with my nexus 7 which I love and
you should pick it up before that $25
expires you don't have it already yeah
you know and for four times that no
that's nuts I'm sorry that that's
amazing that name sixty-eight percent
compared to seventeen percent I I didn't
know that it was that time so I mean
yeah you could say people were holding
out for the iphone five that's why they
didn't buy phones the past quarter which
is probably true and that could have
brought the numbers up or down we'll see
you here in a three months with this
quarter is but I bet Android still going
to be killing on top also there is a
countries that Iowa is not offered in so
yeah that's kind of a stickler with that
lot i relate to the deadly to the party
in a lot of countries too and they just
don't offer any you know it's one thing
if you started out on iOS and you got
tired of that ecosystem it's another
thing when you bring a phone that
doesn't have any more of a feature set
late to the party yeah very true anjali
feliciano i just saw your comment about
root and ramen noodles yes that's
actually what our segment is about we go
over favorite flavors of element noodles
root is apparently one of them written
ramen noodles that's great we're gonna
start calling it now yeah I so let's
move on to some app updates first and
notably best in my perspective is Google
Maps got updated to version 6.1 to
basically this brings desktop sinking in
history across all connected devices
including navigation history of where
you search to go and where you've
navigated to and from and there's also a
new way to zoom which is very handy
basically what you do is you double tap
on the screen or the map and you swipe
up or swipe down and it's very
convenient and it's better than that
plus or minus in the bottom right hand
corner of the screen you guys think it's
a good feature the zoo um no I'm not
coordinated enough to parently do with
one hand um I work
right I normally pinch to zoom in spin
and pinch to zoom all at the same time
uh I never used a plus or minus to zoom
ever I didn't know I was there oh yeah
the labs yeah I always pinching I always
pinch-to-zoom me obviously I'm using two
hands right so I got my one hand holding
other hints at your pension and
summative do and all that good stuff um
yeah I tried the whole one fingered zoom
and either I don't understand how could
be a different function but it just
seems it just seems like it's laggy
doing it with one finger maybe me
personally with it might be the wrong
sir I don't know um rome's don't do
anything bad ah um buzzer camera crashes
when you open it it might have something
to do with me having my setcpu settings
up high when Google Maps is running that
like on the phone here you're not
tweaking your CPU I got lost up tweak
time for anything out this guy a month
ago didn't even know a root man he isn't
he's doing custom roms and kernels and
tweet lat ye you are a force to be
reckoned with you know that's me it's
extremely useful naps is a pretty
intensive programming I need a ramp ramp
both my clock speed wrap it up random
but it seems faster but awesome upgrades
also moving on to the next let's talk
about maps here just real quick since
you you happen to mention yep an image
is Google Maps let's just let's just
talk about that since it's in the news
to dance all over the Internet so
apparently I haven't seen any memes
related to that turning point did you
guys happen to see that image that
android authority shared earlier today
uh we're apparently some poor guy
decided to use iOS iOS 6 to drive this
car to his buddy's house Ron upon in top
on top of the tree Wow in England
there's a heading into somewhere I saw
it image of someone saying you know if
you upgrade to iOS 6 we have local paper
maps here free videos available in the
booking office yes so basically what's
going on all over the news is people are
griping about iOS 6 and
maps they ditched the goog in a lot of
people were pissed to put to me but one
it's horrible from what I'm reading I
don't know Phil how is it buddy have you
tried it I upgraded to iOS 6 last night
and it hasn't been the best experience
so far I like the maps like they're nice
when they work you know they're pretty
good it's nice to have turn by turn but
people are having a lot of problems with
it it's early could be better i had a
great time looking at Big Ben in 3d ok
power but that's really the most I've
use it but but could you find Big Ben if
you had to go that's the thing you know
what it I think that I think they got
London down it's like or some more
obscure locations they don't quite have
there's like towels are missing and now
in buildings are like I got gas stations
apparently located on top of like a
skyscraper you know yeah there's stuff
like that well I will say this the first
thing I did after updating and seeing
the new maps app was trying to find a
Google Maps iOS app to download and I
couldn't find one yeah contended did say
they did say they were working on one so
I don't know if it gets approved didn't
even get to certainly a market for one
right now well yeah I mean if you have
your desktop and it saves everything
from it's crazy I mean the
synchronization between maps and the
fact that you have an online cloud-based
desktop tablet whatever Apple doesn't
have that they don't have street view as
well they don't have the raw data that
Google has and the traffic the traffic
data or animal transit stations are
awake one in their defense is thinking
with version one maybe the next time
around gas stations and airports won't
be located on top of buildings you know
so let's get this biscuit yeah maybe but
let's get back talking a little bit but
I enjoyed so what's the next athlete
good updates guy well the next app is a
SoundCloud some of you might be
listening to us on soundcloud we are on
soundcloud and it got updated basically
it adds some new offline editing tools
basically you can trim a track you can
fade in fade out effects
also you can pause and resume audio
recording so if you're listening to
somebody talk or a speech you can then
stop it pause it and then continue
recording and it will create a new file
it'll create it'll add on to that
additional file which is very nice I
think in the usability front also I know
that we're on google+ but uh facebook is
trying some new things they or their
stock is following and they have to try
some new things so they had some huge
improvements to facebook Messenger they
had some an option for some people
although we don't know how to get it but
that you can do some SMS through the
facebook Messenger app which is kind of
interesting um integrating an
almost-dead technology is pretty cool
they are also testing their mobile ad
network you know Google Plus has no ads
well facebook is testing mobile ads
because they have to get at revenue and
one of my people that I work with I saw
an atom written in the middle of the
stream and it's invasive and bake yeah
I'm almost done right now I wouldn't
like and had in the middle of my mobile
stream just because that's something
weren't accustomed to not seen you know
I mean I understand people need to make
money but that that's a huge change
that's not just a subtle change if it
was extremely relevant to me and my
location like in Google now I wouldn't
mind it yes you know here you're at this
coffee shop and they're done day one you
know uh here's five dollars off the rest
here I think for advertisements even be
effective they have to be kind of
contextual you're not going to sell
somebody something in this situation
where they want to if they're scrolling
through a stream trying to see what
their mom said today or how they're you
know whatever they're not in the mode to
want to buy something but if you're
searching for something and actually
looking for something that's the point
that you're going to respond to an
advertisement a lot of times if you look
on google search the official website
for the you know what you're searching
for will be the advertised
and that can understand making money
like that because you're giving them
something when it's actually useful yeah
another thing that Facebook is
experimenting with you know that feature
that google plus has had around for the
robo lap to automatically upload your
pictures months since danger zone from
the beginning yeah so thats little
feature that we know when love on
facebook is working on that type of same
picture a feature with pictures I don't
know about videos but pictures
definitely very useful picture I use it
all the time I do too I wish it was a
tad bit faster when it would show me in
the mobile app on what it's uploaded or
not yeah yeah I think it's well it's
it's not heed for instant I me if you
take something instantly want to share
it then yeah that's what you use it for
but if you're just out and about you're
taking a whole bunch of pictures you get
home later that night ok I want to share
my album that I took her you know
whatever then then that's what it's used
for or four oops I lost my phone I want
to cry lost all my pictures up don't
worry they're backed up yeah more for
documenting things and enjoying it and
then going back and reliving as opposed
to taking the picture at old let's be on
our phone and share yeah and then uh
Derek we got a Twitter update right
Twitter yeah so if you're still
twittering all the things you're
tweeting all over the place uh had some
neat new features they looked up new
profiles and header photos that's
actually kind of cool that's completely
different for the me section you can
have a header photo like a banner photo
streams are 4 profiles and events you
can actually pinch to zoom on photos now
butch before you weren't able to do that
um they have improved account protection
account management and this you know
polishes fixes improvements here in
their bug fixes yada yada yada I think
actually search is actually improved to
search suggestions for people topics
hashtags on it's good stuff so it's a
nice sizable update if you're in uh
what's our twitter handle android off
okay for all you twitter folks android
off
so and here we had another big app
update over the past week Phil as we
said is here when din the conversation
few times Phyllis is from technician
technician is the famous company behind
the chameleon launcher for android
tablets thus far seen coming to phones
um soon young in the parenthesis they
started out on on Kickstarter raised a
whole bunch of money we had them on a
show a while ago talked about the
initial release of the device and
everything that was going to do and
they've come a long way in the past few
months uh this past week you guys though
released the official version version
one on the Play Store for download as
well as the past week had tons of
updates me no release cannon one and all
sorts of stuff so how's that how's that
go until would uh well what have you
guys been up to since we last talked
right so I guess we'll do a quick little
history it was actually was just six
weeks ago six or seven weeks ago I so23
that I first came on that we had just
released the beta but the whole story of
chameleon goes back whoa four months ago
I was May sixteenth that we started our
first Kickstarter campaign and it was
really well received we weren't sure we
had this idea and we want to see if
people were into it we went on
Kickstarter people were totally into it
however soon afterwards we got embroiled
in some scandal and international
intrigue and it kind of forced us to
cancel the campaign but you know you
were down but not out less than a week
later we relaunched and reached our goal
in less than 24 hours so we knew that we
had something camelia was being picked
up by thousands of media outlets you
know all over the world well he could
even read half of them it was
unbelievable you know all eyes were on
us and it really fired us up you know we
were headed towards uncharted territory
I was our first self-published
application and we had no idea how much
work he was going to be when we set out
to put a beta in people's hands you know
by August but we didn't want to make
people wait months and months like many
other Kickstarter campaigns do so after
what can only be described as a
superhuman dedication and
work out we began rolling out our first
version of the beta on the eve of august
first but we didn't have much time to
celebrate you know being one of the
first software companies to release an
app on time because we had a long way to
go still and work resumed August second
and 50 days later 14 builds and 305
revisions we've reached a point where we
thought we're ready to go with v1 we
were ready for prime time we you know
there isn't an Android device in the
office that any of us own you know that
we either bring to work or have at home
that isn't running chameleon as the
default home screen we never see the
default Android launcher anymore so I I
personally and you know on behalf of
technician we really want to thank all
of our Kickstarter backers all the early
adopters all the pre-order customers as
well as the thousands of people who
emailed us and tweeted and shared posted
liked or hated chameleon you know
they've made the last four months of our
lives a crazy sleep-deprived
sleep-deprived adventure but you know I
wouldn't trade it for the world and
really it's just the beginning we've got
so much more planned and we just wrapped
up our latest update which I think we're
even pushing out tomorrow so version 101
and it's got 15 new improvements that
we've added so we hope everybody really
likes it so was it the beginning of this
week or late last week I don't remember
widgets the API for that finally came
out he talked a bit about that yeah
absolutely so we released the widget API
a little bit before be released v1
wanted to get it out there a little bit
sooner to get some developer hands on it
and since then we've been getting a lot
of emails from a lot of people you know
saying oh look at this widget you know I
seen I've seen all kinds of crazy
witches people have made some slicker
widgets and task widgets and you know IP
camera widgets it's really been nice to
see the developers getting involved in
making their own widgets and before long
you're gonna start seeing that widget
catalog grow not just from our widgets
that we're going to be adding so Google+
calendar improved email and media you
know those are all definitely on the
docket and then after that there's going
to be more but by the end by the end of
that time you know we'll have the third
party widgets in there and some new
features that we think
really change the conversation around
chameleon so what features on this the
past update did you come out with that
it added so this next update that I
pushing out tomorrow doesn't have the
wipers also 101 ok 101 yeah so it's just
a point of one release so it's just got
a lot of improvements so making Adam
custom wallpapers that's been improved
now so you can you can add a wallpaper
you know from your email app or anywhere
where you've got the image you can add a
custom wallpaper as well the quality of
the wallpaper has been improved before
it was compressed a little bit but now
it looks a lot better we've improved the
EPI so some of the developers out there
gonna be happy to see that a bunch of my
you know minor bug fixes there hasn't
been like any serious crashes or
freezing problems but there have been
minor noises people have been reporting
so we've been taking care of that
widgets there's a issue plaguing some
users where we just look your blank
sometimes so we've got that one pretty
much nailed down now and you know
miscellaneous things also well it seems
like you guys are happy in development
and really looking to improve a
experience as a whole which is awesome
when is there any type of pipeline date
for that I believe last time we talked
and talked almost like a catalog where
developers would put their their their
widget so be more than just your widgets
the widgets that no third-party
developers added is that still going to
be something that you will plan on
implementing in the future where
everybody's widgets will be and you can
sorted by category or something like
that yeah the sophistication of the
catalog will depend on how many widgets
we have but we're definitely going to be
opening it up to third-party widgets
making third-party widgets available to
all users but we of course want to make
sure that the EP is solid and that we've
worked with developers to make sure that
the widgets you know meet our standards
I would say I mean I can't put a
deadline on exactly we're definitely
working hard on it right now our focus
is finishing up the Google+ widgets and
calendar and the other widgets that
we're working on and after that's done
we're gonna then move to
focusing on getting the third party
widgets in there and improving and
bolstering our widget catalogue so I see
in the last version the ability to
publish in tweets and status updates
from facebook was that and correct yeah
so twittering and Facebook so if you
have the Twitter app installer or the
facebook app installed you know the
Twitter and Facebook widget and
chameleon now gives you a shortcut to be
able to post is that your house is that
functionality going to be available for
people plus as well or is it just going
to be a feed of your stream I'm not I'm
not working on the Google+ widget myself
but it's possible we're going to put it
in there okay good good answer now now
those of us that were or Kickstarter
backers ya what I'll famous write a new
shoutouts uh yeah just a little young
nice little shout-out section was added
I like that so that said that what hero
how do I get to it yet i'll remember oh
my go to the apps that's right you go to
the apps and up at the top your shout
outs and all your name everybody's names
appear some little little circles and
you can search for your name all 798
backers are on there if they made us
famous and really make them famous
that's been that's nice that's nice we
have a question from michael nice will a
smaller or tighter widget grid be
launched with for the 10-inch tablets we
are playing around with the idea of
adjusting the the grids for the
different sized tablets nothing is
written in stone on that yet so we're
still gauging people's feedback trying
to find the down the perfect the sweet
spot for the grids there um but i can't
comment exactly what we're gonna do you
know but we're trying to make sure that
we find agree that most people are
comfortable with personally my view is
the more grits the better because let's
say you want to you know have it some
way you give more customization with
more grits and you know that's how I
would feel well you know we're working
on redesigning some parts of the app to
kind of fit a lot more with a philosophy
behind
million and take context which is
actually a big central core feature of
chameleon and bring that back to the
forefront and the idea that we have
actually would mean that this grid
problem would no longer be an issue with
this redesign that we're thinking of so
we're kicking people's feedback and
we're not just thinking okay well we'll
just do it that way to fix it if people
are having problems or they may have the
ideas on how to improve things they need
to go back and figure out why is it that
they have this issue how can we go
deeper and make sure that we fix the
root cause of the problem and not just
give them more grids and say there you
go is fixed happy extremely interesting
a grid 'less design that is not limited
by that that would be cool Barry I think
I didn't say grid list but I should've
saying something like that yeah would
add a lot more functionality yeah and
that's just the beginning you know
chameleon it was really hardcore
hardcore development for several several
months I mean we're a small team and
we've been putting in intensely long
hours we've got to this point now and
you know from this point on it's just
going to get better and better we've
stayed true to the original design but
since starting we've had a lot of new
ideas and concepts on how to make
chameleon even more useful now how big
is your team the the development team
there's four of us okay Wow and I'll
forward you working on separate projects
or or kind of tag to a little bit we
yeah we tag team a little it depends on
the size of the task you know so I
mostly focus on the Android side I focus
more on the UI stuff you've got
developers working on the widgets
working on the widget API you've got
developers who are communicating with
support and forums and making sure we
get all the bugs in in fixing bugs we
all fix bugs we all had features we all
get together and sort of share the tasks
but you know chameleon really was a
monumental task and it looks simple its
deceptive in its simplicity you know for
an app to have so little actual you I to
it but be able to do so much it's
difficult to pull that off and the
contexts are nice i noticed that this
past week one of the updates money
vindhya released candid that a a
countdown
was was added you know 10 seconds we're
going to be switching screens based on
this contacting out or something I was
using that earlier I have my contact set
up for home and and and for in for work
and I got home and I just pulled out my
tablet and within a few seconds of being
on it I saw hey we're switching screens
in a ring circular thing came officer
captain down I like that out I mean it
just just what gave a little something
something that's really polished and you
need you like the reveal yeah like
you're never getting like that in
Android yeah yeah now speaking android
since you said you're in the Android
development side um I know that you guys
don't officially you know try to support
this rom that we're all miserable that
Rob you're mainly focusing on an
official version so since you noted that
in the changelog I have to ask have you
heard certain roms not being compatible
made it has that been an issue that
actually hasn't been as much of an issue
since we've been improving the the you
know the beta at first had a lot of
problems but since we've fixed a lot of
the problems with the beta it just
magically became more compatible with a
lot more devices but we've got a ton of
people you know running touch pads and
we've seen people running running it on
the 5-inch notes you know we've seen
people running it on tablets that we've
never heard of before and in the in the
Google developer console where you can
see people are fighting there's a lot of
crazy stuff in there it's going about on
the tablet well I wonder how they have
that they were able to install it on the
note I guess there's some really
ingenious Android developers out there
or they just took the APK you know i
mean that's that's yeah i got that
simple you just downloaded on your on
your tablet then you take it take the
APK and toss it on your father a couple
of a couple of build profits and
framework at it so yeah we're good oh no
you filled up frothing there you go it's
now supported yea i meant it would look
pretty nice on the gas and note too
though yeah right now chameleon is
optimized for seven
and larger displays right so that's
really the whole idea it'll run on a
smaller display but we haven't really
dialed in everything to be optimal to
give it the optimal experience all the
smaller displays but we will be of
course when we release the phone version
it's no secret I mean we announced the
phone version in kickstarter and we're
really excited about it actually right
now there's a bunch of people waiting in
line for the iphone 5 i wanted to grab
the st three we have in the office put
chameleon on their photo make fun of
people who are waiting in line show them
chameleon show them the contacts tone
the dashboards in the widgets and say
yeah can your iphone do this looks PQ to
do odd did you see that new ad by
Samsung yeah that's good spray I love
every one of those commercials are
definitely I still feel we have another
question here and I'm curious as well as
I'm a guide it has has work email Ezra
we asked this last time we chatted it
has there been any headway or any
thought on adding non-gmail adding up
personal email accounts problem you know
I don't know maybe maybe yahoo hotmail
maybe my work email you know I me any
other email besides you know yeah we
agree the gmail widget I mean it's
limited right now just because of the
API that Google provides obviously we
want to be able to show a lot more than
that but just like the grid concerns of
users email concern we want to kind of
go back to the root and see if we can
figure out a way to solve the root
problem so I think we've come up with
the way to do that I'm not going to give
anything away but email should be a lot
better in a future update well it is
involved any back-end services that
technician would have to host and then
that's my I can't say much loving wife
are like how we registered of the
technician server and that's where your
email reside and they will get into that
later that's how I would probably do it
if I kept tried to get around it Oh
anyways so we their questions about
about chameleon here um okay
here's a gmail questions you can email
the the widget that is being designed do
you know if you'll be able to add
multiple counts or at least maybe
multiple widgets maybe yeah maybe I have
my my personal gmail account and I have
a an android authority email calendar
what the third both gmail and I want you
know one on each widget is that
functionality going to be available or
is not welcome that's all what we want
to be able to do is is at least provide
what Android will give you out of the
box okay so that's you know that's as
much as I can say on that radio so I'm
gonna say yes then because I can add
multiple gmail accounts to to my android
devices and check them all there's oh
there's only so much I'm allowed to say
right i mean i wonder what we're doing
is still kind of are indeed there's a
lot of fun you know what and i'm picking
your brain and you guys doing a great
job we appreciate everything you're
feeling it's a amazing Long tribe it
keeps getting better and better I'll be
the first to say a hundred percent I was
skeptical at the beginning I first I
tried to yet you remember that no yeah I
tried it and I'm just like you know what
I need anymore i need more it it's come
a long way in a short time I'm you know
i like it i do in one so we get calendar
and google+ yeah i might have to turn it
into my mind my default yeah you I I
might don't be long it's been it's been
very nice the more i've used it i think
it's probably the first example of make
a tablet I honestly take good advantage
of what screen space you have because
the the application in application out
go to the next applications just kind of
it makes sense for a phone because
you're limited on display size for any
of the tablets like and that's windows 8
and iOS and Android included that's just
kind of shameful that they can't take
advantage of a 10 inch screen better
than they can't yeah wait is the way it
is stock I mean yeah yeah and I think
what we hear from a lot of people using
chameleon uh it's really so different
than the default launcher that
just you know by nature people are going
to sort of be uncomfortable with a whole
new paradigm they're not used to because
you look at it you're like well now you
know what do I do with this but after
people have had it for a day or two you
know we hear back from them and they
love it now you know they almost don't
even want to go back to the stock
launcher chameleons the sort of thing
that you need to start using it we've
designed it to be as useful as possible
and you can't get that from it after
only five minutes of playing around you
know well you got it you got to
customize your dashboards you know what
I mean it's just what you make it it
really is and if you're not going to
make it useful it's not going to be
useful it's not going to come out of the
box and like boom and wow you write what
you need to set it up and once you set
up like I did with you know different
home screens set up I'll but at
different context yeah it's I like I do
Thank You Garrett its place after after
six weeks it's nice to hear yeah yeah
bad guy yeah oh ok so let's let's talk
about some up some devices that you may
be able to run chameleon on the near
future this week we had a whole bunch of
devices then you just love this time of
year you know it's it's fall you know
the iphone coming out we're all
switching to that we have yeah we have
all sorts of different devices being
launched and rumored to be launched
announced and all sorts of good stuff so
this week acer announced the a 110 it's
basically biggest competitor is going to
be the nexus 7 in the kindle fire it
it's coming with jelly bean it's a
7-inch tablet jelly bean right out of
the box in my opinion if you're going to
want this if 8 gigabytes or 7 16
gigabytes isn't enough space because it
has an SD card so if you need expandable
storage this might be the way to go um
HTC the HTC One X 5 was announced it
wasn't it was initially of being rumored
as being called the DI X the droid
incredible X or you know people calling
the phablet 5 inch phablet web I think
that term
but uh so thankfully it's not called the
gix anymore because well there's a short
matter that's kind of odd to look at on
paper only you don't really want to say
hey what do you have any we called other
failure we shorten it and then we spell
them out that's what we do because
android games are horrible so did you
really want to go out there and be like
yeah i have the new HTC dicks you know
you don't even want to do that so
thankfully it's not called the VIX at
least the that that's what the the
rumors go as it's going to be the one x
5 because it's a 5 inch and you know
there's there's no set information on
where it's coming but you know it's red
it looks like the droid incredible line
chances are it's coming to to verizon
but hopefully more on that student it's
rumored to be pretty pretty amazing in
John and I were actually talking offline
about it uh I was disappointed to see
that there was a Windows Phone
announcement this week yep yeah turned
it off right after that you were hoping
that that was that phone going to be
announced cuz he had we were both
talking you know what might be the phone
to get you know I they'll get HTC is
historically not been the greatest with
batteries they underestimate that their
battery size in battery life isn't is
what it should be so if you display
phone scares me battery consumption was
so if this if this bill does have a big
battery or a battery they can support a
1080p screen then this might be a heck
of a device I'm excited to see where
they go with it um asus has the PadFone
you know that the phone that's the phone
that's a tablet that's a netbook
depending on all the different
accessories you get for it but even
though it just came out as all things
with technology hey look here's the next
version of it so here in a little less
than a month october 16 they're going to
be announcing unveiling the PadFone to
be nice if it was the offer on some
carriers here in the US zip it may not
go i don't know i said i would buy one
but
definitely definitely be cool to geek
out with and play with it would be
awesome I just don't know if a carrier
want to carry it because I kind of
knocks them out of getting to data plan
well but even with the shared plans are
getting an extra like 10 bucks a month
per device you add to it so if you talk
it out with one device all together
they're probably not going to want to
carry it at all so if you're into
prepaid plans and you're looking for
something on boost mobile that's who
you're currently use the ZTE Warp is now
available for 200 bucks on three boost
mobile or three amazon if let's think
about this this chips with vanilla stock
ICS no bloatware no no carrier junk no
skins you eyes whatever it's straight
Android and it kind of looks like a
Galaxy Nexus so it's almost like a
bastardized cheap version of the galaxy
nexus i mean it has a 4.3 inch qhd
screen 1.4 gigahertz 768 megabytes of
ram mean it's it's a it's almost like a
Galaxy Nexus it really is Clark speed
higher gold yellow bit clock speed
little less Ram no little smaller screen
which him I could never downsize format
so so last week we talked about the LG
optimus G and we were all excited
because this is a beast of a film but
the hardware on it seems amazing we
don't know anything else beyond that
it's coming sometime in q4 in the US
don't know what carriers yet but it
would be nice to see it on as many as
possible like other rumors that came out
about films though which we'll get to
here in a minute the the Galaxy Note 2
was confirmed this past week to come out
on five US carriers so we'll see the
note to the 5.5 inch note to your a bit
the bigger better faster version on
verizon AT&amp;amp;T tmobile sprint US cellular
and surprise surprise the verizon
version will probably have a locked
bootloader
yeah I would have been surprised if they
just had an unlock bootloader on it
personally at this pod yeah it's gonna
bring the network at the booth oh yeah
then the network immediately like shut
down stop noticing I'd love to see the
ratio of break to motorola's that
they've had to deal with with customer
support versus bricked Nexus devices
because apparently you know apparently
the Nexus must be the one just tying up
all their support you know nobody ever
breaks a motorola know what you have to
try hard to bristle so now I mean you
literally have to sit out as I'm going
to brick this phone today I mean with
fast food and SBS and I mean I haven't
done it and I didn't know anything about
it and i have not bricked anything i've
gotten into a little bit of a situation
i lost all my soft keys but uh vanilla
root and rom and scott figured it out he
isn't what the hell he's doing so yeah
it's you have to really set out today
I'm breaking my phone you can have to
mean you have to pretty damn good at
doing it to do it till we've been
anyways that's a rant for another show a
couple other devices want to mention
real quick so oppo oppo don't I say that
what was it ok we'll say oppo so oppo a
chinese company the fine five duh so we
got the specs on that this week no
mention of pricing or availability
that's a 12 megapixel camera two gigs of
ram a Snapdragon s4 pro processor 1.5
gigahertz quad-core 5-inch screen with
441 pixels-per-inch it's going to have a
full 1080p 1920 x 1080 resolution that's
that's not some of this age we live in
that's not so mobile device sauce that's
insane yes it has a 2500 milliamp hour
battery I mean it's gonna have to add a
decent sized battery but push all those
pixels so it's going to come with jelly
bean God willing else besides a bit
that's awesome I that mean leave the
phones that are being in you know
announced now God those things are
powerhouses
and I want every single world asia is
just kicking us around like they're from
last year at this point um so yeah let's
talk you know unfortunately Dan Charlton
isn't able to join us this week he would
love to talk about the next phone does
not like Intel CPUs in his mobile
devices and I I just don't know the
architecture enough to yell bad but uh
it'll get there good or if it's not not
there now I can say it's not there now
it's gotta feel good to two gigahertz
CPU and the razor I which is the
european version of the razr m here in
the US everything's exactly the same on
the outside software it's the same phone
it's just it has a different processor
and it obviously different radios but
it's you know edge to edge display two
thousand million power battery ice cream
sandwich actually i lied the software
isn't exactly the same chrome does not
work on it yet chrome does not support
that processor yet so so if you're
watching this are listening over and you
can you're gonna plan on getting this
phone and chromed your latest browser or
your favorite browser don't worry google
said it's going to be updated soon yeah
i know what soon means could be tomorrow
could be a month but they're an updated
to support that architecture student so
yeah don't don't so excited thanks maybe
you can just bring desktop Chrome over
and just skin you know shrink it down
just be thrown OS yeah just put chrome
OS on and be done with it I wonder how
much development it takes to support
that new chip like the medfield wonder
native development kit wouldn't be hard
it would be the Intel's having to port
over for the compiler that's what we
know they just finished their jelly bean
port that's the more the grunt work
because they a development get a
developer can compile it against the
architectural I mean for the most part
uh they're coming in a good time because
I mean yeah it would have helped them to
come in a little bit earlier but you
look at all the multi-core like a
a core processor now and uh none of the
mobile operating systems really scale
all that well to four cores anyway so
that the other point on a single core
but you know single-threaded poor
performance is still more important than
multi-threaded at this point so they
won't suffer too bad for that and also
you know you mentioned that they relate
to the race but I don't think this is a
microphone type late this is like they
have some time to actually come in and I
really hope that they increase their
market share let's talk about one last
rumor that you know this past week in
nexus rumors this time of year is
awesome you know when new Nexus phones
going to coming out soon we're going to
start hearing all sorts of stuff and
every android fans gonna turn into
basically what we made fun up about
Apple fans the past week so I'll
nutrient to that guy I can't wait to do
it this past week we heard about you
know the galaxy nexus two or maybe the
galaxy premier you know it looks like
it's probably gonna be called the galaxy
premier instead it's actually not going
to be the Galaxy Nexus to you know it
rumors are rumors I can be wrong not
what I'm talking about but based on what
speculation and leaks and all sorts of
good stuff around the internet we found
out that a phone called the GT I 9260 is
apparently the works um it might not be
the galaxy nexus two could be called the
galaxy premier it's gonna have an 8
megapixel camera you know I don't think
it's a it's a nexus because it has an SD
card the nexus don't do that so so we'll
see what happens with that and was also
really to have a cortex a9 cpu which
right now is just you know vapor
hardware because it actually doesn't
exist or so good hey 11 your move yeah
what'd I say hey nothing oh ok I don't
say 11 yeah yeah good good catch a job
in a trap yeah yeah so we'll see what
happens with that it mean either way
it's a decent phone I mean we will talk
about it but I don't think it's an
excess we're still waiting for that
those rumors to hopefully come in the
next
weeks um let's move on to jellybean ICS
updates here so just today we heard from
Palo brian at monaco that the HTC One X
jelly bean update should be coming soon
sometime in October and then other other
HTC devices would follow before
Christmas maybe that's the one s the
video who knows but uh you know
information is everything is good
information so if you own that device or
those devices jellybean is coming soon
hopefully sooner than later the sony
xperia ion got ICS this week a not bad
timing out for nearly here the Samsung
Galaxy exhilarate that ICS as well once
again not that been out for almost a
year um that's good it's good hopefully
we'll we'll see jellybean before
Christmas on those two devices as well
rooted in ramen noodles is it Anthony
Feliciano says that so to varun ramen
noodles thank you for this to bed that's
ok though so uh so aokp the android open
kang project uh got billed to this week
you know their minds know if the song uh
nobler to anyways um Galaxy Nexus Nexus
7 that's nexus 7 multiple Samsung
devices multiple galaxy tabs I've got
all sorts of support this week there's
tons of new feature tons of
customizations if you're into
customizing all the things and you might
wanna check out aokp yeah i'm currently
running a AP two and it is nice i added
a lot more features over the first build
but second version was very nice and
extremely stable from my experiences
i've been running it for about four
three or four days good yeah that's good
um okay okay p is is one of those roms
that literally packs everything in for
customization they don't hold back at
you know i don't think you customize
that yep we're gonna try to I mean they
they would they want you to customize
everything and they they give you that
ability on Iran the AAP a little bit
in ICS time that's okay I didn't didn't
hate it so yeah if you're into like I
said all the things being customized and
yeah give it a try check them out and
it's or if you like unicorns a lot like
unicorns yeah yeah their logo is a
unicorn designed by the flash Oh funny a
funny thing that i found today um is in
when you go to all apps installed all
apps there's unicorn horn as an
installed app that's hidden and I didn't
know that it's a live wallpaper oh is it
mm-hmm talk about I was hilarious I was
like you're saying floating paint it's a
pink background with floating you know
unicorns it's a lot like phase beam is
all I thought it was hilarious mm-hmm
it's funny ah so something you want to
hand your phone over to somebody for
though hey here's a heart hey guys yeah
you can borrow my phone here's my pink
unicorn wallpaper check it out yeah you
know some people might like that some
people are like pink unicorns all right
so rude and ronon uh the new Amazon
Kindle Fire HD gets routed with an old
exploit remember amazon they forked ICS
and customized it made you know amazon
the last whatever the calling it fire
stuff and what they they failed the
patch and known existing bug and ICS
which hey that's good for customization
so it can now be rooted in you can do
all the things to it that you can with
root the bootloader so far remains
locked but you know what does android
devs they amaze us i'm sure you know i'm
sure we'll have an unlocked bootloader a
hack crack whatever you want to call it
in the near future you know the android
community never ceases to amaze me
because things like this happen over at
XDA a new universal root method was
released and i wouldn't say it's true
universal yet has been tested on every
device but what it does is
it's a simple batch file for for windows
obviously you're on the batch file and
boom it it does its thing what it does
is it uses a remount timing issue for
androids adb restore service and it
works on jelly bean and ICS allows you
to route a lot of different devices it's
working on a lot of different Sony
Xperia devices nexus 7 a few different
LG devices a few different HTC devices a
couple Samsung devices and Moore's mods
and ends I wanna check it out on post
the links after the show and check them
out on XDA and try it on your various
device to see if you can read all the
things with it supposedly um but you
know and that's very you know we need
more easy methods like that so there
isn't 72 different methods for 72
different phones I like that it makes
things easier for people that want to
root their devices or as well as root
their friends device or family members
device or you know whatever you don't
have to download a separate tool to do
it area research how I do on this device
she does go though the one-size-fits-all
I like that ok well let's go over let's
wrap up with a little bit of carrier
news we got Sprint's CEO they've sold 1
million LTE devices it's kind of cool to
get a milestone for them to hit yeah
that's not bad especially now because
they just really got into LTE you know
the better part of the past six months
yeah and they're they're still on track
for their 100 city released for the real
teen at work in cities in the next
couple of months that's pretty cool um
18 tlte in Seattle Portland Detroit
Honolulu Pittsburgh Memphis Philly
Cincinnati um basically everybody's
scattering to get LTE footprint expanded
um pretty cool um and then also a side
thought that I had going to work when
all these iphone 5s come on my network
I wonder Hank I wonder how the networks
are going to react because I remember
winning it was the way when they came
out with 3g and they had problems or
claim that they had had problems but I
wonder what it's going to be like with
the of all the LTE usage I hope I don't
know hopefully you know verizon blonde
long I can keep up the 3g on verizon
didn't get hit particularly bad when
they got it but I didn't they don't have
as many iphones as AT&amp;amp;T does but we do
what he has i would think has majority
of they wish they still do by a good
margin actually but uh LTE i would
because verizon was anticipating and
telling us to expect five to ten
megabits a second you know what that's
really annoying gone remember a year ago
we got almost a year ago back in you
know what was in december we got our i
was getting 35 for the day that I got my
Nexus oh yeah I was getting that I was
consistently getting getting 30s and now
i'm getting not you know maybe 15 18 20
that's like HSPA speed and LTE battery
life so there's a win-win there's a
win-win situation the question is though
are we being throttled or is it just
because the network's Bob down a little
bit haha that is the question that is
the I would honestly think throttled
where I'm it because I'm not in a
gigantic metropolitan area or anything
like that I don't see whether than that
many people that jumped on it because
and it's saturated here too I'm probably
throttled I use at least six gigs per
month so so real quick on the on the
patent words not going to get into it
because I will run out of time but you
know its ongoing Microsoft one a few
things against google / motorola
mobility in germany there's an
injunction the going to happen it
basically it they they lost a patent
infringement case we're saying that um
the patent infringes on a microsoft
patent to allow for soft input panel
system and method
what's that mean it means applications
that receive input from various sources
and methods pretty much a lot of Android
app they're safe that so that they
they've been lost that um sales ban on
the Galaxy Tab 10.1 is to remain in
place here in the US judge Koh said a
complaints been filed by motorola to the
IPC and Apple is heavily under scrutiny
right now they're investigating seven
different patents we'll see what happens
basically the whole lot about it the
release said that Motorola Mobility
filed a complaint and the investigation
will be surrounding certain wireless
communication devices portable music and
data processing devices computers and
components thereof so we don't know the
list of devices but we turn before that
it's you know macbook iphone 3 the whole
way up to iphone 5 now and as well as
you know ipod ipod touch so what I'm
sure we'll find out more about that but
that case it is going to be heard for a
while let me read it right now the
Samsung just add the iphone 5 to its
list of infringing uh claims on eight
different patents and that's scheduled
to go and mark so we got three my three
months yeah we got just March 2014 on
them yeah yeah we got we got rough I
typed that wrong no just just making
sure cuz I like yeah we're gonna drop
the banhammer two years no yeah um yeah
a year and a half from now melvin morse
we're gonna get them then yeah we're
going to really go we'll put it in March
2013 not 2014 that that's gonna go to
trial that Samsung adding the iphone to
its a patent claim so lot of stuff's
going on not a lot of you know real
information just filing is going on here
and there and it's going to be a bumpy
road especially now iphone has an LTE
film that comes out tomorrow because the
chances are HTC is going to follow
through with her suit so I'm sure next
week we'll have some more to go on with
that okay for you guys watching there
