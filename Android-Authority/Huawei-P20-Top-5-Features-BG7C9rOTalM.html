form with the mate 10 and a mate 10 Pro
and it's looking to carry that momentum
forwards this year with the P 20 and the
P 20 Pro so according to y way these two
devices are such a huge leap from the P
10 series that they needed double the
number and to be fair they really do
impress so what makes them so great
I'm Adam Shin Itsuki from Android
authority and these are the top five
features of the Huawei P 20 and P 20 Pro
so first up for feature number one we
have the P 20s eye catching design this
phone really is a looker when
considering the design philosophy for
this year's model while wasted it drew
inspiration from the way that artists
use light to accentuate paintings and
other forms of art and to be honest it's
hard to argue with the results to a
notable departure from the P 10 while
way outfitted the p20 P 20 pro with a
glass front and back around the curved
metal frame that means the glass camera
visor seen on previous P series devices
is gone
instead the rear camera setup is now
vertical with two sensors on the P 20
and three sensors on the P 20 throw and
don't worry we'll be coming back to
those cameras later the P 20 comes in
five different colors including midnight
blue pink gold black and champagne gold
but the real highlight is the stunning
Twilight model the gradient finish here
ensures that the phone grabs your
attention from all angles and it's
something that really has to be seen in
person to truly appreciate it's also
worth noting how thin each device is
with the larger pro managing to cram in
a four thousand milliamp hour battery as
a thickness of just seven point eight
millimeters that four thousand milliamp
hour battery alone could easily have had
its own entry on a list like this but of
course for number two it's impossible to
talk about the phone's design without
touching on the new full view display
and while ways potentially controversial
decision to adopt the knotch the p20 is
in fact by far the highest profile case
of hashtag notch life on an Android
device since the essential phone and
it's all too easy to draw overall visual
comparisons with Apple's iPhone X
Waialae says it included the knotch to
maximize screen real estate which has
been bumped up to an 18 point 7 by 9
aspect ratio on both the vanilla P 20
and the pro of course the cutout won't
be to everyone's tastes but in a smart
move while always included a toggle in
the settings menu that effectively
removes the not completely in favor of a
regular
occasions bar that hides the notch in
the middle as for the display itself the
p20 sports a 5.8 inch LCD panel with a
1080p resolution or the pro makes the
jump to OLED and clocks in at six point
one inches despite both phones upgrading
to the kind of elongated screens we've
gotten used to in recent months they
retain front-facing fingerprint sensors
like those fans on the p10 whether
that's a problem will not will come down
to personal preference but it does seem
almost as they why was so keen on
stripping down the top bezel that had
just kind of forgot about the bottom one
let's move on from all that and talk
about the biggest change this year the
camera and number three has to go to the
show-stopping triple lens setup so the
regular p20 is a like a dual camera with
a 12 megapixel RGB and 20 mega pixel
monochrome sensor combo that's already
significant boost over the p10 and the
mate 10 series yet while other OEMs are
still playing catch-up and making the
shift to dual lens cameras why was going
one step further with the p20 pro by
adding a triple camera this boosts the
RGB sensor up to whopping 40 megapixels
and has an 8 megapixel telephoto lens
add those three together and you've got
a total of 68 megapixels on one phone
and a combined ISO rating of a hundred
and 2400 the p20 post camera also
supports for the predictive focus for
tracking moving objects and boasts the
largest pixel size of any smartphone by
fusing one pixel into four to create a
two micrometer pixel size both the pro
and the standard p20 are also capable of
recording super slow-motion video at 960
frames per second in 720 p in our early
tests it doesn't seem quite as intuitive
as the super slow-mo on last year's Sony
Xperia x8 premium or the recently
released galaxy s 9 but it's still a
ridiculously fun feature to play around
with the penultimate entry on this list
is another camera feature 5 x hybrid
zoom now the first thing to note is that
this is as the name suggests a hybrid
system and not 5 times optical zoom
instead what we have is a depth sensing
telephoto lens that provides 3 times
optical zoom which then combined with
the main RGB sensor to capture shots
with up to 5 times magnification we've
tested the maximum hybrid zoom on
multiple occasions now and have come
away impressed every time Blair has kept
a minimum thanks to the motion detection
powered by the Kiran 9
chipsets npu capabilities while the
phones four and one hybrid focus system
helps to create gorgeous shots with rich
vibrant colors great detail and very
little noise even at five x oom but it's
those AI systems that deserve the last
entry on this countdown as it wouldn't
be a modern why away camera suite
without some a I assisted photography
goodness anyone familiar with the mate
tenon mate tempra will instantly
recognize the p20 series scene detection
feature which adjusts camera settings
based on the subject within the frame
rather than completely overhaul the
feature while we his work with
professional photographers from around
the world to fine-tune these scenes as
an example say you have a nice spread of
cupcakes and macaroons as you ready your
shot the p20 will automatically hop over
into a food scene the big difference
this time around is the p20 is actually
clever enough to identify these as
desserts
rather than say a big slab of meat and
will quietly tinker with the camera
settings behind the scenes to best
capture the mouth-watering treats the
master AI as other uses - for instance
it let you know if you need to tilt your
aim or move around to fully capture a
group shot in addition while raises its
AI image stabilisation technology will
enable hand-held long time exposure
shots of up to four seconds so you can
capture stunning night shots without a
need for a tripod I've always loved the
long exposure setting on highway phones
for taking stunning shots of the night
sky that looked like they've come
straight from the pages of the National
Geographic
I imagine the National Geographic might
disagree but you get my point
these are just a handful of the most
notable features on the y way p 20 and p
20 pro based on our early impressions
you'll be hearing more from us on
Huawei's latest flagship as we spend
