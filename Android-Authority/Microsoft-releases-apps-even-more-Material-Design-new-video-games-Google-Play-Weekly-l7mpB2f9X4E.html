Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly this
week it's all about Microsoft Google
material design and a couple of awesome
games so let's get started first up this
week Microsoft has released a couple of
interesting Android applications as well
as an Android wear app these are all
things to an initiative at Microsoft
called the garage project which is
essentially random Microsoft employees
getting together to do farm things the
first application is called journey and
notes and it's essentially a simplistic
travel log the other is called next lock
screen it's kind of like Microsoft's
take on dashclock the Android wear
application is called torque and let you
access Cortana with a flick of the wrist
they're all free in the Google Play
Store and frankly kudos to Microsoft for
doing something a little bit different
while we're on the topic of Microsoft
they just opened up their office 365
cloud api's for developers to use on
Android what this means is that
developers can now use these api's to
integrate their applications with
Microsoft Office 365 cloud one example
is the popular ifttt application which
will be able to use office 365 events as
triggers to do other things we know most
of you use Google Drive and will likely
scoff at this a little bit and that's
fine but personally I'm stoked that
Microsoft is taking Android more
seriously and the Google Drive is
finally getting some real competition so
Google finally released that bookmark
application that was teased repeatedly
over the summer back then it was called
Google stars but its final name is
called bookmark manager it features
large graphics some advanced
organization features and it's
definitely something different than the
classic bookmark style it's free in the
Chrome App Store right now if you want
to give it a shot but be warned it is
really busy so if you're like me and
never really organized your bookmarks
before you're in for a bit of a shock
while we're on the topic of Google they
just made it really easy for developers
to integrate the ok Google hot word into
their applications ok so here's what
this means google has made it
ridiculously easy for application
developers to integrate ok Google into
their application literally like half a
dozen lines of code this doesn't mean
much for consumers right now but down
the road a lot more applications are
gonna have ok Google integrated to their
application and that's pretty exciting
in our last bit of news this week a
whole bunch of Google applications got
material design updates I'm not kidding
at Google Play movies and TV Google
wallets google play games Google Drive
Google Docs Google slides and Google
sheets all got material design updates
this last week this is no doubt in
preparation for the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9
launch which apparently went really well
if your google and horribly if your
everyone else these updates are
currently rolling out so if you use any
of them just sit tight because it's
coming so who wants to see some trending
applications as usual if you want to
check any of these applications out you
can find the links in the briton
companion which is in the video
description below first up this week is
Republic it's a stealth action game that
comes with amazing graphics a dark and
entertaining story line and three
episodes of content to play through with
more planned in the future it uses the
walking dead style where it adds content
to the game in the form of episodes and
you have to buy them as in-app purchases
so far it's garnered positive reviews
and 299 really isn't that bad inbox by
Gmail has already made quite the splash
and it's still in the invite-only stage
that most Google Apps go through before
being released to the public it's
Google's latest take on email and so far
it's had some pretty polarizing reviews
some think it's great while others think
it's too busy and complicated we did a
quick hands-on so you can judge for
yourself and that's linked in the video
description below and here at the end of
the video ES File Manager now has
chromecast support but you'll have to
download this plugin in order to do it
it is free in the Google Play Store and
it does essentially what it says it does
once you download and install the
plug-in you'll have the chromecast
option in the actual ES File Explorer
app and you can cast photos and videos
if you use ES file explorer you should
also have this NHL 2k is out and it's
probably the best hockey game you can
get on Android it's a little pricey and
having in app purchases on top of the
eight dollar price tag is probably a bit
much for some people but sports do tend
to lag behind the competition when it
comes to mobile gaming in any case there
are plenty of game modes accurate
rosters and some old arcade style
gameplay it's also really nice to see
major publishers taking Android a little
bit more seriously last up this week is
djing which is a very very popular DJ
application over on iOS that's finally
made its Android debut it has a lot of
features that allow you to alter and mix
songs at your
and it comes with Spotify integration it
seems to be generally well like but
there are more hardcore users who seem
to wish it had more features in any case
299 isn't that much and it does look
like a lot of fun if you want to see the
latest and greatest an android app news
