domain.com through the 4k video
recording and gaming we're going to test
to see of this beloved flagship
overheats taking the data we compiled
from last year's best of android
comparison and running the same tests on
the Exynos powered galaxy s7 and s7 edge
we can tell whether the current
smartphones operate cooler than their
predecessors now it'll be clear we've
tested the Exynos powered galaxy s7 and
s7 edge with the same test to
distinguish if one of the two handsets
overheats more than the other we also
combine the data compiled and our
testing a few months ago to give you a
comparison against other devices now one
of the biggest tests has got to be 4k
video recording it may be a feature
present on most mid-range and premium
smartphones but it also is a surefire
way to put your smartphone's internals
under enough pressure to heat up
sometimes to critical temperatures with
a 4k video recording limit of 10 minutes
does the galaxy s7 heat up noticeably or
does the liquid cooling and power
efficiencies prevent it from doing so
taking the average of the three
temperatures recorded the galaxy s7 edge
heats up less than the galaxy s7 does
with the temperature increase of 4.5 oh
and 4.90 respectively despite this
however both rise in temperatures
slightly more than the samsung galaxy
note 5 and pale in comparison to the
Nexus 6p which scores a 1.73 rise now
that's 4k recording but what about full
HD video it's less taxing on internals
but full HD recording can happen for
much longer up to 30 minutes so this
should be interesting this is where the
galaxy s7 proves to be quite a
disappointment running quite hot after
its stint as a cameraman with an average
temperature rise of 5.07 the smartphone
falls behind the Nexus 6p the LG v10 and
the Xperia z5 premium the Galaxy s7 edge
fares considerably better but with the
temperature rise of 3.27 it still only
ranks in one place higher now of course
the granddaddy test of all is mobile
gaming specifically a 30-minute session
of
zone to HD which is fairly resource
intensive how does each smartphone fare
note that we haven't run this test
previously so the results of the Nexus
6p and the note 5 and BlackBerry Prive
we're all captured as part of our
testing as you can see here the Galaxy
s7 and s7 edge both outperformed the
Nexus 6p the note 5 and the BlackBerry
Prive as the efficiency gains provided
by new architecture come into effect
this could also potentially be due to
Samsung's liquid cooling feature with a
percentage gain of approximately 28% and
22% respectively over the note 5 it's
likely to be a combination of both
factors so what's the verdict does the
s7 and s7 edge overheat well the data
clearly shows that both smartphones do
indeed run hot during camera based tasks
with the area containing the camera
proven to be the hottest part of each
smartphone but during the performance
intensive tasks Samsung's newest
flagships remain mostly cool taking
averages of each smartphone across
various tests we can see that the s7 and
s7 edge ranked lower than you might have
expected with the Nexus 6p the LG v10
and the galaxy note 5 proven to be
cooler on average what's most
interesting to me though is that the
Galaxy s7 edge is consistently cooler
than the regular variant the extra size
of Samsung's larger flagship offers heat
a wider area from which to dissipate and
as such the smartphone does run
noticeably cooler now what I want to
know is does the liquid cooling actually
work it's entirely likely that the
liquid cooling does help some internal
components cool but the redesigned
camera module overheats more than
previous devices resulting in a false
negative result have any of you guys or
gals had problems with your s7 or s7
edge overheating let me know in the
comments below so do you guys remember
from like 15 years ago when people were
making money hand over fist in the
dot-com bubble remember we didn't call
it a dotnet bubble or dot-org bubble we
didn't call them dot biz billionaires we
called them dot-com billionaires because
that's the power of a dot-com now why is
that because no domain name extension
tells your story with the same degree of
trust as a dot-com or dotnet domain name
