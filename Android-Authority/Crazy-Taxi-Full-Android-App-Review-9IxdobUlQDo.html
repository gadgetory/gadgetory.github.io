handy the Android authority app guy so
who owned a Dreamcast
no one Bueller well I sure did and one
of the best games for it was crazy taxi
Sega has now brought that game to
Android and we're gonna take a closer
look at it
if you played the original Crazy Taxi on
sega dreamcast or in the arcades then
everything we're about to talk about
will be wildly familiar to you this is
almost an exact part of the dreamcast
classic in almost every way even the
ridiculous game physics still hold true
in terms of control the game gives you
two options you can use the tilts or the
on-screen controls if you like one or
the other better you have both options
but it doesn't quite matter which one
you use because driving around isn't all
that difficult anyway here's how the
game works it's a little more than an
arcade game you play ranked mode three
minute five minute and ten minute modes
and then the crazy box mode where you
can do really big jumps or Bowl using
the taxi you'll earn money by taxing
people from place to place with bonus
money being earned when you do cool
stuff with your taxi that's pretty much
the whole game the challenge comes from
getting as many fares done as possible
in the time allotted and then there's a
time limit per fare so if you don't get
there in time they'll bail out of the
moving vehicle and you lose the money
they would have paid you the graphics
are about as good as you can expect from
a Dreamcast arcade port it's definitely
been revamped and sharpened for Android
screens so it's not like playing an
emulator where it'll get all fuzzy it's
sharp and it looks good The Sound of
Music is about as awesome as it always
was instead of some generic video game
music you're treated to some old-style
punk rock by bands like The Offspring
for those who've never played it's
reminiscent of games like the old Tony
Hawk series all in all the graphics are
what you could possibly hope for out of
a sega port and the music is well
totally awesome nothing amazing or
fantastic but not disappointing either
ok so here's what we liked about Crazy
Taxi the original gameplay was pretty
much perfectly ported if you spent time
years ago playing this game and loved it
you'll probably love it again thankfully
Sega understood what makes the game
great to begin with and kept all of
those elements the music in this game is
awesome if you're into that sort of
music the graphics aren't bad either
considering what Crazy Taxi is and where
it came from it won't win any awards but
you can definitely tell what's going on
and it's definitely enjoyable it's a
simple game there isn't much to learn
aside from the controls once you get
those down the game is really easy to
play so there's no ridiculous learning
curve and it's not really difficult to
begin with it is fun slightly addictive
and a total throwback to one of the few
games that made a real splash on the
Dreamcast there wasn't much to dislike
about this game mostly because there
isn't much to the game to begin with and
that's the first thing we didn't like
about it it's an arcade game through and
through which means no story no campaign
and no real content outside of the
arcade modes once you get sick of the
time challenges you pretty much get sick
of Crazy Taxi if you don't like 90s punk
rock you'll likely play this game only
on mute even if the offspring and
similar band sold tens of millions of
albums in the 90s the kids today just
don't like that kind of stuff anymore
hey at least it's not a bunch of Justin
Bieber and Nicki Minaj tracks at the end
of the day would we recommend this game
the answer is yes we would for five
dollars you can get a game that lived
through the death of the arcade
generation through the crushing
depressing lifecycle of the Sega
Dreamcast and a few more systems
there aren't many other games out there
with those kind of bragging rights we
would also like to acknowledge the loyal
if somewhat small fanbase this game had
over the course of its existence for
those people $5.00 is well worth
throwing at a game many of us played in
our childhood
everything is there just like it used to
be and kudos to everyone involved for
keeping it that way so for the final
thoughts I'll say this the game earned a
four point five rating in the Play Store
and if you're into arcade-style games
from the 90s and early 2000s pick this
one up it's well worth it once again I'm
