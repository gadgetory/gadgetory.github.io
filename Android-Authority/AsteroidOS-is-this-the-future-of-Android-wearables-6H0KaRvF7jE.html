authority and with Android wear 2.0
being delayed till next year and no new
Android wear smartwatches from companies
like LG Motorola or Huawei Android wear
has grown a little bit stagnant at least
until the update comes out if you're
impatient or just looking for something
to breathe some new life into your
Android wear a SmartWatch you might want
to give astroid OS a try which we
currently have running on one of the
oldest Android wear smartwatches the
original LG G watch so asteroid OS was
created by a French computer science
student and it's a completely standalone
Linux based wearable OS so it's not
based on Android wear in any way shape
or form it's also completely open source
which means other developers and
manufacturers can take this and freely
modify as they see fit something to keep
in mind with asteroid OS is that it's
currently in alpha so don't expect
everything to work perfectly you will
notice a lot of bugs and freezes but it
still runs well enough to give you a
good idea of what this new take on a
wearable operating system is like
asteroid OS also has their own app which
you can download from their official
home page and this app will allow you to
manage certain functions and pair it
with your SmartWatch
aside from the LG G watch ashford OS
also currently supports the G watch
urbane the Sony SmartWatch 3 and the
assist is n watch - if you're looking to
pair this to your phone for
notifications bluetooth pairing only
works on the original G watch at the
moment but even though it works on the G
watch it's still very finicky the
Bluetooth connection isn't always stable
and the notifications disappear from the
watch after a couple of seconds and will
go back to telling you that you have no
notifications and it doesn't seem like
you can interact with or read the
notifications directly from the watch at
least for right now when the watch is
connected to the phone you have several
options within the app itself you can
change the weather to your city of
choice locate your watch grab a
screenshot or tinker with the
notification settings but the weather
settings and they find my watch options
are currently the only ones that work
right now while the other two are not
supported just yet the app will also
tell you your remaining battery life on
your SmartWatch but at the moment it's
not accurate so you want to check your
watch's battery life I would do on the
watch itself and not through the app
since there's a touch-based wearable OS
all of your navigation will be done by
swipes if you swipe down on the display
this will give you access to some quick
shortcuts for screen brightness
Bluetooth and turning vibration on or
off you can also see your remaining
battery life from here and if you tap on
the lock icon it'll put your watch to
sleep and you can double tap on the
display if you want to wake it back up
swipe it to the left will take you to
your notifications if you manage to get
notifications to work properly and
swiping right will always take you back
one step unless you're already on the
main home screen and in this case
swiping right will take you to your
recent apps screen which will let you
quickly jump between apps and you can
easily close these apps out by long
pressing on them and tapping the X that
appears there's no third-party apps at
the moment but there are a handful of
basic applications pre-installed which
you can get to by swiping up you have a
calendar application calculator alarm
clock timer stopwatch a music player and
a weather application and all the apps
have a very clean simple minimalistic
look with white text and graphics and
colorful backgrounds you can also access
all the watch settings from here which
has all the basic functions that you
would expect like the time date language
Bluetooth screen brightness and options
to power off and reboot the watch
there's also some customization options
here for wallpapers and watch faces and
it comes pre-installed with a
surprisingly decent amount of wallpapers
and watch faces especially for such an
early build if you're looking to install
this you can find the instructions on
the astroid os home page which will
either link down below in the
description or over android authority
but keep in mind it's not for the faint
of heart and does require knowledge on
how to use ADB in order to install it
it's also not exactly daily driver
material due to the bugs and the battery
life isn't all that good but this alpha
release will give you a good idea of
what the experience is like if you're
familiar with ADB feel free to give it a
try and just in case you're wondering it
doesn't overwrite Android wear and you
can easily revert back to Android wear
just by simply rebooting your watch it's
definitely a wearable operating system
that looks like it has a lot of
potential and I think it's worth keeping
an eye on just to see where it goes from
