Hindy the android authority apra and
welcome to the 167th episode of android
apps weekly there was a major holiday
this last week but there is still some
avenues to talk about so let's get
started Google Play is currently trying
out individual game ratings the way it
works is that you rate titles based on
gameplay controls and graphics the score
for each category lets people know how
good those qualities are for a more
comprehensive look at the game it can
also warn people of games don't have
good controller support or have great
graphics but otherwise suck we're not
sure if this is going to roll out to
everybody but it sure seems like a good
idea so Twitter banned its own CEO this
last week in an act that essentially
summed up how bad it's been a twitter
lately Jack Dorsey spent a good portion
of the day not being able to view his
own Twitter account he did eventually
make it back on and told everyone that
it was an internal problem that caused
the ban there's nothing of real note
here but it was kind of funny it was
announced this week that Google is
ending Google Play services support for
Android Gingerbread the change will
happen in early 2017 by removing
gingerbread Google Play services will
become a little more modern in nature
and give developers more options for
building apps the number of devices that
even use gingerbread these days is only
about 1.3 percent also most app
developers don't support gingerbread
anymore anyway the latest humble bundle
is now live this bundle features tons of
games from handy games and includes
clouds in chief one and two rocket
island 1942 pacific front and plenty of
other games that would cost you about
$42 if you bought them individually you
can pay what you want and get five games
pay the three dollar minimum and get up
to eleven games or pay five dollars or
more and get the whole bundle it's a
good way to get some games on the cheap
and give to charity Google Play is
tossing a huge games apps books movies
TV and more sale at honor of Black
Friday and Cyber Monday you can get some
stuff for up to eighty percent off and
some of the titles are rather expensive
without the deals it's a good time to
stock up on some stuff if you don't
already have it we don't know how long
these deals will last or where they're
available so be sure to get them while
you can you can find links to these
deals in the written companion which is
linked in the video description below
eisenhorn xenos is an adventure game
that takes place in the Warhammer 40,000
universe is an adaptation from a book of
the same name you'll be able to explore
the world take part in various quests
and the game comes with full voice
acting the graphics are also pretty
decent unlike most Warhammer games these
days this one is a pay once title with
no in-app purchases it also has full
game controller support if that matters
to you chase bank has released its own
NFC payment application called chase pay
it's about what you'd expect from an NFC
payment app you'll be able to log into
an existing chase account and use the
cards on file to make purchases it's a
brand new thing which means there are
plenty of bugs that need to be worked
out still also the app only works at
Best Buy and a few other locations right
now although we do expect that to
increase over time it's not very good at
the moment but members of Chase Bank
should keep an eye on it gear Club is a
racing game that boasts a realistic
experience underneath of its bravado
it's a fairly standard freemium racing
game you'll race various tracks at
various locations to win various
championships above that there is a
large selection of cars to collect
optimize and upgrade the graphics are
simply astounding although other parts
of the game could use a little bit of
work it's not quite prime time just yet
but we're sure it'll get there
eventually pulse SMS is a hybrid of a
texting application and a pushbullet
competitor on its own the android app
functions as a good if slightly basic
SMS app however you can download the app
on various platforms and share the SMS
messages between them that means you can
text on your tablet or your computer if
you want to like pushbullet there is a
subscription service although you can
get a lifetime license and not have to
worry about it if you don't want to it's
a little buggy as new apps are but it's
definitely going to get better over time
microsoft solitaire collection is an
android port of the popular solitaire
games available on most microsoft
windows machines the game includes 5
