picture up on my Instagram and my
Google+ page of me and my girlfriend at
Disneyland using the oppo n3 in a kind
of a special way in order to get a
picture done I've been getting some
questions not only about how I got the
picture but the tool I use in order to
do it and as I'm finishing up my opal
and three full review I thought it would
be a good time for me to show you
exactly what that's all about
so it's Josh of gar from Andhra
Authority what's going on everybody and
as you can see here I'm going to give
you a feature focus on the O click the O
click does come in the package with the
opal n3 and it also has a battery
included so you don't have to worry
about buying one just pop that into
there and you'll be able to slide the
back cover onto the old click the only
problem I had with it is that the back
cover seems to slide off pretty easily
but putting this on a keyring since it
was able to hold everything in place is
the remedy for that now setup is pretty
easy with the O click you will be able
to have the old click nearby it is
connected via bluetooth and paired as
such and when you have the oppo n3
available to you just get into the
operating system and you can head on
over to the O click application which is
where you will do all the setup once you
get there you'll be given a quick
introduction into what it is able to do
you will be able to see that it does the
remote control for the camera and for
music it's a nice little presentation
that also shows you how to locate your
phone by double pressing on it and then
it also will be able to blink for
notification alerts the notification
alerts are not really ones that I use
very often because it's just a pulsating
light much like the skyline notification
light on the oppo n3 it's just one color
I can't really tell what different
notifications there are only that there
are notifications but from there you'll
get here and you'll be able to turn on
the various functions the remote control
for camera music locating the phone
which are the two that pretty much I
always have on and the notification
alert which like I said alright it
doesn't make too much of a difference
once you head over to the top right
you'll be able to connect it to the
phone and it will connect automatically
in your initial setup you will just
press the button on the oak click in
order for it to recognize the phone the
Bluetooth range on the oak click is
pretty standard which means that if
you're in your house let's say in your
living room and you just can't find your
phone
having the oak click on your key ring
like I do
allows you to just pick it up double
press on the middle button and it should
turn on the phone and play a loud little
tune let's say and have the phone go
nuts so that you'll be able to find it
after you find your phone you'll be able
to just either turn it off on the phone
itself or press the button to turn it
back off well that's obviously a marquee
feature for the old click but there's
one big problem with it if you walk
outside of the Bluetooth range then
these two devices lose their connections
it should be easy to get them back but
that's not really the case the
instructions state that if you press the
middle button and it glows white instead
of red then you have reestablished the
connection with the 0.3 unfortunately
that has only worked sporadically at
best more often than not I've had to go
into the actual application in the oppo
n3 go to the connection screen
re-establish the connection using the
application and then finally I'll click
with work again that is far from ideal
for anybody walking into a room trying
to find their phone but in order to get
the.oh click to actually work you have
to find the phone first before anything
else can happen now we have the up-down
left-right available here on the Oh
click and that is what you're going to
use to control your music in particular
controlling the volume and controlling
your forward or backward on the tracks
if you hit the middle button especially
after you've already had some music
playing in the native application for
the oppo n3 it will just play the music
already
you can see that that music is already
playing and if I hit the left button it
will go back and play the beginning of
this particular song I only have one
song and that's the built-in one on the
elbow and three but nonetheless you can
do other things like turn down the
volume there you go
and you notice that the responsiveness
of the buttons isn't necessarily that
great it's another issue that I've had
with the old click but it has come in
handy for the other application which is
for a camera but it is also worth noting
that these controls do not work for
other services which is a bummer for me
because I prefer to do google play music
streaming but now we come to the final
usage for the L click and that is as a
remote control for the camera now even
when the 0.3 is stationary like this and
the screen is off in standby mode you
can hold the middle button on the O
click and it will access the camera
now obviously the cameras pointed
backwards right now and if I'm trying to
take a self-portrait I needed to move
the other way around hold the up or down
button and you'll be able to move it in
that particular direction but on the
other hand if holding down the button in
order to move the camera forward and
backward is too much you can hit the
left or right button to make a go all
the way around all in one swoop in this
case we'll hit the left button and it
will move the camera all the way around
and you can see me right there press the
right button just tap that and it'll
rotate all the way back around now of
course if we have the self portrait area
here this is where the Oh clicks main
functions come in and it's awesome the
ability to just rotate the camera around
do it in just the way that you need it
to hopefully with those increments being
a little bit too big at least for my
taste and then you just press the button
and take your shot so that's a rundown
of all of the things the L click is
capable of now you know what the
functionality is but is it really a good
product to have all the time around with
your oppo n3 well as a companion it does
work really well and in those situations
where it actually works very well it's
incredibly
useful but there are some problems as
you probably suspect it's on my key ring
as you can see here and the main problem
happens when I have this in my pocket
and other things in my pocket like the
other keys happen to press what happens
to be a rather large surface area for
that middle button during that trip to
Disneyland I found my phone going off
playing music a lot and when I took my
phone out at other times the camera was
already on which means I was losing
precious battery life so that is one of
the issues I had with the okhla
expecially when it was in my pocket
because those buttons can be triggered
pretty easily by other objects and of
course the main annoyance I probably
have with it is the fact that when you
go outside of the Bluetooth range it's
hard to get it back without having the
actual phone in your hand nonetheless
though taking up a lot of time in the
elbow and three full review in order to
explain to you this little module it
comes with seems like something I should
put into a feature focus video instead
and that's exactly what I hope you guys
enjoyed today nonetheless stay tuned for
my Opel entry full review and that is
coming very soon but until then you can
check out all of the content from my
colleagues in Android and you can see a
