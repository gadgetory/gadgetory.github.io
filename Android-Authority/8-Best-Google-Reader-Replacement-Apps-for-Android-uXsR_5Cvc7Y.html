joe hindy the android authority app guy
so Google is killing off google reader
huh boo but after the intro will show
you the best google reader replacements
for android first on our list is feedly
this seems to be the one that just about
everyone is going to in fact most
reports indicate that about half a
million people have already migrated to
feedly they'll be replacing google
reader were thrown back in called
normandy which is great because we
didn't join authority or big fans of
mass effect references the app happens
to work pretty well as an RSS reader too
if you swipe to open the left panel
you'll have all your categories where
you can read based on the category or
select individual feeds to check out on
the interface itself you can swipe up
and down to go to various pages and
swipe again to mark things as read it
has a variety of views so readers can
choose whether to have a magazine layout
or a list layout in terms of google
reader replacements feedly is one of the
most powerful and most popular on our
list next on our list is google currents
this is the replacement for Google
Reader if you want to keep using
strictly Google applications it's a
pretty solid reader but it's definitely
geared more towards the average consumer
than anything else so if you like to
read things during your morning number
twos or while waiting for an appointment
google currents could be up your alley
the interface is fresh although
consuming a lot of content can take a
lot of swipes if you open up the left
column you can pick an individual feed
to check out you can also swipe to the
left and to the right to change feeds
once you've found to feed you like you
scroll up and down to check out the
stories from that bead to mark anything
read you either have to read it or you
go back to the left column press a feed
or category and Mark it all read the
popular and widely known Flipboard is up
next if you're a casual RSS user then
this is among the best Google Reader
replacements out there it features nice
animations a solid clean interface and
it's not difficult finding what you like
to read on there if you use RSS for
professional reasons you may want to
skip this one using Flipboard is pretty
easy once you get your feet set up you
open the app and swipe up and down to
flip through your various feeds then you
select one and swipe up and down through
the various stories that's essentially
it with footboard it's really easy and
it looks really good but scanning a lot
of content takes eternity so again if
you're looking to read your news like a
magazine flipboard's worth checking out
if you're one of those people who likes
to gobble up content very quickly then
you should probably look for something
else
hat tip to our senior editor Bogdan for
suggesting that we add greader pro to
the list for right now it is a
full-blown greader client however like
feedly it's working on a solution for
after google reader's death so GD reader
users can keep on using the app like
nothing ever happened the layout is
similar to that of feeley's except it's
a lot less flashy for the time being you
log into your Google Reader account
where it'll sync your feeds so with this
solution you won't have to find all your
feeds all over again you open the left
panel to view all your feeds and
categories select which one you want to
read and then you read it once you get
the hang of it and customize your
settings it really is one of the best
replacements if you like sifting through
a lot of content very quickly news360 is
one of the most interesting google
reader replacements it works as a
replacement in a sense that you can find
most of your favorite feeds and nearly
all of your favorite topics what's
different about it is it instead of
having a set list of feeds to read
news360 keeps track of articles that you
read and your thumbs up and thumbs down
and only brings you the news that you
like in case it isn't obvious this is
definitely more for the casual RSS
reader than any professional user but
it's still a pretty nice application
using it as much like using a less
graphically dense version of Flipboard
you swipe left and right to view stories
tap to view them and you can also liked
it dislike it share it and save it for
offline reading it's dead simple to use
and good for those casual readers who
just want to find something really quick
pro types who prefer having their feeds
listed probably won't like this one very
much he presses another google reader
application that has assured their users
that they'll be switching to something
new before google reader kicks the
digital bucket they said will be
cross-platform and offer nearly the same
type of functionality so if you end up
going with press you can put your google
reader info in now and it should be
saved when the switch is made that said
press is a beautiful application you
start out at the categories list then
you can select individual feeds from a
gridview once you select an article it
brings in the screen from the right if
you want to go back to the list just
swipe the article screen away it's fluid
and it looks nice it also tries very
hard to bridge that gap between the
casual and the professional user it
succeeds to an extent and it's
definitely worth checking out tattoo
offers google reader is a viable
alternative for when google reader shuts
down and has confirmed that if you
import google reader info it'll stay on
tap to after the shutdown porting the
google reader stuff is pretty easy and
it actually doesn't use google reader at
all once it's poured it in so there are
no worries there tattoo is another one
of those gorgeously designed news
aggregator
it displays each feed horizontally and
you just swipe to view the list this is
good for casual readers and
professionals alike because it has an
eye friendly interface and you can
literally race through content it has
all the features of your regular RSS
feed apps and the layout is definitely
pleasant to deal with if you're still
talking about a google reader
replacement tab who deserves to be in
that conversation last on our list is
pulse unlike most of the apps on this
list pulse has its own RSS service and
doesn't rely on google reader at all you
can port your stuff in but once it's in
its impulses system so if you decide to
go to pulse there are no worries when
Google Reader goes down here in a few
months first the good news pulse has a
beautiful interface that is emulated by
top two to a degree fees are listed
vertically and their stories are listed
horizontally so you can swipe through
them according your fees in from google
reader is actually very easy now the bad
news each category you make can be maxed
out in fact during testing I couldn't
add all of my technology feeds because I
had maxed out that category so this is
definitely something for the casual
reader and not professional RSS user go
figure that the one that the Apple
executive likes is the one that has so
much promise but is bottlenecked by
silly limitations if you take a look at
our leaderboard you can see how these
applications stack up against one
another if you don't know our ranking
system that's fine because that's not
what we do here these apps are ranked
based on their ratings in the Google
Play Store so this is how you the people
have ranked them there is no bias on our
part also we'd like to give an honorary
mention to an application called pocket
it's compatible with most of these RSS
readers and allows you to save stories
you like to read them offline this is an
excellent app if you're planning on
spending some time around places without
the web and one a good stash of stuff to
read also this is a little bit of an
early list there are a lot of good
Google Reader clients out there and
we're sure many more will find ways of
bringing RSS without google reader so if
we missed a good replacement or a great
google reader client has decided to keep
on going after greader ends feel free to
leave us a comment either here or a
written version to let everybody know
