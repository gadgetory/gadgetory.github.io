Authority and today I'm going to try not
to the question what is the Internet of
Things the Internet as we know it is
going to change today it's a massive
global network that allows people to
communicate with each other we send
emails we send instant messages we use
websites to communicate to share data
and it is the people who drive the
internet the data that we send comes
from client devices like a laptop or a
PC or a tablet or a smartphone and it go
to some servers and the servers then
transmit that data that information on
further in that sense we can say that
the entities made up of three major
actors the people the client devices
they use and the servers but a whole new
category of actor is being added to the
Internet they've been unglamorous Lee
called things hence the term instead of
things so what is a thing we really do
any object that has a sensor attached to
it that can transmit the data from that
sensor further up into the Internet into
the cloud where it can be analyzed and
used to make decisions examples of such
centers include temperature sensors
traffic sensors flow rate sensors energy
usage monitors and so on
a temperature sensor can be placed in a
smart thermostat a smart electricity
usage meter can be wired into a house or
a traffic monitor can be placed into a
traffic signal these things then send
data further up the chain and either a
person or a piece of computer software
makes a decision based on that data it
won't be long and maybe it's already
happened but there will be more things
on the internet sending data around an
actual people using Internet enabled
devices the cell phone the internet
email social media and smart phones have
all changed the way we do things both at
a personal level and at a business level
clearly the Internet of Things will do
the same thing our personal lives and
our professional lives will be affected
how will be affected isn't fully it
understood but for sure it will change
things there are several big challenges
ahead for the embryonic Internet of
thing
there are technological challenges in
terms of the actual devices that collect
and send data these challenges includes
both hardware and software issues like
battery life maintenance
interoperability incompatibility there
are big data issues around building
systems that can produce all this data
and use it to achieve meaningful tasks
there are also security and privacy
problems who wants to have a smart home
that can be hacked nobody does
or worse still a smart hospital that can
be breached remotely as we move from the
individual smart homes to smart cities
which have smart transport systems and
smart infrastructure then all these
issues become more complex and more
difficult to solve correctly the reality
of the intent of things from a consumer
point of view to the giant leap forward
this year when Samsung's co-ceo took to
the stage at CES 2015 to declare that
all Samsung products will be instead of
things enabled within five years
if 2020 sounds like a long way off to
you he also said that 90% of Samsung's
products would be able to connect to the
web by 2017 Samsung's plans are for
every washing machine every
air-conditioning unit and every
microwave oven to be IOT enabled and
five years from now every single piece
of Samsung Hardware will be an IOT
device whether it is an air purifier or
an oven in his speech the co-ceo also
highlighted that the IOT experience
needs to be seamless for the consumer
the IOT experience has traditionalists I
predict this journey to the seamless
experience will be quite bumpy however
there are companies like arm who are
trying their best to smooth out the road
as we go towards the end of 2014 arm
announced a new operating system to
boost the development of IOT devices
called MV OS it's a free operating
system for arms cortex-m range of
microcontrollers one of the key points
about M bed OS is that it supports the
important IOT protocols and allows
anybody from a hobbyist developer to a
multimillion-dollar corporation to prote
and develop IOT devices embed OS will
include all the functionality needed to
create an IOT device and to transmit
that data to the cloud it supports a lot
of different communication stacks
including ipv4 ipv6 6lowpan Bluetooth
Wi-Fi 2g GSM and 3G the interesting
thing about embed OS is that it falls
into a very special class of operating
system when we think about a smart phone
it comes with an operating system like
Android and Android itself is built on
Linux and Linux is what we call a
multitasking operating system and the
resources in a modern-day smartphone are
quite large you've got a quad core maybe
an octa-core processor core GPU you've
got one gigs to gigs three gigs of ram
maybe eight gigs of internal storage and
so on a typical IOT device will have a
processor that runs at just 100
megahertz not 1.5 gigahertz or 2
gigahertz like a smart phone it'll only
have maybe 4 K of memory or 96 K of
memory in the biggest case is 256 K of
memory and that's very different to 3
gigabytes of memory that we see in a
smart phone it only have a tiny bit of
storage maybe 32 K 64 K or flash storage
that means that Internet of Things
devices need a special type of operating
system so I said there were 4 types of
operating system the multitasking
operating system is like Android and
like Linux
there's another type of operating system
which is called artists or a real-time
operating system these are found in very
small debated devices that you're
getting cars in planes and industrial
applications and they are specialty type
of operating system that worries about
how the scheduler works how things
happen in what order they happen where
they happen within a certain time
constraint now that sounds good for IOT
but that kind of system can be quite
battery hungry or not very power
efficient another approach is called the
bare metal approach it really isn't an
operating system in itself basically you
have a loop that goes round round and
round and round around for infinity and
you run your code inside that loop
checking everything and just doing
everything
if you've used an Arduino you'll be
familiar with that kind of
here the problem is that can't be
maintained once the project gets
particularly large it also doesn't allow
for scheduling it doesn't allow for
certain other things as well so it has
its limitations and that brings us to
the fourth type of operating system
which is a low-power operating system an
operating system is designed just to
conserve power while performing its
functions typically these operating
systems are event-driven rather than
using polling always checking to see
what's going on and that's the kind of
category that the embed OS fits into
it's very useful for interesting devices
so what does the init of things look
like in terms of its structure it's
quite simple at the thing end you have a
small device which monitors something a
door a window heart rate monitor a
temperature monitor whatever these
devices transmit that data to another
more complicated device it could be a
smartphone it could be a control unit of
some kind like a smart thermostat or it
could be a dedicated device that acts as
a gateway to the Internet this last
category of device is known as an IOT
gateway they are important because the
sensors often don't have a direct
connection to the Internet they probably
only have bluetooth or some other
low-power connectivity like ZigBee once
the IOT gateway has received the data
from the sensor it can be sent further
up into the cloud part of arm strategy
can be seen with its MBOs device server
while a web server would accept
connections from web browsers running on
pcs or smartphones the embed OS device
server handles connections from IOT
devices it uses open source protocols
including HTTP for data communication
and for device management the embed OS
device server would sit behind an IOT
gateway and would use the Gateway to
talk to the IOT devices it can also send
the collected data higher up into the
cloud imagine you wanted to control the
temperature in your house your
air-conditioning unit will be monitoring
the temperature and either keeping it at
a certain level or it would be
programmed to come on at a set hour this
data is collected and sent up to the
cloud by
IOT gateway via a server for you to
monitor via the web or on your
smartphone if you manage to get out of
work early you might want to switch on
the air-conditioning earlier so that the
house is nice and cool when you arrive
you can send that command via your smart
phone and it will be relayed back down
the chain to the unit you can imagine
other scenarios about the same thing to
do with traffic control street lighting
and so on and so on this all sounds very
utopian but of course there are dangers
with all these devices sending data and
receiving commands it won't be long
before the hackers are drawn in a recent
security report from Intel's McAfee labs
singled out IOT as a potential area for
security problems the report says that
IOT rated attacks will increase due to
the predicted fast growth of the number
of connected devices many of which will
unfortunately have poor levels of
security in 2013 at a white hat security
conference it was demonstrated that you
could hack webcams that were connected
to the Internet and the hackers were
able to watch what was going on with the
webcams last year there were several
different reports about baby monitors
that had been hacked and the attackers
were watching the video feed of the
babies in their rooms in extreme cases
they were even screaming at the babies
and waking them up and frightening them
last year the BBC ran a story about a
website that was dedicated just a
streaming video feed from hacked webcams
and baby monitors this is creepy and
quite disturbing but unfortunately it's
the world that we live in however moving
on another important concept of the
Internet of Things is m2m or machine to
machine at one level
m2m is what it says it is a way for one
machine to talk to another machine
however in this context it means how a
connected device talks to the cloud it
also includes how these devices are
managed
m2m isn't new in the sense that we are
all used to one device talking to
another file transfers over Bluetooth
app updates over Wi-Fi even emails are
examples of how one machine talks to
another machine to achieve a specific
task however the special thing about m2m
in terms of Intel
things is that these connected devices
have a a low power usage they aren't
always on or awake and see are limited
in terms of their resources like
processing power and memory and so on
all this technology sounds great for the
consumer but probably the big money is
to be made on larger scale projects
smart building smart cities and IOT
navels businesses are where the large
contracts are to be one whole
infrastructures enabled for IOT or
end-to-end business processes using IOT
in every step everything from garbage to
electricity from trams to taxes from
parcels to production lines can be built
to use IOT the initial investment will
be higher for businesses however the
benefits will likely save money in the
long term so the IOT revolution has just
started and there going to be lots of
advancements over the next few years
it's going to be interesting to watch
the journey until we reach the seamless
IOT experience
I'm sure along the way we're going to
see some great innovation coming from
some surprising sources my name is Gary
soon from Andrew Authority I hope you
enjoyed this video if you did please
give it a thumbs up also please use the
comment below to tell me what you think
about IOT also don't forget to subscribe
to anger Authority's YouTube channel and
as for me I'll see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
