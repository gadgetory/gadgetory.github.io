brought to you by the LG g3 one thing we
definitely need our smartphones to be
able to do is multitask after all our
lives can be so busy that we need to be
able to do one thing at the same time as
doing another like say looking up a
phone number and then being able to dial
it right away without having to memorize
it in our heads that's a pretty simple
example but our smart phones are perfect
ways of being able to do that so it's
Joshua card from Android authority
what's going on everybody and this is a
look at multitasking on the LG g3
alright so here we are with the LG g3
and we're going to jump right into the
multitasking capability so we'll just
unlock the phone and basically you have
a number of different tools in order to
multitask on the g3 and one of them is a
pretty classic one the recent apps
screen and it's part of the soft keys
down here in the nav bar just go ahead
and press that and we have a slew of
different applications already open you
can maybe do a 2x2 grid or in this case
we have a 3x3 grid and it allows you to
take a look at a number of different
applications at once and of course if
you zoom in you have the entire line to
go through it's just a way for you to
get a better look at the applications
that you may be using at the time but
what if you want to be able to keep the
screen that you're looking at but still
be able to perform some functions on the
side wall that is where Acushla
applications come into play qslide
applications as I mentioned before are a
little shade in the notification
drop-down that do hide these elements if
you want more space right here in the
notification shade and it is a great
idea that LG put in in order to hide
those elements so they don't really
clutter up the screen so when you hit
qslide right there you have a number of
different applications right here and
these are all the ones that you can use
you might be able to draft a quick email
check the calendar see what day is
coming up for you if you're busy on a
particular day even watch a video on top
of what you're already doing you even
have a browser if you so wish to browse
a little bit and take a quick look at
something now you might have to look up
like say a Wikipedia entry or a
dictionary entry but the example that
I'll use is with the same one that I
gave in the previous one and that's this
location where I love to buy and drink
tea so we have the number right here
that is
available and if I wanted to dial it
very quickly I would open the phone
qslide application right here and easily
be able to dial the number in so that is
one of the better ways of being able to
just quickly get to a number let's say
using the Q side app for the phone and
the other way around works as well if
you have the phone open we can open up
the browser Q side application and we'll
have the number right there in the Q
slide browser if I hold the back button
right here I'll be able to pick from a
small list but a effective list of
applications to be able to get some
tasks done I can browse wild messaging
or looking at a map or even by watching
YouTube which is the example I'll show
right now
I'll throw if the browser on the top
there and then I'll throw YouTube on the
bottom it's nice and quick and once you
have it available you can't actually
change the amount of space that both
windows take up you'll see I have this
page right here that I've had queued up
for the last two examples already and
then I have a video queued up here good
old Joe with the Google Play weekly
video for this week and from there we
basically have just an easy way of
looking at two different applications at
once and being able to enjoy YouTube
video in this case and browsing the
Internet at the same time if you were to
tap on the middle you do have some
options here to switch them to open up
other applications if you so choose and
also depending on which section you have
open you can always click this third
button in order to make it fullscreen
again to go back to a singular app
interface but if I go horizontally right
here they also move accordingly
so this might not be the best example
for YouTube but you can still do this if
you're looking at say a map or messaging
other people using jima or hangouts one
final function that I'll show you from
the dual window is the ability to have a
comp up in particular situations
automatically now you do have to use the
built-in email application in order for
this to work but once you have an email
that has an attachment on there like say
a picture which is what is used in this
situation then you are going to be able
to hit that attachment and it will
automatically open up the gallery in
order for you to see the picture while
still holding your place inside of the
email and you can see that right here
there you go the dual window comes up
and we have our one
for Android Authority logo on the bottom
but I still have the email at the top
ready for me to do any replies or
anything with it while still being able
to look at the photo on the bottom stay
