dominated the affordable flagship space
by delivering powerful phones at a
fraction of the cost and up until now
there hasn't been anyone to really
challenge them honors latest smartphone
is looking to step into the ring'
oneplus but does it have what it takes
to challenge the longtime champion this
is the honor of view 10 versus the 1 + 5
t you don't have to look very far to see
why these two phones draw a lot of
comparisons in terms of hardware they're
very very similar the honor of U 10 + 1
+ 5 t both have metal bodies with smooth
finishes identically place plastic
antenna lines dual cameras and many will
probably say they have a lot of
resemblances to the iPhone even if they
aren't the most unique design see on
review 10 + 1 + 5 t are good-looking
phones and they're very well-constructed
the only major difference in design is
the 1 + 5 t has a curvier more
pebble-like shape that feels a little
more comfortable and ergonomic the sides
also taper down to a thin edge so the
phone feels a lot thinner than it
actually is button and port placement
are also fairly similar power and volume
keys are on the sides and on the bottom
are the single bottom firing speakers
USB type-c ports and they both have a
headphone jack with the 1 + 5 t you of
course get the notification slider which
has always sort of been a trademark of
oneplus devices and it makes it really
easy to switch between androids
different ring profiles another Hardware
difference that you'll find is the honor
butan has an IR blaster which is a
feature you don't really see anymore on
smartphones but it's there if you want
to use your phone as a universal remote
as for fingerprint sensors they both
have very fast and accurate fingerprint
sensors but the honor of you tends is on
the front and doubles as a solid state
home button whereas oneplus made the
switch to a rear-mounted fingerprint
sensor in order to make way for a larger
screen and smaller bezels personally I
like oneplus is implementation better
it's more spacious and I'm just a fan of
rear-facing fingerprint sensors in
general because of how much easier it is
to unlock the phone when pulling it out
of your pocket under the hood the honor
View 10 + 1 + 5 t are packing some
pretty top-tier specs the honor of you
tin has Huawei's very powerful in-house
chipset with akhirin 9
and six gigs of ram and the one plus 5t
has the more typical snapdragon 835
processor with either six or eight
gigabytes of RAM depending on storage
performance wise they're both extremely
fast phones whether you're just casually
reading emails browsing the web checking
social media watching YouTube or playing
games you'll have a pretty hard time
slowing either one of these phones down
what makes the cur√© 970 in the butan
special though aside from being a very
powerful processor is its NTU which
gives faster image processing and
recognition better performance with AI
apps better battery life and also help
with degradation of performance over
time but obviously we'll have to wait
and see how well that actually holds up
battery life however is an area where
you'll notice an immediate impact from
the NP you having a large three thousand
seven hundred fifty milliamp hour
battery makes a significant difference
as well but the honor of uten has no
problems lasting me a full day with
screen on time consistently hitting the
five to six hour mark the oneplus 5ts
3300 milliamp hour battery is no slouch
either as I'm able to get pretty much
the same screen on time numbers with the
same exact usage no wireless charging on
either phone unfortunately due to the
metal designs but I don't think it's
that big of a deal since they're both
really quick to charge especially the
one plus 5t with its - charging
technology which is still one of the
fastest and most efficient quick
charging methods out there on the front
they both have one of the most current
smartphone trends with 18 by 9 screens
that are surrounded by very thin bezels
the honor of utens display measures in
at five point nine nine inches and the
five t is only marginally larger at six
point zero one inches they both however
have the same screen resolution of 2160
by 1080 the big difference here is that
the view 10 uses an IPS panel and the 1
+ 5 t uses AMOLED but the IPS panel on
the v10 is surprisingly good and keeps
up very well with a 5 TS display it's
vibrant
it's colorful and the black levels are
very good for an IPS screen I still
prefer the contrast and inky beat blacks
ugly 5 T's display but both these
screens look fantastic and the fact that
they're 1080p doesn't really bother me
at all the software experiences is
really what differentiates these two
phones the most the honor of you 10
ships with
injured 8.0 Oreo with emui 8.0 on top
which drastically changes the Android
experience and if you couldn't tell it's
pretty heavily inspired by iOS with the
way it looks and some of the features
that it has aesthetically emui isn't my
favorite skin but it does have some
pretty nice features like the swipe up
for quick shortcuts on the lockscreen a
built in theme engine and swipe gestures
on the home button that can be used to
navigate the software in place of the
on-screen navigation keys I think the
biggest issue with the butan software is
how much bloatware comes pre-installed
most of it can be uninstalled but it's a
stark contrast to the 1 plus 5t software
which doesn't have any bloatware at all
oxygen OS is also a very stock like
Android experience but it sort of takes
it to the next level by giving you a ton
of customization options there's a bunch
of different gesture controls custom
accent colors a light or dark mode and a
whole lot more it's so seamlessly
integrated that it feels like a natural
part of Android and that's what I love
most about it if you're running the
latest Oreo beta you'll also get iPhone
10 like swipe gestures to navigate the
OS instead of the on-screen soft keys on
the back side you'll find dual cameras
on both the honor view 10 and the 1 + 5
t the on review tin has a 16 megapixel
primary shooter and a secondary 20 mega
pixel monochrome sensor to help pull in
more detail both of which have a bright
F 1.8 aperture the 1 + 5 t also has a 16
megapixel primary shooter and a
secondary 20 megapixel camera with a
slightly wider F 1.7 aperture but both
lenses are RGB and the secondary sensor
is designed to help improve low-light
performance if you want a camera that
offers a ton of features and modes the
honor butan will be the way to go my
favorite and most useful feature of the
view 10 is the wide aperture mode which
we've seen on previous Huawei and honor'
phones but it's an awesome feature and I
love being able to adjust the bokeh
effect on my photos after the fact the
oneplus 5ts approach is much more
simplistic you won't find too many modes
here outside of the typical beauty mode
and a portrait mode for that added depth
of field to your photos in terms of
picture quality they're pretty similar
when it comes to sharpness detail and
overall dynamic range where you'll
notice the biggest difference is
in the color reproduction the honor of
Eton typically produces warmer results
and more natural-looking colors while
the five T tends to be cooler but the
colors are much more saturated now the
camera is amazing in low light but the
honor of utens photos in low-light are
usually brighter giving you more details
especially in the shadows when it comes
to deciding between these two phones
price and hardware isn't going to play a
huge factor because they're both very
competitively priced and the majority of
the hardware is pretty similar they both
have sleek metal designs 18 by 9
displays dual cameras and fantastic
battery life what it's really gonna come
down to is the software experiences
because that's what separates these two
phones the most as solid of a smartphone
as the Vue 10 is the 1 + 5 t would still
be my pick as the winner in this
comparison simply because I love the
clean and stock like experience of
oxygen OS and the high level of
customization that comes with it but
what smartphone would you pick would you
pick the honor view 10 or the 1 + 5 t
