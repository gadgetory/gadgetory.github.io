Joe handy the Android authority app guy
after the intro will show you everything
you need to know about the new Opera
browser let's start with some new
features the first thing you'll notice
when you open up the new opera browser
is the speed dial feature this is kind
of like a bookmarks page you can add
frequently visited sites visit the Opera
Mobile store and even supports folders
right next to that is the discover
feature it has the bones of being a
really great feature it's essentially a
newsfeed that lets you check out some
big news from various topics you can
change the topics at displays to show
off the stuff that you're interested in
unfortunately you can't narrow it down
any further than that so you may be
stuck with generic news
perhaps our favorite new feature is the
off road feature when activated this
nifty feature loads only the essential
content of a website this allows for a
much faster browsing experience and if
you're in an area with spotty internet
connection it can help load those
websites the 2g coverage probably
wouldn't normally load along with these
new features opera has a full-featured
web browsing experience
it definitely loads websites faster than
the old opera did and with things like a
dedicated download manager and a new
more ergonomic design it makes the Opera
experience a lot better than it used to
be the new design deserves some mention
here it goes with the standard top bar
with the address bar the tabs button and
the menu button all at the top in the
settings menu you can actually change
this to move all this stuff to the
bottom of the screen if you prefer
bottom bars to the left of the address
bar is a plus button where you can save
a page for offline viewing or add it to
your speed dial which is pretty nifty
you can also share webpages through the
menu button if you enjoy doing that as
mentioned there are no more bookmarks as
this functionality has been replaced by
speed dial overall though the design is
definitely cleaner and more friendly to
the either the old opera was it borrows
a few design elements from chrome but
that's not necessarily a bad thing why
we would have liked to have seen
something a little more dynamic we
cannot complain the simplicity makes
opera that much easier to use there is a
lot to like about opera the speed dial
feature is actually really awesome once
you get used to it and once you get it
set up for you granted many will still
swear by the bookmark system but usually
for bookmarks you have to open a menu
and scroll through them opera puts all
of that right in the front for easy
access off-road mode is definitely one
of the better features for any web
browser it strips down the website to
its bare essentials and loads
leave that this can't be useful if your
internet connection is spotty and you
still want snappy web browsing it can
also be used by those who are on limited
data plans to help save data by not
loading unnecessary elements we also
enjoyed the ease of use you can get
anywhere an opera from anywhere an opera
relatively quickly you are never more
than two clicks away from any feature in
opera this made it field feather-light
as getting to things like speed dial or
browser history is excruciating ly
simple which we found to be rather
wonderful opera like all software isn't
flawless there were a couple of things
we actually didn't like first and
foremost on some larger websites with a
lot of content scrolling can get a
little jumpy until opera loads the full
site so on a few occasions you might be
stuck waiting for the site to load all
the way before smooth scrolling can
happen the only other real downside to
opera is its Discoverer tab it has so
much promise and if we're more
customizable it'd be a feature we could
rave about unfortunately in an app who's
strongest feature is simplicity
Discoverer suffers from being too simple
aside from these minor issues we found
that opera was an enjoyable browsing
experience it's definitely better than
it used to be which is great news for
opera fans it still ranks among the best
web browsers out there so if you're
starting to get tired of the one you're
using it's worth giving opera a shot
