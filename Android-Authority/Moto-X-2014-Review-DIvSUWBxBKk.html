brought to you by Norton security last
year we saw the return of Motorola and
it was a sweet one it was with the phone
that championed experience over
specifications personalization over
cookie cutting and it defied users to
reevaluate what they thought made of
smartphone a flagship and this year
despite some managerial and logistical
changes within the company itself
Motorola has brought the follow-up and I
was finally able to get the version I
wanted so it's Joshua Vergara from
Android authority what's going on
everybody and this is the Moto X just as
important as the customization options
are the updates to what keeps it all
together
a new metallic frame keeps the 2.5 D
glass front kept together with whatever
backing you decide on a bump up to a
larger screen allows for even better
viewing and handling experiences dual
front speaker grilles allow for another
area of color customization and the
Motorola logo on the back has been
enlarged and given prime positioning
under the optics that include a dual
ring flash the curve on the back harkens
back to the original design making
economics a continued focus the feel of
different materials for the backing will
dictate the grip I have felt all the
material choices and have had little
issue with any of them grip on the wood
options are more than adequate the
leather sticks quite well to the palm
and the plastic backings all feel very
familiar one issue I have with the
handling however is the fact that the
sides have been made very thin in order
to accommodate the curve due to the
smoother feel of the metal the thinness
can make side gripping a bit difficult
it's a small handling hurdle to get over
but it was there all in all the general
shape of the phone is a continuation of
Motorola's already well-received design
language further improved by a better
frame and your own customizations
thankfully all material choices have
been made available from the start this
time around so creating a phone that is
really yours is easy via the Moto maker
plastic leather and a bunch of different
color combinations including accents
help put together a fully personalized
phone while the only gripe I might have
involves the Motorola logo because it
kind of flashes the branding a little
too much it's definitely far from a
deal-breaker though the original Moto X
was heralded for not being a very large
phone this iteration has been bumped up
to what can be considered the industry
standard 5.2 inches
is the size now for the screen and it
brings 1080p resolution at 424 pixels
per inch AMOLED technology is also used
here bringing the kind of color
saturation and contrast that you'd
expect from it but its usage is also
advantageous for the active display
which only activates the needed pixels
to show the time and the notifications
that you get sharpness is where it
should be
making text easy to read on here and
things like media and games are all
enjoyable on this size screen the specs
underneath the hood happen to keep up
with the notion that the Moto X isn't
the bleeding edge but then again it
doesn't need to be the Snapdragon 805
does not make an appearance here but the
801 does bringing 2.5 gigahertz backed
by the audrina 330 and two gigabytes of
RAM this is not the absolute best
performance package available right now
but it still does a great job of helping
the phone fly through its elements
seriously the speed on this almost
completely stock version of Android is
easily felt especially when going
through applications using the recent
apps screen even with Motorola's
additions put in there is little you can
do to really slow down this phone are
you going to be easily playing the most
advanced Android games no but that isn't
the focus of the Moto X and in all other
respects it still handles the job as
well as it should when it comes to
hardware there are a few places that
modal held back on but they are clearly
made up for in other details onboard
storage comes in 16 or 32 gigabyte
flavors but there is no microsd card
slot for expansion this phone is already
available for all major carriers though
a pure edition of the Moto X is
available for anyone that wants it
unlocked call quality then is still as
good as you'd expect motorola to make it
a robust microphone setup ensures that
audio capture sounds great even though
there are two indentations for what
looked like front-facing speakers in
reality only the bottom one is a speaker
but that being said this front facing
speaker on the Moto X is still a better
performer than anyone's that might be
found on the Raider or even on the
bottom
speaking of audio captured the same
voice recognition hardware and software
returns and is even better this time
around
perhaps the best new feature of the
voice service is the ability to pick
your own phrase even in noisy
environments still the Moto X is able to
pick up the phrase and then activate the
voice commands and then on the corners
of the phone is an infrared sensor array
that can recognize your hand
over the phone a wave over the phone
while a call is coming in will silence
the ring but simply waving a hand over
the phone will turn on the active
display making it easier to find out
what's going on battery life requires
another compromise on motos part as they
kept the unit at only 2300 milliamp
hours which will only hit a day and a
half with lower to moderate usage he can
get the row solid day but you'll
probably be worried about running out of
juice more often than not near the end
of that day if there was one real point
of contention with the original Moto X
it was with the camera despite an
easy-to-access camera app via a couple
of twisting motions it wasn't a very
high quality performer but this time
around we have a 13 megapixel shooter
and a dual LED flash that is actually
wrapped around the optics which is
pretty cool as far as the app goes it's
still quite minimalistic with only a few
different options available via swipes
the modes include HDR panorama and a
burst mode that activates when you hold
down instead of tapping to take a shot
4k video recording is also available and
in the right conditions does get quite a
bit of detail the problem is that it is
not a default setting focusing in the
app requires dragging the focal points
where you want it to be and that's a bit
cumbersome especially when you're trying
to take shots with one hand so I would
have preferred the tap to shoot to
handle the focus and exposure just
seconds before taking the picture
nonetheless the photo taking experience
is ultimately still pretty easy on the
Moto X but the quality does leave a
little bit more to be desired still the
performance and bright environments is
nicely detailed but the colour
reproduction can be hit and miss for the
most part you'll get a usable image but
it might take you a few tries it's in
lower light that I actually found there
to be some higher than average
performance higher ISO limits allow for
a pretty good looking image without the
incredible amounts of noise and blur and
that's even without the flash the flash
though ingeniously wrapped around the
optics are still quite harsh and can
actually bleed some light into the image
due to how close they are to the optics
so though it's far from the best camera
available on Android right now I would
say that the new Moto X has improved on
the camera performance from before and
other concessions aside though a much
better camera experience would have been
a huge boost for this phone anyone
worried that Motorola is exit from
Google's umbrella would change the
software experience need not worry with
this Moto X it is still the very stock
like Android experience with motos
actually very handy
anyone that has used say a Nexus or any
stock Android build will feel right at
home here home screens app drawer
notification drop-down with the quick
settings shade and the Google now
launcher brings the second home screen
experience it's in Moto's own editions
that we find some actually useful extras
we have the modal voice service and the
active display that I've already touched
on but some assist abilities make the
phone aware of where you are and react
accordingly connect your phone to an
audio source in your car and you will
automatically play music when it detects
that you're on the road set it to know
when your meetings are and the phone
will be silent during those important
times and during the night it will go
silent so as to not disturb you what I
love about the software experience
especially as an original motox user are
the small improvements being able to
pick your own voice activation phrase is
the right step forward from the already
reliable ok Google now in the active
display you can now select different
notifications and swipe to either side
to dismiss them and even the date is
displayed up top when you are tapping
down to use the active display the speed
of pretty much a fully stock Android
keeps things really snappy but the
additions are undeniably useful and
honestly really fun speaking of software
and before I get into the end of this
review I do want to talk to you guys a
little bit about our sponsor for this
video Noren security a trusted name and
device protection that you probably are
familiar with already with norm security
you will get total protection from all
of the threats on the internet including
malware viruses ID theft and financial
scams and with normal security you can
have the peace of mind browsing and
enjoying the internet that you deserve
but from there with all of the different
devices that we now have in our lives
these days we also need to up the ante
when it comes to our security and that's
exactly what Norton security can do with
multi device protection you can install
norm security on your desktop your
laptop your tablet your smart phone yes
even the musty moto X that I have in
this review and you could have Norton
security protect you across all of them
with the same level of security that you
need and with a 100% money back
guarantee you can rest assured that with
norton security all of your devices will
remain virus free or your money back for
more information on norton security and
what it can do for all of your different
devices whether they be computers or
android devices tablets or smartphones
make sure you check the description
below for links and even more info
and remember that northern security has
your back when it comes to your safety
on the internet the Moto X is now
available for any and all contract plans
for below the usual premium price $99
for a phone that blurs the line of
flagship it's great to see that it
doesn't have the flagship price but if
you want to have a fully unlocked pure
edition Moto X the total price will
start at $4.99 adding bamboo and 32
gigabytes of storage for my version
brought the phone up to just over $600
so be aware that customization comes at
a price especially with its now standard
screen size it falls in the realm of
current flagship competitors like the
Samsung Galaxy s5 and the Sony Xperia z3
for a lower price you might get slightly
lower specs but the margin is small and
almost negligible if Moto's experience
better speaks to you and so there you
have it
the Moto X it's hard not to like a phone
when you've made it exactly the way you
want it in the past that might have been
the saving grace for what could have
been considered a sub flagship device
but now the Moto X has matured and
gotten its foot squarely in the top-tier
door a better spec all-around keeps it
as speedy as its competitors if not more
because of its decidedly Spartan Android
build and where the Moto X fall short it
doesn't fall far at all yes we would
have liked a bigger battery we would
have liked the bleeding edge in
processing power and yes we could have
done with a more robust camera
experience but for all intents and
purposes the sum of its parts is what
makes the Moto X such an attractive
package it's not about keeping up with
the Joneses it's about Motorola sticking
to their guns as to what makes a great
Android experience and in the case of
this Moto X they have definitely
succeeded as always thank you guys very
