continues to go round moto tries to take
its original design and inject some new
features into it but is it enough to
really upgrade from the original moto
360
well it's Java gar from Android
authority what's going on everybody and
this is a full review of the Moto 360
second generation now quick disclaimer I
did design the Moto 360 that I'm using
for this review so the fact that I made
it look the way that I wanted to could
be contributing to the fact that I think
this is actually a really great-looking
SmartWatch speaking factually however
the Moto 360 now has a new body to it
it's no longer just an Oreo that's
sitting on your wrist now there are nubs
on the top and bottom that make
replacing the watch strap incredibly
easy but the thing about those nubs also
is that they're really not all that shy
about even being there obviously with an
Android wear SmartWatch you're going to
have a large body and this is just over
11 millimeters in its size and this
particular one is a 46 millimeter body
which is kind of large for a lot of
people out there but luckily there is a
42 millimeter variety available for
anyone with smaller wrists but overall
if you're going to have a big body on a
device then the other elements
surrounding it should probably reflect
that and that's exactly what those nubs
do with the rigid lines that do fit in
very well with the rigidity of the
overall body construction Gorilla Glass
3 covers the front and you have a button
at the 2 o'clock position with the Moto
logo overall the thing that I liked the
most about the moto 360 2nd generation
is that it really isn't all that shy
about its appearance yes you're going to
get a big SmartWatch here and everything
about this watch pretty much screams
that particular sentiment this entire
watch looks very industrial and Moto has
done a good job of basically owning the
fact that well when you buy a Moto 360
in 46 millimeters it's going to be a
large device no matter which way you put
it as we get into the display
you guys already see it on the bottom
there the flat tire yes there are a lot
of people out there who really dislike
the flat tire but I happen to think that
it is actually a defining trait of a
Moto SmartWatch after all Moto has tried
to explain it by saying that the flat
tire on the bottom here is for the
ambient light sensor which is true but
that it also allows for the entire
screen to have a smaller bezel that
being said however 360 by 360 total
resolution
is available in the screen right here in
a LCD construction now this particular
screen does look quite nice in pretty
much every situation and the ambient
light sensor makes it pretty easy for it
to dim down in darker situations that
said even at slowest setting it can be
enough to annoy people who are right
next to you so you are probably going to
have to provide some inputs on turning
on the theater mode or just turning down
or turning off the screen in general
that said outside it is still very easy
to view and with the ambient light
sensor once again it will brighten up if
the conditions are a little bit too hard
for you to read what is already a pretty
good screen performance on the second
generation moto 360 is about where you
would expect it to be because you get
the de facto performance package
underneath the snapdragon 400 along with
half a gigabyte of RAM and four
gigabytes of on-board storage if you do
want to move some media on to it but
really going through all of the
different cards that Google now
suggestions your notifications and even
the occasional application if you have
one installed alongside your smartphone
application that is pretty much the
standard experience I have had no
problems on here and even though there
were very tiny moments of stutter on
here they were very far and few between
and not enough for us to think that
performance was lagging on the Moto 360
where we did have some issues was in
voice recognition which is a bit
uncharacteristic of a company like
Motorola that said the Moto 360 second
generation even in normal environments
had some trouble registering the ok
Google sound we had to say it a few
extra times just to finally get the
watch to recognize it and start taking
our general voice command and even
though this is mostly excusable it did
happen a few more times so we had to
mention it in this review when it comes
to hardware we do have the first usual
component to an Android wear SmartWatch
and that would be the heart rate sensor
on the back which performs pretty much
as well as it should that said when it
comes to fitness you do have the Moto
body application which has to also be
installed on your smartphone and it will
be able to track your calories burn via
the steps that you've taken usually
these numbers are pretty arbitrary but
at least it gives you a small snapshot
into just how much you are actually
moving throughout the day and despite
the ip67 rating because of the leather
band that you may or may not be getting
with the Moto 360 you're probably going
to be taking this watch off before you
get into any water-based situations like
taking a shower anyway so even though it
is nice that a splash is not going to
make it malfunction you're also not
going to be wearing it into a pool for
example any time soon and we also
already mentioned the issues with voice
recognition but we do have to mention
that the microphone is available on the
bottom left of it for the most part if
we thought we had some trouble getting
ok Google to really register on here we
just have to talk directly into that
area and it did happen to work a little
bit better and finally in battery we do
have to mention the great wireless
charging solution that returns from the
original moto 360
it's a doc and you are able to just live
the watch on its side right onto it and
then you'll be able to charge in about
an hour and a half from 0 to 100 but the
best part about it is that while it's
charging the 400 milli amp hour unit
underneath you will also get a bedside
clock because it goes into a landscape
mode making the watch actually useful
even when it's not on your wrist
but in battery life it is still a pretty
standard affair you're going to be
charging the Moto 360 pretty much
nightly and you're not going to get much
more than a day and a half if at that
turning off the always screen on
function in the settings does help a
little bit but you're still not going to
get the kind of longevity that we hope
smartwatches can get pretty soon and
finally in software you get Android wear
which is pretty much what you would
expect from any other Android wear
device you go through all of the
different cards and suggestions and
notifications with some control
available when you swipe over to the
side now responding to messages using
your voice is still really awesome and
that is a core function of Google on
your wrist and then you also have a
number of applications that might be
installed alongside the ones that are
available in your smartphone moto also
tries to put in some of its own flavor
including a number of watch faces and
you can even construct one yourself
which is a nice extra layer of
customization to the Moto 360 2nd gen
the base model for the Moto 360
second-generation comes in at 299
dollars without the additions like the
patterned bezel for 20 dollars the gold
body for $30 and metal bands for 50 now
while the price hike can be a bit of a
bummer changes in the overall design of
the Moto 360 and the Moto maker
experience especially keep the watch
from feeling like a forced acceptance
because you are responsible for how it
turns out and that is really important
because underneath the surface you get
pretty much Android wear once again
without
anymore injections by motorola so if the
shell of what Android wear is is the
most important part of what is being
presented then the Moto 360 definitely
deserves to be up there as one of the
best ones because you make it look the
way you want as always thank you guys
very much for watching and I hope you
enjoyed this review of the Moto 360
second-generation it is a great
SmartWatch and I personally love the
look of it but that's also because I
designed it myself so keep it tuned to
Android 34 even more about the Moto 360
