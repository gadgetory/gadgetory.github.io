andrew authority and welcome to a brand
new series here on the channel that we
like to call camera 360 on this show
we're gonna be breaking down a
smartphone camera in about three minutes
time we're gonna give you the gist of
what you need to know while keeping
everything short and sweet we're going
to talk about the camera app the
features and of course the image quality
today's smartphone is the huawei mate 20
pro so let's go ahead and jump right in
just in case you need a quick refresher
on the camera specs the mate Tony Pro is
packin three cameras on the rear there's
a primary 40 mega pixel wide angle lens
at F 1.8 aperture a 20 megapixel ultra
wide-angle at F 2.2 and an 8 megapixel
telephoto at F 2.4 the cameras also
feature Huawei's AI image stabilization
4k video recording at 30fps and laser
autofocus the front-facing shooter is 24
megapixels at F 2.0 and is accompanied
by 3d depth sensors if you've used other
Huawei devices like a p20 or p 20 pro
you'll feel right at home with the
camera app on the mate 20 pro it's
straightforward easy to use and has an
abundance of features aperture night
portrait photo video and pro mode sit
between the viewfinder and shutter
button making them easily accessible
selecting the more button will bring up
other advanced features like watermark
time-lapse a or lens slow-motion
document scanning HDR panorama and
underwater all the features that you
would want or need are all in plain
sight in daylight conditions the mate
Tony Pro performs very well as expected
but not much better than other
smartphones in its class colors are
vibrant
there's tons of detail and dynamic range
is very strong in this example here the
photo is very uniform and equally
exposed throughout there is plenty of
detail in the clouds as well as the
trees and grass even in more high
contrast situations such as this image
at the beach the camera is still capable
of capturing a lot of detail especially
in the more shadowy areas the May 20 pro
seems to do a pretty great job of
differences in exposure and turning on
HDR when needed the mate 20 pro also
does an excellent job of making colors
pop you can see how vibrant the blue on
the porch looks in this image but the
overall picture is still very natural
and I also appreciate how it captures
the fine details such as the water
droplets on the side of the car the same
can be said about this image of London
although there isn't much going on here
and it's a mostly muted image the yellow
containers and red double deckers manage
to stand out in low-light the mate Tony
Pro performs decently in auto mode but
it's low-light capabilities truly shine
in night mode which takes multiple shots
at different exposures then grabs the
best images and turns it into a single
improved low-light shot night mode
images lack the motion blur and noise
that's typical of standard low-light
shots outdoor shots are very crisp with
good exposure and plenty of detail in
the shadows and highlights in extreme
dark situations it still manages to pick
up the subject quite well although
maintaining proper white balance does
become more difficult portrait mode is a
feature that we see in practically every
smartphone camera nowadays and the mate
20 pro performs decently well in this
area when it gets things right the image
can look really convincing and you won't
notice any significant mistakes
unfortunately that isn't always the case
it sometimes blurs things that should
still be in focus or leaves things in
focus when they shouldn't be most of the
time the portrait mode photos look quite
nice but it's pretty easy to spot the
mistakes when they happen so that's
pretty much gonna wrap it up for our
very first episode of camera 360 overall
we gave the mate 20 pro a score of 8.4
out of 10 if you want to find out why
make sure to check out the written
version linked in the description below
which covers the camera much more in
depth and if you want to see the full
resolution images for yourself we'll
also have that linked below as well
thanks for watching and we'll see you
guys in the next episode of camera 360</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
