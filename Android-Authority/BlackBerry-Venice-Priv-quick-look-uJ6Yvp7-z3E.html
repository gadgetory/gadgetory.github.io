had a nice surprise show up at her
office a blackberry Venice looks like an
evaluation unit so us being us I thought
let's take a look let's see what this
device can do let's take a look at the
hardware I know there's a lot of you out
there they're kind of interested in
having a blackberry device running
Android so jumping right into it we're
looking at the device one thing we
noticed right away is it looks to have
topped awake go right into the device
software very Android ish have our app
drawers and what makes the best a neat
unit is the slide-out keyboard and just
like a blackberry Passport
it also reads with a biometric sense
touch so you can actually swipe up and
down this would be great if you were
looking at websites reading documents
you could just simply use your fingers
to slide up and down and go through your
documents we noticed something else that
was kind of neat and whether or not this
stays in the final software again I have
to stress this is an evaluation unit
that made its way into our channel but
as you'll notice blackberry hub Google
services and global or Universal Search
on the device and if it works like other
BlackBerry 10 devices this should allow
you to search the web search for
contacts on your device search documents
almost anything within a device so I
think this is a great improvement great
way to go through and find information
you'll notice on the screen we've got
our Google search bar at the top we have
our Google notification bar so this is
just you know marvelous for those of you
that are into Android and really like
the services there you go spin the
device so you can see where some of the
controls are so you've seen the
slide-out keyboard and one thing I have
to stress is for those of you that we're
using a torch where that unit ended or
tended to be sort of bottom heavy or top
light and a lot of them would flip out
of the hand I have to say one thing
about this it is very comfortable
whether you're using it closed or open
so let me just spin this through you can
the screen is very slim nicely housed
into the chassis very easy to slide up
and down no problems whatsoever
underneath this packing seal we've got a
mer button on the opposite side we have
our your volume rockers and your
convenience key in the center smart
action key so BlackBerry users would be
very akin to how this device is laid out
across the bottom we've got our micro
USB port we've got a 3.5 millimeter
headset jack if we scroll across the top
you'll have micro SD looks to be you'll
probably use a pin to eject it and your
SIM card tray I'm assuming this would be
a noise cancelling microphone or it
could just be a microphone for picking
up audio at the top and across the
bottom I don't really see a microphone
jack but the one thing I do see this
huge speaker grille we haven't been able
to test this but if you take a close
look I mean that is assuming that's a
full-fledged speaker underneath the
housing I'm assuming that would be quite
loud just like most BlackBerry devices
and I would say earpiece across the top
not sure if there's anything embedded or
hidden into the end of those ports as
well and if we scroll over on to the
back the one thing you notice right away
is that huge camera bezel but I hope you
liked this video hopefully it gives you
a little bit more information on this
device truly hoping that we get this
into the Canadian market again this is
an evaluation unit we were lucky enough
just to get our hands on it and it's
going to be going back on its way to
where it's supposed to be so for those
of you looking for this device keep your
fingers crossed and hopefully you'll
come to your channel soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
