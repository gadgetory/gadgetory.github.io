Amazon bought whole foods for 13.7
billion dollars but why why does it
matter
especially because that billion is
billion with 80 whitey because that's a
lot of tofurkey oh stop your moment it's
Father's Day I had to put in a good bad
dad joke now some of you must be
thinking what is Amazon's endgame here I
mean Whole Foods is just some overpriced
hipster grocery store right we'll
consider this in December of 2016
amazon officially opened its first
brick-and-mortar store called Amazon go
this store allows customers to walk in
grab their food and go without any lines
it does this by asking the Amazon Go app
on the users phone to add items to their
cart as they pick them up off the
shelves in the store and uses computer
vision to understand if those items were
put back now the project has been
delayed a couple of times but the
company is currently testing the service
in beta for local employees this service
helps close the grocery store gap for
many users and give those who want to
just get in and get out real quick an
opportunity to do so
Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods is
just one more step to offering every
food available on the market while Prime
fresh and prime now cover a wide variety
of available items Whole Foods is
probably the one store that can close
the gap in what is available to
customers they offer a huge variety of
items that you'll be hard-pressed to
find anywhere else and owning the store
will give them the ability to integrate
Whole Foods offerings into both their
delivery and brick-and-mortar services
think about it Amazon wants to be able
to sell you everything if you're in the
u.s. they can do that in most places now
they can sell you everything you could
possibly need
except for cars and hoses let me name it
gadgets clothes books even food they've
been doing that for some time but Whole
Foods allows them to take this to a
whole other level
Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods is
absolutely monumental this purchase is
the biggest one Amazon is made to date
and it is clearly looking to become the
one-stop shop for literally
anything you might need in your daily
life the company's success has been a
slow climb but it is now quickly
becoming the biggest retail store in the
world it may have taken 14 years to
actually become profitable but it is the
trust that investors have and Jeff Bezos
and the company which keeps this huge
machine turning ok so I know some of you
may be thinking chase okay I get it
but why is it that Amazon didn't just
build up Amazon go or Amazon fresh to
become their own Whole Foods why do they
have to spend 13 point something billion
dollars to buy a Whole Foods well the
answer is sometimes when you're as big
as Amazon it's easier just to buy the
asset than it is to spend all the time
resources and stress to build one up
yourself so my question to you is have
you bought groceries online before have
you done it through Amazon or perhaps
another service would you buy Whole
Foods products through Amazon and I'm
assuming that Amazon will have not just
premium high-end products from Whole
Foods but they will have cheaper more
reasonably priced - I mean the joke with
Whole Foods is it takes your whole
wallet in addition to Whole Foods so how
many of you have done it will you do it
what do you think let me know in the
comments below or on Twitter verse
