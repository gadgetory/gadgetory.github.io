Android Authority and about a month ago
oneplus released a sandstone white color
variant of their 5 T flagship now just
in time for Valentine's Day oneplus has
introduced another bold color option
which is of course lava red so this
color option was actually first released
in India and China a while ago but it's
just now going on sale for those in
North America and Europe so to achieve
this vibrant lava red color oneplus
tells us that they use a to oxidation
process which helps ensure a smooth
texture and beautiful finish the end
result is a color that makes the 1 + 5 t
look absolutely stunning it's a man that
will finish just like the midnight black
model except in well red so yeah it's
the same exact classic 5g hardware that
we all know and love this flame red also
makes the oneplus more edible than ever
before perhaps even more so than Tide
Pods that was a joke please don't
actually eat a phone or Tide Pods unless
you're professional so in case you were
curious yes this model does look quite
similar to the Opel R 11s but it still
has its own unique design elements the
color on the oneplus is also slightly
more orange where the oppo is a bit more
pink both are nice colors but it's easy
to see why oneplus is calling this flame
red when you compare these phones
side-by-side if you've been holding out
on the 1 + 5 t and you really like this
new color option you should act quickly
as it's being sold only while supplies
last it's only available with 8
gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes of
storage but hey at least there's no
markup for this color option if you're
interested in learning more about the 1
+ 5 t in general you should check out
our review where we cover everything
there is to like and just like about
this phone and that will be all for this
video definitely let me know what you
