handy the Android a30 app guy the
everything me launcher has generated a
lot of media attention and today it's
leaving beta which means we are going to
take a look at it okay let's start out
with what this launcher actually does it
is a launcher like Nova and a v8 so
it'll be replacing your home screens
with its own it comes with five home
screens to start but you can change it
to one three five or seven if you prefer
at the top is the search bar at the
bottom rest the prediction bar and all
the apps are sorted into smart folders
the prediction bar is pretty nice what
it's supposed to do is deliver
applications that are contextually
relevant to whatever it is that you're
doing so if you're a work it'll deliver
work apps and when you're at home it'll
deliver entertainment apps I only had
the app for a few days before this
review and after some tweaking here and
there it did a fairly good job at
knowing what apps I wanted and when once
it gets your habits down it's fairly
accurate and handy
we'll talk about smart folders next
smart folders divide all of your
applications up into folders based on
what type they are and any application
you download after that is automatically
added to its respective folder they each
have their own wallpaper which you can
customize and alongside your apps will
be recommendations for more applications
in those same categories which is nice
if you're looking for something new
the last big feature is the phone search
and frankly this was my favorite feature
you can search for pretty much anything
and it'll give you your results in both
applications and on the web so if you
search for say Arrested Development
it'll give you Netflix and YouTube as
the applications and then the
opportunity to search popular websites
like IMDB or Google the search bar can
also filter through your contacts to
make it easier to find them aside from
these things everything me launcher acts
like a normal launcher with your
standard home screens app drawer widget
drawer and long press for launcher
preferences and phone settings the
design is pretty standard you still have
your usual home screens that you can
swipe through on each home screen you
can add applications and widgets just
like your average launcher the
prediction bar and search bar are only
on the main home screen so you don't
have to worry about those taking up
space everywhere the app drawer and the
widget drawer are your standard swipe
style they put a lot of work into the
design specifically so things don't
appear static each Smart Folder has its
own customizable wallpaper in addition
to the regular wallpapers on the home
screen
actually even your searches have their
own wallpapers so if you use this
launcher and all of its features you
will view a system that looks
consistently different which we really
enjoyed there were also a lot of small
things the search bar greets you every
time you open the home screen and there
are little animations here and there to
make things look more active which we
also really enjoyed it's not as
customizable as your Nova or your apex
launchers and we wish there were more
ways to customize but even without these
elements it's still a fresh enough of an
experience to enjoy it ok so here's what
we liked the prediction bar once it's
learned your browsing habits is actually
fairly accurate it took a little effort
on my part but it didn't take long for
the prediction bar to deliver results I
actually wanted the search bar is
outstanding being able to search for a
lot of things and then having multiple
ways to engage with my search results
was refreshing especially for things
like movies TV and music titles the
smart folders are awesome especially for
a guy like me who uses a bunch of
applications this is not too different
from a v8 scattegories
except for there are more options for
smart folders and they're easier to
customize with the dedicated wallpaper
and the recommendations for each one it
helps make everything feel like a richer
experience the design was very well done
it has enough of the typical Android
experience to make the learning curve
minimal but enough new things to make it
feel like a different experience not
every app is perfect and that includes
this one so here are a list of things
that we didn't like so much we wish they
would have integrated their search bar a
little bit better with Google now while
there are some things I'd rather search
for in everything me search there are a
lot of commands in Google now that would
have meant to the experience and made it
drastically better plus fans of Google
may not like having to open two
different search apps depending on their
needs there are instances where the
recommendations and the smart folders
can get a little bit in the way the
sponsored apps are usually apps I
wouldn't be caught dead having on my
phone so I can say definitively that the
ads are not as contextual as the rest of
the launcher there are some things that
context just doesn't fix in the new
section I only saw news about things I
don't care about from sources I never
read from it would have been nice to see
news about my actual interests instead
also Bing lastly it is region-locked I
don't know the full list of regions so
you'll have to check the Google Play
Store and see if you can install it or
not region locks are never a good thing
overall this is one of the most unique
launchers available today it's close
enough to the typical Android experience
to
familiar while different enough to feel
brand new the contextual elements aren't
perfect but they are still a major step
forward compared to most of the
competition there are some things that
need to be improved and likely will be
improved in future updates however the
pros outweigh the cons by a large margin
so if you're looking for something a
little bit different we recommend you
