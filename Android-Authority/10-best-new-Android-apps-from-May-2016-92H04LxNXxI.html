Hindy the android authority app guy we
are nearing the end of May which means
it's time to round up the best android
apps that were released this month 5217
is an application that aims to increase
your productivity the central premise is
that you can use it to time intervals
where you work for 52 minutes followed
by a 17 minute break this routine is
supposed to help you work better and the
application will log how many cycles you
went through during the course of your
average workday it's a simple
application with a clean at colorful
design and recent updates have also
added Android wear support it's an
expensive which is nice and it has no
in-app purchases beam is a social
networking application that allows you
to take video of what you're doing and
post it online unlike most other
networks that do a similar function this
one doesn't let you see or edit the
video before you post us online so
whatever your phone sees is what
everyone else sees it's a fun concept
and refreshing since there are no
filters or editing to gum up the works
it's worth a shot if you're looking for
something unique Turks guy made some
ways when it first came out because it
charged Android users a yearly
subscription while iOS users only got
charged once even so dark sky is a
pretty decent weather application that's
a lot of fun to use it has your basic
stuff like forecasts and weather radar
paid users will get up-to-the-minute
weather updates along with widgets
alerts and a daily summary about the
weather even if you're not paying for a
yearly subscription the free version is
still pretty good if you need something
simple fallout 4 live wallpaper is as
you may have guessed a live wallpaper
application that is themed like fallout
4 it's a simple wallpaper and it
displays 5 bobbleheads that move wobble
and sway depending on how you move your
device and your home screens there is
also a camera panning effect as you
scroll the bobbleheads you can pick our
customizable foot overall you can't
change it all that much it strikes a
good balance between being fun but not
too flashy and it's entirely free back
in the day foobar2000 was one of the
more well-known audio players on PC and
it's still used by many audiophiles
today now it's on Android and like it's
PC counterparts foobar2000 employs a
simple if slightly antiquated design
with a decent amount of features it also
features support for lesser-known codecs
such as flak and Muse pack just in case
you have a high quality music collection
the music application is completely free
with
in-app purchases and it's worth a shot
if you want something really simple join
is a pretty nifty little application
that can do some awesome stuff it's a
service that connects your Android
device to your web enabled PC similar to
how pushbullet does it except for this
one costs 499 once instead of asking for
a subscription you can reply to messages
and text messages for most services
check notifications share your clipboard
and it even comes with tasker
integration encryption and file sharing
you can try it out for free with a
30-day trial before you buy it there is
also a Chrome extension and a Windows 10
app launch 0 is a cute little weather
application that's currently in beta the
premise is simple there is a weather cat
that tells you about the weather it has
a pretty basic set of features including
a twice daily forecast for your zip code
the general forecast pollen allergy and
humidity levels and there's an adorable
little cat that sends you funny gifs and
makes comments on the weather it's a
free app with no in-app purchases but
you'll have to join the public beta
before you can download the app that
link is in the video description below
if you're interested quick is a video
editor and one of the few that exists on
Android unfortunately it's not a
hardcore video editor but rather a video
composer where you can pick video clips
and images that all get warped together
into a little video that you can then
share with your friends it comes with
filters a simple to use interface music
that you can use as background and you
can reorder your various clips and
images to make the video flow how you
want it's not on Final Cut pros level
but it's better than most science
journal is an application that allows
you to use various sensors in your
device to record data for use in various
types of research you can measure things
like how loud something is how much
light is being produced and more using
the sensors on your device you can also
connect hardware sensors to the device
and then record that it that way it's
meant for academics more than the casual
consumer but it's still pretty nifty and
it's completely free this basis is a new
kind of social media platform where you
can join groups and then post about
various things inside of the group each
post is its own thread that can generate
its own discussion think of it like
Google's version of Reddit with each
space being like a subreddit there's no
limit to the types of spaces you can
create or join right now and it's a
decent little way to have conversations
about specific topics it's also
partially integrated with Google Plus in
that you can see spaces notifications
there if you use both and that about
does it for this video folks if you want
more Android apps and games news check
out the Android apps weekly show which
is linked there on the screen and in the
video description below don't forget to
subscribe and keep it tuned to android
authority because we are your source for
all things android as always thanks for
watching everybody and have a wonderful
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
