by bitdefender mobile security at MWC
2014 we were introduced to Samsung's new
flagship device but we want to know how
it stacks up to some of the more
established ones in the space right now
hey it's Josh of agar from Android
thority what's going on everybody and
this is the Samsung Galaxy s5 vs. the
Google Nexus 5 both the galaxy s5 in the
black version of the Nexus 5 feature a
soft touch plastic back that is very
similar with the addition of a ridged
pattern on the s5 perforations if you
will while the white version comes with
a harder polycarbonate back when it
comes to the Nexus 5 the galaxy s5
phaedra favors our more angular design
Allah the note 3 while the Nexus 5 comes
with corners that are slightly more
curved the flatter sides on the Nexus 5
do allow it to be pretty easily handled
but the galaxy s5 has this same trope as
well while it's slightly larger display
on the galaxy s5 makes it a bigger
device overall the Nexus 5 is slightly
thicker yet lighter than the s5 now we
move away from the glossy plastic that
Samsung used to use all the time and now
both the Nexus 5 and the galaxy s5 have
the look and feel of the premium devices
that they truly are when it comes to the
displays both the Nexus 5 and the galaxy
s5 feature 1080p displays with the Nexus
5 getting the slight edge in its pixel
density due to its slightly smaller size
it's the old battle of LCD vs. AMOLED
but it's very difficult to find any
faults with either display colors pop
possibly a little bit more with the s5
but the viewing English are still great
and you'll still have a good time on
either device when it comes to the
processing package we do have to give
the edge just a little bit to the Galaxy
s5 for its updated version of the
Snapdragon 800 that has been clocked to
2.5 gigahertz this time compared to the
2.3 gigahertz of the Nexus 5 2 gigabytes
of RAM and the adrenal 330 round out the
best processing package is currently
available guaranteeing that you'll have
great speed no matter which one of these
two you choose as far as the gigahertz
go these s5 might have just a slight
edge in terms of speed but in terms of
the actual performance you probably
won't have much problem with either one
16 and 32 gigabyte versions are
available for both phones with the s5
featuring the additional benefit of
microSD expansion the s5 also takes the
lead over the Nexus 5 when it comes to
the battery
it comes with the 2800 milliamp hour
units as opposed to the 2300 milliamp
hour unit in the Nexus 5 but of course
then the galaxy s5 does also come with a
removable battery so if you have some
spares on hand you probably won't be
without power for long if the storage
options and the removable battery or our
Samsung started widening the gap however
the camera is where the s5 simply blows
the Nexus 5 out of the water issues with
the Nexus 5 camera are well known
especially in its first couple months of
release and the amazing 16 megapixel
isosa shooter introduced in the s5
complemented by a feature-packed camera
software package brings the issues of
the adequate camera of the Nexus 5 to
the forefront and finally when it comes
to software it's the old stock versus
well everything else many Android fans
do love their Nexus devices because of
the fact that a run stock Android and
it's understated look inside and out to
do provide a nice motif in that when you
start using the Nexus 5 you realize that
they can get a lot of stuff done however
the Nexus 5 did change things up a bit
with the Google now launcher that
remains very minimalistic but has a
major spotlight on search enter the new
version of TouchWiz which is based on
the new version of Android 4.4 KitKat
and it is quite possibly the polar
opposite of what you get with the Nexus
5 it is packed with even more features
and enhancements compared to the s4
before it you get the magazine UX which
is a second screen much like Google now
a revamped multi-tasking menu camera
software with tons of features and even
a heart rate monitor on a bet on the
back with the fingerprint scanner up
front there's just a lot of additions in
the s5 so the s5 does offer a lot but
there's always that risk of galaxy
syndrome setting in so how important all
of these features are is entirely up to
you not only the beginning but later on
and so there you have it for this quick
look at the Samsung Galaxy s5 versus the
Google Nexus 5 both take on different
philosophies when it comes to providing
a good user experience but one thing is
for certain both do provide a good user
experience stay tuned for all of the
best coverage of the Samsung Galaxy s5
leading up to its release in April so
keep it tuned here to Android authority
