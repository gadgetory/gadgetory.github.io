well earlier this week I was talking to
you about the Android 1 program getting
a shot in the arm via Shou Me's me a one
currently in India but it's gonna come
out to other countries and we're talking
near flagship level specs ok like high
mid tier stuff but for very affordable
prices but that was happening in
developing countries so why am i excited
today let me give you him it turns out
that Xiaomi and Motorola are not the
only big names joining the Android 1
Club according to two well-known leakers
HTC might be readying an Android 1
device of its own lab 2 fer a custom ROM
developer that occasionally leaks news
revealed that HTC's ocean life will have
an Android 1 version
the device will run stock Android with a
handful of HTC customizations including
edge sense
zowie and the HTC camera app heaven
glass also chimed in to confirm the
information and shared a picture of the
ocean life running HTC's Sense interface
we also revealed exclusively that ocean
light is the codename of HTC u 11 life
the phone will launch in the United
States with t-mobile featuring a 5.2
inch full HD display as 16 megapixel
cameras on front and the rear a
Snapdragon 630 processor water
resistance and HCC's edgesense squeeze
gestures it looks like HTC's first
Android phone will be a rebranded u 11
life
similar to the way xiaomi rebranded the
me 5x to create the me a1 Motorola is
expected to take the same route
rebranding the Moto X 4 and if that
wasn't good enough news how about this
the LG v 30s 64 gigabyte option will be
842 dollars us and the 128 gigabyte
option will be 886 dollars versus the
Galaxy Note 8 64 gigabyte option being
$966 us with the 256 gigabyte option
being 1108 buckaroos I want to know how
much that actually matters to you let me
know right there or in the comments
also good news for all you 1+5 fans out
there there may be a special edition
revealed next week oneplus is holding an
event on September 19th in Paris where
the company will reveal something new
but before you get too excited let me
point out that this won't be a new
smartphone as the oneplus 5 has just
been available for three months what we
will likely see is a special edition of
the flagship made in partnership with
designer Jean Charles de casa black
oneplus has confirmed that it is teaming
up with a French designer - tech advisor
unfortunately the invite doesn't reveal
very much so we're not completely sure
what to expect our best guess is that
the company will show off the oneplus
five and a new color option branded with
the designers logo on the back now if
you think that's much ado about nothing
remember that one plus did the same
thing back in March when it joined
forces with Colet and announced a
limited-edition one plus 3t it came in a
new color at the time black and had the
Colette logo engraved on the back but
remained identical to the standard
variant of the device in terms of specs
do you guys like that
that's generally reserved for the
hardcore of the hard cores but let me
know what you think in the comments
below now my audience is smart so smart
that sometimes you're inspired by a
business idea and then you try and get
the name of that business in a domain
name and your next perspective customer
is searching your business name and they
assume you have the dot-com and if you
don't you're giving your business away
to the one who does that's the power of
a.com now why is that exactly
well no domain name extension tells your
story with the same degree of trust as a
dot-com or dotnet domain name.com and
dotnet domain name extensions and jet
credibility and your online presence and
who doesn't want to be credible and
