Android authority and the Samsung Galaxy
s6 edge was just announced at Mobile
World Congress 2015 and it's another
flagship smartphone that features curves
along the display so it only makes sense
that we put it up against another
flagship smartphone with a curved screen
this is the Samsung Galaxy s6 edge
versus the LG G flex 2 if you're looking
for a high-end smartphone that pushes
the boundaries in terms of design your
best bet is with these two smartphones
the galaxy s6 edge and the LG G flex 2
on one hand the G flex 2 features a
pronounced curve from top to bottom
allowing for a somewhat better handling
experience which is further helped by
its more normal size compared to its
predecessor it does retain all the
signature elements of any new LG
flagships though including the
ultra-thin bezels up front and the
unique placement of the volume and power
button at the back which is even better
suited with the curve another flex
series feature available is the
self-healing back that heals minor
scratches in less than a minute and is
always useful to have Samsung
experimented with a curved element on
their displays with the non-starter that
was the galaxy round and then with the
note edge with a curved side that
allowed for some additional information
and functionality without trespassing on
the main display Samsung has now taken
that to the next level with the s6 edge
with curves on both sides of the display
the edge introduces new features like
the people edge information stream night
clock and can even be utilized as a
light bar of sorts for incoming
notifications staples like the tactile
home button up front do return so
there's no mistaking this device for
anything other than a Samsung phone but
the premium look and feel does put this
at a level where you'd expect to find a
high-end smartphone of this caliber a
5.5 inch screen on the G flex 2 brings a
higher resolution than before with is
1080p IPS screen the brightness is quite
great even in broad daylight and the
curve does make the experience a little
bit more immersive colors do tend to
have an adequate saturation to them and
this can be adjusted further in the
settings the s6 edge on the other hand
features a smaller 5.1 inch screen but
with a higher quad HD resolution
super amoled offers deep blacks vivid
colors great viewing angles and a good
amount of brightness at 600 nits on this
particular display with the two edges
allowing for a very smooth and seamless
swiping experience both are fantastic
displays but the s6 edge is definitely
the clear winner when it comes to
overall pixel density the G flex 2 is
the first widely available smartphone to
feature the Snapdragon 810 coupled with
the adrenal 430 and 2 or 3 gigabytes of
RAM depending on whether you pick 16 or
32 gigabytes of storage many expected
the performance to be off the charts but
that unfortunately didn't translate to
real-world use even if the blame might
lie more within the software
optimization as opposed to the
capabilities of the processing package
some of the issues seen with the 810 and
the G flex 2 could be one of the reasons
why Samsung decided to pass on qualcomm
for their current flagships in favor of
their in-house Exynos 7420 coupled with
three gigabytes of RAM performance is
absolutely fantastic on this device and
the more streamlined iteration of
TouchWiz is definitely a contributing
factor in both cases the battery is not
removable and even though the battery on
the s6 edge is smaller the Exynos is
said to be more frugal in its power
consumption so battery life should have
beat much every concern the G flex 2
packs a 13 megapixel rear shooter with
OAS plus and while it's still quite a
capable smartphone camera especially
when outdoors there were a few issues
that showed up with indoor shots or
those with bad lighting conditions with
an evident loss of detail and sharpness
os+ did make a noticeable difference in
keeping the shot steady which was
particularly helpful when shooting video
on the other hand the s6 edge features a
16 megapixel rear shooter with a setup
similar to what is found on the galaxy
note 4 the note 4 as we know featured
one of the best smartphone cameras last
year and we can certainly expect a
similar verdict with regards to the s6
edge the G flex 2 runs Android 5.0 but
in terms of the interface it is
definitely more LG GUI than lollipop
with the major aesthetic changes only in
the recent apps screen and the
notification drop-down it does come with
a lot of useful features especially
something like not code but at least in
the Asian version that was used for our
review the software was too cluttered
and offered a less than ideal experience
Samsung has finally take
to heart what it's consumers want and
offered up a far lighter streamlined
version of TouchWiz on top of lollipop
lollipop aspects do make their way to
the recent apps notification drop down
and lock screen but for the most part it
is still TouchWiz without the clutter
only a few features and apps are
available pre-installed with users now
given the opportunity to install others
if they choose to do so and that about
wraps it up for this quick comparison of
the s6 edge versus the G flex 2 - curved
displays smartphones that are utilized
in two completely different ways and
it's going to be up to you to decide
which one is the better option
