hindi the android authority app guy and
in this quick video we're gonna take a
look at the best android flashlights
first up is color flashlight its claim
to fame as the ability to simulate
various lights including candles police
lights SOS and a lot of others you can
also access the LED on the back of the
camera with it and it's totally free
next is an application that is simply
named flashlight is a simple flashlight
app that gives us au s strobe mode and
access to the LED on the back of the
device it's also totally free to use and
is a solid flashlight option flashlight
by sim gears is another totally free
option that includes for decent widget
options and a feature that automatically
turns the flashlight off when you put it
in your pocket plus the advertising can
be disabled if you don't like it
flashlight HD LED uses both the home
screen and the LED flash to light up
whatever you need you can also choose
the color of the light from the screen
it includes widgets a simple user
interface and it's totally free mega
flashlight is another one that uses
either your screen or your LED flash on
the back of the camera you can also set
it to strobe in various patterns
including SOS and it includes a simple
user interface complete with permission
explanations privacy flashlight is made
by a company called snowball and that
company really cares about your privacy
their flashlight requires the bone
minimum permissions and it's also very
small at just under one megabyte for the
download super bright LED flashlight is
among the most popular options on the
list with over 100 million downloads
it's well designed even if the features
are anything that stands out from the
pack is totally free and it works on
most devices Tesla LED is developed by
the same people who also brought us Nova
Launcher it works on most devices
despite not being updated in a very long
time and there are even customizable
widgets if you want those beware though
this will become irrelevant
eventually tiny flashlight is another
minimal camera option that registers at
just over 1 megabyte in size it has a
theme of a widget strobe light settings
and it's been downloaded over 100
million times which is very impressive
last up is torch and this one should
seem familiar to many CyanogenMod fans
because this is the widget that they use
it's simple it works on most devices
it's small and there's a widget it's
also totally free and that about does it
for this video folks we may update the
article one or two more times but let's
face facts the flashlight app era is
likely coming to an end thanks to native
flashlight integration
with Android lollipop still if you want
to recommend one let us know about it in
the comments if you haven't already

authority as always thanks for watching
