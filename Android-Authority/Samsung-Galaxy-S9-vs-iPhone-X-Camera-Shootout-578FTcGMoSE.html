on everybody and we're here taking
another look at the Samsung Galaxy s 9
pluses camera putting it up against the
iPhone tab this is yet another chapter
in the age-old debate of Android versus
iOS and in this case we're going to take
a look at some of the specifications and
you're going to see all of the photos
including the 100 crops as they happen
right after the original photo and you
can enjoy that here or in the galleries
that are found in Android authority comm
now clearly the Samsung Galaxy S 9 has
some great enhancements in its hardware
with multi frame processing thanks to
the RAM built into the camera module
that secondary lens on the plus model
and in the main lens you have a dual
aperture mode that actually gives it f
1.5 and F 2.4 apertures in comparison
the iPhone 10 has a dual lens setup at
12 mega pixels each and the main lens
has F 1.8 aperture with the other
telephoto lens having F 2.4 the
front-facing camera is a 7 megapixel
shooter at F 2.2 aperture now while
you're taking a look at some of these
photos and of course head into the
comment sections down below and sound
off on what you think about these
particular photos but in this case we're
taking a look at auto shots it's just
straight from the camera and we're going
to compare those photos and give a
little bit of a commentary on them right
off the bat you might notice that the
iPhone 10 kind of under exposes its
photos compared to the s9 the s9 kind of
over exposes especially in low-light
situations because it's trying to
compensate for the amount of light
that's available in the scene those are
shots that you're going to see a little
bit later but that bit of overexposure
also means that it is able to eke out
more detail in the darker areas of a
scene the iPhone 10 simply is not really
able to render a really great dynamic
range and what that means is that the
colors seem a little bit duller and
details start to get lost the darker
that elements are in the frame now
credit where credit is due the iPhone
tends photo might look a little bit more
dramatic or striking but that's not
really how the scene actually looked in
real life depending on what you're
really looking for the iPhone 10 might
provide more dramatic results and some
people do like that where there's more
contrast and there's definitely more
saturation in the iPhone photos however
that's at the expense of a balanced
exposure which the Galaxy S nine does a
better job of capturing on a consistent
basis it does a better job of taking
detail out of the shadowy parts of an
image while the iPhone 10 keeps them
dark and might even add some darkness to
them because it's trying to keep a bit
a dramatic view or maybe on the other
hand the iPhone 10 is just not as good
at measuring lights properly and it's
dynamic range suffers because of it
there were some instances when the
iPhone 10 was able to make a better
photo with its HDR and exposed the very
dark scene and provide a little bit more
that you're able to actually look at but
with more things seen in the photo you
could also see that there's plenty more
noise now taking a lot of the facets
that we've mentioned before about the
iPhone 10 about its saturation and it's
higher contrast and apply it to their
portrait modes now in this case you
might be able to just take your pick
between the two photos and realize that
they both do a pretty good job the
iPhone 10 renders a artistically blurred
background pretty well with the cutout
being mostly alright even though there's
a lot of hair blending in with the tree
in the background but if you look at the
color reproduction especially when you
consider that this is supposed to be a
good looking portrait then the iPhone 10
might be able to eke out just a little
bit of a step forward and like we said
before some people just enjoy more drama
out of their photos which is what the
iPhone 10 provides rather than the
overexposed and trying too hard photo
that came out of the galaxy s 9 plus and
that over softening effect seems to show
up in selfies too it's generally a
problem with the front-facing camera of
the galaxy s 9 and the s 9 plus that
it's trying to soften skin and maybe
that's just something that they tuned
into that camera because people want to
have softer details in their photos now
clearly there are times when the iPhone
10 provides a better looking photo but
those situations were far and few
between in our comparison especially in
low-light shots the galaxy s 9 just blew
the pants off of the iPhone 10 now there
is one more thing we will talk about and
that is emojis just a brief overview the
an emojis are not really built into the
camera app themselves so it's not
technically a camera feature but it uses
the face tracking on the front camera in
messaging apps so that you can move your
head around and be one of many different
characters and the tracking is pretty
good it is technically a feature of the
camera even if it's not in the camera
app on the other hand you have the AR
emojis of the Galaxy S 9 which are part
of the camera app and you can create a
digital avatar of yourself create facial
expressions and record videos and take
photos as your digital avatar it's
probably a no-brainer here that the an
emojis tend to be a lot smoother
compared to the AR emojis which are
plenty
buggier but really that's gonna be
something that's up to you and if you
get one phone over the other based upon
this maybe the an emojis are gonna end
up being a bit more fun for you but so
there you have it the Galaxy S nine
versus the iPhone tab it's pretty clear
which one is the winner here and even if
you think that here at an android
website that we would always pick the
galaxy s 9 in this kind of comparison
well the thing is that the iPhone 10 was
able to provide some better photos in a
few situations but it was far and few
between and we'll give the iPhone 10
credit for that and it's an emojis but
overall the S 9 is definitely the clear
winner here so make sure you keep it
