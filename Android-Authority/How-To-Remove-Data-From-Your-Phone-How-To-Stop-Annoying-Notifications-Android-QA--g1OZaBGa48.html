Jason this is where we try and deal with
your most pressing Android issues like
security now we all know the crazy NSA
is listening to your phone calls reading
your texts and there's little the
average person can do about it unless of
course you're also prepared to be a
little crazy to protect yourselves wait
a minute getting signal Hollywood mm
sadly I'm sorry I can't help you with
the NSA hack question but I can help my
friend Nasir with a security question
that I'm sure many of you have hey Jase
I wanted to ask you this I want to sell
my Android phone but I have to clear all
my data beforehand but I also heard that
it could be restored by someone else
using some apps that could be used
against you is there any way that I can
prevent this good question Nasir and
there's really three steps to this
process number one is you want to remove
your SIM card there's no reason that the
new user will need your SIM card so make
sure you do remove that second step is
to remove your micro SD card now in some
cases the condition of sale may be that
the SD card is included in the sale of
the phone if that's the case make sure
you format that micro SD card before you
sell the phone now the third step is to
do a full factory reset by going to your
settings here right now so I should add
here that it is conceivable that even
after you do all of this someone with
the right tools and experience could
recover your data and use it in a way
that you don't want so to add another
level of security you could add Android
encryption so you can go to the settings
&amp;amp; Security tab and add that that will
take some time but it will add a level
level of assurance and the second and
probably most simple thing is just a vet
the person you're passing the phone on
to what if you're selling it to someone
you know we're giving it to someone you
know you're much less likely to have a
problem with that data in the long run
good luck tester moving on to a secret
Twitter app just for tablets hey Jase
remember when the Note 10.1 2014 came
out
and it came with a tablet-optimized
Twitter app and it was said that this
app would then come up the Play Store
for the general public by the end of
2013
well it's 2014 now and there's no
Twitter for tablets when do you think
this is coming out great question and
you should know that our own Android
authorities joe hindi and andrew grush
wrote about this app when it initially
came out i've linked to those articles
below but the obvious question remains
why would twitter spend so much time
developing an app just for one tablet
the note 10.1 2014 doesn't make much
sense
well twitter is not just developing a
twitter app for android tablets they're
specifically designing the app to play
really nice with the notes ability to
use multi-function windows and use that
s-pen to draw on photos and send them
directly to twitter but there is no news
or rumors as of yet as to when that will
be released obviously they're late
hopefully sooner rather than later
moving on to a question regarding mobile
payment wars kemon ring asks great show
question why is it that carriers can
stop the use of mobile payments with
Google Wallet I can't wrap my brain
around that one well Cameron there is a
war going on between the carriers
Verizon AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile who have
teamed up to create their own mobile
payment system called Isis using NFC
technology and of course Isis is a
direct competitor with Google Wallet but
they can't say that directly because
that would be an Tyco or
anti-competitive behavior and would
likely garner a lawsuit so instead the
carriers have said this Google is free
to offer its Google Wallet application
in a manner that doesn't require
integration with the secure element now
the secure element that the carriers are
talking about here is a tamper resistant
platform that allows your phone to
secure confidential data like your
credit card information for example but
here's the kicker the carrier's Mobile
Payment Isis also requires access to the
secure element so they're just being
painfully hypocritical and deserve a
kick in the pants now moving on to a
question about how to deal with pesky
notification
Riz gar asks hey Jase how do I disable
app notifications I did go to the
settings and disabled it but they keep
showing up
please help great question and I know
you said you did this but for others I
want to go over the basics first go to
settings then apps select the specific
app deselect notifications press ok and
then you're done now that won't solve
the problem for all of you there are
some developers who have unfortunately
developed notifications that are very
spam like good news is that when 4.3
came out it dealt with that effectively
but not all of you are on 4.3 so I did
find a fantastic app on the Google Play
Store that was reviewed very well to
solve that problem it's called
notifications off go check it out and
let me know in the comments below how it
works for you thanks for watching
Android peace please remember if you
have any questions or concerns comments
whatever please put them in the comments
below I read all of them I would love to
connect with you here on Twitter or
Google+ and don't forget my brother's an
android Josh Joe in the tech ninja Kevin
I shall see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
