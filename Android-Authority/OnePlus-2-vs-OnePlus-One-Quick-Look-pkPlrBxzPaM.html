hotly anticipated phones of the year but
the question still remains how does the
new one stack up to the old one a
structure of a guard from android
authority what's going on everybody and
here's a quick look at the oneplus 2
versus the 1+1 the oneplus one had a
gorgeous design and the new iteration
takes it up a notch by offering similar
yet improved aesthetics the first
notable difference is a home line that
is added to the front that designates an
area for you to be able to put your
fingerprint on in order to unlock the
phone easily now it does seem like a
button but it's not one that you can
actually press down you could just rest
your finger on there in the fingerprint
reader even when the phone is off well
scan for fingerprints and then unlock
the phone if it finds one that is
registered with the 3.5 millimeter
headset jack at the top while the power
bond stays on the right side now with
the volume rocker moving over to the
right side because on the other side of
the phone now we have a notification
toggle which has three different
positions for the different types of
notifications either you get none all or
you only get priority ones it's a great
input that really puts the 1+2 in a
different place compared to all the
other classical button layouts that are
available and on the bottom microUSB
from the oneplus one has been made into
USB type-c now not only will this
improve data speed transfers and also
charging hopefully USB type-c is also
reversible port so you don't have to
fiddle around getting the right position
for the micro USB port like you did in
the oneplus one this time around USB
type-c is also going to be a new
standard in the oneplus 2 is the first
phone to provide it turning to the front
of the phones above the fingerprint
reader and the capacitive keys for
either of these phones you will notice
that both screens manage to still look
great at the same exact size 5.5 inches
at 1080p resolution no there is no quad
HD in the oneplus 2 which does seem like
a bit of a bummer but with its lower
price it does seem to make a little bit
of sense and especially if the battery
life is going to be pretty good because
of the full HD display we're all forward
in the oneplus 2 however it is going to
be very similar to the one plus one
maybe just a little bit more brightness
and a little bit more saturation that I
at least saw in the 1+2 at the moment
you're really all interested in the
power underneath the Snapdragon 801 of
the oneplus one it goes up against the
eight
10 version 2.1 into 1 plus 2 now the
Snapdragon 801 is still a great
performer and for anyone that still has
a one plus one they are still quite
happy with the performance they're
getting from last year's flagship killer
this year's flagship killer however has
the one of the most powerful processors
that are available right now a 64-bit
processor backed by the adrenal for 30
and four gigabytes of RAM which is
awesome still we do see a lot of speed
from either of these phones perhaps the
oneplus 2 is going to have just a little
inch more in terms of its smoothness and
its reliability but the one plus one is
still holding its ground so we do think
that for daily usage either these phones
will provide the kind of experiences
that general user will need now in terms
of hardware we do have some new
additions in the 1+2 namely those
notification toggles and the fingerprint
sensor that we already talked about but
also the phone will provide dual sim
capabilities out of the box and
everywhere so if you haven't used dual
sims before and you think that you have
a need for the oneplus 2 will provide
that for you but now we're going to talk
about the cameras and though they might
seem pretty identical on paper both have
13 megapixel rear shooters but there are
some upgrades in the 1+2 mainly features
like optical image stabilization and the
laser-guided autofocus which you can see
right below the optics now the placement
of the camera might be a little bit odd
on the one plus two is definitely
something that needs some getting used
to but the very least when you're
holding the phone you won't have fingers
getting in the way of the lenses by any
means because the placement makes it
easier to hold the phone without doing
so f 2 point 0 aperture is still the par
for the course here for the 1+2 but
without google image stabilization it's
a low-light performance should get a
little bit better and I'll Fiat that
will definitely be the case when we get
our hands on a review unit and put it
through its paces now finally when it
comes to software this is probably the
main point of contention because the
relationship between one plus and
cyanogen unfortunately went sour in the
time that the oneplus one had its
lifespan but now with the oneplus 2
oxygen OS is the name of the game sanjan
is still available for the oneplus one
if you have 11s than you upgraded
probably 2 12's and signage and mod does
provide some more features like
customization and some extra security
features let's save for messaging
for example in the 1+1 the oneplus 2
does not have many of these features
because oxygen OS it's just about as
stock Android as it can get you do have
the same look as the Google now launcher
for example with only a few main
additions that 1+1 centric additions
that make it over to the oneplus to
include the gestures on a turned off
screen in order to get to places pretty
quickly you also have customization on
the button so you can use soft keys and
stuff the capacitive keys and then
there's the Shelf which is basically a
frequency widget showing you all of the
different of apps that you use on a
frequent basis and also the many
different contexts that you might call
in text frequently now if clean and
simple is really what you want oxygen OS
is definitely going to scratch that itch
but when it comes to customization and
some extra future cyanogenmod is pretty
much only available for the oneplus one
now but oxygen OS is going to be the
official one going forward so take your
pick here and if a customization is
really the name of the game for the 1+2
it could be possible that you can just
go ahead and install another rom on it
if you so wish to but oxygen OS is the
official and it does get the iteration
bump up that it needed but maybe it just
needs a few more extra features to
really separate itself from the pack so
with all that out of the way can we say
that the one plus two is a worthy
successor to the one well we couldn't
say that it is definitely the upgrade
that was needed with some extra features
but until we get our review unit we will
be able to tell you even more at that
point well the oneplus one was launched
it was mostly the specs in the price I
made it amazing and for the most part
that could be the case for the 1+2 at
389 dollars for the 64 gigabyte version
it is still a pretty good price for one
of the most powerful devices you could
probably get today so keep it tuned to
android authority for even more a full
vs will be done between these two phones
once we get our hands on a review unit
including camera shootouts most likely
so make sure you keep it tuned to
Android or D for all that and even more
because we are your source for all
things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
