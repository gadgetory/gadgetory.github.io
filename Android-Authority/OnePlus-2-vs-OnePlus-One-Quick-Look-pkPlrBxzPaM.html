hotly anticipated phones of the year but
the question still remains how does the
new one stack up to the old one
hey structure of agar from Android
Authority what's going on everybody and
here's a quick look at the oneplus 2
versus the oneplus one the oneplus one
had a gorgeous design and the new
iteration takes it up a notch by
offering similar yet improved aesthetics
the first notable difference is a home
line that is added to the front that
designates an area for you to be able to
put your fingerprint on in order to
unlock the phone easily now it does seem
like a button but it's not one that you
can actually press down you could just
rest your finger on there and the
fingerprint reader even when the phone
is off well scan for fingerprints and
then unlock the phone if it finds one
that is registered with the 3.5
milimeter headset jack at the top while
the power button stays on the right side
now with the volume rocker moving over
to the right side because on the other
side of the phone now we have a
notification toggle which has three
different positions for the different
types of notifications either you get
none all or you only get priority ones
it's a great input that really puts the
oneplus 2 in a different place compared
to all the other classical button
layouts that are available and on the
bottom microUSB from the oneplus one has
been made into USB type-c now not only
will this improve data speed transfers
and also charging hopefully USB type-c
is also reversible port so you don't
have to fiddle around getting the right
position for the microUSB port like you
did in the oneplus one this time around
USB type-c is also going to be a new
standard in the oneplus 2 is the first
phone to provide it turning to the front
of the phones above the fingerprint
reader and the capacitive keys for
either of these phones you will notice
that both screens managed to still look
great at the same exact size 5.5 inches
at 1080p resolution no there is no quad
HD in the oneplus 2 which does seem like
a bit of a bummer but with its lower
price it does seem to make a little bit
of sense and especially if the battery
life is going to be pretty good because
of the full HD display we're all for it
in the oneplus 2 however it is going to
be very similar to the oneplus one maybe
just a little bit more brightness and a
little bit more saturation that I at
least saw in the oneplus 2 at the moment
you're really all interested in the
power underneath the Snapdragon 801 of
the oneplus one it goes up against the 8
hen version 2.1 into one plus two now
the Snapdragon 801 is still a great
performer and for anyone that still has
a oneplus one they are still quite happy
with the performance they're getting
from last year's flagship killer
this year's flagship killer however has
the one of the most powerful processors
that are available right now a 64-bit
processor backed by the adrenal 430 and
four gigabytes of RAM which is awesome
still we do see a lot of speed from
either of these phones
perhaps the oneplus 2 is going to have
just a little inch more in terms of its
smoothness and its reliability but the
oneplus one is still holding its ground
so we do think that for daily usage
either these phones will provide the
kind of experiences that the general
user will need now in terms of hardware
we do have some new additions in the
oneplus 2 namely those notification
toggles and the fingerprint sensor that
we already talked about but also the
phone will provide dual-sim capabilities
out of the box and everywhere so if you
haven't used dual Sims before and you
think that you have a need for the
oneplus 2 we'll provide that for you but
now we're going to talk about the
cameras and though they might seem
pretty identical on paper both have 13
megapixel rear shooters but there are
some upgrades in the oneplus 2 mainly
features like optical image
stabilization and the laser-guided auto
focus which you can see right below the
optics now the placement of the camera
might be a little bit odd on the oneplus
2 it's definitely something that needs
some getting used to but the very least
when you're holding the phone you won't
have your fingers getting in the way of
the lenses if by any means because the
placement makes it easier to hold the
phone without doing so f 2.0 aperture is
still the par for the course here for
the oneplus 2 but without the go image
stabilization it's a low light
performance should get a little bit
better and I'll fee that will definitely
be the case when we get our hands on a
review unit and put it through its paces
now finally when it comes to software
this is probably the main point of
contention because the relationship
between 1 plus and cyanogen
unfortunately went sour in the time that
the oneplus one had its lifespan but now
with the oneplus 2 oxygen OS is the name
of the game sangeun is still available
for the oneplus one if you had 11s than
you upgraded probably to 12s and
sandwich and mod does provide some more
features like customization and some
extra security features let's say for
messaging
for example in the oneplus one the
oneplus 2 does not have many of these
features because oxygen OS it's just
about as stock Android as it can get you
do have the same look as the Google now
launcher for example with only a few
main editions the oneplus one said trick
editions that make it over to the
oneplus to include the gestures on it
turned off screen in order to get to
places pretty quickly
you also have customization on the
button so you can use soft keys and
stuff the capacitive keys and then
there's the shelf which is basically a
frequency widget showing you all of the
different apps that you use on a
frequent basis and also that many
different contexts that you might call
in text frequently now if clean and
simple is really what you want oxygen OS
is definitely going to scratch that itch
but when it comes to customization and
some extra features CyanogenMod is
pretty much only available for the
oneplus one now but oxygen OS is going
to be the official one going forward so
take you to pick here and if a
customization is really the name of the
game for the oneplus 2 it could be
possible that you can just go ahead and
install another rom on it if you so wish
to but oxygen OS is the official and it
does get the iteration bump of that it
needed but maybe it just needs a few
more extra features to really separate
itself from the pack so with all that
out of the way can we say that the
oneplus 2 is a worthy successor to the
one well we could say that it is
definitely the upgrade that was needed
with some extra features but until we
get our review unit we will be able to
tell you even more at that point well
the oneplus one was launched it was
mostly the specs in the price that made
it amazing and for the most part that
could be the case for the oneplus 2 at
three hundred and eighty nine dollars
for the 64 gigabyte version it is still
a pretty good price for one of the most
powerful devices you could probably get
today so keep it tuned to Android
authorial for even more a full versus
will be done between these two phones
once we get our hands on a review unit
including camera shootouts most likely
so make sure you keep it tuned to
Android or D for all that and even more
because we are your source for all
things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
