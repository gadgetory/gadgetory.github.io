only recent features such as
computational photography via or some
real-time HDR we can try for k I know
it's all about really impressive yeah
really impressive and I'll give you a
quick demo yeah let's do it as you can
see I mean it's like console quality or
texture smooth geometry a very high
polygon town yeah really high 36 shaders
effect physics so again we had nvidia
tegra it's all about trying to push the
boundary and in case of touch for
we are just trying to make sure that the
end user experience is nothing but
awesome really impressively definitely
call so quality alright pics 1080p yeah
as well on the screen is actually 1080p
fluid frame rates amazing effects you
know great shadow shaders so it's all
about bringing the ultimate experience
at the end user yeah so again kind of
this works up to shield so which brings
a lot more of this awesomeness and
goodness absolutely I see already you
may know to shield is basically Nvidia's
open mobile gaming platform yeah so to
put it in other words it's running stock
in jelly bean Android ok so for virtual
box four point two dot one out of the
box I out of today yeah you know so no
overlays nothing stopped with lysis of
that you have full access to all yeah
all the google apps yeah yeah all the
games that you've downloaded on your all
the technicals own games which i saw it
on your nexus 7 yeah you want x will you
walk out of the power asks himself
everything works out of the box so when
do you thing is going to come to market
so as of today we're saying its q2 q2
and what's the price point we have it
around for price 299 109 we have in 99
what's the price point yet okay in terms
of joy from tegra 2 to take a three how
much of a jump of performance will be
talking about there they go at three to
tango for tegra two to take our three
big nerd there's about four times right
approximating ya ghous read a Tegra 4 so
definitely do Tegra 4 the GPU itself is
about six times six hours power photo
sticker 3 has 2 l's GPU cores yeah
agri-food is 72 so six time increase yes
and also talk about arm 5815 as well
which is a lot more powerful yup so II
Cordy nines to 40 50 big deal it's
pretty massive yeah be with you yeah
and it's 28-nanometer yeah with the back
receiver code so you get all the awesome
performance yeah what much much lower
power okay really really good he
completed them and we have the ice
arrived yeah of course because the
opposition and then you reduce the
footprint on that by forty percent too
which is great LG is going to be the
connectivity standard of the world
actually so is it overkill for a
smartphone take her for are there gonna
be dual core variants or anything that's
a little bit less you know you know
powerful I mean then regular two came on
people are like do you really need a
dual yeah we can do you really need more
code oh yeah also there's no you know
with every month every week every year

right yeah the time when all used to use
your phone was texting and making phone
calls then emails and surfing the net
