the night and civil war finally the TV
shows include the flash season 3 arrow

10 some of these are going for a pretty
good price and it's worth a shot if you
want a little extra Media Square Enix is
shutting down just as Monsters 5 on
March 27th it came out alongside Final
Fantasy 15 as kind of a promotional
thing and it helped build the hype
around the game's release there has been
no word on why the game is shutting down
simply that Square Enix is sorry about
the decision to be honest it wasn't that
great of a game overall it had a few
bugs and it never really recovered vine
is officially shutting down on January
17th we've talked about this social
media network ad nauseam over the last
two months and we're nearing the end of
the rope on the mentioned date the
service will shut down while the
application will turn into vine camera
you'll be able to take the same old six
second videos and then post them on
various other social medias thankfully
all of this will be over soon and we
know you're sick and tired of hearing
about it
it was announced this week that Google
assistant will start to be made
available on set-top boxes and Smart TVs
many of which will be released in 2017
that also includes the new Nvidia shield
TV announced this week at CES this puts
into question how valuable the
exclusivity of Google assistant is on
the Google pixel but otherwise it's
great news it should also help bolster
development for the platform by other
app developers
burrs mood cast IRA is an application
that lets you keep a diary the basic
idea is that you tell the application
how you've been doing over the course of
every day after each entry the app
determines whether the mood was positive
or negative and it can get it wrong
sometimes but you can always change it
later over time the application can tell
you how your mood has changed over the
lifetime of your usage Pro users can
link things like their Twitter and
Facebook accounts to import the various
status updates and tweets into the app
it's unreleased so there are plenty of
bugs but it's fun to use overall
geometry - world is an adventure
platformer from the makers of the
popular geometry - game in this title
you'll run jump bounce and float your
way through various obstacles and levels
it also includes some fun little
environmental things like flipping
gravity flying rockets and other stuff
it comes with 10 levels colorful and fun
graphics and some light character
customization the big news here is that
the game is totally free with no in-app
purchases which is pretty rare screens
is a nifty little tool that can only be
used by devices that are running Android
nougats it's a fairly basic application
that allows you to enter split screen
mode much more quickly what you do is
choose two applications that you
commonly have in split screen mode the
application then creates a shortcut that
will put those two apps in split screen
mode instantaneously we had to fiddle
with it a little bit to get it working
properly and some combos caused more
problems than others thankfully it's
completely free so it costs nothing if
you want to try it out Capcom made a
bold move this week when they released
the first six Mega Man games on Android
these reports of the original games with
a few little quirks added in for
instance in the original Mega Man you
have unlimited lives the ports all seem
to be ok but they do need a little work
some issues include low frame rates
alongside the usual array of early
release bugs Capcom has responded to
several user reviews stating that
they're looking into the issue
thankfully the ports are only about two
bucks each with no in-app purchases
after months of beta testing the
official release of ADW launcher 2
happened earlier this week the launcher
includes a range of modern features
including many borrowed from the popular
pixel launcher it also comes with a
bunch of other features such as theming
widgets animations icons and other
customization features it works pretty
well and it's great to see atw back in
action you could pick up the application
for free and then pay the dollar
ninety-nine as an in-app purchase for
the pro version for even more Android
apps and game
