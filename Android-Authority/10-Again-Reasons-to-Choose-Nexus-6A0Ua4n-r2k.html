android market is to choose what device
you want because there are just so many
different choices luckily Google has got
your back because they've created a line
of devices that really sits above the
rest and are called the Nexus and I'll
show you why they're the best because
it's Joshua Vergara from Android
authority what's going on everybody and
Here I am to bring you ten again about
why you should choose the Nexus
as the Nexus line is supposed to be the
standard for all other Android devices
we're going to be taking a look at some
key aspects and we're going to come out
swinging with hardware and performance
if the current crop of Nexus devices is
any indication all of the future Google
official devices will probably blow away
the rest of the competition take for
example the Nexus 4 sporting a very fast
quad-core Snapdragon s4 pro processor
this phone packs a wallop and even with
2 gigabytes of RAM these are
specifications that a lot of phones out
on the market today can only dream of
having as such the Nexus 4 is typically
at the top of the food chain in whatever
benchmark tests you may run on it and
for good reason it really is just that
powerful of a phone and then in the
mid-range you have the Nexus 7 as a
smaller tablet the Nexus 7 didn't
necessarily have the best specs out
there of any device but it did support
the NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor which still
holds up today even after the long time
after the Nexus 7 was released it is
still able to handle pretty much
anything that I was able to throw at it
and that's true for a lot of users out
there it is still a fan favorite among a
lot of users but the powerhouse of the
Nexus family is definitely the 10-inch
tablet the Nexus 10 sporting a 10 inch
screen at 2560 by 1600 resolution and
300 PPI it was obvious that the
specifications underneath needed to be
amazing and they truly are a 1.7
gigahertz dual core Exynos processor is
backed by an Adreno 320 graphics
processor to make this the fastest
tablet on the market and that doesn't
necessarily just mean Android that means
all tablets in general ultimately all of
the Nexus devices come with a load of
power and usually wouldn't that come at
a pretty hefty price well luckily Google
has got your back on that as well
because all of these devices happen to
be very affordable what you're seeing on
the Nexus 4 right now is the price of
the 16 gigabyte version 349 might still
sound like a lot but consider that a lot
of phones out there right now have
lesser specs but still come in at five
or six hundred dollars unlocked on the
other hand the Nexus 7 still comes in at
$1.99 which is a great price for a
tablet as versatile and as powerful as
it it is still one of the most of
and best bang for your buck tablets on
the market today and finally you have
the Nexus 10 which comes in at a very
competitive 399 given its specifications
and the fact that the iPad and other
Android competitors are up to a hundred
or more dollars more expensive than the
Nexus 10 it really is a price you can't
beat and with all of the different
features that are available on each of
these devices the prices that they come
in at are all really hard to deny that
price will seem like even more of a
bargain when you consider not just the
hardware and the performance of the
software that it powers and as a nexus
user you can rest assured that your
devices will always be updated with the
latest version of Android so tell me
what do all of these devices have in
common well it's a pretty simple answer
all of them sport operating systems that
are now out of date Google's already
released the latest version of jellybean
4.2.1 and what devices get to run this
new OS yeah you guessed right the Nexus
devices this reason alone is why a lot
of users choose to invest in the Nexus
and it really is a hot-button topic for
a lot of people when we're talking about
any other device there is always that
group of people who want to know what
version is on and when they hear that
it's not the most updated it's usually a
turn-off but the Nexus you don't have to
worry about that your software is always
going to be updated and you will have
all of the latest features that
jellybean and in the future key lime pie
have to offer but that's the great part
about it because Android is really
getting better and better the once was a
time when I wanted my Android device to
have certain features that were only
available if I either installed
customization software apps or I even
put custom roms on there after rooting
the phones now with the newest version
of Android jelly bean I feel like I
don't have to do that anymore I actually
like Android just the way it is and it's
because of these features that you're
seeing right now things like a expanded
notification drop-down with access to
all of your settings is something that
used to be a dream in the past but now
it's a reality in the stock Android
system and then there's Google now which
I said in my previous video that
really encourage everybody to start
using it even more those cards just
seems to know exactly what I'm looking
for at the moment and it's just a great
way of looking at information searching
and it's just a wonderful piece of
technology underneath the already great
Android experience of course these
translate very well into tablets as you
can see here you can access the settings
from the right side of the drop-down and
Google now looks just as good on a
tablet as you can see here Android
jellybean 4.2.1 is really a great
example of just how much Android has
matured and that brings me to yet
another great aspect of the Nexus line
of devices the dev community
basically if some of the software inside
of your phone or tablet is for whatever
reason something you don't like there
are ways of changing it to make it even
better and that was done by a group of
developers who are pretty much users
just like yourself and they've created a
community that really takes advantage of
the fact that the Nexus line of devices
is very easy to gain root access to now
I'm not going to get into the whole
process of rooting and flashing in this
video but essentially rooting a device
means that you get full system level
access to the root directory where all
of the system files are which allows you
to take advantage of apps that require
that root access or to even install
whole new operating systems that were
built from the ground up by the devs in
that community now there might be a
small degree of difficulty to this whole
process there might even be a little bit
of danger because if it fails for
whatever reason you have a fancy
paperweight on your hands but with the
right amount of research and the backing
of a community that is honestly really
helpful and developers who have made the
process easy you could be routing and
flashing your Nexus device as well this
next reason to choose the Nexus focus is
on the floor and the fact that it is
unlocked now what exactly does unlock to
mean well we can illustrate that by
looking at the box what do you get when
you buy a Nexus 4 well you get the box
and everything inside of it and that's
kind of the beauty of it you own that
phone when you buy it for only $2.99
compared to five hundred and six hundred
dollars for other unlocked phones out
there you get to have the Nexus 4 and
it's not shackled by any two-year
contracts
one-year contracts and it's not even
shackled by the kinds of plans you would
need to get on those contracts
essentially you can find the GSM carrier
that you want with the services that you
want and once you get that prepaid or
monthly plan set up you just get the SIM
card popping into the Nexus 4 and it's
ready to go and then you power up your
device for the first time and what do
you see on your home screens a bunch of
free stuff that's another great thing
about the Nexus line let's take the
Nexus 10 for example the first time I
booted it up these widgets are right
there
and in these widgets they're not just
listing things that you can have they're
listing things that you already have
because Google with every new device
gives you a number of different things
already installed and already available
in your Play accounts that you can have
fun with from the get-go Google wants
you to have fun with your device and see
its capabilities like the Nexus 10
playing planet Earth or if that's not
your style then you can go for
Transformers Dark of the Moon which
originally came with my Nexus 7 there's
all this free stuff and who says no to
free stuff now this one's a little bit
more tablet centric and it's the
multi-user support the newest version of
jellybean brought in the new feature of
adding multiple users to the same device
now if you are the sole owner and user
of your particular device let's say the
Nexus 7 or the Nexus 10 then this
probably isn't the most practical
feature however there are plenty of
situations that I can see this being
very handy for example if you're a
parent and you have some kids and they
would like to use the tablet as well
maybe you don't want them getting into
the work that you've been doing or any
of the files that you have so you create
a new user for them and what you're
greeted with is a setup screen so that
they can create their own account on the
same device and once they get past that
setup what they're greeted with is a
screen that looks just like the one that
you saw when you first powered on the
device it is essentially a clean slate
that the next user is able to pretty
much customize that their delight they
also get their own set of apps and they
can install their own apps in order to
make the experience on that particular
user quintus
for them and it's kind of a great way of
sort of making one device very easy to
use for let's say a small family and
it's just a really nice feature to have
on the Nexus 7 in the Nexus 10 it's also
a very easy feature to navigate because
if you want to go back to your user
simply click the user icon in the
notification drop-down settings and
you'll be brought back to the lock
screen where you can select your
accounts and when it changes the
wallpaper to show that it is your
account you can just go through the lock
screen and jump right back in here's one
that I feel people forget sometimes
Nexus devices don't come with bloatware
take a look at these devices again not
only is their software out of date
but they also come with especially if
shackled to another phone carrier they
come with a lot of useless apps like NFL
apps and you don't watch football or
carry your specific ringtone apps
I mean who uses those on the Nexus
device what you need is what's included
aside from the free content from that
Google gives you which really doesn't
even get in the way anyway you're given
a blank slate you're free to do with
your phone exactly anything that you
want install the apps that you want all
the clutter that the phone company's
apps would have taken up is free for you
to clutter it up with your own apps
obviously but at least that was all on
you and finally we put together all of
our reasons to get the final one and
that's freedom because that is what
having a nexus is all about here we have
three different devices all
competitively priced with wonderful
specifications and killer performance
and the promise of updated software for
at least the foreseeable future
right now they have software that no
other competitor has yet if you have a
nexus 4 you have the freedom of picking
a carrier any one that you want if you
have a nexus 7 you have portability
flexibility that most tablets don't have
and when you have the Nexus 10 you have
a powerhouse of a tablet that will
remain so for quite a while when you
become a nexus user you open up a world
of possibilities that might be akin to
those found in other Android devices but
I guarantee you aren't nearly as great
in number
or more importantly as great in quality
as that found in the Nexus when you
choose the Nexus you choose value
performance and flexibility but just as
much as all those qualities you choose
freedom let us know what you think in
the comments below and for the written
version of this edition of ten again
