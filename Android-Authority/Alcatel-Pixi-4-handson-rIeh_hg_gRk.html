authority coming to you live from CES
2016 and we're hanging out with Alcatel
taking a look at some of their latest
affordable budget smart phones that are
going to be hitting the market this year
this is their pick c-4 lineup and it
comes in several different sizes so you
have a three and a half inch model a
four inch model and a six inch model if
you really want to go big they're
essentially all the same phones in terms
of design with a simple rectangular form
factor and they are all made entirely of
plastic but they feel pretty sturdy due
to the unibody design they're all
packing LCD displays and mediatek
processors but these specs like CPU
cores display resolution Ram internal
memory camera resolution and battery
capacity will increase as you move up in
size if you're more cost-conscious and
want a phone that can easily fit in the
palm of your hand then go with these
smaller versions but if you want the
best out of the bunch then you'll have
to spring for the largest model but no
matter which one you choose you're not
really going to break the bank software
wise they're pretty much all identical
here a couple of the units that we got a
chance to play around with we're running
on 5.1 lollipop but at launch every
model will be shipping with marshmallow
on board it's a mostly stock experience
with just a few touches of customization
from Alcatel but otherwise this is a
pretty clean and pure Android experience
and it really helps to keep the
performance running as smooth as
possible especially on the low respect
models but that's pretty much going to
do it for this quick hands-on look of
the pixi Ford lineup from Alcatel for
more information on these devices
including pricing and availability check
out the written post on android
authority calm and keep it tuned here
for the rest of our coverage because we
are your source for all things CES 2016
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
