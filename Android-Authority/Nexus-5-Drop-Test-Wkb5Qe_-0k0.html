hey what's going on everybody and you
knew this was coming now that I finally
got my hands on the great Google's Nexus
5
at least my first impressions I was very
impressed with the phone unfortunately
it's a little bit twisted but now that I
have my hands on the phone I got to drop
it and yes we're going to be dropping
the white version of the Google Nexus 5
we're going to see how it stands up to
our drop test
it's a typical drop test as you probably
know by now I'm going to be dropping it
on its back on its bottom and finally on
its face okay here is our before shot to
showing you the phone in my hand right
now it's not the soft touch plastic that
wraps around the phone all the way to
the front so we're not too sure if
there's going to be separation in the
panel's Android 4.4 KitKat running just
fine on here and we're about to get
started on the test so this is what the
phone pretty much looks like in a
pristine condition I think it's drop
test time all right just checking on my
camera's here we go with the first test
on the Google Nexus 5 falling right onto
its back so let's see what happens on
three two one
so it looks like my dropping is not
quite as good as it was in the last
couple tests because it landed a little
bit on its corner but a concern that I
had definitely came about in this
particular test the separation in the
panels does cause the back cover to come
off just a little bit after impacting on
a corner I wasn't able to get to fall
flat but we still see some damage even
though it landed on its corner which
probably was maybe a little bit worse
all right we got damage on the bottom of
the phone in the corner the cover does
snap right back in like I just did right
now so it does come back there is
scuffing on the corner and the cover did
start to separate but I was able to get
that right back in there I have to drop
it back on that particular spot again
because we're gonna do our bottom test
so here we go in three two one
looks like we have more scuffs on the
bottom but there really is no damage to
at least the screen for now and we
didn't have a separation of the back
once again now we're going to do the
final test of the Google Nexus 5 and
that's falling right onto its face this
is where some of the worst damage can
possibly happen on the phone from about
chest level in 3 2 1
whew
a lot more damage than I had expected I
mean I expect the damage but that oh
this is not good at all I was expecting
the screen to crack but I wasn't
expecting the circuits to show up on the
bottom like that in just one drop we've
already exposed the inside of the phone
so you saw the before shot that I gave
you of the phone working let's see if it
still works so there's the screen it
actually turns on and there go the
elements so it's still operational
to a fault however getting you back down
here is probably not that safe and of
course yeah you run the risk as usual of
sort of nicking your thumb when you're
swiping across the screen for the most
part however it looks like pretty much
most if not all of the screen that needs
to work is working so maybe that is a
plus but still this is really really
crazy but the most impressive part about
this phone is I despite all of that it
is still highly operational I found
really no parts of the screen that were
still that were inoperable I found that
pretty much everything worked the cracks
are below where the soft keys are and I
was actually very pleasantly surprised
that's this completely cracked screen
still works actually quite about as much
as you need it to so with that being
said this drop tests on the Google Nexus
5 kind of for the most part it passes
because it's still operational phone
even after all that we did to it however
because of those blemishes down here I
do have to give it a bit of a yeah
because so much of it was exposed after
just one drop all right guys there's
always thank you very much for watching
and I hope you enjoyed this drop test if
you did drop us a like down below and
