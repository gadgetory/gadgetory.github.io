the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and its
predecessor the Galaxy Note 3 when it
comes to the overall size and looks the
note 4 is actually very similar to the
note 3 of course the major design
difference is the presence of a metal
frame that was originally seen in the
recent Galaxy alpha the note 4's corners
also come with a bit of a curve to them
but it's really not something that is
very noticeable this flat side a profile
when it comes to that metal frame really
helps refine the feel of the note 4
though when you look at the back it is
still made of the plastic that was
originally introduced in the note 3 that
textured plastic that's made to look
somewhat like leather though it does
lose that stitching from last year but
on the front side both of the Samsung
handsets have essentially the same
iconic look with the physical home
button though now the note 4 does add a
fingerprint scanner to the formula
underneath that home button the note
forced front also features what Samsung
does refer to as 2.5 D glass which
basically just means the edges of the
protective glass are a bit rounded for a
better look and speaking of that display
you can really see it for yourself that
both of these devices feature the
beautiful crisp Super AMOLED displays
that Samsung is very much known for that
bring vivid colors deep contrast and
excellent viewing angles the screen
sizes themselves remain the same though
the note 4 now comes with the quad HD
resolution and it's very impressive from
what we've seen already the pixel
density on the note 4 is through the
roof over 500 pixels per inch which
really Trump's the original galaxy note
3 though we will say that any pixel
density above let's say 350 pixels per
inch might be a matter of debate as to
whether or not it really adds to the
sharpness but nonetheless the resolution
on the note 4 is sure to bring you a
great experience with all media and text
as we've seen for example on the Galaxy
Tab s line of tablets which all have
that quad HD display as well once you
get underneath the surface you can bet
that the updates needed for the Galaxy
Note 4 are definitely here as we are
going to get the two versions one that
is powered by a Snapdragon 805 processor
and the other by samsung's new Exynos
octa-core processor as well the two
processors are going to be the best on
the market right now as we're going to
get even the best GPUs underneath as
well for all of the gaming pleasure that
you might be needing now both of these
versions
four gigabytes of RAM which should
further help with multitasking which has
been given a big boost in the galaxy
note 4 but even if it's only one year
old by now the note 3 is still very
respectable in its package with 3
gigabytes of RAM and a powerful
Snapdragon 800 or XT nosed processor of
its own in terms of hardware the note 4
comes with 16 32 or 64 gigabytes of
storage with the obligatory microSD card
slot that lets you plug in another up to
128 gigabytes worth the note 3 has the
same basically in this front and it's
still a really great device for
day-to-day usage now while the battery
capacity hasn't substantially changed
between the two generations we will say
that the note 4 comes with the addition
of fast charging which we have been told
will allow you to fill up to 50% of your
battery in just 30 minutes
of course when we're talking about
hardware we do have to talk about the S
Pen and it does mostly look the same as
last year's iteration but this time is
just a little bit thinner and also gets
a bit of a texture design on the actual
pen itself for a better handling feel
after that the actual touch sensitivity
of the s-pen has been improved which
paved the way for a couple of new pens
inside of the S no application the
calligraphy and the fountain pen for you
to truly customize the type of strokes
that you have when your handwriting your
notes and then when it comes to the
camera Samsung has finally adopted that
optical image stabilization we've always
waited for on the note 4 which means
you'll get smoother video clearer
pictures and possibly even better shots
in low light which should give it a bit
of a boost over what might otherwise be
the same type of experience that you
would get on the 13 megapixel camera of
the Galaxy Note 3 the front camera has
received a nice update that now has a
three point seven megapixel unit in the
front of the galaxy note 4 with a wide
viewing angle 90 degrees as compared to
77 on the note 3 if that's not enough
you can use the wide selfie mode to
capture an even wider image that is
perfect for group selfies and finally we
take a look at the software where we see
that the Galaxy Note 4 has been given
that aesthetic upgrade that the galaxy
s5 had which just put it over the top in
terms of looks when you compare to the
original Note 3 but we also have a lot
of enhancements when it comes to the
features which include the smart select
which lets you copy content from
different sources and collect it in one
place to be used later in a number of
different ways but we also have the
updated multitasking features on the
note 4
in which from the recent apps screen you
see these cards here where you have a
little button where you can launch the
multi window mode automatically and from
there you can actually move in and out
of the multi window mode and a floating
app mode seamlessly to make the
multitasking experience even easier for
you but from there we take the S Pen out
and we see the Air Command menu which
was also tweaked to include the smart
select and also be a little bit more
streamlined but from there the action
memo is easily activated by holding the
button down and tapping twice on there
and you will be able to have really
quick notes because you can easily
convert the action memo into an S note
note now one other feature is the
Selective voice recording mode which
takes advantage of the extra mic on the
note 3 2 on the bottom and one on the
top at this point which lets you record
sound that comes from let's say the
front and back of the phone only and can
detect up to 8 different voices that you
can turn on and off in your audio really
all these consider you're not losing
that much if you stick with the galaxy
note 3 when it comes to software but we
will say that the additions of the note
4 greatly enhance the kind of experience
that was already there so if you want
the bleeding edge then you can go for
the note 4 and all those enhancements
will likely make the experience even
better if you compare it to the note 3
and so there you have it for this quick
look at the galaxy note 4 versus the
galaxy note 3 like we said in the galaxy
note 4 first look it is basically an
improvement across the board from the
galaxy note 3 that we will say that the
experience might largely be the same it
has just added those little enhancements
that might put it over the top for a lot
of you out there we definitely love the
design and all of these software
enhancements we then just make life a
little bit easier even if many of those
features were already available in the
note 3 so keep it tuned to Android
authority for all of the best coverage
of the galaxy note 4 here at the samsung
live event in Berlin for Aoife 2014</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
