there's a lot of really interesting
computers here of course it's Computex
so this is the show where you're gonna
find a lot of really weird designs but
this year there's also a lot of really
interesting laptops so we decided to go
over our top five laptop designs of copy
text 2019 so first is a collaboration
between nvidia and then a bunch of other
brands but we really wanted to highlight
the razer version so this is the Razer
Blade 15 Studio Edition and the idea
here is that they wanted to make it
really easy for creators to find laptops
that work for them so this Razer Blade
15 studio Edition has a 15 inch OLED
display it's 4k and it's beautiful uses
an NVIDIA Quadro 5000 which is a
graphics card that has traditionally
been used for more 3d rendering purposes
and it's got an Intel Core i7 97 50 H
which is 6 core 12 thread CPU and so
this laptop is just incredible it's also
got 32 gigs of RAM and up to one
terabyte of memory so you've just got
insane specs in this laptop and it also
comes in this really beautiful color
next up we've got the a sous Zenbook Pro
duo and we actually have a dedicated
video for this so if you want to go
check it out there is a link right up
here but effectively it is a 15-inch
laptop with an OLED display it's also
got 32 gigabytes of RAM and up to a
terabyte of storage but the really
interesting thing about this laptop is
that it's got a separate screen on the
keyboard base called the screen pad and
effectively what this is for is being
able to multitask with different apps so
you've got the main window on your
laptop that you would normally use like
any other laptop if you can pull down
other windows into the screen pad to
really multitask more effectively now
it's also including up to an Intel Core
I 9 processor and an NVIDIA r-tx
2060 GPUs so this is really a laptop
that is made for creators first next
we've got the Dell XPS 13 70 390 which
is now a 2 in 1 laptop if you really
like the original Dell XPS 13 this now
folds into a tablet portion so you can
do things like tent mode you can do
things like drawing on it in your hand
it's kind of a really interesting
concept that we've seen from Dell before
but now it's put in this new laptop now
this is one of the first laptops that's
using Intel's new isolate
processors their 10th generation
processor which is based on a 10
nanometer process and it's got about 2.5
times the performance of a previous
processor that Intel was using here you
might think that this laptop isn't that
powerful because it's a thin inline
notebook that is folds in half and it's
just extremely thin but it's actually
got up to 32 gigabytes of RAM and a
terabyte of storage so you can really
pack a lot of data on there now you're
not gonna get a dedicated gaming
graphics card like an Nvidia r-tx 2060
in this device but that new ice Lake
processor has iris plus graphics in it
which intel says is a lot better than
the previous generation next up we've
got lenovo's project limitless which is
a collaboration with qualcomm to
basically produce the first 5g ready
laptop now this is the first laptop to
use welcomes new 8 CX processor which is
about the equivalent processing power as
Intel's last year Core i5
8250 you mobile processor this is an ARM
based processor that is now just as
powerful as something that Intel has
been iterating on for years and when
we're not gonna see this laptop until
sometime in 2020 it's really exciting to
see a 5g ready laptop that is gonna have
incredible battery life and just as much
performance as a mobile laptop from last
year and last but not least we've got
two different concepts laptops from
Intel that aren't going to come to
market but they kind of show what you
can do with a laptop in today's day and
age first laptop is called honeycomb
glacier and effectively what this laptop
is is it's a laptop that kind of has to
displace sort of like the sous laptops
that we talked about earlier but this
one basically raises up so you've got a
separate screen that is kind of at an
angle right next to the keyboard and
then you've got the main screen which
comes up above that it looks a little
bit like a trapeze type deal going on
here but it's made for gaming so the
regular screen is right in front of you
and it's a little bit raised then you've
got this angled display that can show
things like stats you can do a twitch
stream on it it's very very similar to
as sous was showing but it's separate
from the keyboard it's not built into
the keyboard so that was really cool to
see and the second concept device that
we've got from Intel is called Twin
River and if you've seen the concepts of
Microsoft's core ear device it's pretty
much similar to that it's basically a
laptop that folds out with two screens
that kind of looks like a little book
that you would open up and it's a fan
list
I'm here so it's just two screens that
are both touchscreen and they're running
an Intel u series processor which is 15
watt but it is quad core and it's
actually a fanless design which is just
vapor chamber cooling to cool the whole
thing it's also made of this really nice
fabric material so it actually looks
like you're carrying around a book when
you're walking around with it so if
you're an artist that just wants to draw
things on the go and you want to have an
actual PC this is a really cool concept
so that's been it for our laptop roundup
here at Computex 2019 make sure you head
over to android authority comm because
we've got a lot of news here there's
actually quite a bit of news at Computex
we weren't really expecting that but
make sure you stand head over there and
stay tuned to our youtube channel
because we're gonna have other videos
from copy text 2019 as well and I will
catch you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
