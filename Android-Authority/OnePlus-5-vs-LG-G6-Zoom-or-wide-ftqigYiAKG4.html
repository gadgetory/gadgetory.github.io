camera in the Android space but we
wanted to put it up against another dual
camera that does things a little bit
differently it's Josh of a garb what's
going on everybody and this is a one
plus five versus the LG G six in this
battle between zoom and watch before we
get to all of that however let's go
ahead and briefly go through all of the
other bases and talk about the
specifications the oneplus 5 has a
slightly different philosophy when it
comes to the flagship game and you can
see it plainly in its design and in its
display the one plus five is a sleek
metal phone that is contrary to a lot of
the glass on glass designs that we see
from other phones like the LG G six
however there are some defining traits
in the design especially for the G six
which puts the power button on the back
with its integrated fingerprint reader
the fingerprint reader on the one plus
five is up front in the capacitive array
and then in terms of its input there is
the alert slider which makes a return
here but overall handling is about the
same between these two phones and you're
not really going to have too many
problems with either of them really
slipping about too much however there is
a little bit more screen on the LG G 6
because of its new 18 by 9 aspect ratio
you can fit more screen on this device
because it's a little bit more narrow
and LG has managed to make the screen go
pretty close to the very edges of the
front compare that to the 1 plus 5 which
has 1080p resolution in its screen which
is still okay for a lot of users out
there however it does still stick to the
16 by 9 aspect ratio which looks a
little bit more conventional when you
put it up against the likes of the SI to
end the G 6 in this case slight
controversies aside the AMOLED display
of the oneplus 5 performs very well and
it does put out some more saturated
colors when compared to the LG G 6
however the IPS display of the G 6 is
still a wonderful performance now while
the G 6 will have an always-on display
that kind of mimics the secondary
display that you would see on the V 20
the oneplus 5 does have a couple of
extra features under its sleeve there's
a less egregious night light blue filter
but the main feature that we like here
is the Reading Mode which monochromes
the entire display so that the oneplus 5
works a little bit like a secondary
Kindle if you're reading books on your
phone or going through different
websites like Android or decom it'll
look better and easier on the eyes
the five actually surpasses the LGG six
on the spec sheet sporting the
Snapdragon 835 over the a 21-6 gigabytes
of RAM over the four and even more
internal storage and base models there's
no denying that the performance between
these two phones is going to be
top-notch but we still have to tip that
to oneplus for keeping their phones
internals as high as possible for the
spec hungry people out there in terms of
performance however between these two
phones you shouldn't really have any
issues at all when it comes to extras
however the LG G 6 is a bit of a mixed
bag while there are features like a
dedicated deck or wireless charging
involved they're only available in
particular markets oneplus on the other
hand keeps the extras to a general
minimum with the exception of the alert
slider which we already mentioned and
pretty much every connection type that
users might need is available here
including NFC for the oneplus 5 battery
performance somewhat favors the 1 + 5 if
only because it's screen is a little bit
smaller and has lower resolution however
the LG G 6 doesn't fall too far behind
after all both of these phones have the
same capacity in their battery units
Android nougat is found on both of these
phones in their own respective flavors
and in the case of LG the extras have
been scaled back in recent iterations
qslide is still available if somewhat
hidden and to make life easier
customisable soft keys make it so that
you don't have to reach to the top in
order to bring down the notification
slider oneplus on the other hand has
still brought a level of customization
to oxygen OS the capacitive array can be
deactivated for soft keys or they can be
customized for specific functions while
more input methods like drawing gestures
on the standby screen make it easier to
open some of your most used applications
the 1 + 5 is also one of the only phones
out there to support a dark mode and we
also enjoyed the Shelf which provides a
place to safely put away some widgets so
that they don't take up room on the main
home screens so now we can talk about
the cameras and for the most part we're
dealing with two high-powered shooters
here the front-facing cameras however
have a clear difference as the oneplus 5
has a 13 megapixel front facing shooter
compared to the 5 megapixel shooter of
the LG G 6 the front-facing camera of
the oneplus 5 has a clear advantage of
the LG G 6 as it sports 13 megapixels
much higher than the 5 megapixels of the
LG G 6
however the G 6 does have this ability
to crop in the sensor this is the
original wide-angle version
of the front-facing sensor that you can
then crop in a little bit so that you
can use one or the other in order to get
more people into your selfie the
interfaces also show off a little bit of
a difference in philosophy the longer
screen allows for more room so that on
the side there is a really sleek
interface for checking the most recent
pictures and videos when you're inside
of the camera app the difference in the
1 plus 5 is that the 1 plus camera is a
little bit simpler but you can go into
the pro mode and you'll get tools like
even a histogram to be able to find out
exactly how your shots going to turn out
the LGG 6 photos tended to come in a
little bit more overexposed
and on top of that its color processing
was a little bit more dialed back the
HDR on the 1+5 aisle resulted in
contrasting photos and also higher bumps
of in saturation so that means that the
1 plus 5 camera is probably going to end
up providing the more crowd-pleasing
photos whereas the LGG 6 is the more
accurate one depicting the scene the
same basically goes for video as well as
you can record 4k
videos on either of these cameras so
even if the experience is going to be
pretty top notch no matter which one you
pick we can talk about the extra now
zoom versus wide with the 1 + 5 you get
a zoom lens that allows for 2 X optical
zoom and then you can go beyond that
with slight dips in quality I took both
of these cameras out to San Diego Comic
Con and I found that the 1 + 5 was a
little bit more useful for that kind of
situation after all I was in a lot of
different crowds and if I wanted to
actually get a picture of the subject
that we were all crowding around the
Zoom actually helped with that like in
this picture where I got a paparazzi
style shot of Tom Welling former star of
Smallville or in this case outside of
comic-con where I was part of a big
group that was taking pictures these
amazing overwatch mercy cosplayers
there's another reason why the zoom is
helpful on the 1 plus 5 as well a
portrait mode that uses software
processing along with the tighter focal
lengths in order to create a
nice-looking portrait of your subject
you can put anyone or anything into the
frame and it will try to draw a line
around the subject and then add a bokeh
effect to everything in the background
the problem with the portrait mode is
that it's a bit hit or miss the lines
have to be very defined on the subject
or else you're going to get certain
parts of the photo that are still in
focus as the software wasn't able to
really define the subject when it works
it's a beautiful photo but when it
doesn't
if you get kind of uneven photos and if
you don't have well-lit situations you
won't be able to use the portrait mode
in low-light so now we have the
wide-angle lens of the g6 it makes
perfect sense that you would have zoom
when you just need to get right into the
subject but when it comes to wide-angle
shots you're trying to share even more
of the scene and thus more of your
experience users would never have to
worry about getting everybody into the
frame or in some cases anything in the
frame when it's so wide that you'll be
able to get a nice dramatic shot of the
scene even the most mundane of photos
can be made more appealing when there is
plenty more to share outside of just a
subject and as it stands right now LG is
the only company that is making a
wide-angle lens that is standard on all
of their flagship phones ultimately
matters what is more practical to you
the zoom lens is going to make more
sense for people who are typically too
far away from their subjects and if you
want to use the portrait mode then it's
going to do a good job as long as it
works perfectly the wide-angle lens is
probably a little bit more fun to use
and it's going to get everything into
the shot in a dramatic fashion maybe you
want to focus quite literally on very
specific things using a zoom lens or
portrait mode and that's the perfect way
of describing the 1+5 with it's honed in
specifications you don't really get too
many extras but you get a top-notch
experience still or you want to get
everything you possibly can into the
frame and that's a great way of
describing the LG G 6 with its wide
angle lens great specifications 18 by 9
aspect ratio with bezel is almost
display and pretty much everything you
could ask for in lg device well you get
that with the g6 so that might be the
best way of describing this comparison
