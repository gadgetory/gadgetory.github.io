clay know we're coming at you from the
best Android web site on the web and
read Authority calm today I've got an
in-depth review of the HTC One S for
tmobile got our HTC One S right here
we'll just check out some of the
hardware the software the native apps
give a run-through of the performance of
the device as well so first off let's
take a look at the body this has got a
4.3 inch qhd AMOLED display with a 960 x
540 resolution this is packing a 1.5
gigahertz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon
s4 processor those are pretty fast we're
going to be doing a benchmark for this
as well in the video we've got one
gigabyte of RAM in this bad boy and
we've got a 1650 milliamp lithium-ion
battery which is non-removable its
embedded in the body now the body feels
really nice is HTC's thinnest device yet
this is only seven point eight
millimeters thick our 4.3 inch AMOLED
display has this nice curved glass that
kind of extends into the body like that
on each side let's see we have our micro
USB here got our speakers here in our
Beats Audio branding the bottom we've
got a small Mike got our volume rocker
right here on top we have our power
button another small mic and our 8
millimeter headphone jack we cannot take
off the case right here and then we just
pop it off when we pop the case off we
can see this is where our a millimeter
headphone jack is this is our SIM card
slot and then we have our nice blue
color we've got a blue surrounding our
8-megapixel rear-facing camera blue
bezel there we can snap this back on
this is a really nice device feels great
in my hands it's very very light it has
gotten a little bit hot the aluminum
backing does feel slightly hot when
you're running a lot of apps or when
you're doing the graphic intensive
program i'll just go ahead and turn on
this screen as you can see here we
greeted with the sense 4.0 running atop
the Android Ice Cream Sandwich for dot 0
dot for operating system our lock screen
is pretty cool it's our classic pull the
ring up for HTC and also grabbed the
phone and bring it down or we can grab
mail messages and even a folder
we bring down a folder we actually open
up the folder on the home screen this is
our basic home screen we've got our
location data and our weather with our
HTC flip clock they use and they
implement often we just scroll through
the home screens we don't have infinite
scrolling but it is preloaded with some
HTC widgets as well as some t-mobile
widgets and we'll scroll through that
our power bar there this is our
notification bar as you can see we're
actually getting a system update right
now you can go to our settings and we
have our airplane mode our Wi-Fi our
bluetooth mobile network now under our
personal tab here we can personalize the
HTC One S we can select through a few
different scenes that HTC comes with we
have our HTC social work play and travel
all with different widgets setups
there's no theming going on with the
different scenes like this but it does
configure different widgets as well as
different wallpapers we also have our
skins there are skins it's basically the
same thing we do have our Luminum skin
to actually just changes some of the
background and stuff in the lock screen
and we have our mat and their serene we
have our default wallpaper we can choose
we can choose our lockscreen style and
we can choose lock screen lock screen
shortcuts and we can organize apps and
widgets on the home screen also have
sound configurations where we can choose
our different alarm notification
ringtones we have our counts nsync where
you can add different accounts now if
you had a facebook and stuff like that
HTC is going to requested a permission
for your Facebook the sense is and I
really don't like that but it's fine we
can have our location settings our
security settings we can set up the
different screen lock configurations and
can encrypt the SD card in the sim with
our privacy and accessibility settings
under the display and gestures is where
we can choose our brightness how long
the screen stays awake and we can enable
HTC gestures with three finger gestures
we have our usual sound settings apps
storage power under the power we can
check out our battery level and what's
actually been using the battery we have
our developer options available with
Android for auto with USB debugging we
also have 4th GPU rendering and then all
the other great stuff that comes with
ice cream sandwich
under the about device we can see under
the firmware information here we're
running Android 403 not 404 anyways we
have our sense version for dotto no
easter egg with HTC devices
unfortunately going back anyways we can
check out our app drawer here when we
open that up we have our all frequent
and downloads different segments and we
don't have infinite scrolling on the
app's you can see some of the tmobile
preloaded apps are the 4 11 and more the
game base we have our HTC hub preloaded
app this comes out this comes with
mobile lookout security we have our t
mobile hotspot my t-mobile the more for
me we have Polaris Office pre-loaded as
well as where's my water this game
here's our task manager we can get into
that later do i frequently used apps
it's just a list of the apps that we use
frequently we have our downloads as well
we also have links to the play store
right there or we can search through our
apps and bring down a menu where we can
manage apps edit tabs and share anyways
once we have a few apps running we can
check out the recents which is very nice
and it's sexy this is a lot different
than the normal Android phone auto task
management system this is a lot more
chic it's nice it's easy to use we can
just grab and fling upwards remove the
apps you can remove them all at the same
time which I've creates somewhat of an
inconvenience but it's just fine because
it's a nice i interface just like that
we have our home back capacitive buttons
will impress the home it also brings out
these we can select which one of our
screens will be our default home button
you can also do that by pinching in
using their gestures when we do that we
can add a panel as well so let's go into
our task manager under our task manager
we have our RAM management here and we
can end all the applications stop all
then we can refresh and we also have a
menu in our task manager we have our
settings automatic startup we can
actually start the task manager when we
boot the device up and then we can have
a memory use notifications anyways we'll
just do a nice little quadrant test on
this device to show you how fast these
Snapdragon actually is
coming in the benchmark ok so the HTC
One escort a 5073 which is a fairly high
score it even scored higher than the HTC
One X our cpu is 8420 with our memory
coming in at 70 612 which is very good
for memory considering this only has one
gigabyte of RAM anyways we'll go back
this device does have Corning Gorilla
Glass 4 display so it's fairly strong we
have Beats Audio across the spectrum for
audio video movies all that stuff the
great stuff these will check out our
browser right now not connected to any
web page the 2g is all I'm getting in
this area my name is going to check out
the settings when we open up the menu we
can view the desktop site which I always
liked in the browser options we can
enable flash player also has html5
support we can go to our browser
settings where you can enable labs with
our quick controls it was our tab
management on the browser is very nice
as well so if we're actually viewing a
web page we can bring our finger down
and swipe and this is our tab management
of course these are all like on
displayable web pages but you can just
cancel by pressing the X we can create a
new incognito tab as well access our
bookmarks and are saved but our most
visited in our history anyways we can
check out our camera our 8 megapixel
camera on this is great we also have a
1.3 megapixel front-facing camera okay
now we can just take a picture of this
cruzerlite case with the camera this has
to be fast burst okay we have the super
fast capture available on the HTC One S
and it has super fast autofocus as well
the aperture on the lens for the HTC One
S provides forty percent more light
that's very cool we can also capture
pictures while we're recording videos
says great focus we can go to our
settings here and choose our image
resolution or video quality we can
choose full HD we have our ISO our white
balance we have continuous shooting mode
our camera options are face detection
auto smile capture widescreen your video
options and camera interface options
and choose our flash there here we can
choose slow motion video we have our
different camera scenes Auto HDR
panorama portrait whiteboard landscape
low-light what's really cool is we can
actually choose to take a video or a
picture just right at the click of a
button here these are different effects
that's really cool our front facing
camera is 720p HD now the beats audio
only works when it's actually coming out
of the headphone jack so it's no use to
do a test to show you but the Beats
Audio is a very nice improvement so all
in all you guys this is a really fast
phone has great features pre-loaded a
great camera and awesome screen super
lightweight it's super thin it also
looks sexy with the grey and blue finish
going on so if you guys got t-mobile go
ahead and check out the HTC One S you
won't be disappointed and stay tuned
with android authority calm guys we've
got plenty more reviews and everything
else is good
