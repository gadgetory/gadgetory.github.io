just about a year ago and was one of our
favorite Android wear smartwatches when
the industry was just getting started
this year Asus tries to improve last
year's low price SmartWatch while
decreasing the price by even more hello
everybody I'm crystal and yes Asia's
first Zen watch was a pretty great
SmartWatch but of course it has some
minor flaws so today we'll be taking a
look to see if Asus improved in those
areas or perhaps took a step backwards
we'll find out today in our review of
the Asus Zen while most Android
smartwatches
tend to all operate and perform the same
the design of the watch oftentimes the
main selling point and in this area the
asus is then washed to shines literally
the watch is made from high-quality
stainless steel which looks and feels
very elegant and beautiful its design
closely resembles a traditional luxury
watch while maintaining a nice simple
form and it's also not too flashy which
is good in a world still adjusting to
the idea of smartwatches you have some
choices in color of the stainless steel
from silver gun metal or even rose gold
another choice issues gives us users
this time around is the actual size so
you can pick up the Zen wash too in a
big 49 millimeter model with a one-point
63 inch display or a 45 millimeter model
with a one-point 45 inch display we've
been using the 49 millimeter model and
with me being a very short girl with
small wrists it feels very comfortable
and a lot of that is linked to the
thinness of the watch it's not as bulky
as most smart watches on the market
right now and you'll forget that you're
weighing it very fast actually it's very
easy to exchange bands on the asu's n
watch still by the little sliding
mechanisms next to the body of the watch
it's one of the easiest ways to take on
and off watch bands on a SmartWatch that
we try so far these straps come in
different colors and materials like this
black rubber band that has a slight
texture to it it looks and feels quite
nice nothing too eye-catching but it
gets the job done you can also pick up
leather and metal stainless steel bands
and for the larger design watch to
twenty two millimeter straps are
available for the smaller variant there
are 80 millimeter ones now unfortunately
the pretty large bezel surrounding the
display are still present with a Zen
watch to which
upset some people but with this being an
AMOLED display black wash traces will
seem to blend into these bezels and
itself to determine where the screen
stars and the bezels end which makes up
for it and of course the biggest
advantage to have an AMOLED display on a
Smart Watch is his battery consumption
with most of the time your smart watches
screen will be displaying a couple of
numbers and just two hands over a black
background that's at least 80 percent of
the pixels not being lit up so that
saves a lot of power the quality of the
display is quite nice colors have a nice
vibrancy to them and although the
resolution is not the best at 320 by 320
on the large model and 280 by 280 on the
small model it's more of what we're used
to with Android smartwatches in this day
and age the ACS then wash to has a nice
curved glass over the display Gorilla
Glass Street to be exact so should be
able to hold up over time and this watch
is also bit more resistant to water and
dust in last year's model being ip67
certified so you shouldn't be worried
about getting the swell washing your
hands or bringing it along in a rainy
day a welcome to change is a relocation
of the power button which is now found
on the right side instead of the back
and this time is capable of a couple
more things by pushing it the display
will light up or turn off if it's
already on and by holding it you'll get
into a menu with your apps contacts and
Google now another way to turn off the
screen and it's a lot more fun and
easier is just by tapping the screen
with the palm of your hand it works
perfectly
you'll feel a little vibration on your
wrist and the display will turn off or
go into a dimmer known color mode
depending on your settings and like most
Android smartwatches when you bring to
watch up to glance at it the screen will
turn on giving you more information it
works pretty well and very rarely will
not detect your motion and fail to light
up the screen and of course there going
to be some times throughout the day that
the Zen watch toons thinks you're
raising your wrist to take a look I'm
really you're actually just reaching for
something but the screen will quickly
shut off depending on your timeout
settings within both models of the AC
Zen watch - we have a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 400 processor and 512
megabytes of RAM which for an operating
system like Android wear performs very
well the Zen watch - connected to your
phone using bluetooth 4.1 and can also
connect to Wi-Fi Bluetooth connectivity
is very good I can pretty much walk
around the entire second floor of my
house with my phone in one room and
never lose connection inside the watch
is a sixth act
gyroscopes for detecting subtle wrist
wrestlers the larger variant sports a
four hundred million power battery and a
three hundred million power battery for
the smaller Varian when it comes to
software you're not going to find many
differences compared to other
smartwatches running the Android wear
operating system as Google doesn't allow
any tweaking or skinning you do however
have a lot of watchface choices that you
can change by just holding down some are
more customizable than others and some
show more information such as battery
life and step count if you want to save
some battery going with something based
around a black background will really
help after syncing your Android phone or
even iPhone now with the a season watch
- via bluetooth you will start receiving
notifications that you can browse
through by swiping up or down and when
you get to notification that you like to
interact with you can swipe to the left
to bring up more options or if you want
to get rid of a notification simply
swiping to the right will dismiss it
while the screen is on you can initiate
voice commands by saying ok Google to
send text check whether etc really the
main way to respond or do things on
these smartwatches is with your voice so
thankfully voice recognition is very
reliable the watch does a very good job
of remaining fast and smooth while
navigation through cars and menus very
few stutters are noticeable so it's safe
to expect a very fast and reliable
experience using this and watch - of
course you can keep track and adjust
settings - the Android wear app on your
phone we can view battery life graphs
change watch faces and mess with other
settings but asus has some great apps of
their own where you have some extra
freedom to enhance your SmartWatch
experience with the Zen watch app you
can trigger a find my watch alarm send
emergency messages to close contacts and
even launch a flashlight which may not
be too helpful
another AC Zen watch app called remote
camera allows you to view what your
phone camera is seeing through your
watch once again I'm not sure how many
people actually find this useful and
lastly one more ACN washout worth
mentioning is a wellness app which can
be an alternative to Google's fit app
it's a little silly how a sees broke up
every little feature into their own
independent apps when they could have
just made one then watch app that could
do it all so you may want to just stick
with Google's Android wear apps to make
this simpler battery life on the first
generation of the Zen watch was pretty
good lasting a day to a day and a half
before needing to charge now at first
battery life on the Zen watch 2 was
horrible it was
to get to a full day without the wash
time it would make it for the first nine
or ten hours before hitting 0% and this
is what the brightness set to three a
medium setting and the screen always on
ambient mode but after a couple of
charging cycles the Zen wash twos
battery was performing a lot better
lasting at least a full day to a day and
a half and if you turn off the ambient
display so the watch only lights up when
you raise your wrist you'll get a bit
more battery life but you're probably
going to want to keep ambient display on
so you can view the time without raising
your wrist now the charging experience
on the new HSN watch 2 has tremendously
improved there's no dock or cradle
included but instead is a magnetic Pogo
pin connector that makes connection for
charging very easy the charger also
charges pretty fast I was able to go
from 0 to 50 in about 30 minutes which
is pretty impressive probably the
biggest selling point of the Asus then
watch 2 is this price it's pressed very
low for an android smart watch for the
silver 49 millimeter model it only set
you back $129 and that's including the
rubber wristband there's also a Best Buy
exclusive for the 49 millimeter in the
gunmetal color and with that you'll
receive a leather wristband for 149
dollars and for the smaller 45
millimeter model it'll cost you 149
dollars including a leather wristband an
Android smart watch of this quality and
of this price is a steal if you're just
getting into the SmartWatch feel this
Zen watch 2 is more than perfect as it's
a beautiful luxurious look while still
having very simple aesthetics so it is
not too showy
which is a big concern for people
thinking about wearing smartwatches for
the first time it's customizable enough
with his different colors sizes and
interchangeable bands that make matching
it with your outfit very easy you'll
most likely have to throw it on a
charger before you go to sleep at night
so it could last you to the second day
but if that's the only compromise for
such a cheap SmartWatch you can't go
wrong with the Asus Zen thanks for
watching everyone I hope you enjoyed
this review and if you did give us a
nice big thumbs up because that really
helps us out also check out these cool
videos on the side here and our weekly
podcasts down there and lastly head on
