authority and we're taking a look at the
brand new idol 4s and idol 4 from
Alcatel OneTouch this is the successor
to the very popular idol 3 from last
year and they've really made some
drastic improvements if you thought the
idol 3 was a great phone you're going to
love the idol 4 and 4s the design is now
made of glass and metal all around for a
much more premium look and feel and
they're both very thin at roughly 7
millimeters up piece the idol 4s is the
higher-end model out of the two so
obviously you're going to be getting
much better specs all around the display
has been improved to a very gorgeous
looking 5.5 inch AMOLED display with
quad HD resolution the camera on the
rear is a 16 megapixel sensor with 8
megapixels on the front and the
processor inside is a Snapdragon 650 2
with 3 gigs of RAM the idol 4s also
comes with 32 gigabytes of internal
storage with 25 gigs available to the
end-user
but if that's not enough for you you've
got a micro SD card slot for up to 512
gigs of additional storage there's a
large 3000 milliamp hour battery inside
that should be good enough for a full
day's worth of use and with quick charge
it only takes about one point six hours
for a full charge with the more
inexpensive auto 4 you're still getting
a really great package there's a 5.2
inch IPS LCD display with a resolution
of 1080p on the front a 13 megapixel
camera on the rear and 8 megapixel
camera on the front and inside is a
snapdragon 617 processor with three gigs
of RAM powering the phone you've also
got 16 gigs of on-board storage with the
same micro SD card slot as before s and
a slightly smaller 26 10 milliamp hour
battery that takes about one out of
charge with quick charge one of the
biggest highlight features of the idol 3
from last year was the dual front-facing
speakers and with the idol 4 and 4s
Alcatel has taken that to the next level
you still have the same beautiful
speakers on the front but now you also
have them on the rear as well so no
matter how you have this phone
positioned whether it's face up face
down or even upside down you're always
going to be getting high-quality audio
through the very loud and clear JBL
speakers the power key is located on the
right side of the phone but this isn't
your average
run-of-the-mill power button this is
what Alcatel calls the boom key and we
weren't able to check out everything
that this key can do but it can be used
to do things such as firing up the
camera from standby mode shuffling
through photos in your gallery
automatically optimizing your audio
experience for enhanced loudness and
clarity or create a really cool parallax
effect on the homescreen to show you
things like the current weather as far
as the software goes you'll is going to
Android marshmallow with Alcatel x'
custom UI but like previous versions the
Alcatel x' interface it does enough to
differentiate itself but still maintains
a somewhat stock look and feel which is
great for general fluidity throughout
the interface and just an overall pretty
clean user experience with the boom key
these stunning displays and high quality
speakers the idol 4 and 4s is all about
creating an Augmented multimedia
experience so these phones are also
going to come packaged with a set of JBL
earbuds and a VR headset which is
something we've never seen done before
so not only are you getting a great
phone but you're also getting some
pretty cool accessories to go along with
it this has been a quick look of the
Alcatel OneTouch Idol 4 and 4s for more
