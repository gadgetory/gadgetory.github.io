face if you remember a few months ago I
made this prediction the flagship craze
will be over and we will revert back to
flagship phones being about 4.7 inches
but it turns out I was clearly quite
wrong with that because all the next
crop of flagship phones and mid-tier
phones are plus 5 inches 5.2 inches at
least some is 5.5 45.7 inches and the
other a trend is that tablet sales are
actually going down not up because my
original theory was that as people get
both phone and tablet their media
consumption on their phone would go down
and up on their tablet but thus far that
has not happened yeah and to prove that
Samsung is releasing a new crop of mid
to your phones and you guessed it
they're all pretty large Samsung is
expected to release the highly
anticipated and metallic bodied Galaxy
a7 and as the naming scheme implies the
galaxy seven will be the high-end option
in the galaxy a series range it
supposedly will feature a larger 5.5
inch 1080p display and have an octa-core
exynos 5433 chipset and the same system
on a chip that powers the Galaxy Note
rather than the mid-range quad-core
processors found on the other two
smartphones in this range the galaxy a3
and a5 the cortex a57 cores will be
clocked in at 1.8 giga hertz and one
point three gigahertz for the cortex a53
previous rumours had suggested that the
galaxy a7 would ship with the Snapdragon
615 which is an octa core cortex a53
chip now Samsung is really doubling down
on their mid-tier options with the e5
and e7 according to industry insiders
the galaxy 5 and d7 appear to share a
lot in common with Samsung's recently
released galaxy a3 and a5 as well as the
rumored a7 and fall right in the
mid-tier category starting with the e7
the handset features a 5.5 inch AMOLED
display with a resolution of 720p it
reportedly packs a mid-range 64-bit
Snapdragon 410 processor 2 gigabytes of
RAM and a 13-megapixel rear-facing
camera and a 5-megapixel front-facing
camera
we'll have 16 gigabytes of internal
storage and a 2950 milliamp hour battery
but that's not all because Samsung has
more in store for you who love mid-tier
phablets without the phablet price the
samsung galaxy grand 3 was just approved
by china's version of the USA's FCC the
galaxy grand 3 does feature improvements
over last year's generation of the
handset the older Snapdragon 400
processor has been swapped out for a
slightly better 1.2 gigahertz quad-core
Snapdragon 410 which is built from the
64-bit ARM Cortex a 53 s the handset
camera has also been improved the grand
3 sports a 13-megapixel rear-facing
camera and a 5-megapixel front-facing
snapper the phone also comes with 16
gigabytes of internal storage up from 8
gigabytes and a microSD card slot to
make all you microSD card Deeks happy
and it will support up to 128 gigabytes
of space does anyone else get the
feeling that Samsung is just throwing
everything at the wall and seeing what
sticks I mean didn't we hear just a
couple weeks ago from a samsung VP that
they were going to scale down their
options and models I don't know what's
going on now when Google Hangouts
originally came out it was a very
exciting time because not only did allow
us to make video calls to each other for
free or dirt cheap but allowed us to
broadcast very easily from your webcam
easier than just uploading and editing
to youtube it was fantastic but it's
lost a little bit of a momentum over the
past few months but Google is not giving
up on it and has updated hangouts
significantly the hangouts Android app
has been going through quite a few
changes recently just a few days ago we
saw the material design enhancements
stickers and time stamps now an update
is rolled out for the google hangouts
chrome app that brings notification
support and a new phone tab google is
making your desktop much easier now
allowing you to place hang out calls and
SMS messages to your google voice
contacts straight from the chrome app
which is different from the chrome
extension now for a kid who grew up in
the 80s the google hangouts thing is
really
big way back when the movie 2001 came
out we saw people doing these video
messages that was really really easy and
it was you know it looked fantastic and
now Google Hangouts actually lets us do
just that so was really really exciting
but what do you think Google Hangouts
needs to do to really really spread to
the average person I think Google
Hangouts so far has really done by geeks
most people the average person love to
text on their phone they often don't
even respond to google hangout pings and
messages what do you guys think needs to
happen for really to go mainstream
