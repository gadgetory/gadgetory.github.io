what's going on everybody and us here at
Android Authority the four of us that
are here are having a great time here in
Austin Texas for South by Southwest but
of course we are here to talk about
virtual reality and VR and they have a
great number of panels and also demos
here at Austin Texas for the ability to
not only talk about VR but also
experienced it but a number of the
panels that we did go to today we're all
about how to create stories with virtual
reality and the one that I went to in
particular is called using virtual
reality to create compassion now there's
no doubt that virtual reality is
essentially a way for you to step into a
moment in time and be able to experience
everything about it there's sound
through an immersive look around the
area in a 360 view using 360 video or a
photo of course and what they're talking
about in this particular panel which was
head by Natalie ebel who was a director
of marketing for pencils of promise
cliff Palmer who's the president of John
studios will have links for all these
people at the in the description below
but also GABA Aurora who is a filmmaker
for the UN and this was a very
interesting panel because Gobbo in
particular was showing and sort of
explaining a couple of main examples of
how virtual reality was used in order to
create sort of a public mindset about
various issues that are happening in the
world right now now what you saw there
was a quick clip that he showed just
sort of showing what it's like from the
filmmakers perspective of actually
putting all of these VR cameras out
there and also getting a small glimpse
into what it's like to traverse that
area and what kind of what the people
were like at in Syria there was a sense
of reality
motivate people to do things not just
escaped a problem now there's times
where it's hopefully we've had a lot of
conversations and folks just wellness
they might just be going through you
know whether it's cancer treatment or
something that involve every King Jessee
but uh no para columns it just escaped
for the moment but I think as it's
encouraged do
especially young people it's all things
that were doing get out there not just
but the other example and this was one
that really spoke to the idea of
creating compassion was a VR
presentation that delved into the
problems and the somewhat torturous
conditions of solitary confinement in
prisons and jails wrongfully convicted
present early years and Marjorie which
is been a solitary confinement at the
NPC says you know these next moment to
take off the headset and these next
moment you get to take our heads I'd
return to your daily life but for over
eighty thousand American that's not the
case sighing ACL u--'s petition to ban
youth solitary confinement and every
single person did it everyone took off
their outside
so it's easy to think of virtual reality
headsets and experiences as new ways of
experiencing content and we usually
think about that from the entertainment
sense we have live music venues that
show it they have tourists applications
then we have gaming of course and also
movies of course so these are all
different ways of viewing the same
platform but really vr can also be a way
for us to educate the people and this
was a panel that was very much about
that not only educating people about
certain causes and issues but also to
have them experience what it is that
they might actually be fighting for or
fighting against and I think that's a
really profound way of looking at
virtual reality outside of the scope of
let's say what you guys might view VR as
at the moment and I think it's those
extra mile and those extra applications
of virtual reality that are going to
become more and more prevalent and also
more important as it's as its lifespan
continues as Darcy says in another video
about his panel that he what he reacted
to here at andrew authority vr is still
in its infancy but it's already an
incredibly powerful tool and an
incredibly powerful platform and we only
have to just think of it in a number of
different ways in a number of different
applications in order to make it better
than what it is right now and if we're
going to be able to change the world via
VR I think that that's a pretty
interesting and also very let's say a
profound way of looking at what might be
the next big thing in technology so keep
it into android authority for even more
about virtual reality here at South by
Southwest in Austin Texas android
authority of courses here taking a look
at vr which is the next platform of
content creation and content consumption
so we wanted to get our feet wet and
actually see virtual reality for all it
can be here in austin texas keep it
tuned here for even more for that and
everything else from our colleagues and
android and you can always subscribe to
a channel here and also drop us some
legs on these videos because we love to
