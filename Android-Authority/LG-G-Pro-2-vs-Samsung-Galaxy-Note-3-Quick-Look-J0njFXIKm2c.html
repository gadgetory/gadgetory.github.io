by bitdefender mobile security and now
here come the two behemoths from the two
big camps we're taking a quick first
look at the LG G pro 2 and Samsung's
largest most premium flagship the Galaxy
Note 3 both feature very compelling
designs with LG incorporating elements
borrowed from the recent crop of devices
like the LG g2 especially considering
the button layout that is found on the
back to be pressed by your index finger
to take things even further the G pro 2
Slim's the bezels down even further and
the back no longer is of a glossy
plastic as and is instead matted whereas
Samsung has gone with a more rectangular
shape with its design LG has curved down
the corners a little bit and have sought
to creative device that is not only
visually stunning but also is a joy to
hold in the hand despite its very large
size with that 5.9 inch screen yes we do
see a point to increase in the size of
the LG G pro twos screen however the
best from LG is standing up very well
against the best that Samsung has to
offer in its 5.7 inch AMOLED display
well let you be the judge on which one
looks better as both offer very deep
color palettes and are clearly among the
best that we've seen as far as
performance goes we also have a bit of a
dead heat here as both pack the
snapdragon 800 with 3 gigabytes of ram
backed by Adreno 330 GPU graphics so you
can't really lose in either case really
it's more of a question of the
perception of the performance which
appears to be pretty excellent across
the board we'll take a closer look at
how things perform especially in terms
of the camera as the camera on the
Galaxy Note 3 does not have all is and
the OIS inside of the G pro 2 is
actually enhanced not just with the
hardware that we all loved from the g2
but also with some software
optimizations on top of that as far as
the hardware bits go we do see that both
of these phones offer very similar
experiences what with both devices
having 3200 milliamp hour removable
battery units for a good longevity and
also expandable storage with a micro SD
card slot found right next to that
battery as far as the software goes we
do see that the Optimus UI by LG and
TouchWiz by Samsung are quite similar in
that they both sport
heavy feature sets but LG was quick to
emphasize that they will be focusing
more on the quality of the experience
rather than just adding more features
into the software suite that being said
however we do see some optimizations in
here with the update 4.4 kitkat in
particular one feature we did like was
the NOC code in which you could use a
pattern set of taps in order to turn on
and unlock your device from 8 turned off
state Samsung's TouchWiz on the Galaxy
Note 3 does have a top in class
multitasking suite that is very useful
but has also made its way over to the G
pro 2 as well however the main trump
card that the Galaxy Note 3 does have is
of course that S Pen and it remains one
of the best stylus experiences available
on any smartphone and most peripherals
to date in the end we have some of the
best that either of these companies have
to offer and in larger sizes you have a
great screen experience no matter which
device you pick so it really kind of
comes down to whether or not you want a
stylus experience with the Galaxy Note 3
or you want the best that LG has to
offer with their G pro - stay tuned for
a full comparison once we get our hands
on the G pro 2 in the future but until
then keep it tuned to Android authority
for all of the best coverage from the
Mobile World Congress here in Barcelona
