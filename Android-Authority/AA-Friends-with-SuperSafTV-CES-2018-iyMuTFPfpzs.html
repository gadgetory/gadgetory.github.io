everybody and I have the immense
pleasure to have one of our friends here
supersnap TV well okay this is something
to ask you
I'm sure you've had people ask you this
before when they introduce you is it
always super-sized TV super staff or
just staff like what's the best way to
do that well
Saffy's well everybody calls me but with
my online profile it's super safe yeah
the TV thing the reason why the TV thing
actually came about was because super
SAP wasn't available on YouTube time so
I kind of I was like what what I do
right yeah okay I lost a good TV at the
end yeah but now everything is
consistently just super safe but it's
kind of become part of the intro mmm
what's up YouTube's a feeling super safe
TV okay so I kind of just keep that for
the YouTube channel but yeah generally
for me personally it's super okay great
well the staff is here with us and thank
you guys so much for watching the
livestream and we're actually recording
this like we're not at the booth
obviously I did want to come by and make
sure I count I caught SAP before he was
actually out of here from Las Vegas but
like you don't have to give too many
details but like you've only really been
here for like a day or two huh yeah it's
it's been pretty hectic I got here on
Tuesday night and it's Friday right now
and I'm just kind of love just pack my
bags and getting ready to leave so like
directly after this I think he has to go
straight to the airport yeah it's pretty
much it's it's been pretty hectic and
with CES I mean next time I'll probably
come in earlier this was a bit of a
last-minute thing so next time I'll be
here like a good few days in advance
yeah I remember coming in on the first
day and I was trying to figure out who
was around we saw some of our friends I
mean we last saw each other in Hawaii
for the Qualcomm eval yeah which was not
amazing amazing and we had a bunch of
those guys around like annob√≥n bored at
work they have a Cogan the unlocker and
we're just kind of figure out who was
around and everyone was like is Sapp
here like checking your social and I
didn't see anything
yeah then finally I saw that I juiced or
was I just or was it a post that you
were like on a plane on the way here
yeah so that's I mean it was it was it
was a very last-minute thing and you
know with is my actually my first yes
are you kidding this is my first see yes
oh that's hard to believe it is and a
funny story first CSI I kind of walked
in and I was like kind of looking around
went into the the central hall and the
lights went off oh you were there one
the power outage happened yeah and this
is like this is literally like you know
talking minutes into me coming to CES
yeah I kind of just trying to take it
all in and then my school for nothing it
wasn't me
I heard that there was an immense
flicker for a while like it was
flickering on and off and then finally
yes I mean when I came in he's just like
yeah little flicker and boom gone so I
just met dan from what's inside I would
like to shine it in a straight way just
went off was like what just happened
it's crazy
absolutely crazy that's only one of the
stories from this I can only really
describe as a crazy CES yeah did you
hear about the the Google Experience
area um I don't think I did okay so
there are trams that are running like
the convention center we're actually
kind of high up here and you can see the
convention center way over there and
there's a tram stop that's there that
goes to a few other hotels and the tram
or the monorail whatever you want to
call it the tram on the side it says hey
Google oh it's a huge thing right but on
one of the stops you can go downstairs
and they have this whole display where
it says that you can use hey Google now
instead of okay gee oh I keep saying hey
Google I hope no I want them triggering
no one's phones out there but there they
have like in this experience Center and
it looked really awesome and people were
going and then I think just the day
before you arrived
it was raining like crazy oh yeah I
school that was that was insane yeah so
what happened was it actually rained it
out oh and everyone started like making
their little jokes about it like oh I
guess they still don't know about IP
certifications or something really I
don't remember who it was if you I don't
remember who was that that published us
on that tweeted this out but they said
that Google live by the cloud died by
the color in any case you are here it's
great to see and even if it's a quick
turnaround okay so we did talk a little
bit yesterday because we were hanging
out yeah I was going to ask you what
some of your favorite stuff from CES has
been or anything but you haven't really
had a chance to go home it's it's been
crazy because like I've just had the two
days and I think a lot of it has just
been kind of seeing you guys everybody
else I mean the tech youtuber community
is awesome and everybody's here and you
very I mean you get occasional sort of
events where everybody gets together
with CES is like where everybody's here
premium Yeah right
so it's just awesome kind of catching up
with everybody I had a brief look around
there's a few things I saw I mean the
Samsung 146 inch micro LED TV essence
yeah I agree it was it was actually
crazy to try to even get up close
because they was like that was probably
one of the busiest places that I came
across in the whole CSI was like at
least like 50 people in front of it so
but yeah I mean just seeing that was
like wow like I want that on my wall
like my wall does not look good anymore
like that is the wall that's what they
call it to this I think welcome to the
wall and yeah yeah they had a little
event to show it off and I stopped in
there was actually the first thing I saw
when I came to Las Vegas and when I
walked in yeah everyone was just
crowding around it there were so many
other displays but nobody wanted to
leave the wall I think that that's
that's the biggest display there and
like it's crazy and it's module as well
I mean they've not released too much
about it but you know you could make it
small you could potentially make it
bigger as well am i right in thinking
that I believe so because yeah the
modularity behind it all I mean I'm not
even too sure what is what that's all
gonna mean but it is it is a wonderful
piece of technology and there's a lot of
that here at CES and it based upon any
coverage that you might have seen is
there anything else that you thought was
pretty interesting at the show yes I
mean I'm a bit of a DJI phantom always
keeping up to date with what they're
doing so seeing the Osmo mobile - and
especially at this new price point I
think it's it's amazing really makes it
accessible to everybody and then I had a
play around with the the Ronin s oh you
did yeah yeah oh hell it was it's pretty
awesome yes also again like if you're
into filmmaking then I can see that as a
really useful tool how okay so how does
that stack up because DJI has a very
vast library of different gimble's and
of course there's so many other
one-handed cables out there like the
giant crane and all that how does the
Ronin
how do you feel the Ronin like stacks up
to those like do you have a gimbal that
you use so I actually use I mean I don't
use a gimbal for my DSLR okay
like you know microphone thuds my jh4
mostly I used the DJI Osmo mobile algaas
first version so but I have a play
around with the
making sure the name is the bigger road
right the row uh mmm Nona I'm Aronian
anyway yeah the double have to Canada
and you know from from a practicality
point of view like it's it's uh it's an
amazing piece of kit but you know
setting you up and everything so like
with the Ronin s that you could you know
have that one-handed
I mean it's heavy don't get me wrong but
it's you could still have that
flexibility of you know doing some of
those shots which will be much more
practical like you know getting into
smaller spaces things I did see that
there's there's a stand I don't know if
it's built in or if they had it screwed
on to the tripod mount but they had that
folded in and that was like the second
handle yes it looked like a staff yeah
yeah so yeah it's pretty cool so uh
looking forward to playing around with
that yeah I really want to try it out to
like I have I have a one-handed gimbal
from before that's just a I'm not gonna
say what brand it is or anything but I
just I think it's a piece of junk now
because I got it when one hand and
cables were starting to become a thing
yeah and of course like point one point
knows of anything you know yeah it's
it's uh yeah it gets better with time as
you know yeah so there's been there's
been a couple of trend like main themes
to CES and I'm wondering what your take
is on this I one of our friends Michael
Josh actually called it a boxing match
of sorts here at CES because it's Vegas
between Google and Amazon all right okay
assistants going at it yes so Google
assistant of course and then Amazon's
echo library with I'm afraid to say
Alexa but I just did Alexa finding its
way to so many different devices yeah I
guess my first question would be what is
your assistant of choice so my assistant
of choices Google home I mean I I don't
have anything against lecture is just um
it's more integrated with everything
that I have right now so um plus Google
sent me a bunch of stuff so you know a
so I mean you know I've got a few Google
I've got the Google home and then I've
got the Google home mini as well and
it's linked up to my philips hue light
system it's linked up to my smart
thermostat so yeah I nest it's a - oh hi
I was pretty it's pretty popular in the
UK I know that they just sort of they
had some announcements here as well with
young camera um but yeah I mean I've had
it at my place for some time so it's
it's nice to have that but yeah I mean
Google like I've been using Google
assistant on my phone as well so it kind
of just integrates with you know
everything having Google home is just
this is something I'm familiar with so
again like if there's any Amazon Alexa
fans I always try to do a disclaimer
when it comes to Android versus iOS or
when it comes to Google Home Office
Alexis I've got nothing against you
right whatever is your personal
preference but my personal preference is
cuckoo home I feel the same way I mean I
had the HTC u 11 life which has
obviously Android with Google assistant
built into it because it's Oreo or at
least nougat and the Amazon Alexa app
was in there because they wanted have it
integrate so you could choose between
the two assistants I tried using Amazon
Alexa for a while and it just didn't
feel like it was doing as much as
assistant wanted to or I wanted to with
the system and I had a couple people ask
me this already
they don't Google or Amazon and I just
said there's no such thing as Amazon or
Alexa Maps mmm you know so that's kind
of my main thing yeah yeah totally
so sell that phone I would ask Alexa you
know navigate to this place it would
just open Google Maps anyway exactly
exactly so yeah I mean it is what's I
mean it's it's built into especially
feel somebody who uses Android like with
me I primarily use Android it's
integrated with everything right so it
just it's just easier for me personally
how about putting assistance into like
everything like they're starting put
them into the smart displays now yes but
of course speakers and headphones yeah I
mean so I had a bit of a tour of the
Samsung booth so they've got Bigsby
integrated with everything yeah so for
instance I've got the family hub I've
got the 2.0 they've got the 3.0 now so
that's a small refrigerator which has
cameras built into your fridge and yep I
described it is something that you never
think you'd need but once you've got it
it's like this is so cool cuz I can I'm
here in Vegas and I can see what's in my
fridge that's true from here which is
like really cool but yeah I mean they've
got the integration with everything so I
mean there's some things that I can see
myself using like say I don't really
cook much but I mean if you are
somebody who cooks then you know you
could just be like do I have set a timer
for this long m8 here is well I seen
that but yeah so you know seeing some of
those things was really cool and they've
got some new concepts where if you're
listening to Spotify in your car and
when you walk into your house then you
can just be like hey Bixby carry on
playing what I work with what I listen
to and you carry on on your TV or your
speakers so there's some there's some
interesting concepts I mean it is taking
over like I'm sure in like five ten
years time we'll have everything I mean
like right now my place I mean I've got
Google home like I said I was saying
like so when I walk into my house mmm
and be like hey Google switch on the
living room and you know boom yeah it's
just like I love it it's it's it's the
features it's cool my my dream is to
have I mean people say is like the movie
her in a way yeah but not quite in that
direction but I do want to have a
bluetooth earbud okay yeah that I can
always have connected to any source I
want seamlessly but then it also has
Google assistant in there so I can
control stuff yeah yeah so I probably
have something I might be connected all
the time I don't know if that'd be a
great thing but I would have it in my
ear pretty much all the time I mean the
thing is like with with guys like uh
something like I'm constantly on my
phone right so having that connectivity
like especially like I think one of the
things is when driving right I I still
want to be connected but I obviously
don't want to be taking my attention of
the road right so having that
integration there and maybe you know
having it read out any view messages and
things like that so you're still
connected but you're not you know being
distracted in that way so yeah totally
um so I'm sure there's a lot of people
out there who have watched your coverage
already and watched your channel to see
what your thoughts on 2017 were but I
kind of wanted to backtrack a little bit
cuz I want to look at the future but I
first want to look at 2017 yeah and just
ask you what were your highlights of the
year what were your picks we did all of
our best of the year coverage and
everything so I wanted to see what yours
were yeah I mean it was there was a lot
of stuff I mean in the small phone space
I think was a really exciting time I was
because you know I I use
Android phones as well as Apple devices
so seeing the iPhone tent finally with
the display I mean because this is
something I was really like kind of
bored with the design so I mean I
actually like the iPhone er to use it on
the smartphone space I think for me was
it was you know cuz I'm I love smart
phones as you guys probably know and
especially when it comes to cameras I
mean the Google picks for cameras like
wow like that's I think you know he's
coming to a point where I'm taking my
camera out less and less like my DSLR uh
I mean I wouldn't take it out much but
now he's come to a point where I just
like you know I was on the cs floor in
his psyche I was you know I didn't want
to lug around camera at me and I was
just like recording stuff with my
smartphone and it's and it's awesome I
did do like a best tech of 2017 my
personal favorite like this is for what
I use it for was the Dell XPS 15 right
because okay I am I've been traveling a
lot recently and I needed something cuz
I'm a Windows user right so hey so I I
wanted something that was portable and
powerful right and you know having a
look around it was like you know you've
got some really powerful laptops but
they look really crap right they just
like huge right so with the Dell XPS 15
the 9564 me is like the perfect hybrid
so it's not so bulky it looks really
good it's got minimal bezels beautiful
4k display what's the what's the
graphics card that's in there is the
1050 1050 okay so it's you know for what
I use it for Premiere Pro it's actually
pretty good I mean obviously a 10-6 your
1080 possible would be amazing but then
you just reduce you have pretty much a
desktop that you can say it's like a
workstation at exactly exactly and like
with me like I've got my backpack and
I'm going from place to place so even
here like you know when I've been doing
a bit of editing here and there and it's
just that portability is awesome so yeah
that was my personal favorite I think
I'm in the market for a laptop and you
know what I should be thinking about the
Dell a lot more I have to say because I
know so many people who are really into
the XPS line yes
yeah I mean I was surprised because um I
can have watched a few of the videos
from 50 other guys and like the
recommendation was always the Dell XPS
15 we might need to take a quick second
if you see a hard cut real quick I mean
that don't worry we just had to tell we
just have to tell housekeeping that
we're good okay so now we can move
forward to 2018 I mean CES is obviously
supposed to be a sort of a snapshot of
the rest of the year which is why the
whole assistant fight is interesting to
me yeah but are there any trends or is
there anything that you're really truly
excited about coming into 2018 I know
there's a lot of speculation in this
kind of question yeah yeah I mean I'm
interested to see what what else we can
get in the drone space because I come I
have been like using drones for a long
time and like you know with with the
Maverick Pro it's just amazing with a
spark so I kind of want to see what can
it be having this year and it's quite
exciting to see what we're gonna be
seeing next in terms of portability and
you know quality that you can get I'm
also excited again like by Spurs in the
smartphone space and to see what else
they're gonna be doing
we saw some demos the fingerprint scan
within this place been something that's
talked about for so long it'll be nice
to see that in action and did you did
you get to see it at all I never get
over there okay well it was the vive
phone yeah the phone yes I mean seen
that unlike on the smartphone cameras
side of things like when the Qualcomm
submit they were talking about for 4kh
do you have video recording on a
smartphone sighs true Wow like I I
really want to kind of see how that's
gonna work and how well that's actually
gonna be we saw some leaked specs of the
s9 possibly might be fake who knows but
you know we're looking at possibly a
primary camera with an F 1.5 aperture
which is like what is good that's kind
of bunkers yeah I'd say so
and that's only like something like a
couple months away yeah yeah so
potentially what it was we're not we're
not yeah so many claims here or anything
like that based on the leaks that are
out that does
but that's what's looking like oh yeah
I'm really excited to see on because for
me like as as mentioned earlier on
smartphone cameras like it they're my
sort of main area of interest right yeah
definitely and I'm really excited to see
what we're gonna be having next because
last year was amazing yeah with things
like the pixel and the dual cameras with
the portrait modes which are getting
bear and bear and some of the shots that
I post like a lot of people like it
doesn't look like that was shot in a
smartphone because it's so good
exactly and then our favorite question
on social media what camera was this
which is which is why I always take but
you still like last time actually tag
hashtag not show on a smartphone because
be honest but I had like 15 comments on
that same picture saying which
smartphone was it exactly
we know you're lying come on it's a
smart well that's great I mean I'm
really looking forward to all of that as
well and I think for myself I'm just
really hoping that we see something
really gnarly come out I mean the axon M
was the most recent sort of really crazy
idea that they went ahead and put into a
smartphone we'll see more of that
Samsung with their well potentially
foldable displays but we don't know
what's gonna happen there I mean the
latest room is on that side of that
might not be seeing it this year it
might be nice I mean again these are
things that you know we've seen concepts
of for a long time so seeing that in you
know a consumer product which you can
actually go and get and use on a daily
basis that would be amazing and that's
what we'll see is hopefully the next
step yeah I agree I mean think about how
long the fingerprint sensor under the
display how long that took to come out
yeah and even that it's not even on a
production model it isn't yeah fully
someone's going to get it and also um
I'm sure you saw what it was were you
disappointed at all that it wasn't like
you can touch any part of the display I
know a lot people talk about that I know
I mean I can that I think I mean that
that's way ahead but I mean I was
expecting I was being more realistic so
like one of the things always says like
with the note tape and the SAT you've
got that 3d
well a pressure-sensitive area yeah
which I really like because wherever I
am I can just push that and that so I
I'm kind of used to that so very ER so
if it was somewhere around there then
you know I'd be okay with that be cool
with it cuz it's you know like with
touch ID you kind of
it's muscle memory you get used to where
it is so I'll personally I think I'll be
okay with it but yeah I mean having it
anywhere would be would be pretty snappy
that would be a bit futuristic I agree
yeah all right why don't want take up
too much time I know you're probably
gonna be heading out from here like
pretty much after this yeah I want to
thank you so much for having me on thank
you for having me as well it's been
awesome it's been awesome hang around
with all of you guys so it's it's always
nice to catch up Qualcomm and now this
and hopefully MWC maybe yeah do you
think you're gonna be there well it's
not so far for me socially so yeah I
forget about the proximity there well
I'll tell you what uh at the end of all
of our videos and livestreams for this
show I want to make sure I give you some
time to plug anything that you want to
if you're not already following then you
know do go ahead and follow me I'm super
safe on everything YouTube Facebook
Instagram - wait I'm not sure why I said
the Facebook straight after YouTube
that's usually the last one but yeah I'm
quite active on especially in Sugerman
on Twitter as well so do go ahead and
follow me on there if you wanna see lots
of tech stuff as well as be it selfies
yeah there's a lot of that I didn't
notice myself and then I was trying to
get some tips from him about like you
know doing some Instagram stuff as well
so I've learned I've learned a lot from
you man - it's always good to hang
around we we bounce around ideas yeah
and love the tech community and YouTube
is awesome for sure alright cool so if
you're sticking around for the live
stream I think we have a couple more
things coming up today but if not you
can always stick around to the Android
Authority channel for all of our great
coverage of CES 2018 because we are of
course your source for all things
