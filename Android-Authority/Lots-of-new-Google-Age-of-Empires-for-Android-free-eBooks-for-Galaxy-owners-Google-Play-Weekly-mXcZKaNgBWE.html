Hindy the android authority app guy and
it's Friday which means it's time for
another episode of Google Play weekly in
this week's episode we're going to talk
about a lot of awesome things that
Google did this week a new age of
empires game that's coming this summer
and a whole lot more so let's get
started before we get started I just
want to say congratulations to all the
teams that made the Stanley Cup Playoffs
the Montreal Canadiens are the only team
in Canada to make the playoffs fun fact
did you know that the Canadians were the
last canadian team to win the stanley
cup playoffs and that was back in
nineteen ninety three that means the
last time a canadian team won a Stanley
Cup Jace broda head hair okay so let's
get into some news this week first up
this week is ideal between Samsung and
Amazon that gets galaxy device owners
free ebooks okay so what's happening is
Amazon is releasing an official kindle
application specifically for samsung
devices it'll have all the standard
features of the regular Android app
except for one really nifty part where
Amazon plans on giving away 12 free
e-books per year to people who use the
Samsung version of the kindle app if you
want to try it out it should be
available for Galaxy devices right now
running Android 4.0 and up it's a fairly
solid deal if you own a samsung device
and read ebooks on a fairly regular
basis there's no word yet if there are
any limitations to your free ebook
selections but a quick way to find out
is to grab the app and see for yourself
with the highly popular and iconic age
of empires franchise it's going to be
making its way to Android sometime this
summer awesome unfortunately not a lot
is known yet about the upcoming age of
empires mobile game we do know that it's
coming this summer and what you're
viewing right now is from the teaser
trailer released earlier this week given
that it's a mobile game I'd say it looks
pretty good and I can't wait to give
this one a review it will feature
historical figures such as Joan of Arc
Attila the Hun King Arthur and others it
also boasts being able to team up with
others and battle against others so
there will be multiplayer support it
looks really exciting but as we all know
some poorly thought out in-app purchases
can tank an otherwise amazing game so
we'll have to wait and see how this
turns out so as you guys probably know
by now I love me a good humble bundle
and there's a pretty decent one going on
now featured in this humble bundle or a
number of android games including
faggots aaralyn sword and shadow our
type to the room to the cave and
carcassonne as per the norm you can pay
whatever you want and get the first
three titles if you fork over the
average which is four dollars and
fifty-one sense at the time of this
video then you'll get all six games is
worth noting that all six games would
set you back about twenty dollars if you
bought them individually in the Google
Play Store as my regular viewers well no
I always encourage people to get humble
bundles they donate money to charity and
it gives indie developers a little
attention in cash to keep bringing us
games if you're down to donate to some
charity and hungry developers and get
six games in the process check out the
written companion where we'll have a
link to the humble bundle so a potential
Google+ redesigned link made its way
around social media this week let's take
a quick look at it last week we talked
briefly about the various Google App
redesigns that Google may be doing this
week a new Google+ development build
leak seemed to shine some more light as
to which design may be the accurate one
as you can see the design is more
colorful with circular icons which seem
to coincide with the gmail screenshot
that showed up on reddit last week now
do remember that this is aleek and not
confirmed by anyone so the final
redesign could be wildly different than
what we're seeing here one thing is for
sure and that's that project Hera is
coming up and with all these redesign
leaks it looks like the next version of
android is going to be very interesting
in her last bit of news this week Google
Calendar got itself a pretty big update
the update began rolling out earlier
this week and now allows you to search
for and set real locations for meetings
it doesn't seem like that big of a deal
for some but this is something that's
been available in the web interface for
a long time but not the application if
you're a person who regularly scheduled
meetings on google calendar and they
have different venues than this could be
a wildly useful feature so who wants to
see some trending applications as usual
if you want to check any of these
applications out you can find the links
in the written companion which is in the
video description below first up this
week is domo icons this icon pack is
from the well-known and respected
developer cove dev and features more
than sixteen hundred and fifty icons a
cloud-based wallpaper gallery a category
based icon library and moves I live
wallpaper support it's a dollar
ninety-nine and for that many icons
that's not really a bad deal if you're
in the hunt for a new icon pack give
these a shot if our Fauria is an
application that lets you download and
read children's books
features over 600 books that you can
download whenever and either read to
your kids or let your kids raid on their
own it does require a subscription which
may deter some people but they do give
you a trial so you can see what it's
like first they add new books every
weekday and once you've bought in you
can download and read any book in the
library this is a great application if
you have younger kids because reading is
good today calendar was released this
last week to highly positive reviews
it's based on the AOSP calendar but
makes a number of visual and performance
improvements the most notable of which
is the more modern design with color
accents the developers also include
widgets as a separate download that have
also been redesigned if you like the
AOSP calendar but wish it looked a
little different this is an app to try
out part of the awesome week google has
been having includes the release of
chrome remote desktop as the name
implies this allows you to mirror your
desktop onto your android device so that
you can manage your desktop from your
mobile it seems to work pretty well for
most people but there are some quirks
and incompatibilities here and there
thankfully it's free so you don't lose
anything by trying it out the new google
camera was released this last week and
its really been the talk of the week i
reviewed google camera and we'll have
that linked here at the end of the video
and in the video description below so I
won't spend too much time talking about
it now Google camera is a simple camera
application with a refreshingly simple
and active interface with some fun
features like lens blur check out the
full review for more details for even
more of the latest Android app news
