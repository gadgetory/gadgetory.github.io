Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 135 we got a lot of
news to cover so let's get started the
Taliban tried to release an application
to the Google Play Store this last week
has just about all of you could have
predicted the application was pulled as
soon as it was identified for pretty
much every reason that you would expect
about the only disturbing thing is that
it took Google Play two days to get it
taken down but at least it's gone now
capcom announced that they are going to
be merging all of their mobile gaming
studios into one big single studio
called capcom mobile during the
announcement they also stated that the
studio would create four major mobile
games by this time next year and they
will be based on big name titles such as
mega man and monster hunter google
revealed this last week that the Google
Play family of applications are going to
be getting a unified set of icons this
is obviously so that consumers can see
them and recognize them as a Google Play
App results have been mixed in my
circles but I follow a lot of people who
criticize everything I think they look
freaking great some enterprising
developers decided to honor the legend
of zelda 30th birthday by recreating the
game using 3d voxel graphics the game is
playable in a browser and even on some
Android devices but admittedly not very
well still it's a fun little ode to a
great video game franchise whatsapp
announced a huge partnership this week
with open whisper systems makers of the
popular signal private messenger
application the partnership will bring
end-to-end encryption to whatsapp
improving its security immensely the
feature started rolling out this week
and everyone should have it by the end
of the month for even more Android apps
and games news releases and updates
don't forget to check out this week's
newsletter which is linked in the video
description below you can find all of
the information we didn't have time for
here including some stuff about VR if
you're so inclined you can sign up using
the form on the written companion which
is in the video description below as
well and then you can get the Android
apps weekly newsletter straight to your
email every Sunday all right folks is
take a look at the apps and games that
made anything splash this week as usual
if you want to check out any of these
apps or games for yourself we'll have
those links for you in the video
description below
zero click is a new application from
domino's pizza that allows you to order
a pizza just by opening the application
the idea is that you set up an account
on Domino's official website and then
you create your favorite order you can
then open the zero click application and
your favorite order gets placed with an
automatic charged to your credit card
there is even a 10-second countdown that
gives you time to cancel in case you tap
the icon by accidents it's nifty at
least if you live somewhere with a
Domino's Pizza disney announced that
Disney Crossy Road was coming out a few
weeks ago and now here it is it looks in
place pretty much like the original
Crossy Road except now you're playing
with and unlocking Disney characters for
those who don't know Crossy Road is kind
of like a modern-day version of Frogger
where you must cross roads and streams
all while avoiding obstacles it's a fun
little time killer that's free to
download and it's also kid-friendly
following the official launch of the HTC
vive the company also released a
companion application the app is quite
simple and actually just acts as an
intermediary between your device and
your VR headsets you'll get your
notifications in an unobtrusive manner
while you're in the VR game and you can
check them again later in the system
dashboard you can also use the
application to respond to a missed call
or a text message it's a simple little
app that appears to work well now all
they need to do is finish shipping those
pre-orders the long-awaited Kingdom
Hearts Unchained key finally hit mobile
this week on both iOS and Android which
is a rare feat it's a point-and-click
adventure game that has you traversing
through various disney world's to
destroy the heartless despite being a
free-to-play game the developers managed
to keep the cartoon quirk of the series
alive and well and so far there really
isn't much to complain about it's not a
full-fledged kingdom hearts game
obviously but it's definitely better
than most premium titles it's worth
checking out especially if you're a fan
of the series reddit release their
official application to the public this
week with hilariously bad results the
application itself works pretty well and
you can in fact browse the web site and
manage your accounts in various ways it
also uses material design and it looks
pretty good unfortunately fans of
third-party running apps seem to have
come out of the woodwork to criticize
the application for not being exactly
like their favorite third-party reddit
app this has resulted in a much lower
Google Play rating than this application
probably
serves in any case it's a good effort
and worth a try if you're a casual
reddit fan and that about does it for
this video folks if you want to keep
watching Gary has a fantastic video
explaining cache memory linked up on the
screen there and in the video
description below while you're at it
