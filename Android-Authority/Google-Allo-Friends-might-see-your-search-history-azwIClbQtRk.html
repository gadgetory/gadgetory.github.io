people google's assistant in google alo
may be showing people your search
history and doing so with attitude you
see the Google allo you can summon the
Google assistant to perform searches set
reminders and ask about weather and a
whole lot more but what happens when
Google isn't so secretive about what
you've been searching for
well according to recode that's a real
problem in a low right now when you're
in the middle of a chat with a friend
the Google assistant can help you find
the best places of Pizza near you or
plan a meet-up with your friend while
you're in chat and apparently some
people have been noticing that the
Google assistant is responding to
unrelated questions or even responding
to answers to earlier questions and this
is definitely something you don't want
your voice assistant to do and a
reporter at recode gave a first-hand
account of a bizarre interaction with
the Google assistant but it could have
been a whole lot worse
you see recode test Townsend within the
middle of a conversation with a friend
when the friend asked the Google
assistant to identify itself the Google
assistant responded to the question with
a link from the harry potter fan site
Pottermore which led to an excerpt from
Harry Potter and the order of the
Phoenix that may seem like a random
response to a simple question but that
is not the case it was actually a search
result related to a previous search that
was made by the friend a few days
earlier I don't have to tell you how god
that potentially could have went if it
has niche you just think about it for a
moment now it is worth mentioning that
the assistants answer didn't come from
anyone search history since no Harry
Potter related web sites were accessed
by either user in the few days before
the conversation plus the subject of
Harry Potter wasn't even brought up
until the assistant mentioned it
luckily Harry Potter was the only thing
the assistant brought up what if it
brought up a search result relating to a
more sensitive topic
now Google assistant in alo can relay
sensitive information to other users but
it's supposed to ask
permission before sharing for instance
if you were to ask the assistant what
your name is
it will privately respond with can I
share this giving you the option to
share this information with your friend
or cancel the request recode notes that
the assistant didn't ask for permission
before sharing this Harry Potter
information what do you guys think about
this does it concern you are you even
using a low I suspect that many of you
are not let me know what you think in
