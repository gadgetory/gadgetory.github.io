why are we even checking this thing out
it's called the Segway mini Pro by 9.9
BOTS a company that acquired Segway back
in 2014 and you probably know segways
reputation for making those Segway
scooters that you're used to seeing at
the mall beings by mall security
but the Segway mini Pro is essentially a
more slimmed down version of that and
it's also consumer friendly now a lot of
people will probably tell you this is a
hoverboard of some kind and we know the
kind of reputation hoverboards have they
were big last holiday season but after
safety issues some accidents and also
them being been specific cities it
didn't go well for hoverboards so say
what this product is better it's
actually the next step in the evolution
of personal transportation just because
it utilizes various technologies to make
it far better and also has a smartphone
aspect because it's connected via
bluetooth to your device the person that
really drew me into the Segway mini pro
is its design it's definitely a lot more
stylish and aggressive and that's
evident with the black paint job and red
accents found throughout the device it's
also a lot beefier healthier than most
hoverboards because the foundation the
frame itself is built from a super light
durable magnesium alloy gives it a lot
of strength and integrity and on top of
that too you could sense that there is
something more to this because it's put
together by 2/10 1/2 inch pneumatic air
filled tires and they are substantial to
say the least there are also a lot of
LEDs found throughout the mini pro it's
smart enough that at night they'll turn
on the front LEDs to help illuminate the
path you have also LEDs for when you're
braking or reversing turning a left or
right and all of them are actually
customizable so you can choose specific
colors for different actions what
differentiates it from other hoverboards
is the center column it sticks out so
basically you use this instead of column
to actually move left or right you steer
towards
specific directions and it kind of rests
right at your knees so you're basically
tilting your knees to the left or right
to move towards those directions and I
think this is a far safer implementation
than a hoverboard where you're basically
tilting your your feet one foot back one
foot forward and kind of throws you a
little bit off-balance this doesn't
really impede the balance within the
operation another thing that
differentiates this is its smartphone
integration it connects via bluetooth
you download the United by app to your
Android smartphone and allows you to
customize the LED lights you could
calibrate the unit you can also obtain
Diagnostics information you could even
control it remotely with the app and
there's also an anti security alarm
feature that will notify you an event
that it's being tampered with or moved
around but of course this all hinges on
the range of your Bluetooth connectivity
because once you're on that range if
someone touches it you're not going to
get that notification until that
connection is re-established
and at that point when it does they're
probably long gone with the unit I've
been using this for over a week now and
I gotta say for someone who's ever used
a hoverboard you'll naturally fit in
you'll easily get the balancing right
away if this your first time using a
personal transportation device that
relies on balancing it might have a
slight learning curve but it's pretty
simple and I found to be pretty safe for
the most part so just like most
hoverboards it's all about finding that
center of gravity why don't you
establish that getting on getting off
moving forward moving back turning is a
breeze and I had a lot of fun using it
actually there were only two situations
where I found using the mini pro a
little bit troublesome and the first one
is uneven terrain that opposed some
issues just because if you're moving
very quickly you might be thrown off
balance and secondly is going downhill
at a fast speed now going uphill fast
speed is not a problem because I'm
leaning forward with the unit but going
downhill very fast you
I get a sense of being unbalanced and
you also want to just play it safe and
be cautious when you're doing that I did
however have one incident where I got
off the Segway Pro Mini Pro but my
t-shirt kind of got caught on the center
column and then the mini Pro just
started turning left and it just you
know kind of grazed me on my ankle so I
guess you got to be careful about the
center column snagging you a lot of
people are going to wonder whether it's
a practical form of personal
transportation now I personally use a
folding bike whenever I go into the city
it's just more reliable and easy to
transport as well and the Segway mini
Pro is in same caliber it's at 28 pounds
so roughly the weight of your ordinary
bike but still bulkier and heavier than
most skateboards or scooters it does
have a top speed of 10 miles per hour
and a range of 14 miles which is great
but my biggest issue with the mini Pro
is that it's not as easy to carry around
there is a bar that you extend from the
center call to pull it around but when
you're trying to bring it upstairs or
bring it downstairs or just carrying it
around in the subway it's a walk there's
a lot of effort involved in that and on
top of that of course it's a battery
pack but in the event that battery dies
you're basically going to have to lug
this around wherever you go the last
thing you probably wanna know is worth
buying
it has a sticker price of $1,300 but
over Amazon right now it's on sale for
$1000 I know $1,000 is still a lot of
money but you have to think about those
commercial Segway scooters which start
at $5,000 easily so the savings you get
here with Minko is definitely
substantial still at the end day it's
just still too much of an expensive
investment to exper that type of
adoption on a mass scale and still gonna
be seen largely as a luxury thing now
for half the cost you have alternatives
like a decent folding bike electric
scooter or some other electric
transportation device that will offer
more versatility for those who really
need to cover this
I'll be the first one say that I had a
lot of fun using the mini Pro it's cool
it's fast gets you from point A to point
B relatively quickly but it's just still
too expensive for me to like so if you
guys won't learn more about this device
