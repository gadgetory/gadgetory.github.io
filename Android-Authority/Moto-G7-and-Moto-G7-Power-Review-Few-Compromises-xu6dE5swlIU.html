authority and today we're taking a look
at the Moto G 7 and the Moto G 7 power
these are two out of the four
smartphones that Motorola released in
the g7 lineup and if you couldn't tell
by the name these are the seventh
generation Moto G's and Motorola has had
a lot of success with a Moto G line the
very first Moto G became their most
popular smartphone and they've continued
to have success with it
ever since and for one very good reason
the price was always super affordable
and for that price you got a pretty
reasonable package in terms of
specifications performance and features
and they're looking to continue that
same approach with the g7 and g7 power
so the Moto g7 costs $2.99 and the Moto
g7 power costs 249 and for the most part
they're fairly similar but there are
some differences that separate them the
g7 is the more powerful of the two this
is sort of the flagship if you will out
of the g7 lineup and the g7 power
despite the word power being in the name
is actually a little bit lower spec the
power is actually referring to the large
5,000 milliamp hour battery that's in
this thing which is pretty huge and
quite a bit bigger than the 3000
milliamp hour battery that's in the Moto
G 7 they do however have the same
Snapdragon processor but the Moto g7
does have one extra gigabyte of RAM and
doubles the internal storage so you're
gonna get slightly better performance on
a moto G 7 in terms of multitasking and
things like that but for the most part
they both felt very similar in terms of
performance you're gonna be able to run
apps play games browse the web check
social media or watch YouTube perfectly
fine and you can even play games on
these phones without really that much of
an issue so I had no complaints at all
using these phones as a daily driver
when it came to performance now for sub
$300 smart phones the Moto G 7 and g7
power look and feel a lot nicer than
their price tags would lead you to
believe they also have really big
displays on the front they actually have
the same
sighs display and the same LCD
technology the only difference here is
the resolution the Moto g7 has a full HD
plus display and the g7 power has an HD
plus display so the g7 plus display is
noticeably sharper the icons and the
text just look a lot crisper whereas on
the g7 power everything looks a little
bit more jagged the other difference
between these two displays is the
notches they both have notches but the
g7 has a water drop style notch
whereas the g7 power has the more
traditional wider notch so the water
drop notch
not only looks a little bit nicer but
you're also getting slightly more screen
real estate the rest of the hardware is
pretty much identical they both have
micro SD card slots for extra storage
they both have rear-facing fingerprint
sensors they both have single speakers
and they both have a headphone jack the
only difference is the g7 has its
headphone jack on the bottom and the g7
power has it's headphone jack on the top
of course with these phones being subbed
300 other smart phones there are some
sacrifices that have to be made in order
to meet that price point you're not
gonna find a ton of bells and whistles
like you would on a phone that has a
thousand dollar price tag so the Moto G
7 and g7 power don't have wireless
charging they also don't have NFC which
means you can't take advantage of Google
pay or Android Beam and they also are
not IP certified that means there's no
official water resistance they do
however have a protective nano coating
that Motorola tends to put on a lot of
their phones so it can survive a splash
or getting caught on the rain but I
don't recommend dunking these in the
pool or in the toilet I would say one of
the biggest bright spots for the g7 and
g7 power is definitely the battery life
especially in the case of the g7 power
that five thousand milliamp power
battery in combination with the low
resolution display is a perfect recipe
for a long-lasting battery life and
Motorola claims that this phone can last
up to three days
I haven't exactly gotten three days but
I am getting a full solid two days on a
single charge with a ridiculous amount
of screen on time and the g7 s battery
life isn't bad
either I'm still getting five to six
hours of screen on time which isn't
gonna get you two or three days worth of
battery life but it will get you a full
solid day now the cameras on these two
phones aren't amazing they're definitely
not gonna stack up to smartphones that
are three or four times its price but
they're decent for what it's worth they
both have 12 megapixel sensors but
they're not identical sensors the g7 has
an aperture of f-18 and the g7 power has
an aperture of f28 a g7 also has an
extra five megapixel depth sensor so
your portrait mode photos are going to
look a little bit better and the g7 is
capable of taking a portrait mode photo
of anything whereas the g7 power can
only take a portrait mode photo when it
detects a face in low-light conditions
these cameras are not that great they're
pretty terrible to be honest but if
you're in bright conditions these
cameras can actually grab some pretty
nice-looking photos I will say that the
g7 is a little bit better at image
processing the photos are a little bit
brighter and the colors are also a
little bit more vibrant I also prefer
the warmer look of the g7 whereas the g7
power tends to have more of a bluish
tint to it which I don't think looks
quite as attractive my absolute favorite
thing about the moto g7 and the g7 power
or any Motorola phone really is the
software experience because Motorola is
very good at keeping the software very
close to stock so you essentially have a
stock build of Android 9pi but with
these being Motorola phones you of
course get Motorola's entire suite of
software features all of their gesture
controls like the double chop to turn on
the flashlight the wrist twist to launch
the camera and of course you also have
things like motor display for senior
notifications and there are a few things
that I actually think Motorola handles
better than stock Android Pi Motorola's
gesture navigation controls are much
more intuitive and they feel a little
bit more like the iPhones and you can
actually do a short swipe up to open the
app drawer on the g7 and g7 power
instead of that long swipe up that you
have to do on stock Android Pi so that's
pretty much it for this review of the
Moto G 7 and g7 power overall I think
Motorola continues to strike a really
perfect balance between price
performance features without a whole lot
of sacrifice
and compromise and these phones are
really solid if you just want something
that has a lot of modern features a lot
of modern design elements without
spending a ton of cash but if you need a
lot of extra bells and whistles you need
IP certification you need wireless
charging
you're better off looking at more
expensive alternatives but for how much
these phones cost and everything that
they're capable of these are extremely
solid options and I would have no
problems recommending them to people
that just want a phone that isn't gonna
cost them a ton of money but that's it
