everybody and this is the 1 + 5 T now
the reason why you're seeing an initial
review right now is because we've used
this phone for enough time to bring you
some very positive thoughts on 1 + is
best device yet however we wanted to
spend a little bit more time getting to
know the camera and also putting it up
against some of the other flagships in
the game now you're going to see a
follow-up review sometime after this one
and we're going to give you as much
information as we can in the video
you're watching right now so starting
off with the design the 1 + 5 t
obviously takes a number of cues from
the original 1 + 5 the main change of
course is that entire screen on the
front you don't have any element except
for a display on the front with an 18 by
9 aspect ratio and that means that the
fingerprint reader that used to be below
the screen is now on the back this
fingerprint reader might be in a
location that some people don't find
ideal but it is still one of the fastest
fingerprint readers out there just tap
on the ceramic sensor and you'll be able
to get the phone unlocked in fractions
of a second there is another way of
unlocking the device and it is the face
unlock and it's kind of scary quick just
have your face data be put into the
phone using the outline in the settings
and then when you're looking at the
phone at least the camera should
recognize that your face is in front of
the phone when you hit the power button
it's going to basically unlock straight
into the UI the angle of recognition
also seems to be pretty wide so I could
have the phone wake up away from my face
and then slowly move in you can tell
exactly one it recognizes that my face
is in front of it the security of the
face unlock is a little bit questionable
for some users but at least one plus
does put a disclaimer that face unlock
is not as secure as passwords or the
fingerprint unlock now around the device
you solve all the same bits and pieces
including the alert slider which is one
of the unique features oneplus has over
any other phone in the market today the
AMOLED display is doing a great job so
far and having so much of it on the
front has been an absolute joy it adds
to the eye candy effect because colors
are punched out pretty well so that all
of the oneplus wallpapers that they put
into the 5t are so good that I could
pick any one of them and it would make
the phone look wonderful
text has also been enjoyed to read on
this device not only because of the
trademarked oneplus slate font which we
are fans of but also because oxygen OS
does a good job of tuning the text so it
doesn't bloat out on a full HD
resolution screen of this size if there
is one thing I wish oneplus did with
this AMOLED display it's make the
ambient
bleh be and always on display the way
that oxygen shows its ambient display is
one of the more attractive ones out
there and I wish it was available at all
times
the only other change here is in terms
of the camera not just the fact that
there isn't a telephoto lens on there
anymore but the fact that the camera
bump is coming out a little bit more
this time it's still nestled in the
corner and you might be scared of
scratching it from time to time if you
slide your phone on services but we
don't think it's that big of a deal now
since we're on the topic of the camera
we can talk about that for a bit
there's no telephoto lens on here
anymore like with the 1+5 so you don't
have optical zoom capabilities instead
you have a secondary 20 megapixel RGB
sensor that tries to use groups of four
pixels in order to absorb more light for
low-light shots now we're spending more
time with the camera to see just how it
fares in the overall flagship space and
one of the things that we did already
was put it up against the pixel to now
portrait modes aside what we see here is
that Google's own algorithmic procedures
in post-processing still yield a better
looking shot that's not necessarily the
case with the 1 + 5 t instead it does a
pretty good job of enhancing the photo
but doesn't quite get all the way there
the way the pixel 2 does that said in
regular - even really bright light
situations we had a really good time
with the 1 + 5 t thus far and underneath
the surface you get the same
specifications - with a snapdragon 835
and 6 gigabytes of RAM in the base model
but you can still tear through a
gigabytes of RAM if you pay a little bit
extra money you also get upgraded
storage there at 128 gigabytes as
compared to the 64 gigabytes of storage
in the base model the final bit of
hardware is of course the battery 3300
milliamp hours is what you get here just
like in the original 1 + 5 and having a
larger screen might bring down the
battery life but so far that hasn't been
the case I was able to get 5 hours of
screen on time on average on days when I
was listening to a lot of music through
Bluetooth earbuds getting navigation
done and also using mobile networks but
on a day that I was just using Wi-Fi for
the majority of the time I was able to
get over 6 hours of screen on time which
is really impressive and of course the
high quality accessories that come with
the phone include the - charging cable
and the plug adapter which helped to get
the phone back up to speed in no time so
the rest of the change is what the 1
plus 5 team might seem kind of subtle
but I would argue that they are some of
the most significant changes yet and
is in the software you have the newest
version of oxygen OS here and it's a
version that hasn't made it onto the
original one +5 yet it might get there
eventually but for now this is the best
version of oxygen that we've seen ever
the best way for me to describe this
current version of oxygen OS is through
a phrase I used to use all the time
simplistically elegant there's virtually
no bloatware on here except for an
application that gets you straight to
the oneplus community and then there are
a number of features that show that
oneplus has put a lot of attention to
detail in here one such feature is the
parallel apps feature which is new to
this version of oxygen and to the 1 + 5
t you're able to have two different
versions of most social media
applications including snapchat which is
probably the main one to use here
because many of the social media apps
that you're seeing have multiple account
support there are some returning
favorites here like the Reading Mode
which is a personal favorites it makes
the display go black and white a lot
like an ePaper display on a Kindle so if
you actually use the Amazon Kindle app
it's going to be one of the best ways of
using it aside from actually owning a
Kindle it also works for scrolling
applications and websites it's just a
lot easier in the eyes and makes this a
better reading experience aside from
that you also have the app folders which
have that nice little header with the
red line underneath that you can also
change in the settings because you can
customize what the accent colors are and
it comes all the way down to even one
plus his own trademarked slate font it
doesn't look that much better than
Roboto but what I did notice is that it
utilizes the space even better and also
fun fact not only does it look good it
makes Android auto look good as well
because it actually shows when I plug it
into my GTI whereas oneplus devices in
the past might have been reliable speedy
and had great performance due to
high-end specifications the software
just lacked that little bit of polish
that just took away from the overall
experience
just that nagging little bit this time
around though the oxygen OS on the 1 + 5
T is just one of the best-looking ones
and it does have that level of polish
and it just makes this software a joy to
use and so there you have it's the one
plus 5t in our initial review here now
we tried to give you a lot of
information as to the experience of
using the 1 plus 5t and if you can't
tell by now we have very positive
feelings about it the battery life is
really great and the AMOLED displayed
despite being full HD resolution does a
great job of providing a high-end
experience nonetheless
even though this is just our initial
review we would still wholeheartedly
recommend the 1 plus 5t already the
camera is already performing pretty well
and the main thing we want to highlight
is that it's 499 dollars for what feels
like a phone that should cost even more
than that now that's not necessarily
something that we've been able to say
about oneplus for a while it doesn't
really hit the 349 price point of the
high-end oneplus one from back in the
day but then again very few phones do
that these days anyway this is the
closest that we're going to get to an
affordable flagship that does a great
job of keeping up with the pack at the
very least it's a healthy and very
welcome addition to the oneplus family
and the 5 T might actually make one plus
five owners rethink their purchase you
might be a little bit miffed that you
didn't wait out for this one but at
least it's here now and you might
strongly consider upgrading as always
thank you guys very much for watching
and we hope you enjoyed this initial
review of the one plus 5t now we're
going to be spending a little more time
with the camera and you'll be seeing
other videos and other pieces of content
on android authority comm regarding the
camera especially in comparison to
phones like the pixel and the note 8 so
you can stay tuned to andrew authority
for that and even more because we are
