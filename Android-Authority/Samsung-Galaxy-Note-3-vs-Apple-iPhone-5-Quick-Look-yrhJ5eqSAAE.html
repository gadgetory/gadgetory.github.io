between two flagship devices it's Josh
magar from Andhra Authority what's going
on everybody and here we have the
Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and the iPhone 5
and a quick look it should be almost
painfully obvious the differences
between these devices while the iPhone 5
is Apple's current flagship that is soon
to be updated the galaxy note 3 is the
behemoth that has just been announced
it's a 4-inch 11 36 by 640 resolution
IPS screen up against a 5.7 inch 1080p
Super AMOLED monster with matching
smaller or bigger bodies to match for
display experience you should pretty
much know off the bat if you want that
larger screen for a much better media
display or if the smaller iPhone screen
is good enough for your needs in the
case of the iPhone 5 it's a smaller
stature that makes it incredibly easy to
handle well the note 3 pretty much
always requires 2 hands especially when
considering the S Pen the metal body of
Apple's phone has always been
well-received but Samsung is finally
moving from its glossy plastic and has
moved to a textured plastic that
honestly feels and looks much better it
seriously comes down to your comfort
level but with the note being pretty
consistently popular maybe size doesn't
matter quite as much as it used to under
the hood we have completely different
packages powering different ecosystems
while the dual-core 1.3 gigahertz Apple
a6 does pale in comparison to the 2.3
gigahertz Snapdragon 800 in the galaxy
note 3 they are also catered towards
different demands the iOS ecosystem
doesn't too often require the crazy
aspects and in the case of the note 3
its multitasking abilities are so much
more robust that a more powerful package
is pretty much required like a boost up
to 3 gigabytes of RAM the cameras are
another story of size as the 8 megapixel
optics in the iPhone performed very well
with good consistent pictures but is
very limited in its app you don't have
nearly as many options as the note 3
camera which has everything from drama
modes to even a golf mode quality is a
subjective matter but this Note 3 camera
which is basically the well-received s4
camera has been able to keep up with the
iPhones optics quite well and finally
we'll look at the software a little in
which the note 3 has again a ton of
options compared to the iPhone 5 as iOS
focuses on icons and folders in lieu of
widgets on the home screens it also
doesn't have the
multitasking power of the note three
especially with the s-pen you can do so
much on the note three that have to do
with note-taking or multiple abusing or
even having small app overlays over your
screen there is no doubt that the note 3
offers a ton but for some it might be
too much and perhaps the simpler but
still powerful operation of iOS is just
enough for the many people who still use
the iPhone and so there you have it a
very quick look at a couple flagship
phones perhaps more as an exercise and
realizing that Apple needs a pretty
substantial upgrade to its smartphone
which is soon to happen for now these
are the flagships we have to compare and
we'll see what Apple has in store for
its next iPhone iteration to keep up
with what Samsung and Android have to
offer we have more on the Galaxy Note 3
