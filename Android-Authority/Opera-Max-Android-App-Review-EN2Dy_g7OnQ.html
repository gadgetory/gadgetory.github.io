handy the Android authority app guide
opera max has been in beta for a long
time and it's now getting a stable
release which means we're going to take
a look at it ok so what does opera max
actually do it is a standalone
application that routes your internet
traffic through its servers and
compresses the data before it gets sent
to your phone this sounds complicated
but it really isn't when browsing the
web you are essentially just downloading
a bunch of stuff videos images
advertisements webpages etc and all are
downloaded to your device using your
data connection and then displayed to
you what opera max does is takes all of
that stuff and makes it smaller before
sending it to your device that means you
use less of your data to essentially get
the same content this may not sound like
a big deal but when you're on a 1
gigabyte per month data plan anything
that helps you stretch that data further
it's something that could be useful and
in this case it's opera max along with
the data compression service opera max
lets you see what apps are using data
and when there are time stamps to show
when apps use data so you know something
is borrowing your data connection when
you're not using it there's also a
function to block apps from using data
so that ones that update frequently and
we're looking at you Facebook can be
kept under control and that's really it
folks you install it open it and enable
it and it pretty much takes care of
everything else on its own it should be
noted that it cannot save your data on
encrypted apps because encrypted data is
not rotted through opera servers that
stuff gets sent straight to your device
so how can you use this application it's
very simple really this is a classic
fire-and-forget application so there's
not really much for you to do you enable
opera max and it essentially just works
in the background to save you data you
can then use the app to block access
from applications that you don't want
using your data all the time and overall
it gives you more control over your own
data usage as we noted earlier it does
not work on encrypted applications so in
order to get the full benefit of opera
max you may have to relegate a lot of
your activity to your browser this means
using the browser for things like
YouTube Facebook vine Instagram and
others that the app itself may not fully
support that way the data can be
compressed and you can start using less
data on more stuff ok so here's what we
liked about opera max it is a really
good idea for an application we live in
a world where many carriers still
restrict how much data you can use and
sometimes a couple of gigabytes per
month simply won't
cut its and for many opera max can help
we found that we really like the block
apps feature even if they can't save you
data on encrypted apps it can still
prevent them from accessing the internet
without your permission and this alone
can save you hundreds of megabytes per
month especially from social media apps
that like to update constantly for the
most part it's fairly easy to use you
open the application you enable it and
then you go about your business as usual
there are no over complicated setup
processes lastly we like the level of
information that it gives you you can
see exactly which apps use what data and
when this can be a real eye-opener for
people because a lot of applications use
more data than they would initially
think or use a lot of data in the
background without their knowledge even
if you don't engage in opera Max's data
saving services it's still pretty nifty
to see what is using your connection and
here's what we didn't like so much it
doesn't support ipv6 and that is a real
bummer when it detects that you have it
it suggests that you simply change your
APN settings for some this won't be a
big deal but for many this is a
complicated task you can still use the
other features of the application like
block apps but you won't be able to get
any data savings until they either
support ipv6 or you decide to go through
the learning process on how to change
your APN there isn't a readily available
list of popular applications that are
encrypted and even the screenshots are a
little ambiguous so figuring out when
and how to save data can be a little bit
of a pain in that same vein most savings
take place on the mobile web browser and
not so much in the applications so many
may be turned off by the prospect of
using their mobile web browser instead
of applications for doing things since
the app is essentially a VPN service you
may experience slower web browsing
depending on things like your distance
from the nearest server also because it
does compress data you may also notice
some lower quality images and video
overall opera max is a solid application
it has its problems but none of them are
really bad enough to decrease the
overall value if used properly this app
can save you quite a bit of data if
you're on a limited data plan and are on
a carrier that uses overage charges this
app may very well save you some money
and that's never a bad thing
even without the data saving mechanism
the app is still pretty useful being
able to block applications from using
your data alone makes it worth checking
out because we all use applications that
use our data religiously for updates
best of all it's free to use so there's
really no reason not to check it out
