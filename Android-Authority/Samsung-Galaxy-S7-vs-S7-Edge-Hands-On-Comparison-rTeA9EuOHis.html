Authority and we're taking a look at the
galaxy s7 and the Galaxy s7 edge just to
show you guys what the difference
between these two phones are because
there are quite a few differences
especially this year compared to last
year's model so the first thing that
you're going to notice right off the bat
with these two phones is the difference
in size and most of that has to do with
the display so the s7 has a 5.1 inch
display whereas the s7 Edge has a 5.5
inch display and you'll notice that the
edge is also slightly more rounded and
it also feels thinner in the hand
because of this more rounded design
because you have that curved glass on
the on the back curved glass on the
front and the frame itself is also it's
also a lot more rounded off as well in
comparison to the regular s7 which has
much flatter sides and because of this
the s7 edge actually feels like the
binner phone in the hand but the s7 is a
easier phone to use in one hand because
it is a smaller phone now besides the
difference in display size you're also
getting that curved edge glass on the s7
edge and because of this curved edge you
also have the edge screen features that
you don't get on the regular s7 so you
get things like the people edge the TASC
edge the apse edge and the edge panel
and Samsung has really worked a lot on
these edge features to really give you a
lot more functionality on this current
version of the galaxy s7 the final
difference between these two devices is
the battery capacity so with the s7
you're getting a 3000 milliamp hour
battery whereas with the s7 edge you
have a 3600 milliamp hour battery so in
theory the s7 edge should have slightly
better battery life than the regular s7
but obviously we'll have to wait and see
when we get these devices in-house and
put them through their paces to really
see what the battery life is like but
that's really going to do it for this
quick comparison of the galaxy s7 and
galaxy s7 edge hopefully you guys
enjoyed this video and found it somewhat
helpful in terms of showing you guys the
differences between these two phones and
stay tuned for the rest of our Mobile
World Congress 2016 coverage because we
we have a lot more to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
