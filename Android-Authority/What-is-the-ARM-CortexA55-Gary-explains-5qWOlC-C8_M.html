is my third video that I'm doing this
week and today's videos at the cortex a
55 previously spoken by dynamic the new
processes designed from arm I spoke
about the cortex a 75 the
high-performance core from arm and now
we've come to the energy efficiency core
so what is the court it's a 55 and what
will it mean to us well let me explain
now the cortex a53 has been an
absolutely amazing processor it was a
64-bit processor it had high energy
efficiency and arm say there have been
over one point seven billion cortex a53
caused shipped in the last few years so
that's absolutely amazing and we own all
of our phones whether it's from Huawei
or whether it's from Samsung whether
it's one that's using a Qualcomm chip
set there are going to be some courted
8:53 calls in their handling that power
efficiency stuff now with the advent of
dynamic and these new movement from
putting the cause both the power
efficiency calls and the high power
cords into the same cluster arm have
released a new energy efficiency
processor to replace the cortex a53 so
the court is a 55 start where the a 53
left off and what they've done is
they've tweaked it to make it more power
efficient and yet to offer greater
performance so overall we're going to
see round about a 20 percent increase in
performance compared to the a 53 and in
fact in some circumstance in particular
its memory intensive throughput we might
even see double the performance compared
to the cortex a53 and you take a
something like deep bench for then over
there you going to get about 18 to 20
percent performance in the overall
running or the other long video
benchmarks I like a great performance
step for this power efficient core who
isn't aimed at perform with is aimed at
power efficiency and even though it
increased that performance we actually
find a 15 percent better of energy usage
so more performance low lower energy
balls what more
could we ask for now like the a fifty
three before it this is an inorder
processor that means it doesn't execute
anything instructions out of order the
order they come in the pipeline is the
order that it executes and doesn't need
to try and check to see whether it can
run one while it's running another to
try and it just is right whatever is
coming on the pipeline that's the order
I'm going to execute in which makes it
simpler and of course more
power-efficient but of course you do
sacrifice a bit of a performance but
that's what we call it a 75 core is for
of course and just let the cortex a 75
the a 55 is really kind of concentrating
on sustained performance it's all very
well saying about 20% performance
increases out only lasts three minutes
and then dives down because the chip
gets too hot know that the a 55 is also
able to maintain that level of sustained
performance now the court is a 55 is not
going to get the center of attention as
the a 75 does because the a 75 is where
all the benchmark scores are going to be
tested again can be compared different
manufacture of each other but the
reality is we all use the cortex a53
every single day in our smartphones and
it really has become the bedrock of our
mobile computing and it is important
that we understand that the 855 is
continuing with that tradition of power
efficiency and yet good performance in a
64-bit ARM processor now here's a look
at some of the micro architectural
details of the cortex 855 these of
course based on the cortex a53 but now
of course we've got the new level 2
cache integrated because we're moving
over to the dynamic core there's a much
better branch predictor which is
important for making sure that the pipe
stays full of all of the instructions
need to run it's using an inorder eight
stage pipeline and of course it has the
latest ARM architecture revision which
is armed v 8.2 it's worth mentioning
that v 8.2 is the standard for the
dynamic clusters so the arm core is a 75
in the quarters a 55 are all 8.2 and
they have to be the same so that when
programs switch from one to the other
the same instructions work in exactly
the same way which also means of course
you can't use the a 75 with a
is a 53 and you can't use a court it's a
73 with the cortex a 55 there has to be
the 75 and the 55 and whatever future
generations are bring out using the vr
8.2 architecture now it's really
interesting because the a 55 is using a
neural network for doing its branch
predictors now our work quite clear they
weren't going to release many details
about this but the basic thing the idea
is a neural network for a branch
predictor is actually a very good and
actually quite well known in CPU design
field idea for making branch predictors
it doesn't use up much silicon it gives
good results it's not as good as maybe a
complex branch predictor which is what
you find in the a 75 doesn't use a
neural network product predictor but you
do find it in the a 55 so when you're
using your new phones next year in 2018
just give it a thought with the a 55
cores got a newer network built into it
and so then we have it the new power
efficiency core from arm partners the
cortex a 75 we're going to see in fold
in 2018 we might see phones is four or
even six or even seven eight of these
cortex a 55 calls and just like the
corners in 53 before it's going to
become the foundation of our low energy
computing over the next few years
my name is guys didn't reminder
authority I hope you enjoyed this video
if you did please do give it a thumbs up
this is the third video of me this week
about the announcements to arm have made
the next video will be on the Mali g72
GPU so make sure you subscribe to Andrew

we publish a new video and last but not
least do go over to Andrew folding calm
