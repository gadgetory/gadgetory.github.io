android authority until we've got an HTC
Rhyme review all right let's get right
into the phone now as you said the box
was the box with purple matching the
phone and matching the characteristics
of the phone so as you can see it's
really kind of a more female friendly
phone I'd say because the purple tech
they had a purple design and the easy
handheld features it's got a nice grip
on the back which shouldn't slip out of
here it's too easily let's get into some
of the specifications now 3.7 inch
touchscreen it's got a 4 gigabyte
internal storage and it's up to 32
gigabytes for micro SD card it comes
with the naked gabite micro secret
camera is 5 megapixels unfortunately I
wish you was 8 megapixel since a lot of
the HTC phones out there and now 8
megapixels and up it has a front facing
camera which is vga also not so
impressive but it's a front facing
camera and we're just getting into that
so I'm not going to pound on that too
much that's like at 720p video recording
which is standard I guess with a lot of
phones now so you've got a lot of
features with this phone there's a lot
of capabilities that it has what comes
with the box is really cool let's start
off with a headset this comes with the
box it has a nice purple design and
rubber so that the wires are not tangled
it also fits in your ear pretty nicely
and its really good styled eight HD
seats part we've gone I think about the
included chime or i should say charm
add-on and this basically goes in your
3.5 millimeter jack and it lights up
whenever you have a text message phone
call voicemail email etc and you've got
of course a charging two-piece charging
usually just for USB to an outlet so you
can use with your computer also very
smart idea that finally has the best
feature of all the dock
let's get a better view of this stuck
here the doc is really nice it features
a three prong charging so it's really
easy to go in and out of the charging
port and a rubber and fabric it seems
pretty well built if I smashers on the
ground it probably would have a few
marks on it but I don't think it
wouldn't kill it too bad I don't want to
smack down the ground and said I want to
review this phone a little bit alright
that's running on android 2.3 point for
hcc always has to have this little touch
to it of course as some apps that we
don't like such as oh I don't know
endomondo well he wasn't required in
this french room really i don't think
anybody cares about Amazon Kindle people
can just download on the market let me
get closer here you can just download on
the market right you've got some really
good utilities now mark it the only app
that that came with that I thought it
was really cool was the scan feature and
that allows you to scan I guess barcodes
and maybe receipts i'm not exactly sure
on that
they made this design really simple for
the user I think this phone is it's
really simple it's a first-hand droid
and it's great for female use the reason
I say that is it's more of a female from
the phone with the purple on it and like
it's a really good start of foam I
believe in Asia this is a silver phone
so it's really not only in America
really simply just going to place your
phone absolutely just before we do this
here see the three prongs it's also
three prongs right here so you know this
is not fake I mean and there you can see
you see a light right there that's
charging it's also got a few multimedia
features here trying to get a good view
of this so you've got your you got your
your play I've got your calendar you've
got this cool feature where you press
this button right here and it dims it
for you it doesn't really show off the
screen as you can see that does dim it
it's really good it's a really good
start a droid I wouldn't say it's the
best because it's only 3g the internal
memories kind of lousy was only 4
gigabytes and I think the 8 gigabyte SD
card think that they give you should be
at least 16 gigs the 5 megapixel camera
could be upgraded to an 8 megapixel
camera and should be 1080p video
recording but I'm not really a big
Smasher on the 1080p recording because
it's really just phoned again to 720p
now so I can understand this apparently
has a 1 gigahertz scorpion processor
with a cual coupe sorry the Qualcomm
smsm 8255 chipset but yeah it's a great
phone for starters and I'd say it's a
really good foam for play the girly side
if you're a guy though you like purple
it's probably good phone for you as well
I wouldn't say it's a really big
powerful droid as we see about powerful
android phone anyway um but you know
it's it's a it's what we have and I
think it's really good from the Neches
you came up with with style it's the
style side of it is great so um that's
it guys
