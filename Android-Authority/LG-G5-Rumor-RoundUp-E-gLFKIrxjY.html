domain.com well to kick off the flagship
season that is fast approaching let's
talk about what we know about the LG g5
now to start off let's talk about the LG
g5 s rumored release date the LG g4
launched earlier in the year than the g3
before it and the g3 launched earlier
than the g2 so we're expecting the trend
to continue with the g5 as LG tries to
keep up with increasingly aggressive
competitors on January seventh business
career reported that LG will unveil the
g5 at the Mobile World Congress 2016 LG
only showed mid-range devices of the
past two editions of the Barcelona
mobile show but it looks like this year
it will use the occasion to get the
spotlight on its flagship so therefore
we can reasonably expect that the LG g5
will be officially announced on februari
21st 222nd now let's talk pricing like
the g4 and g3 the LG g5 will probably be
offered in the 600 650 dollar price
range now there's no solid rumors about
the pricing just yet the LG has been
fairly stable in this department the
switch to a full metal body construction
may increase the manufacturing costs by
a bit but we don't see LG passing the
buck to customers now when it comes to
the display according to VentureBeat a
report penned by heaven blast aka
evleaks the LG g5 will feature a 5.3
inch LCD display slightly smaller than
the 5.5 inch screen of the g4 if that's
the case LG will buck the trend of
displays getting progressively larger
but with a g5 may lack in size it
hopefully will make up and functionality
like the v10 the LG g5 will likely
feature a secondary ticker display
placed above the regular screen this
ticker will have a resolution of 160 x
10 40 pixels and be used for displaying
notifications or shortcuts to favorite
apps in addition the g5 and other LG
devices from 2016 are said to sport this
ticker the LG g5 is expected to be
powered by Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 820
processor the same chip that will power
the galaxy s7 or some variant thereof
the shell maybe five and the gist
introduced lemax Pro based on a smaller
more efficient process and featuring
Qualcomm's customized chiro see
you Coors and a high octane GPU we
expected to be blazing fast the
Snapdragon 820 is expected to be paired
with 3 gigabytes of ram 32 gigabytes of
storage the same configuration that
we've seen on the g4 and it's also
expected to have a micro SD card slot
now when it comes to the cameras LG will
allegedly use a dual camera on the back
of the LG g5 taking inspiration from the
dual front cameras that the v10 has with
dual cameras you can compose very wide
shots and presumably do other cool
software tricks the idea is nothing new
in the phone industry but it hasn't
really caught on until recently like the
screen the g5s battery is also expected
to be smaller than the GeForce 2800
milliamp hours compared to three
thousand million Bowers it's possible
that LG is getting for a very compact
design and the g5 but the loss of
capacity is going to be disappointing to
many that said it's possible that the
difference in actual battery life might
be mitigated by the smaller display on
the more efficient processor now when it
comes to availability you can probably
actually buy the g5 a month after the
announcement sometime near the end of
March if you go by LG's history so what
do you guys think is this phone exciting
for you are you concerned about the
unibody construction you may not be able
to have a removable battery I know lots
