situation rather poorly for company
their size and their prestige you would
think there'd be a lot more serious
about fixing the issue as opposed to
sweeping it under the rug that's a
problem it comes down to Quality
Assurance making sure that these
replacement devices are put there
springe and testing to ensure that they
are good to go but as it turns out it
doesn't seem like that happened
I think Samsung did just about as well
as it could be expected I mean they had
this huge problem they did a recall that
didn't work so they're doing kind of
like a second recall except for you know
they're just getting it off the market
they're telling people to go get you
know their phones refunded they're
telling people to go turn them back in
you know get rid of them they're sending
out those ridiculous boxes with like the
ceramic paper lining so that it the Box
doesn't explode it's particulars but at
the end of the day I mean Samsung is
doing pretty much me what else could
they possibly do there are millions of
phones out there including this note 7
that I have in my hand - don't worry
it's turned off and they have to tell
everyone to turn them off dispose of
them properly and to get them out of
their hands because out of all the
millions of phones any one of them could
be the next problem and that's just a
risk that a company like Samsung is
unable to take they were very quick to
react to this situation when they first
heard that it was happening this was you
know like the first week of September we
were still in Eva covering the event at
the time they issued that recall that
same exact week and they started the
exchange program pretty much immediately
obviously the exchange program didn't
work out phones are still exploding and
that's why the phone is completely
discontinued now so I think this was the
right course of action for it it's
unfortunate that it happened but I think
this is the best way to go about it
because if they were to try to issue
another
recall and another exchange and then
more phones kept blowing up still that
would have been even worse and I think
when it comes to a company you know
screwing up on this kind of scale that's
kind of what you expect them to do like
Samsung is taking the hit to the revenue
but they're going to be okay because
they make more than ten billion dollars
a year and I mean really uh what else
can Jess going to do I think there's
still a very strong fan base with the
note line that's what has made the note
line so successful so I think they can
recover from this I think they can
salvage the note line and continue it if
they choose to continue it I hope that
they do and Samsung basically will just
have to be very forthcoming about what
they do in the production of their phone
in order to make it safe for all their
users so they can skirt this controversy
but also that's kind of good for us
users because then we might get more
transparency in the way that our phones
are actually created and what kind of
parts are actually being used in these
devices I think people still even want
the note 7 it's just right now it sucks
but long-term saying that the note brand
is still recognizable and still
considered one to premiere smart phones
whenever they're announced I think
Samsung would be ok come next year I
think next year is gonna be that really
awkward phase where people are walking
in and like is this the one that
exploded and the CSRs are gonna be like
no he's aren't the wasn't exploded that
was last year's model this is the new
model and I think there's gonna be some
people who are apprehensive about
picking one of these devices up however
I think that if Samsung doesn't screw up
anymore at least not on this kind of
scale I think that by 2018 that
everything's going to be fine everyone
will be looking forward to the note
series again and this is going to be one
of those like you remember back in 2016
holy crap that sucked
well I would be lying if I said that I
didn't you know think that it was going
to affect the way that I'm going to buy
things moving forward um when it comes
to Samsung you know obviously I still
trust the brand two out of the three
phones didn't explode this year so I
guess that's positive but you know next
year when the next note comes out it's
gonna be one of those wait-and-see kind
of things I'm not gonna pre-order the
phone I'm gonna see what the reviews say
I'm gonna see how it stands after a few
weeks and if everything's good then I
mean yeah might actually buy one every
phone has the potential of going bad
even those indestructible phones that
they claim could be a defect it could be
a physical damage issue but every phone
is prone to a problem of course the note
7 is more prevalent now because of the
instances of it Catching Fire but to me
if they're able to address that with the
next version and that next version has
all the features I want and also is a
top performer in every category it's
always going to be in consideration for
me I don't think this is something
that's going to roll over to their next
generation of devices it's it's just one
big anomaly and it's unfortunate that it
happened to such a big company to such a
well-known company so no it doesn't it
doesn't change my mind about Samsung it
doesn't influence what I think about
them at all
I still trust them as a company I still
will buy the products in the future that
said the upcoming year is going to be
important for Samsung like I said in the
last answer because now Samsung will
have to be very candid and have a lot of
transparency in terms of how their
phones are constructed and they have to
make sure that we know that we can still
trust them
number one thing I think they should do
right now is apologize not just through
a press release statement but whenever
they announce their next big phone
whether it be the s8 before that they do
that they get on stage they just want to
dress all the issues surrounding the
note 7 and have a genuine apology about
that this is a very good opportunity for
a lot of other companies with the note 7
gone it's important that you the Android
user sheath your S Pen and turn this
phone off and explore what else is out
there in the world of Android because
this year has been incredible
now what Samsung will have to do in
order to get back their momentum is
still reassured their Samsung faithful
that their phones are still safe to use
and there's a lot of Samsung fans that
will be flocking back to the s8 or the
note 8 whenever those come out next year
so I don't think Samsung is going to
have much of a problem second thing I
think is to refund customers for any of
the you know secondary items they bought
for the note 7 whether it be screen
protectors case because right now if the
note 7 it's not going to be available
anymore that means they're stuck with
those products and maybe for some people
they might be added return policy so at
least give them some sort of
compensation for that just focus on the
future focus on their next generation of
devices and just right this ship
completely and that's all they can do
and they'll be able to do that Samsung
makes a ton of different things they
make washer and dryers they make
refrigerators they make computers so
they're not solely invested purely on
smartphones here yes it's a big loss but
it's a loss that they they as a company
can recover from and they totally will I
mean in terms of recovery there are a
lot of things that Samsung could do but
right now I think they're doing what
needs to be done they need to get the
note 7 out of here so that it doesn't
explode on anybody else and they need to
focus on all of the rest of their
devices moving forward they're getting
the note 7 out of here they're going to
focus on their next devices they're
probably hopefully they give discounts
on their current devices so that you
know the competitors don't run amok over
the next couple of weeks but I think at
the end of the day you know I mean the
best course of action is just to hunker
down and make sure that this doesn't
happen again
but what Samsung can do is just come
back even stronger than before and make
a device that for some of us users will
understand is going to be desperately
spectacular and so there you have it for
this Android Authority reacts to the
note 7 controversy the fact that this
phone has been taken out of production
and no longer should be in your hands if
you are a note 7 owner currently we do
implore you to turn off your devices and
go through the proper channels to get
your refunds and for this phone to go
into the recycling or some sort of
disposal proper disposal through
Samsung's own channels if you happen to
be on a different carrier you can always
exchange this phone for a completely new
one or just go ahead and get a full
refund
stay tuned to Android authority for all
of the best including what might happen
with Samsung over the next year of
course the onus is on them to create a
device and a future that is a lot more
than what this current issue is now he
be tuned to Android 30 for that and even
more and don't forget to subscribe to
the channel if you haven't already for
even more reviews comparisons and pieces
