been saturated with all of the flagship
devices coming from the likes of Samsung
Sony and HTC but one of the best phones
possibly coming out of the Asian market
just made it onto my doorstep hey it's
Josh magar from Android authority Oh
what's going on everybody and it's time
to unbox and give my first impressions
on the Oppo find 7 but first a quick
disclaimer the version that I'm going to
be unboxing and giving my first
impressions on right now is the find 7a
which is the version that comes with
1080p resolution in the screen instead
of the quad HD of the original fine 7
alright and here we are with the box I
actually think it's a very attractive
looking box it's just black all around I
will show you the sticker on the back as
we can see right here it says a 5.5 inch
LCD coming in at 1920 by 1080 resolution
so this is not the quad HD version that
we are working with here but the
contents in the box the extras should be
largely the same so let's go ahead and
take a look at what they are I'm gonna
take the lid off and there is the phone
what we have here is the fine 7 with the
5.5 inch screen and that is pretty much
what we would have expected this comes
in it looks like the gray version we
don't have the other color here so I'll
go ahead and take out the phone put that
aside for now and here are the extras
you can already see here we have the
Luke charger the vio OC a fast charger
that we did extensively cover with in
our first impressions back in Beijing
when the phone was launched and this is
the one that will charge the phone
incredibly quickly we saw it go from
like zero to five percent in just a few
minutes and it was one of the most
exciting parts of this phone hands-down
but aside from that we also get the
micro USB charging cable now this is a
non-proprietary one you can see a little
cable coming out of here yes the cable
from the actual Luke charger itself does
require you to use
it does require you to use it in order
to get the fast-charging done but if you
just want to use a regular USB cable
because maybe you don't have the time to
use this or a place to use this rather
then you'll get more more traditional
charging speeds than you would with this
so you get a micro USB charging cable
here or a connector to the computer but
the VUCA charger comes with its own cord
that snakes around over here after that
we also have these headphones right here
which I'm going to take a look at in a
little bit these look like they are
somewhat higher quality than most of the
standard fare that you get and there's
also a microphone inline on these
headphones and of course you have the
replacement buds after that here are the
manuals if I'm not mistaken oh and the
battery is right underneath as well so
we have the battery I'll go ahead and
put that aside and we'll get ready to
use the phone using that and here are
the manuals you do get an introduction
to the actual Luke charger itself which
is nice you'll you'll be able to get a
little bit of information on there so
you can get started fast charging the
phone and it's something that we will
cover in a future focus video so you'll
see what the evolution of charging looks
like given by Oppo let's go ahead and
just do the honors alright and here it
is the Oppo find 7 it's a very
attractive looking device you'll see
here this is the 5.5 inch screen right
here that allows it to be pretty large
it is going to be outside the comfort of
one hand that there's no doubt about
that but it does bring the aesthetic
that we remember from the Oppo find 5
which was one of the more attractive
phones of last year that had a very good
build that may not be quite the same in
this one because it doesn't have that
steel construction underneath but it
still has a very attractive profile it
still has a pretty sturdy feel to it and
also the fact that the back is removable
does allow its access to the micro SD
card slot the expandable storage and of
course the removable battery
here is the profile of the phone we have
the 5.5 inch screen up front which gives
it the black slate design the nice LED
on the bottom is going to be fun to use
and then here on the sides we have the
we have the very very sleek profile and
it's not that thick of a device at all
it's still pretty thin and if we go to
the other side of the phone real quick
you'll see that the button layout is the
opposite of what we're usually used to
the power button is right here on the
left side making it so that I have to
turn it on using my index or middle
finger and then the volume rockers are
on the right after that we have the
microUSB charging port on the bottom and
then of course the headphone jack right
up top so this is what we're looking at
here I'll go ahead and head on over to
the back now there's this metallic
finish on here but it's still just
plastic it's not it does not metal don't
get it twisted but nonetheless it's a
very simple look on the back just the
Opel logo up top with the camera optics
above it and then finally the speaker
grille on the bottom alright and let's
go ahead and dive into the actual
operating system itself this is of
course the color OS which has been
updated to include quite a few features
and a lot of them were gestures if you
remember correctly a few of them were
really exciting at least to me but we'll
take a look at those in a little bit so
it's a color OS providing a experience
to Android that is actually quite
thoughtful and has a few enhancements
underneath that make it actually pretty
cool even if it's look is somewhat
unorthodox and a little bit odd at times
and of course the home button one of the
nice little additions that is there is
if you want to turn off the screen you
don't necessarily have to reach over to
the power button you could just double
tap on home and there you go you can
also double tap on the screen to turn it
back on so those are just that's just
one of the gestures I can actually show
you another one right now like if I were
to draw a circle while the phone is off
I can go straight to the camera very
easily and so there you have it for this
unboxing and first impressions on the
Opel find 7a again this is not the
premium version that comes with the quad
HD or 2k display instead this is the
1080p display version that pretty much
has all of the same bits and pieces
underneath and the only real change that
we have is a solid finish on the back
rather than the carbon fiber that we
really loved about to find seven so keep
it tuned to Android authority for all of
the best coverage including our future
coverage of the Oppo find 7 a and the
find 7 when it finally makes it here it
is great to see that the flagships
coming from Samsung Sony HTC really
don't stand alone because we have some
great offers coming out of the Asian
market and this is a wonderful example
of one of them so keep it tuned here for
coverage of this phone as well as our
reviews our comparisons and all of our
weekly coverage all of which are created
by the likes of Joe Jason Kevin the tech
ninja drop us some likes on our videos
