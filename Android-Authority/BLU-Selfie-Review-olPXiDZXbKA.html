before the company offers unlocked
off-contract smartphones at very
affordable prices based out of Miami
Blue is a small company with high
aspirations one of their more recent
devices to hit the market is the blue
selfie a device designed specifically to
take good-looking selfies so how does
the blue selfie stack out next to the
budget friendly competition this is
Bailey Stein with Android authority and
this is my full review of the blue
selfie the blue selfie brings around the
most unique smartphone designs to the
table the shape alone is a bold
departure from normal and makes the
phone look like a concept device from
the past that came to light that's
definitely not a bad thing though is the
selfie is both unique and eye-catching
with it subtly curved polycarbonate
plastic back and brushed metal band the
blue selfie not only looks great but
also feels great in the hand the matte
plastic finish is reminiscent of the
material used on the HTC Droid DNA it
resists fingerprints well it can also be
the victim of minor discoloration after
using the device for less than two weeks
I noticed that the chin of the phone
where the plastic wraps around to meet
with the displaced glass had started to
turn a very faint blue this may just be
a problem with the white model but it is
something to consider if you put your
phone in your pocket frequently rubbing
the region with a damp cloth it does
seem to help but does not fully restore
the original color the golden accents
found on the camera ring and metal band
complement the design nicely the tapered
meeting point between the plastic back
metal band and display also looks very
nice and gives the phone a professional
look as competition in the budget
smartphone space continues to heat up
it's really nice to see a company
delivering something truly different and
unique there were many people who
noticed that too as I kept getting asked
which phone I was using when I told
people about the device their reaction
was overall mostly positive with had
said boost choice of shape and
determination to pack to Sony IMX 135
cameras does have a couple of drawbacks
the device is on the slightly thicker
side at nine point six millimeters and
the phone does have a tendency to wobble
a bit it's not a major problem but it
can be enough to make you adjust how you
use your phone at a desk or a table
there's also a considerable amount of
bezel
front which accommodates to the devices
shape that's not really a big deal in
terms of aesthetics but it does make the
device pretty tall although I have no
trouble reaching horizontally across the
screen reaching to the top can be a
challenge at times and that's not
because of a large display either in
fact the blue selfies display is just
4.7 inches compared to the Moto X 2014
which has a 5.2 inch display the blue
selfie is skinnier but noticeably taller
the good news is that the bezel on the
top at least leaves room for the 13
megapixel front facing camera earpiece
sensors and flash I think that the extra
bezel is a compromise that many people
who are interested in this phone will
take so it's not really detrimental to
the design the capacitive keys at the
bottom have plenty of illumination for
indoor and outdoor environments the home
button also doubles as a notification
LED eliminating the need for an extra
light at the top of the phone like many
of blue smartphones the blue selfie has
a dual sim dual standby device popping
out the SIM tray on the top right side
of the phone reveals the dedicated area
for a micro SIM card on the left and a
shared area for either a nail SIM card
or micro SD card on the right
I think blues implementation here is
really cool since it gives you the
choice of using either a micro SD or
nano SIM in the same slot the only thing
to keep in mind is that you'll need to
get an adapter if you want to use a nano
SIM card and a micro SD card and also
that you'll only be able to use a single
SIM card if you want expandable storage
regardless the option to add up to 64
gigabytes with a micro SD card to 16
gigabytes of internal storage is a great
addition on the left side of the phone
you'll find the volume buttons which are
positioned well to not get in the way
while using the phone the power button
is on the top right of the phone and
could be difficult to reach for some
users the phone is really tall too
making dropping the phone while trying
to unlock it a serious concern so why
didn't it blue just put the power button
on the rights of the phone well in
addition to the sim and micro SD card
slot a camera shutter button lives on
the centre right side of the device
what's unfortunate about the camera
button is that it only works when the
phone's display is on in other words you
can just press and hold the button to
launch the camera when the phone is
locked you actually have to press the
power button first and then press and
hold the camera button to launch the
camera app the logic behind this
confuses me since you can also just
swipe left on the lock screen to open
the camera at the same speed as the
physical button because it doesn't speed
up the amount of time it takes to
actually launch the camera app I can't
really see the buttons usefulness you
could argue that it could be used to
take a picture while the camera app is
open but that's also not really a great
option since the button is in the center
and not on the bottom or top of the edge
if I can make a single change to the
hardware I would replace this camera run
with a power button instead to conclude
the headphone jack is on the top left
and the charging port is on the bottom
left luckily these ports are positioned
at an angle so you won't be limited by
the phone's housing in terms of what you
can plug in the 4.7 inch 720p display on
the blue selfie looks pretty good
overall and has decent sunlight
readability the colors are accurate and
the viewing angles are good it's not as
sharp as phones with 1080p displays
obviously but it's still a great looking
panel and this size the upgrade to 1080p
wouldn't be all that apparent since it's
already at 312 PPI and I actually think
that many users will prefer the lower
resolution because of the superior
battery life that offers thankfully the
display is coated in Corning Gorilla
Glass 3 which helps it resist scratches
if you're still worried about scratching
the display blue has you covered with an
included screen protector in the box
when it comes to performance the blue
selfie performs well for the price with
a mediatek mt6752 its general day-to-day
performance is comparable to phones with
the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 scoring a 33
thousand 4 + n - 2 + 449 single core
2494 multi-core and Geekbench
the benchmark scores are reasonably good
for this price the processor is a bit
outdated having been released in late
2013 but it's certainly more than enough
for a budget device
with two gigs of RAM the selfie is fast
enough for much of what the average user
uses their phone for there were times
when the phone would stutter a bit when
scrolling well that's where the
performance issues ended
despite the Mali 450 GPU also starting
to show its age it handled graphic
intensive games like asphalt 8 and
balloons tower defense 5 well it does
help that the GPU only has to push a
720p display but I think that the
average gamer will be satisfied with the
gaming performance on this device the
United States model of the blue selfie
supports gsm quad band in ages PA + 8 15
1919 is that the phone will always work
with HSPA+ or 4G on AT&amp;amp;T network and 2g
+ t-mobile's network since t-mobile has
recently refund the majority of their
HSPA+ network to the 1900 band you may
also receive HSPA+ speeds in certain
areas it's not fully supported though
but should work in many metropolitan
areas the major disappointment for many
people will be the lack of 4G LTE
support so you'll have to decide whether
it's worth the compromise in addition to
GSM carrier support the blue selfie also
supports gps 802 11 and Wi-Fi and
bluetooth 4.0 the speaker is on the
bottom of the back of the phone and it
sounds fairly decent it does seem to be
loud enough but also gets noticed we
distorted at full volume
the cameras on the blue selfie are kind
of a big deal
blue seems to be very resolute on
marketing the 13 megapixel Sony IMX 135
cameras used on both the front and back
of the selfie and while Sony sensors are
usually pretty good the cameras on this
phone are unfortunately disappointing
the camera software is pretty simple to
use with options in the settings to
adjust white balance and image quality
normal and panoramic shooting modes and
a few beauty enhancement techniques for
example you can make your eyes look
bigger slim your face smooth your skin
or whiten your skin it's really just up
to you on how you use these tools the
rear camera is surrounded by dual flash
one on each side of the very large
sensor these are really bright though so
bright that they often make low-light
photos look worse for outdoor daylight
images the blue selfie does take some
decent looking images but if you zoom in
even just a little bit you'll start to
notice out-of-focus objects and
excessive knowings
the rear facing camera does seem to have
problems focusing the slow shutter speed
often leads to poor results due to
shakiness the overall quality is okay
but a lot of the images that I took
despite being large 13 megapixel shots
lacked color had objects out of focus
and had excessive amounts of knowings
the front-facing camera is placed on the
center of the bezel at the top of the
phone and the single flash is below the
screen towards the right the
front-facing flash is what blu calls
glam flash and it's designed to offer
just the right amount of light when you
need it the most
I am very happy with the Flash's
brightness level it's bright enough to
illuminate my face but it's not blinding
when taking a selfie it does sometimes
take up to four seconds to finally
capture an image with the flash on so
you have to be extremely still if you
want to increase the chances of your
selfies being in focus overall I would
say that the front-facing camera takes
just average looking selfies except at a
larger 13 megapixels and while that may
be useful for zooming most selfies just
go through compression anyways when
uploaded to social media services like
Instagram snapchat Facebook or Twitter
the blue selfie includes a built-in 2300
milliamp battery which offers
surprisingly great battery life during
the three days of real-world battery
life
I had no trouble getting the phone to
last throughout a full day of use with
just over three and a half hours of
screen on time each day just to be clear
my day lasts from 7 a.m. in the morning
to 1:00 a.m. the next day the lower
resolution display power-efficient
mediatek chip and lack of LTE he helped
the phone but I also think that Blu
deserves some credit for software
optimization I have tested phones with
the same resolution and processor both
larger batteries and I've had trouble
getting other devices to last past 9
p.m. with more than 3 hours of screen on
time if there's one area where this
phone really shines it's got to be the
battery life Blu has shipped the selfie
with Android 4.4.2 kitkat there is
unfortunately no official plans to
update the device to Android 5.0
lollipop which is very sad as the phone
was just released
however blue is still supporting the
device with bug fixes and general
improvement over the are updates the
actual software experience is very close
to stock without any additional skins
third-party keyboards or strange lock
screens the only notable change blue has
made the software is the inclusion of
their my home launcher this launcher
does not include an app drawer which is
pretty weird coming from devices that do
the stack system app icons are also all
replaced with custom icons and
third-party app icons have circles
editor on the edges but luckily that's
only in the system launcher you can
restore the more familiar stack
experience by downloading a launcher
like the Google now launcher once
downloaded the phone looks exactly like
how stock Android would with a default
app icons and familiar launcher
experience the blue selfie is available
in white black and blue with 16
gigabytes of internal storage for 249
dollars in the United States the global
model should be the exact same except
with the 850 2100 bands instead of the
850 1900 bands although the blue selfie
has a unique design great display an
excellent battery life it's difficult to
recommend for a device marketed to take
great-looking images the blue selfie is
pretty disappointed there's also no word
on a lollipop update which makes me
wonder if the device will be stuck on
KitKat forever don't get me wrong the
blue
selphie is a great phone for the price
but there are just better options
available phones like the Asus zenfone 2
or Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 offer better
user experiences for the same price or
lower prices even I do really like how
the selfie is unique and different but
it falls behind the competition when it
comes to overall experience thank you
