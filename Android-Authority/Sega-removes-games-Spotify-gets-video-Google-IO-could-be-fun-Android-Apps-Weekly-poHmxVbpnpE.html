brought to you by transformers battle
tactics hello again ladies and gentlemen
I'm Joe Hindy the android authority app
guy and welcome back to android apps
weekly we've got some headlines let's
talk about it last week we talked about
Sega's plans to remove games that didn't
fit their standard this week three
applications got the chop including
afterburner climax jet set radio and
super monkey ball 2 on top of that 16
games removed from the Apple App Store
so we expect the removals to continue a
new humble bundle is out now and this
time it's all about developer artifex
moon d you can pay whatever you want and
get three games pay the average and get
four additional games or pay a flat nine
dollars and get all nine games those
games would cost you $41 if you bought
them individually and it's also a great
way to give to charity there is now
evidence to support that Google will
begin it's designed for families program
at Google i/o this year after developers
received an email asking them to opt
into the program by May 28th for those
who don't know designed for families is
essentially a family friendly version of
Google Play that will feature apps and
games for all ages according to a report
from Bloomberg Google may also be
launching a new photo sharing service at
Google i/o this year it would be totally
separate from Google+ photos and it
would let you share to other social
media like Twitter and Facebook will
tell you more about that when we find
out more ourselves in our last bit of
news this week Spotify has announced a
slew of new features among them is a new
now start page Spotify running which is
music specifically picked for exercising
video clips news clips original content
and a whole lot more if this hasn't
rolled out yet it will be very soon
before even more Android apps and games
news updates headlines and new releases
don't forget to check out this week's
newsletter which is linked in the video
description below there we round up
everything that happened this last week
and it's the best way to stay up-to-date
in the world of applications if you're
so inclined you can also sign up using
your email address and we'll beam that
information straight to your inbox every
single Friday okay folks let's talk
about the Android apps and games that
made a big splash this week quick
release day sort of update this last
week that includes some security fixes
on-demand video and the usual array of
bug fixes and
formance improvements the interesting
part is that instead of just releasing
an update twitch has actually released a
whole new application that starts at
version four point oh this is due to the
security fixes that could not be
implemented properly if it had just been
updated so in order to get it you'll
have to delete your current installation
and download the new one which is linked
in the video description below higher
blood memory is the first action RPG out
of developers 10 birds and this one is
rather interesting it adheres to an
old-school feel which means it's tough
as nails you will die a lot and that is
perfectly okay with us the game also
features the ability to summon
companions and a combat system that
requires actual thinking strategy and
your environment is definitely no Dark
Souls but it's still pretty fun layout
from instagram has actually been around
for a long time as an iOS exclusive but
no longer because it's officially been
released for android this application
allows you to create collages from your
photos and then post them to various
social media sites some other features
include the ability to find pictures
with faces in them integrated Instagram
filters and a whole lot more the best
part is you don't actually need to use
Instagram to use this application in
fact you don't need an Instagram account
at all it's worth a shot if you like
collages sunburn is a new game out of
noodle cake studios the developers
responsible for mikey shorts punch quest
and many others in this retro style game
you play as a ship captain that has lost
your ship and your crew you must
navigate the harshness of space using
your jetpack to find your crew without
being hit by a comet you must also do so
before you run out of oxygen it's two
dollars and ninety-nine cents with no
in-app purchases and it's a pretty
decent little retro game Mix Radio has
finally made its way to the Google Play
Store the uk-based streaming service is
a competitor to Pandora and attempts to
create playlist of music based on your
tastes the idea is that the more you
listen the better it gets at predicting
what you like but you can also listen to
curated playlists as well if that's your
thing it also supports offline mode has
over 35 million tracks and a fairly
modern design as always thanks for
watching this week's show everybody but
let's get down to some serious business
transformers battle tactics is an online
game where you assemble a team of
transformers and duel it out online
versus other players in real time the
premise is fairly simple you build a
team that can have Autobots Decepticons
or both and then you take that team
online to face other people in battles
your transformers have their own stats
and you have extra bonus powers to help
you along the way there are a whole
bunch of ways to build your team and use
your powers to your advantage DNA also
throws events fairly frequently we're
almost every player gets a little bit
something for participating it's a good
time and free to download so it won't
hurt to give it a shot once again I'm
