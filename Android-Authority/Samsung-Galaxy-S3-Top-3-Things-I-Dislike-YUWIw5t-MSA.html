clayton over to android authority com
today I'm coming at you with a small
video explaining a few of the things I
dislike about the samsung galaxy s3 now
spend a lengthy amount of time with this
device and I really love a lot of the
features it has to offer it's a great
phone it's solid it's fast and it meets
every single need that I ever have but
there are a few things that I've come
across that I dislike about the phone so
I'm here to tell you exactly what they
are so I first complaint about the
samsung galaxy s3 is its lack of a
master brightness control not only does
it not have master brightness control it
doesn't even have an easily accessible
brightness toggle in the status bar it
does have Wi-Fi GPS mute screen rotation
power saving notification mobile data
Bluetooth driving mode and sink but no
brightness toggle now I what you're
going to have to do to change the
brightness is go into the settings go to
the display options go to the brightness
options and here you can actually set
your brightness you can turn it all the
way up and all the way down of course
you can set automatic brightness but
let's say we want to leave it there
we've got to write this all the way down
we go into an application we actually
have a different brightness than we do
for the entire system you see here when
we access the settings we actually have
to go into brightness and colors to
choose the level of brightness /
application so let's say we turn it up
all the way for the web page and we'll
go home and our brightness is still down
now that may be useful for some but
let's say you wanted the brightest all
the way down your land in bed it's a low
light condition so you don't want to
hurt your eyes you've set your master
brightness here from the home screen or
the settings menu and then you want of
you a web page boom right in your face
is this bright web page you got to go
here you got to turn it down you're
basically going to have to change your
brightness on a per app setting and that
can kind of get annoying unless you have
automatic brightness selected for every
single setting but I personally dislike
that feature a lot so another thing I
dislike about the samsung galaxy s3
somewhat is its placement of the
capacitive buttons here for example
let's say we're browsing a web page
we're just
hanging out right here we want to click
the bars and we're going to use it in
landscape mode our hand will come over
and if we're not careful we can actually
press the capacitive buttons now if
we're handing over handling the phone
like this you're pawan may come over and
press the one of the capacitive buttons
you might press the bottom one the menu
you might press the back button and if
you're careful you can make sure that
this doesn't happen but a lot of times
I've been careless and I'm just hold it
like that my hand might overlap and I
might just hit the button just like that
if you don't have a case that has a
protective bordering you might find
yourself hitting the capacitive buttons
too much i know i have on a daily basis
so i just throw a case on my galaxy s3
to eliminate the problem now anyways my
last complaint with the galaxy s3 is its
difficulty in making folders you see my
home screen here is filled up with apps
but let's say I'd like to make a folder
I can grab my gallery unless I want to
group that right where the camera is so
I've easy access to my camera and my
gallery you can't just hover over and
create a folder like you can in the
native ice cream sandwich in fact
there's not even any options anywhere to
bring it down and make a folder and you
can only just replace the dock bar icons
with the icon that you've selected let's
say we wanted to attempt the same thing
by grabbing a nap out of the tray will
go here and we'll grab the gallery we
still cannot hover over another icon to
create a folder we actually have to go
down to create the folder and when we do
that it still doesn't go to the same a
home screen that we wanted it to in fact
there was no room so it just didn't even
make it at all which is quite an
inconvenience in order to make a folder
you have to have enough space on the
home screen here you can't grab this and
bring it down you have to go to the apps
grab it move to create folder then it'll
create a folder grab the app you wanted
to originally put in the folder and put
it in then when you open the folder it
dims everything else it makes it seem
like your folder as much out of the way
these problems can all be fixed um you
have different launchers that you can
install to eliminate the problem with
the folders you can pop a case on there
so your hands are hitting
capacitive buttons and you could install
a custom rom that has a brightness
slider up here in the toggle bar to
eliminate the problem with the
brightness now all around i love the
galaxy s3 but those are just a few of
the complaints I've found with that you
guys anyways guys keep checking into
android authority calm for hot content
