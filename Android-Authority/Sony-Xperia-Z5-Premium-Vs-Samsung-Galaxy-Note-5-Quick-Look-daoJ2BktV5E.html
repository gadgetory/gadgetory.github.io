Authority and this is the Battle of the
fives this is your quick comparison of
the Sony Xperia z5 premium versus the
Samsung Galaxy Note 5 so the easiest
place to start with these two devices is
in the design so the Xperia z5 premium
looks and feels just like a lot of other
Sony devices it's a clean rectangular
slab with a metal frame and glass on the
front and back and if you're used to
selling devices then you'll love the
design of the z5 premium and you'll
pretty much feel right at home
it does feel pretty great in the hand it
has a very solid feel to it and it's a
very good-looking design even if it is a
little bit simplistic now with the
design of the note 5 this is a very
different direction for Samsung so now
what you have is a glass and metal
design just like the z5 premium but
there's a little bit more curvature to
the note 5 and it's also a little bit
thinner in comparison to the z5 premium
so it is a little bit easier and more
comfortable to hold
but both devices certainly do feel great
but while the note 5 focuses on the
luxurious the z5 premium is definitely
more of the functional device thanks to
its water-resistant capabilities one
similarity that you'll find on both of
these devices is the built-in
fingerprint sensor and on the note 5 you
have it embedded in the home button up
front which is pretty typical placement
for a Samsung but on the z5 premium it's
actually embedded in the power button
that's on the side and it actually makes
a lot of sense and it sort of makes you
wonder why other companies haven't done
this but basically you just press the
power button and it will automatically
unlock with your fingerprint and it
works extremely well it's very fast and
reliable like many other fingerprint
sensors that I've tested before in the
past and again it just simply makes a
lot of sense and works extremely well
now as far as the screens go the z5
premium is the first smartphone in the
world with a 4k display and this equates
to a whopping PPI of 806 which is just
absolutely ridiculous but the galaxy
note 5 is certainly no slouch it's a
quad HD AMOLED panel which also looks
great it's very bright very vibrant very
saturated but in terms of the
resolution it's pretty clear who the
winner is here but I have to say that
the note 5 screen is definitely brighter
which makes it a lot easier to see
outdoors but both of these screens are
absolutely fantastic for pretty much
anything that you want to do on a
smartphone in terms of everyday
performance none of these devices are a
slouch and while sony has packed the
Xperia z5 premium with a 1.9 gigahertz
Snapdragon 810 processor and three
gigabytes of RAM Samsung has stuck to
their own Exynos 7420 inside the galaxy
note 5 with 4 gigabytes of RAM both
devices are very quick and snappy and
responsive so whichever one you decide
to go with you shouldn't really have any
problems at all like many other
flagships both devices come packed with
a full set of components to keep the
experience pristine the Xperia z5
premium comes with 32 gigabytes of
internal storage and a micro SD card
slot while the galaxy note 5 on the
other hand comes with either 32 or 64
gigs of storage but no microSD card
expansion so sony is the winner here if
you care about external storage both
have all the usual connectivity
standards and come with NFC while the
note 5 is also compatible with Samsung
pay mobile payment and comes with the S
Pen Stylus to take advantage of features
like air command to create memos crop
out images create screen grabs and also
write on PDFs a flagship isn't a
flagship without an impressive camera
and while we haven't tested the Xperia
z5 premium camera it's probably going to
be pretty impressive especially
considering Sony's track record when it
comes to cameras but basically what
you're looking at is a 23 megapixel Sony
Exmor RS sensor with super fast phase
detection autofocus and steady shot
stabilization and a 23 millimeter wide
angle F 2.0 lens with the note 5 you're
looking at a 16 megapixel sensor F 1.9
with optical image stabilization and as
we already covered in the review it is a
fantastic camera with all these
power-hungry specs and advanced
functionality both smartphones need
large enough batteries to get through a
full day and the note 5 comes with a
3000 milliamp hour non removable battery
that is mostly impressive while Sony has
packed a large 34 30 milliamp hour
battery inside the z5 premium Sony
swears that the Xperia z5
Premium will provide two days worth of
battery life on a single charge and
that's a pretty bold claim considering
the 4k screen but if that is actually
true it's going to one-up the note 5
which typically only lasts about a day
in terms of the software both the z5
premium and the note 5 are running on
android 5.1.1 lollipop but the
experiences are very different on the z5
you have a more close to stock
experience with the experience you why
which doesn't really add too much to the
lollipop experience so a lot of the
material design elements that you find
in lollipop are mostly intact but there
are some software features that are
integrated to the Xperia Y that many
people will enjoy like these small
applications for multitasking and the
PlayStation integration the note 5 on
the other hand is running TouchWiz and
TouchWiz has been cleaned up quite a bit
this year by Samsung it's a lot cleaner
and tighter and there's a lot less
bloatware and unnecessary features
there's still a lot of features on the
note 5 though but that's simply just due
to the s-pen and if you're buying the
note 5 you're buying it for that S Pen
and for that large screen experience but
there you have it guys for this quick
comparison of the sony xperia z5 premium
versus the samsung galaxy note 5 which
is probably going to be one of Sony's
biggest competitors when this device
finally launches so let us know down
