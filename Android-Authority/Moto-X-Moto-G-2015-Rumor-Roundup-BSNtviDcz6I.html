to you by domain.com good news for all
of you who are aching for the Moto X or
Moto G 2015 because today is turned out
to be a moto show the Moto X 2015 should
be red around the corner more images and
details have emerged this past week
coming from of all places at peruvian
facebook page titled peru android they
also have peru android com the facebook
page is very active and claims to have
gotten these images from an anonymous
source peru android is clear to say they
can't really confirm the informations
validity one hundred percent but the
evidence does look very enticing for
starters the leak tells us the phone
should come with a 2k display and a
twenty-one megapixel rear facing camera
now this is not necessarily huge news
but it's what the image is showcased
that has us scratching our heads these
photos suggest the phone will come with
an integrated front-facing flash solving
your low-light selfie woes in addition
it has a rumored fingerprint reader that
may have a rather unique placement
instead of putting it on the back as was
previously rumored this source claims
that Motorola opted to build the
fingerprint sensor right into the lower
front speaker now if this is the case
the new Moto X would be the first device
in which any major manufacturer manages
to seamlessly integrate a fingerprint
sensor without wasting too much real
estate others have a dedicated spot for
the reader or have opted into integrated
into the home button but by implementing
this new technique Motorola would have
effectively been able to keep a low
bezel to screen ratio and yet still add
biometric functionality the folks over
at hello moto HK have leaked a new image
also moving from left to right the
source tells us that we're looking at a
mini version of the new droid then the
Moto G third-generation the normal
version of the new droid and finally the
Moto X third-generation it should be
noted that we can't vote for the
validity of this leak though it seems
apparent that Motorola has decided on a
general theme for its upcoming line of
smartphones as for additional specs the
rumors say that the Moto X 2015 should
feature a Snapdragon 808 processor 4
gigabytes of ram and a
5.2 inch qhd screen and a 3280 milliamp
hour battery now what about the Moto G
now has previously reported the Moto G
rumored specs are a 5-inch HD display
likely 720p 4G LTE connectivity android
5.1 point one lollipop a quad-core 1.4
gigahertz snapdragon 410 processor eight
or 16 gigabytes of on-board storage a 13
megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel
front-facing shooter dual sim
capabilities and of course expandable
storage good news the leaked photos
revealed that the Moto G will likely
come with ipx7 ingress rating which
means you should be able to use it in up
to one meter underwater for up to 30
minutes given that the handset is likely
going to cost between 150 and 200
dollars u.s. any form of durability
rating will definitely increase the
appeal of the smartphone the handset is
also likely to be customizable through
the Moto maker service allowing you to
make it truly unique to you now Motorola
has sent us a press invite for july
twenty eighth so by then we should know
