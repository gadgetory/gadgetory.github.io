update by Sony that brings a better
display and a more refined design but on
the other corner we do have the update
by LG that arguably does the same thing
but on a larger scale so which one is
worth the space in your pocket well it's
Joshua Gotham Android authority what's
going on everybody and this is the LG g3
versus the Sony Xperia z2 we actually
look at some very different design
philosophies between these two phones
but they are styles that are
quintessentially LG and quintessentially
Sony the LG g3 looked like it was going
to be made of metal for a while but
instead we have been given a strong
polycarbonate that has been treated to
have a brushed feel the result is a
material all around the phone that
doesn't take two fingerprints to easily
and has a slight curve on the back on
the other hand the very angular design
of the Sony Xperia z2 is flattened on
all sides with subtle rounds in the
corners a more refined design choice
that eliminated the rigidity of the
Xperia z1 while the dual glass panel
construction can get easily smudgy under
constant finger prints it's still a very
attractive build that is pretty much
only found on Sony devices the button
layouts really showed the distinct
styles of both of these companies with
the silver power button the big silver
power button on the one side along with
the volume rockers and the dedicated
power button on the Sony Xperia z2 and
then the signature back button design of
the LG g3 that returns from the g2 now
one thing I will say about the Sony
design is that the dedicated camera
button is just a lot of fun to use but
on the other hand with the g3 the better
construction of the buttons makes for a
very meaty feel and is actually pretty
enjoyable to use on their own also but
when we look at the sides we find the
trope of Sony devices due to their
penchant for water and dust resistance
the flaps covering the various ports and
slots basically demean that one closed
this phone can take a dip in the water
LG's construction does not lend itself
to water and dust resistance but it does
have a removable back and allows access
to the replaceable battery and the
microSD card slot so while LG continues
to really come into its own when it
comes to their aesthetic style Sony
sticks to theirs and it really is the
kind of style you only find on Sony
Xperia devices what we do love about the
LG flagship is that it brings a large
screen to a body that is comparable to
the rest of the flagship devices while
the Xperia z2 is a little bit taller
the g3 manages
to only be a modicum wider ultimately
the handling experience is similar
across the board with the curve of the
g3 helping it feel a little more
comfortable and the flatness of the z2
keeping it easily Gribble
both of these phones are incredibly
attractive sure to turn heads either
because of the distinct lines and edges
of the Xperia or the unique layout and
the curve of the g3 display quality
ultimately comes down to size here as
sony has finally put a I PA screen under
flagship with a couple of their own
signature enhancements the g3 sticks to
LG's IPS construction but blows it up by
half an inch the LG g3 screen is a sight
to behold it manages to be very easy on
the eyes despite there being a couple of
concessions what with the warmer tones
all around and the slight loss in
fidelity at steep viewing angles but
speaking of viewing angles they used to
be very terrible with most Sony
offerings before the z2 which has
improved upon in this iteration not only
are the viewing angles better the colors
are also really nice with the live color
LED enhancing the overall color gamut we
like what sony has done with their
display technology despite all of the
crazy names that are associated with it
like try luminous side by side then we
do see a pretty similar color output
though the contrast on the z2 is just a
little bit more defined look hard enough
and you'll find that the LG g3 is just
crisper providing a little more
sharpness due to its 2560 by 1440
resolution in that 5.5 inch screen that
yields an incredible 534 pixels per inch
but don't get it twisted the 1080p 5.2
inch perform of the z2 is still really
great it's really just a difference that
you notice when comparing the two
side-by-side and really looking for it
but you shouldn't notice too much of a
difference when it comes to the
performance as both of these phones
contain the processing package capable
of some really fast work and play the
Snapdragon 801 clocked in at 2.5
gigahertz backed by the adrenal 330 and
in the case of this 32 gigabyte variant
of the LG g3
3 gigabytes of RAM as opposed to 2 in
the z2 there is no doubt that the
interface is absolutely fly and loading
applications doesn't put either of these
phones really ahead well might be
perceived as lag on the part of the
overly feature saturated GUI of the g3
can put off some people but they come
very rarely and the ability to keep up
the speed despite the larger screen
should actually be commended we should
say that the Xperia z2 s operating
system might prove a little bit more
reliable in the
Department solely because it doesn't
include all of the heavy features that
LG's phone does after all when you keep
it simple you keep it fast but truly if
you aren't just picking nits you really
do have your choice of either these
phones and they will both be blazing
fast as the playing field continues to
get evened out in this year's crop of
flagships so too do we start seeing some
of the much needed features returning
that we used to want last year for
example the micro SD card slots have
made the return and while in the Xperia
z2 it is found under one of the flaps
the LG g3 is removable back cover allows
you access to its it also allows you
access to a removable 3000 milliamp hour
battery something that the Xperia z2 s
larger 3200 milliamp hour battery cannot
boast as far as connectivity goes the
slew of general tools will be available
in either of these flagships however we
do have to give LG a bit of a nod
because it will be available on all
major carriers as compared to the Xperia
z2 which we're expecting to only be
available on t-mobile in the States when
it comes to the sound quality Sony's
consolidation of its eco systems puts
the z2 ahead once again as it brings one
of the most robust sound experiences
available despite the loudness of the LG
g3 the dual front facing speaker
construction just helps the Xperia z2 s
case but with the right pair of
headphones that may or may not be
included with your handsets built-in
noise canceling technology will greatly
enhance your media consumption
experience not to mention the slew of
audio tweaking tools built into the z2
and finally in battery the larger
battery of the Xperia z2 certainly went
the distance blasting past the typical
workday especially when using power
saving features and those long running
standby times the LG g3 is no slouch
though and gets a boost if you remember
to bring a spare battery with you it
also gets a nod for being more or less
on par with phone sporting smaller
displays especially when you have the
power saving features turned on we might
give the edge to the Xperia z2 in terms
of the battery life but we will say that
the LG g3 doesn't fall too far behind it
you could certainly argue that in the
Xperia z2 we have basically the same
camera as last season and that the LG g3
has done more to move forward in this
department but actually we feel that
might be oversimplifying the story after
all the 20 point seven megapixel camera
the z2 was a good performer from last
season and it continues to be in this
phone it is also backed by a slew of
modes that could make your
phone photography more fun picture
quality is quite good too with a high
level of detail possible in both the
high megapixel counts or the default 8
megapixel photos which have a high
sampling rate due to those powerful
optics the only real bummer with the
Xperia z2 camera is that the 20.7
megapixel size is standalone no modes or
enhancements can be put upon it which
are all reserved for the much lower 8
megapixel size on the other hand we have
the LG g3 that has brought some welcome
changes from the original g2 mainly a
laser focusing system and the enhanced
oh is plus the laser focusing system
does make a difference as it is able to
create a really fast shutter to file
speed that makes shooting incredibly fun
os plus does its job well and continues
to do so after being introduced in the
LG G pro 2 pictures from the LG g3 are
taken primarily in Auto mode which does
figure out the shot settings itself you
aren't given much manual control at all
but the auto mode does happen to do a
pretty fine job on its own most of the
time thus the speed of the LG g3 camera
is probably its marquee feature but
don't get it twisted
the Xperia z2 is no slouch either when
comparing the pictures these two
performers are actually on a pretty
level playing field with very similar
color reproduction across the board
though the experience due to yields only
eight megapixel photos by default the
super sampling from the 20.7 total
megapixels does yield it a little bit
more sharpness all around though the g3
doesn't fall far behind at all
so snapping pictures with either of
these phones will be a blast though some
people may prefer the level of control
that the Xperia z2 affords it users as
opposed to the pretty much fully
automatic mode of the g3 that does
manage to hold its own quite well
especially in the speed department and
finally in software it's a matter of
simplicity at various levels and whether
or not you need the slew of tools that
are or maybe Orange included in either
device we'll start with the LG g3 whose
GUI has evolved much since the Optimus
days the look of the new interface does
make for a very good update all around
with a flatter look to complement the
bright colors the operating system is
more about hiding elements than
fundamentally changing them though for
example the qslide applications that I
admittedly have never used are all
hidden under another shade in the
drop-down welcome additions include the
dual window which thankfully makes it
onto the larger screen experience and
the smart applications that allow you to
cater the keyboard to your liking or get
a minimal
out of notifications through a home
screen widget if we never used any of
the after mentioned software features
though we'd still be happy with just the
knock on and knock code which I
personally use all the time on the flip
side we have a much more simplistic
Xperia UI which brings to the Xperia z2
an Android experience that is closer to
stock than most of the competitors
interfaces you get the home screen
layout with a notification drop down
quick settings and the app drawer that
does have one shade on the side for
further control but after that
multitasking is still done via the
recent apps screen though it does come
with the small apps that are similar to
the qslide apps in the g3 mostly in that
I don't ever really use them after that
the various application Sony puts into
its smartphones returned like the great
walkman and the nice album gallery app
but if you aren't either a fiend for
locally stored media or a subscriber to
their unlimited streaming service they
may not get much play on your phone we
do like where LG is going in terms of
the g3 s new operating system with this
new look and some of the enhanced
features but if you do like going for a
more stock like experience you're
probably going to want the Xperia z2
because it feels most like it there are
holes in either one of these phones in
terms of their functionality and
usefulness in the software but the g3
might take that crown because there's
just so much in this phone that you may
or may not end up using the Sony Xperia
z2 is still not fully available in the
states that we do expect it to land on
t-mobile in the near future the LG g3
will be more widely available on
carriers but in the end both of these
phones will come in at the high price
points either for contracts or unlocked
around $700 and so their habits the LG
g3 and the Sony Xperia z2 it's possible
to go on and on about the
high-resolution larger screen of the LG
g3 but luckily there is plenty new to
talk about underneath that surface we
can't necessarily say the same about the
Xperia z2 which is the first of Sony's
incremental half-year releases luckily
still we have a good refinement of what
already made the Xperia line great both
in terms of design and hardware
especially in sound LG has continued to
evolve and in the g3 we get one of the
first 2k screens done pretty well and we
believe we can only improve from here it
tries to offer the most out of any phone
right now and manages to do a pretty
good job of it making it a giant and the
flagship game today but the Xperia z2 is
an experience that is quintessentially
Sony and where Sony has come to its own
already
LG is looking to go if you want the best
that either of these companies can offer
you don't have to look any further than
these two phones right here what is up
to you is if the high-resolution screen
Trump's high resolution camera optics
if a replaceable battery Trump's IP
certification or if Sony's ecosystem is
already robust for you over LG's growing
presence so as always thank you guys
