guys are probably wondering who am I and
where did I come from and what am i
doing on this channel well today I'm
gonna talk a little bit more about me so
you'll get to know all that okay so
before I begin talking about myself I
just want to thank all of you guys are
the majority of you guys in the comments
section and everywhere on Twitter on
Instagram all this positive feedback
from my first video on Android Authority
it just feels so great and I feel so
welcome so thank you and the video
almost got like a hundred thousand views
right now it's just amazing mind-blowing
I can't believe how accepting everybody
is and I love it I'm loving it cuz I
love doing this so thank you so much so
I guess I'll begin talking about how I
got into tech and tech reviews well 2011
my first film was iPhone 4 and at the
time I didn't really care about phones
and I didn't really care what I had I
just I liked that it was cool and yes
whatever but more recently last year
when the iPhone 6 plus was being rumored
to come out I was so interested to that
because it was the first big iPhone with
a 5.5 inch display and and I just I
wanted it so bad so I started looking at
rumor videos on YouTube and you guys
know how these room or videos work kind
of like what Jase does on this channel
or they not only talked about one rumor
they talked about a whole bunch of
rumors and so to get to the iPhone
rumors I would sit through Android
rumors and that's when I kind of started
realizing that Oh Android it's pretty
cool and I just started getting really
interested into it so I kept watching
these rumor videos and then finally the
iPhone six-plus came out and you know
how Apple products are you can't really
get them at when they first come out so
hard to get your hands on one so to like
fill that void in my heart I just typed
an iPhone 6 plus on YouTube and I saw
what came up and it was just a bunch of
reviews and unboxing videos and wash and
gos made me feel better because I just
it made me feel like I actually have one
and
I just loved everything about them the
Simmons cinematography the camera angles
the shots editing everything was just so
beautiful and so I was watching all
these iPhone ones and I figured well
there's got to be reviews about the
Android phones that I heard about before
and then I started watching the Android
reviews and I just I fell in love with
them too and it was all so beautiful to
me I was amazed by it so eventually I
was like you know what forget the iPhone
I don't need the iPhone I could just get
one of these beautiful Android phones
that I've been watching the reviews and
I did I got the lg g2 and I loved it so
much I loved everything about it and
there was no reason to keep watching
reviews right well I could keep watching
movies because I love those so much so
after watching an LG g3 review
I sold my g2 and got the g3 and I loved
that phone so much but I just kept going
back to the reviews and I watched a
review for the Nexus 6 I stole my g3 got
the Nexus 6 and yeah you can kind of see
where this is going it's just like a big
vicious cycle of buying phones getting
phones watching reviews so it just
wasn't stopping and I wanted to keep
going it was ridiculous I had a new
phone every week and then I thought why
don't I justify having a new phone every
week by reviewing them well I have to
have a new phone every week and I did
and now it's like I'm living the dream I
love what I'm doing and I don't feel
silly for having a new phone every week
because it's what I have to do so I've
been doing this for about three or four
months now and three months in Android
Authority contacted me saying that they
love my videos they wanted to
collaborate with me and I'm here now
aside from phones I love all of
Technology and I'm constantly learning
new things every day and I've also
always loved making YouTube videos I
actually started out with a pretty silly
video a couple years ago when I was
younger called the Wiener dance
and I also have been doing bass covers
so if you guys want to see those they're
on my other channel not my tech review
channel my personal channel called
crystal aura and I'm also very into art
I'm actually I've been studying graphic
design for two years and coming this
fall I recently got accepted to SVA
which I'm really excited about and I'm a
huge dog lover I actually have some
friends who want to meet you guys come
on boy hi come on boy he's my baby
charlie he's a little bit crazy he's a
cheeky this is the boy look who's that
what's that over there
I'm sure you seen him before
ah I also have this little guy a my
little baby Jack and this was a little
baby she say I see hi baby
oh I just wanted to say because I got a
lot of comments of people wondering what
the heck I am and I'm Spanish and I've
always find your thumb yang so yeah well
that's it guys I don't know what else to
say so thanks for watching and make sure
