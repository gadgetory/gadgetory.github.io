my name is Jason this is where we try
and answer your most pressing Android
questions just like when Vito love
beetle asks what are the advantages of
having a flexible phone I don't get it
unless I was going to have sex with it
well Vito libido an apt name by the way
yes you're right for the moment is a bit
of a gimmick but why I get excited about
it is because of the possibilities it
brings for the future you see if a
manufacturer can produce a flexible
display or device it opens the
possibilities or begins to open the
possibilities for things like
computerized clothing where your
clothing is able to monitor your vital
signs and if i were to keel over and
have a heart attack for example my
clothes could notify an ambulance and
have it come and retrieve me before even
anyone else knows that is amazing and it
also furthers the development of what's
called the Internet of Things and I've
talked about this before it is crazy
exciting the Internet of Things in short
is the connecting of everything like
your refrigerator not just your phone in
your car the obvious thing but I mean
everything your refrigerator could know
when you're running out of milk and can
automatically order new milk from amazon
that kind of thing but the Internet of
Things is not exclusive to electronic
devices no even animals are included yes
that's right this kind of thing is
actually happening as we speak there are
cows that have a biochip inserted into
their shoulder that are able to send a
message to the farmer when they are in
heat via SMS text message yeah I know
you're thinking how would that actually
work oh wait bow that half over there
want your babies now go get her done I
bait channel
oh poor heifer she'll never text me a
damn all right guys let's start off with
the best 10 inch tablet tushar asks what
is the best 10 inch tablet if I need a
laptop replacement should i get the
current nexus 10 or wait for the new
version well tushar there's no real
indication yet about when the Nexus 10
would be released but even if it was I
might not recommend that I do suggest
you look at two other tablets the
samsung galaxy note 10.1 2014 edition of
course has the s pen has a fantastic
battery and has a little bit better
camera than most other tablets out there
right now but it's also you know
probably the most expensive option so
you may want to consider the Asus
Transformer infinity pad it has the
keyboard dock which is getting fantastic
reviews and it has a great screen it's
really good for gaming you had mentioned
that and it does also quite a bit
cheaper so the latter choice is the
really best bang for your buck let me
know which one you get in the comments
below and enjoy your new tablet now mr.
the Barney asks why do developers still
prioritize for iOS users when there are
so many more Android users well mr.
Lombardi that is a good question and a
common one and it comes down to money
you see Apple was the first company to
put out a app store and teach and
condition users to pay for digital
content to pay for mobile applications
so they have over 200 million users that
have credit cards on their itune
accounts and that is extremely valuable
to Apple iOS users are much more likely
to pay for digital content pay for apps
and they pay more on average than
Android users now Google is relatively
late to the game number one and number
two they have more users because they
have more entry-level mobile devices
cheaper phones basically in developing
countries in places where users are less
likely to use a credit card online now
there is a basic solution to this or a
solution i've heard recommended and that
is that google should be in the business
of selling google play cards and you
know every corner store and every kiosk
around the planet and that would allow
those new
users to you know engage in the digital
comedy digital economy in the Play Store
I think it's a great idea we'll see how
it goes mayor 298 asks hey Jace I can't
decide if I should buy the Galaxy Note 3
or the Sony Xperia that one which one do
you recommend well mayor 298 I would
have to ask you what your priorities are
if you already have a tablet you
probably want something significantly
smaller so you might want to consider
the Xperia which has a better camera and
the screen is fantastic but if you don't
have a tablet go for what I think is the
best phablet on the market today that
Samsung Galaxy Note 3 it has great video
and camera capabilities and of course
has a battery that is 3000 milliwatts
hours that is amazeballs so consider
those things and let me know which one
you get good night all right guys the
last up I want to talk about some
comments that were made in last week's
show regarding the whole 64-bit
processor versus a 32-bit processor I
know some of you were upset about the
analogy I gave saying it was not just
oversimplified it was just flat-out
wrong because I was suggesting that a
64-bit processor would double the speed
0 device using a 32-bit processor ok I
didn't say double the speed I said there
were it was closed and there was other
factors involved but I don't argue about
that you're right I should have
clarified that the primary purpose of a
or primary benefit of a 64-bit
processors the fact that it can employ
more RAM and that's always a good thing
so I understand that and the second
thing I wanted to clarify and what I
didn't know and thank you to mr. I was
going to say mr. signage and kills it's
not signage and mr. cyanide kills he
made a great comment and he did it as an
adult I think I appreciate that that
routing a phone and flashing at custom
rom are two different steps and the fact
that rooting your phone getting super
access to your phone is completely safe
you you run no risk of damaging your
phone but the act of flashing a custom
rom does carry with its risk so some
people were you know arguing about you
know routing is not dangerous and people
say yeah I did and I brick my phone four
times so there is a distinction between
those two things thank you sir for
making that clarification I appreciate
it thanks guys for watching if you found
this helpful kindly given
to like and subscribe and if you have a
question please put them in the comments
below I will be sure to read it and
perhaps you can be in next week's Q&amp;amp;A
yeah why as in heat if she heard that
I'd give you too Josh for a drop test</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
