authority reporting live from CES 2012
what we're looking at here is the Hawaii
ascend p1 it's an incredibly thin device
we're looking at seven point six nine
millimeters one of the thinnest phones
on the market just blows away the
thinness of the galaxy s2 or even the
droid razr we're looking at eight
megapixel autofocus in camera on the
rear with an LED flash inside we have a
1.4 gigahertz dual-core TI OMAP 4460
processor with a sgx540 GPU android 4.2
I scream sandwich 4.1 actually on board
no dedicated camera button incredibly
thin profile tapers off at the bottom a
little bit but you know it's an
industrial plastic design is absolutely
no flex to it whatsoever the screen has
the same resolutions qhd as the droid
razr and it just the colors just really
pop out is we come to expect from a
Malay appears to be an incredibly
responsive device and I think that we're
going to expect some pretty good things
here from why
things are a little crazy right now so
you can expect a full review from
android authority in the coming weeks
here the device currently isn't on the
market at other specs include a 1.3
megapixel front-facing camera 1 gig of
ram four gigs of internal memory
Bluetooth Wi-Fi all that sort of stuff
and a sixteen hundred and seventy mill a
battery so probably some pretty good
battery life and of course expandable
memory to but i'm really impressed got
my galaxy s2 here and i got to say it's
not doing it for me anymore i know
just joking but uh yeah I really really
thin beautiful display and really fast
anyway this is the Hawaii ascend p1
we're going to just review the the p1s
right after this and thanks for checking
in everyone we're android authority here
