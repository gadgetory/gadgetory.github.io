Joanne d the android authority app guy
and welcome back to Android apps weekly
it's our first Wednesday show it's also
episode number 113 so let's get right
into those headlines Telltale Games has
announced that their game of thrones
game will be free to download the
various episodes will still cost you
money but the upfront cost is now zero
so you can try it out without buying
anything they also announced that the
final episode is coming next month after
a successful iOS launch the walking dead
no man's land will be coming to Android
here in the next few days it's slated
for official launch on october 29th and
if it's anything like its iOS
counterpart it'll be free with in-app
purchases Apple music has been spotted
in the wild and we have a potential idea
of what the application may look like
surprisingly it looks like it'll stick
to Android's design guidelines at least
to an extent there's still no timeline
for an official launch right now but do
keep in mind that this may not be what
the final product looks like youtube
bread was officially announced late last
week the subscription services 999 per
month and will include features like an
ad free youtube experience screen off
video playback offline video download
and a complete subscription to google
play music all access frankly that's an
awesome deal and it'll be launched
officially on october 28th hopefully no
one gets it confused with redtube on top
of youtube red google also announced a
new application called YouTube music
this will essentially be like YouTube
kids and YouTube gaming except it will
block out all the content aside from
music related stuff of course there will
be additional features available for the
application if you subscribe to YouTube
bread for even more Android apps and
games news don't forget to check out
this week's newsletter which is linked
in the video description below we have a
lot of information there that we didn't
have time for here and it's the best way
to stay up-to-date on the latest android
apps and games news if you want you can
use the form in the written companion
which is also linked in the video
description below and sign up for the
newsletter which we now send out every
single Wednesday okay folks let's take a
look at the apps and games that made a
big splash this week as usual if you
want to check any of these applications
out you can find those links in the
video description below excerpt for
Twitter is a new application that lets
you quickly and easily create images
using web pages here's how it works you
go to a web page news article or
whatever you want and then you've used
the application to capture a snippet of
the content you want to share then you
can have say a quote from the article
while also having 140 characters to
input your
opinion about it it's totally free with
no in-app purchases and aside from a few
early bugs it seems to work rather well
parchi is a Microsoft application that
came out of their garage project this
one is a lightweight and colorful note
taking application that works pretty
much like any other note taking app the
unique feature of this app is the
ability to add hashtags to your various
notes you can then search the hashtags
to find a notes this is a fun little
idea that many of us can pick up and use
without thinking too much about how to
make it work it's also free with no
in-app purchases the trick shot is a
minimal physics-based puzzle game
developed by Jonathan top who most
notably as a member of the US to team
that brought us Monument Valley in this
simple game you must get the ball into
the box the game uses various tools and
obstacles to both help and heater your
progress but most levels have an air of
elegance about them despite the game
simplicity there are over 90 levels
available and you get an unlimited
number of chances to try again it's a
dollar 99 and there are no in-app
purchases the boomerang from Instagram
is a new application that is as the name
implies from Instagram with this
application you can create fun little
one second videos that run on a loop
here's how it works the app takes 10
photos and then stitches them together
to create a fun little loopable jif type
of animation that you can then share on
Facebook Instagram and other places it's
totally free with no in-app purchases
and of course do be cautious of those
early release bugs the prune is an
interesting atmospheric puzzle game
here's how this game works there is a
tree that continuously grows and there
is also a light source your job is to
prune the tree so that it grows into the
light source and blooms pretty flowers
bloom doesn't bill itself as being an
overly difficult game but it can be
challenging at times the overall
experience is one of relaxation and that
permeates through all parts of the game
including the graphics soundtrack and
even the gameplay controls it's fun and
there are also no in-app purchases with
this one once again I'm Joe Hindy from
android authority calm why you're here

android authority youtube channel if
