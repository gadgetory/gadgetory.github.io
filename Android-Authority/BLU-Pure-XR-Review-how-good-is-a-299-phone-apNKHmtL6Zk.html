with Android authority and this is a
review of the blue pur XR and the
ever-changing landscape of mobile tech
the line between mid range and flagship
phones is blurrier than ever with
emerging companies aiming to produce the
next flagship killer some are getting
closer and closer to hitting the mark
the blue pur XR is a mint too high an
offering from blue products second only
to the pure XL many of these phones are
making their way to the States and offer
more than decent specs how to reduce
cost now that we're getting back to
school the perfect target audience could
be parents looking to get their kids
reliable phones without breaking the
bank this phone comes in at 299 which is
still a decent amount of money to part
with but far less than the frontrunners
in the market now let's talk about what
you get for $2.99
first and foremost you get a 1080p HD
Super AMOLED display with great
brightness and viewing angles also you
get a 16 megapixel camera with laser
autofocus a 2.0 gigahertz octa-core
processor four gigs of RAM USB type-c 64
gig internal storage and also a
fingerprint scanner which is an
impressive lineup of specs for a phone
of this price now of course in addition
to the phone inside the box you get your
quick guide and setup manual also you
get a complimentary screen protector
which of course is good to avoid
scratches also you get a starter case
which is also good to give you some type
of protection so you get a better case
SIM tool to pop your SIM card out and
also a USB the USBC adapter your wall
break of course the USBC cable earbuds
and earbud tips and now let's focus in
on the camera and considering that this
phone is half the price of most flagship
devices out there I honestly believe
that this phone's camera will be subpar
coming in at 16 megapixels under the
right conditions this camera can produce
sharp images with realistic color
accuracy but there are some glaring
issues when trying to adjust the focal
point and notice that the center of the
image will always remain sharp and the
edges would be blurred I also must admit
that I'm not a fan of the HDR mode on
this phone it tends to blow out your
highlights and leave your colors washed
out and please do not use the zoom on
this camera you end up with horrible
photos that lack definition in detail
and just look really bad
over sharpened also to be fair I'm not a
fan of using digital zoom on any phone
camera but the blue XR definitely
struggles in this area the video quality
also leaves a lot to be desired
I noticed that there is noticeable shift
in ISO and exposure when going from dark
to highlighted areas and the image
stabilization isn't very dependable and
at best you can record at 1080p 30
frames per second which is in the end of
the world but worth noting in regards to
low-light camera performance I once
again prefer the HDR mode off although
there are still visible artifacts in
both samples when HDR is off it looks a
bit more natural and realistic in my
opinion it is also important to note the
discoloration and the shadowy areas when
HDR is on now let's take a look under
the hood and discuss how the blue pure
XR performs as mentioned earlier this
one is equipped with an octa-core
MediaTek Helio p10 chip now when you
hear octa-core your ears may perk up but
it can be misleading when running antutu
benchmark and EQ bench results were much
worse than I expected coming in ranked
30th with a score of 50,000 789
surprisingly ranking lower than older
phones like the iPhone 5s and Nexus 6
I'm happy to report that those scores
haven't translated over to the
day-to-day use the overall UI is
responsive and quick to load
applications or animations and when
gaming I did notice the occasional frame
drop or delay in graphic textures
loading but nothing that was unbearable
or a deal-breaker
now let's discuss battery life when
using this phone you can expect three to
three-and-a-half hours of screen on time
which is pretty average the real
highlight here is the standby time of
four days 20 hours and five minutes with
14 percent battery remaining also when
testing this phone I used it on and off
Wi-Fi with screen brightness maxed out
GPS on and Bluetooth on all in all this
phone will last you a solid day with
moderate usage which for me is an
occasional game YouTube videos streaming
music and texting now let's summarize
things and recap with the good and the
bad
first the full metal premium design with
7000 series aluminum in glass front this
phone looks beautiful
second the speakers when watching videos
I was surprised by how loud the phone
can get maintaining clarity without
Distortion
providing a valid sense of immersion
when consuming media third
it has a decent camera for the price
although the camera has it's areas of
opportunity as mentioned earlier under
the right conditions you can produce a
great picture next this phone offers a
smooth UI that straight away from
conventional Android by revealing the
settings toggle when swiping up from the
bottom and set at the top also the
omission of the app drawer took some
getting used to but after a while I
forgot it was missing going from screen
to screen and then out of folders had
smooth transition without lag and the
ability to change themes and adjust
color schemes with chameleon is a nice
touch also this phone has a fast
fingerprint scanner which was very quick
to respond no matter the orientation of
my finger and lastly 3d touch was one
feature that I stumbled upon when using
this phone and was shocked by its
inclusion it's the first Android phone
that I've seen adopt 3d touch using
finger pressure and now for the bad or
benchmarks in comparison to other phones
the blue pure XR was unimpressive but
expected although when using the phone
for general use it feel fine so take
those tests with a grain of salt and of
course the camera as mentioned earlier
you can take a great picture under the
right conditions but it does have poor
HDR digital zoom and low light
performance and lastly poor call quality
when making calls the voices did sound
garbled almost as if the other person
had a cold now for my final verdict
understanding the target audience for
this product it's a solid offering
giving the consumer a big bang for their
buck to be honest my list of cons will
short for a reason it's because this is
a great phone for the price and leaves a
little to be desired most people I know
knew nothing about blue products but
when I let them play with the phone that
surprise and satisfaction with the
design and performance was consistent at
the end of the day and this phone isn't
for everyone
nor is it meant to be and have no
problem recommending it and that
concludes this review thank you guys for
