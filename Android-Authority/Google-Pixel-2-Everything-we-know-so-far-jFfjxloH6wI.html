excited about this year it was initially
rumored that Google would just like last
year take the wraps off to pixel devices
the smaller of the two is codenamed
walleye why the excel variant goes under
the name muskie we then heard reports
that the company was also working on a
third device dubbed Cayman which is
expected to be even larger than the
pixel XL according to the latest rumors
the smaller of the two devices is
expected to sport a four point nine inch
display with Full HD resolution it will
be powered by the latest Snapdragon 835
chipset with four gigabytes of RAM when
it comes to storage a 64 gigabyte
version is mentioned but we'll likely
see a larger option as well that's sub 5
inches sorry
one-handed devices get me excited Wow
what's also interesting though is that
the pixel 2 is said to feature two
front-facing stereo speakers which is
more than welcome addition unfortunately
it will come at the expense of a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack this means
you'll have to plug in your headphones
with the help of an adapter that will
likely come included in the box keep in
mind please that this has not been
confirmed and it's quite possible that
the rumor is false especially when
considering that Google actually took a
shot at Apple for the iPhone sevens lack
of headphone jack in last year's pixel
commercial though we don't expect that
the pixel 2 will have a dual camera
setup on the back we do expect that the
pixel 2 will have a great camera just
like its predecessor
when reviewed the main shooter on the
last pixel receive the highest DX o mark
rating at the time with a score of 89
although it was later bumped down to
second place as the HTC u 11 took the
number one spot with a score of 90 the
pixel XL 2 is rumoured to be water and
dust resistant it's expected to be
either IP 67 or IP 68 rated meaning it
will survive being submerged into 1 to
1.5 meters of water for a period of
about 30 minutes as a refresher the
current pixel generation is only IP 53
rated which
basically means it won't die if you
spray with water here or there but it
definitely isn't suitable for anything
more than that
now the pixel xl2 will be similar to the
smaller brother in a lot of ways it will
be powered by the Snapdragon 835 chipset
have four gigabytes of RAM and support
the same camera but it will be
waterproof but it won't have the two
speakers on the front due to a different
design rumors claim that it will have
128 gigabytes of storage but just like
the pixel 2 we'll probably see at least
one more additional storage option the
biggest difference between the two
devices will obviously be the screen
size the pixel XL 2 is expected to
support a 5.9 nine inch qHD display
pushing the device into phablet category
now let's talk about price last year's
Google pixel series was far from
affordable the pixel launched at 649 and
749 while the XL variant retails for 769
and 869 respectively word on the street
is that the pixel 2 and pixel XL 2 will
carry a premium price tag and will
either cost the same or even more than
their predecessors so what do you guys
think I'm just so elated that there's
going to be a true premium flagship that
is one-handed under 5 inches that's
sweet how many of you actually care
about that let me know in the comments
