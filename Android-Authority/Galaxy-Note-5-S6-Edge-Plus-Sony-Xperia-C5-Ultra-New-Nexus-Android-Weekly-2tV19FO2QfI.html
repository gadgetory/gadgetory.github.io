brought to you by domain.com so we got
not leaks not rumors but teasers right
from the source now you probably know
that the note 5 and the s6 edge+ is
expected to be announced this week but
did you know they've also hinted at a
new tablet now check out this teaser
directly from Samsung from top to bottom
it looks like the galaxy s6 edge+ the
galaxy note 5 and then a mystery device
that looks like an 8-inch tablet Samsung
just launched a new Galaxy Tab s2 series
and while Samsung may feel the need to
show off these new tablets at this
week's event the device in the teaser
appears to be different it features a
metallic frame similar to the galaxy s6
as opposed to the painted frame of the
Tab s 28 point 0 more than that tweaking
the brightness of the image reveals what
appears to be a slight curvature on the
left side of the tablet is it possible
that this teacher shows a curved glass
back of the tablet or are we just
reading too much into it what do you
think heck the edge phone worked well
for samsung why not put it on a tablet
make sense hey Sammy do you remember
this I could never get a samsung I'm
creative did your barista this is when
you were the next best thing and you
were kicking it you were the
best-selling flagship smartphone in the
u.s. because you were the next best
thing you were the anti apple you
weren't trying to copy Apple you weren't
trying to out Apple Apple you were
kicking apples trunk now let's talk air
command it appears like we might be
getting a good look at Samsung's
redesigned air command menu that
includes shortcuts for action memo smart
select screen right s note settings and
even an Instagram shortcut this probably
means samsung may allow users to
customize the last shortcuts lot which
is a feature most users will welcome air
command menu looks much more refined as
well as the background now appears to
blur when Air Command is opened now this
video made me really excited for a Nexus
device the video in question comes from
Steve hema Stauffer the man behind on
leaks who is a pretty decent track
record when it comes to leaking as yet
unannounced smartphones based on the
design of past Hanson
for huawei nexus definitely looks like
it was designed by hallway because it
sports a matte rear cover like the
ascend mate seven and the huawei honor
seven but wait there's more possibly a
second Nexus device the LG Nexus on the
other hand is expected to have lesser
specs than the hallway Nexus but will
have a smaller full HD panel an
octa-core processor with two to three
gigabytes of RAM possibly a 13 megapixel
camera like the one found on the Nexus 6
and the motorola moto g want to get a 1
+ 2 but don't want to deal with the
invite system consider opal mart first
is the pricing opal mark currently only
lists the oneplus 2 black 64 gigabyte
model priced at four hundred and fifty
nine dollars a premium of about seventy
dollars over what you pay if you got the
phone directly from one plus second this
is the chinese version of the phone
which will differ slightly in terms of
software and hardware well the same
overall specs and oxygen OS based
software will apply there will be
regional changes and you'll want to
verify that the phone you have will play
nicely with your particular carrier now
let's talk Sony's new selfie phone sony
is doubling down on a selfie phone
concept with the massive experience c5
ultra featuring 13 megapixel cameras on
the front and back the other highlight
feature of the xperia z5 ultra is the
massive 6 inch full HD IPC LCD display
sony is jumping in on the bezel s
bandwagon and the result is pretty
striking with a six-inch panel though
and sizeable bezels on the top and
bottom the c5 ultra is large for
reference at 164 point 2 millimeters
it's taller than the nexus 6 and even
the iPhone 6 plus with the benefit of a
larger screen of course the device is
eight point two millimeters thick and
weighs 180 7 grams processing duties are
handled by an octo core MediaTek clocked
at 1.7 gigahertz with two gigabytes of
ram 16 gigabytes of storage expandable
via and microsd card slot the battery is
a decent 2930 milliamp hour unit but
truth be told a little extra capacity
would have been nice here given the
oversized profile of the phone still
sony promises up 2 2day battery life
