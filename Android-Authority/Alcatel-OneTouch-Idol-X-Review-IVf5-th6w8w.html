Android Authority and last year Alcatel
released the idol X which offered some
really nice hardware and specs for a
very competitive price and this year
Alcatel is back at it again with a
successor but does it pack enough punch
to really stack up against the
competition let's take a look at the
Alcatel OneTouch Idol x+ so here it is
the Alcatel OneTouch Idol x+ which is
kind of a mouthful but let's kick things
off starting with the design and build
quality and it doesn't necessarily have
the most unique design in the world you
can definitely tell where they got their
inspiration from I won't mention where
but it's not a bad looking phone by any
means the construction is comprised of a
combination of glossy plastic on the
back which is very prone to fingerprints
an aluminum frame that wraps around the
perimeter of the phone that actually
makes the phone feel pretty solid in the
hand but it is a little bit on the
slippery side it's also fairly
lightweight at 130 grams and only seven
point nine millimeters thick on the top
of the phone is the power button with a
3.5 millimeter headset jack a single SIM
card slot on the left which is opened by
applying pressure towards the top of the
door and held shut with a magnet on the
right side is a secondary SIM slot with
your volume rockers and along the bottom
is the microUSB port with a single
speaker and a microphone disguised to
look like a second speaker for being a
single speaker it's actually pretty loud
with great clarity but being mounted on
the bottom means you're gonna get
sideways firing audio when watching
videos or playing games and landscape
making this speaker extremely easy to
cover up muffling the sound flipping
around to the front of the phone you'll
find a 2 megapixel camera next to the
earpiece and typical sensors LED
notification light that's hidden unless
it's lit up and capacitive back home and
menu keys flanking the bottom also on
the front which happens to be my
favorite part of the design is the super
thin bezels which not only allows the
display to be the star of the show but
also keeps the phone a lot smaller and
more compact in comparison to other
smart phones with the same display size
and speaking of the display it's a
5-inch 1080p
pS LCD with 441 pixels per inch and it's
actually a pretty good-looking display
making it great for watching videos and
playing games graphics and text look
very sharp with nice color reproduction
it doesn't look oversaturated it also
has good viewing angles and gets plenty
bright making it easy to see outdoors on
the inside the idle X plus is rocking a
mediatek octa-core processor clocked at
2 gigahertz backed by 2 gigabytes of RAM
a Mallee 450 GPU and comes in 16 or 32
gigabytes of internal storage and I
guess you could say this processor is
the first of its kind it's a true
octa-core processor which means all
eight cores are actually firing at the
same time which is different from what
Samsung is doing where it's basically
just two quad cores alternating back and
forth depending on what it is that you
are doing now this processor sounds like
an absolute beast on paper but it's
based on cortex a7 architecture which is
pretty old architecture at this point
the performance of the idle X plus isn't
bad but it could be better
it handles regular day-to-day tasks like
swiping through home screens or opening
up apps with no issues and it even does
a pretty decent job with graphically
intensive games like dead trigger 2 and
Shadowgun deadzone but sometimes you'll
run into some lag or the occasional drop
frame which created for a rather
inconsistent experience and web browsing
performance could also be improved as
there's a lot of rendering issues
especially when scrolling quickly even
on the default web browser the software
could be to blame for some of this as
it's running on 4.2.2 jelly bean which
isn't the latest version of Android or
even the latest version of jelly bean
and I'd be very skeptical on this phone
seeing the light of day when it comes to
updates on top of Android 4.2.2 is
Alcatel OneTouch UI which is full of
very bright and colourful looking icons
and transparencies and the UI elements
like the folders and notification shape
Alcatel does include some rather
interesting features like a scrollable
home screen dedicated purely to widgets
and another home screen for glancing at
images in your gallery both of which can
be removed if you don't like them it
isn't the most intrusive or heaviest
skin out there as it does preserve some
elements from stock
like the app drawer and setting the menu
while the color scheme is a little
different the overall look has been left
intact when this phone is working
properly it's actually not half bad but
Alcatel OneTouch UI is full of bugs
sometimes causing the phone to lock up
or just force closing altogether so
Alcatel definitely has their work cut
out for them as the overall performance
leaves a lot to be desired
despite its performance issues it's been
solid in terms of battery life on the
inside it's rocking a non-removable 2500
milliamp hour battery and I got pretty
much all day battery life with it I was
connected to Wi-Fi the majority of the
time most because edge sucks but I got
between 18 to 20 hours off the charger
and that equated to about four and a
half to almost 5 hours of screen on time
so I was actually pleasantly surprised
especially considering that 2500
milliamp hours is deemed somewhat small
in comparison to a lot of other
smartphones out there
another strong aspect of the idle x+ is
on the back and that is the 13 megapixel
camera it's got a pretty simplistic and
straightforward camera interface with a
few shooting modes like HDR panorama
night and sport and more advanced
options like ISO and exposure to help
you get a better looking shot
surprisingly the camera takes very
nice-looking photos they're very sharp
which you sort of expect out of 13
megapixels with color reproduction that
is very true to life it doesn't have the
fastest shutter speed in the world as
taking photos of moving objects even
slow ones will result in blurry images
but overall the camera performs much
better than I expected it to and at an
f-stop of 2.0 it does a decent job in
low-light as well without creating too
much noise if you're in the United
States looking to get this phone the
biggest deal-breaker will probably be
the connectivity as this phone
completely lacks LTE due to the mediatek
processor and doesn't support any 3G
bands on US carriers like t-mobile and
AT&amp;amp;T and during my time using it I was
actually relegated to edge which created
for a rather frustrating experience and
for $400 off contract it's a rather
steep price to pay for no LTE and the
low probability of software updates and
there's a lot better options out there
that offer a lot more for a lot less
like the Nexus 5 for example or the Moto
X and even phones like the Moto G and
the all-new oneplus one which has been
creating a lot of buzz lately and so
there you have it
overall the idol X plus offers some very
decent hardware like the display and
camera but suffers from way too many
shortcomings to make it a viable option
against other smartphones in its price
range which basically takes away any
competitive edge this phone might have
had but that's pretty much it for this
