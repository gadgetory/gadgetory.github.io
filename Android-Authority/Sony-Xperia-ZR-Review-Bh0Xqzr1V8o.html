and putting it through its paces with a
bunch of different variations most
recently we saw the blown up version the
Xperia Z ultra that huge device but now
Sony has decided to take things just a
little bit simpler and a little bit
smaller hey it's Josh magar from Android
auto what's going on everybody and this
is the Sony Xperia Z R this can be
somewhat considered the mini edition of
the Sony Xperia Z and Z ultra but only
InDesign in all other respects this is a
phone that can certainly stand on its
own falling under the 5 inch screen
measurement the Zr comes in at four and
a half inches and is all around an
easier phone to handle than its bigger
brethren the design is pretty classic
Xperia with white plastic wrapping
around the screen on the front below the
screen is a notification light in the
shape of a nice futuristic looking line
that was first seen in the Xperia Z L
around the sides we have an accented
gray color with the same button layout
we've come to expect from any Xperia the
silver power button and volume rocker
above a small but still welcome addition
of a dedicated camera button all of the
buttons are small but manageable though
there is a bit of a squishiness and a
lack of tactile feel to them that
honestly I didn't really like an
expected IP certification means that the
headphone jack up top and the microUSB
port on the side gets small plastic
covers around the back we actually get a
removable cover which includes
everything that entails the sim and SD
card slots along with a removable
battery I do have to admit that it is a
little odd to see these two important
features available consistently in the
mid-range and not the top-tier
nonetheless the cover is made of a
simple plastic with no texture or design
all you get is the Experian and the
camera optics above the flash diode
obviously the four and a half inch form
factor makes this feel easy in the head
everything is easily reachable from a
neutral grip but the button layout does
seem a little low considering the size
of this phone which is a minor but
noticeable gripe while this isn't a
super light phone there is a lack of
heft that is accompanied by a somewhat
hollow feeling all of this leads to
simultaneously a phone that is very
light but also tows that quality line I
wouldn't go as far as to say that there
is a low quality build or feel to this
but the smooth simple plastic and the
hollow feeling within some would detract
from it the TFT capacitive display is
4.55 inches large and packs a decent
amount of power which puts the
experience er above many of its mini
counterparts capable of 720p and packing
323 pixels per inch the Bravia Engine
also helps with the color reproduction
overall this is much like a smaller
version of the screen found on the
Xperia Z with some improvements
brightness is adequate though you're
going to have to crank it up in broad
daylight colours do have a good level of
contrast and thankfully sony has at
least gotten somewhat better at viewing
angles since the original Xperia Z it
brings the same experience play quality
in a smaller size which honestly is kind
of a nice feat while we thought the
Xperia Z kind of missed the mark by
packing a then somewhat aging Snapdragon
s4 pro it makes perfect sense for this
later mid-range offering the quad core
processor comes in at 1.5 gigahertz and
is backed by the adrenal 320 and two
gigabytes of RAM as expected users get
good and reliable performance from a
chipset that has had over the last year
to prove itself the somewhat simpler
Xperia UI does also help in this regard
so moving around the OS and is er is a
smooth experience general users will
remain quite happy with their experience
on the Xperia Z R which is outfitted
with just enough power to handle just
about anything today's demands throw at
it
IP 58 certification helps keep all of
the hardware on the Xperia Z are dust
free and protected in up to one meter of
water and you'd want to protect all the
all important features of removable
battery and microSD card slot all found
underneath that removable back cover the
rest of the story is pretty familiar
with GPS Bluetooth NFC but there is no
IR blaster included given the lackluster
performance of the experience these
speakers I did
expect the CR to really surpass it that
was about right
as is the case with all Experian's these
days a couple different versions are
available for HSDPA and LTE connectivity
so be sure what you're getting for your
network being able to have a spare
battery handy is often an important
feature to users but with the smaller
specifications the 2300 milliamp power
unit included with the Xperia Z R is
able to go the distance
straight video playback is able to crack
close to the 7 hour mark and moderate to
slightly heavy usage will still take you
from waking up to sleeping without truly
tapping out at the end of one long day I
still had 20% battery life left and was
pretty pleasantly surprised that this
4.5 inch screen device wasn't really
breaking a sweat
this comes as little surprise however
considering there is less screen to
display less pixel density to process
and a less demanding processing package
to power and even in the camera Sony
didn't want to compromise high quality
and power for a smaller phone by today's
standards having a 13 megapixel camera
is a little unheard of nonetheless the
Xperia Z R comes with a camera that can
actually rival some of the top two
devices available now in the app you get
the usual
experience like superior auto a mode
that finds the right scene mode for your
shot it is probably my favorite auto
mode on a smartphone camera because it's
not too intrusive and it just tells you
what it thinks would work so if you need
to change it you certainly can otherwise
you get HDR sweeping panorama and a
myriad of filters picture quality is
quite decent and is very reminiscent of
the good performing Xperia Z details are
captured quite well and dullness and
color reproduction is kept to a minimum
without a full comparison it's hard to
see if the Z are really rivals or
surpasses current top smartphone cameras
but from this cursory glance it's easy
to like what comes out of these optics
low-light shots obviously get more noise
but the flash dial helps with that the
Zr is also capable of 1080p video
capture effectively translating picture
quality to movies HDR can also be turned
on in video mode too ultimately you get
a great performing camera in a phone
that is supposed to take a step back
from the cutting edge when it comes to
software Sony doesn't really stray from
what we've already seen from them the
Xperia U is back in this Android 4.1
version that includes Google now on top
of its own additions the Xperia app
staples of the Walkman movies and album
bring very Sony esque media players to
the fray all of these make for a good
media consumption experience and since
they can play a myriad of file types you
should have little problems
the only other additions are the small
apps little overlays that go on top of
what you're already doing these are just
simple tools like calculators and timers
and notes but they do help with quick
multitasking honestly I've always liked
the Xperia UI with its darker overall
tones because it's like Sonia's own take
on a mostly stock looking Android it's
simple its elegant and it doesn't try
too hard the Sony Xperia Z R isn't
currently available for any carriers in
the States but you can find it unlocked
for just under $500 we don't know where
and we don't know when it will get put
on any carriers but I really hope that
it does eventually and so there you have
it I actually wasn't expecting a whole
lot from the Sony Xperia Z R and that
could possibly be because of the many
different mid to low range phones that
Samsung and let's say LG consistently
put out with Sony looking to get into
that sort of game I was expecting it to
be a lot more of the same thankfully
that was not the case even if the build
and the feel might leave a little bit to
be desired everything underneath is
purely viable and deserves ample
attention the tried and true Snapdragon
s4 pro continues to flaunt its abilities
and features like expandable memory and
720p resolution for a smaller display
help make the Xperia Z R an easily
recommended device while the Moto X
remains quite similar to the Zr in its
specs what is great about the Zr is that
you now have choices for smaller and
more easily accessible devices that
provide as close to a top-tier
experience as they can if you want a
powerful experience without getting too
crazy the Xperia Z R is your bang for
buck phone it might not be on the
cutting edge but it gets close enough
that you might not even be able to tell
the difference as always thank you very
