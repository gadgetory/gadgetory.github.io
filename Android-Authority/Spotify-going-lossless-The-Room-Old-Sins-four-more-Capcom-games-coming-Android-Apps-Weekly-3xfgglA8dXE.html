jill hindi the android authority app guy
and welcome back to android apps' weekly
this is episode number 182 so let's get
started capcom is apparently working on
bringing four more classic games to
mobile one of them is 1942 a classic
top-down shooter that many people
enjoyed back in the day so far capcom
has watched six megaman releases this
year so we're hoping that this attempt
goes a little bit better we don't have a
time frame for a release date just yet
we just know that they're working on it
twitch receive a new update this week
and in that update is a new thing called
pulse pulse is a lot like Facebook's
timeline except for video streamers
it'll make it easier for affluent
members of the community to share clips
highlights and even stuff like schedules
followers can see these things and
interact more frequently it has a bit of
nuance to twitch as otherwise
cut-and-dry experience and it should be
rolling out right now Google Play
announced their first original podcast
this week and it's called City
soundtracks it's essentially a podcast
version of vh1's behind the artist and
each episode will focus on one artist
along with their hometown most are
calling it an attempt for Google Play to
promote its own service from within
however it does sound genuinely
interesting it launched on March 8th
with three episodes and it's on Google
Play right now if you want to try it out
fire proof games announced that a new
room game is coming it'll be called the
room old sins and like its predecessors
it'll be a mix of an escape game and a
puzzle game there isn't a lot of
information available just yet however
we do know that it'll take place in a
house and will feature a very creepy
dollhouse there isn't a definitive
release date just yet we just know that
they're working on it right now work
around the digital grapevine is that
Spotify is preparing a lossless hi-fi
option some users have reported seeing a
prompt to upgrade to the new service and
the prices have ranged anywhere from $5
to $10 for some the likely explanation
is that they're testing to see which
prices that people like this will put
them in direct competition with title as
the only two companies that do lossless
streaming also Spotify announced that
they've hit 50 million paid subscribers
congratulations to Spotify what are
critters is a unique puzzle game you
play as a few cute little critters and
your job is to get them to the end of
any given level you do so by chopping up
the level in such a way that they can
proceed that can involve chopping up the
landscape so they can walk or even hacky
up the place so that various obstacles
can be overcome it's cute and
surprisingly creative you can pick it up
for $2.99 with no in-app purchases or
advertising corner fly is an Android
customization app and its sole purpose
in life is to make the corners of your
screen rounded you know like you'd see
on the LGG 6 or the galaxy s 8 you can
also configure the application for any
individual application if you want to
the best part is if it doesn't require
root to use you can use it for free if
you want to however going pro will allow
you to customize the corners and it'll
remove the advertising it's a little
thing but sometimes the little things
can be fun it's free to download if you
want to check it out unn worded is a
narrative puzzle game in this one you'll
be tasked with little puzzles where you
build objects out of letters you'll do
stuff like use a J to make the handle
for an umbrella or use an H to make
smokestacks on a boat along with the
puzzles is a little narrative story that
gets told to you as you complete levels
it's an entertaining game although we
would like to see a bit more complexity
in some of the puzzles it's three
dollars and 99 cents but there are no
in-app purchases to get in your way
brick box is a new video streaming
service it's for US residents only and
that's kind of unfortunate however those
with access can't pick up a ton of TV
shows movies and programs created in the
UK as a service it seems to work fairly
well we watch several shows without any
buffering or noticeable lag problems the
UI isn't like to look at but it's pretty
easy to move around about the only real
downside is the lack of super hit shows
like Top Gear Doctor Who weakest link
and some others it's $6.99 per month if
you are interested shadow Matic is a new
puzzle game that focuses on shadows it
works by placing a random object in
front of a bright light and your job is
to twist and turn the object around
until the shadow behind it turns into a
picture the game includes over a hundred
levels achievements and Arcade Mode
hints and a lot more you can get the
first 14 levels for free and then you'll
be asked to pay $2.99 for the rest of
the game through an in-app purchase
it's fun it's kid-friendly and the
graphics in this one aren't half bad for
even more Android apps and games news
