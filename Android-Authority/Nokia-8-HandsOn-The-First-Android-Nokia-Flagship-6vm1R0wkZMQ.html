will be the first Nokia flagship running
Android the Nokia eight is this the
return to form that Nokia fans have been
waiting for
well it looks and feels a whole lot like
a 2017 flagship and like many flagship
that has a killer feature to set itself
apart as Nokia has been known to do in
the past they're putting the major
emphasis here on the camera or should
that be cameras and some unique trick
should make it a great choice for
content creators and the Instagram
generation HMV themselves have described
this as the ultimate device for
documenting your life but doesn't do
enough to compete with the other heavy
hitters out there if those madmen know
HMV global as a Finnish company that
acquires the nokia license just eight
months ago and has already given us the
Nokia three five and six this is their
first ever real flagship though so I was
eager to see how it hold up and whether
they'd be able to fly the flag proudly
for the Nokia brand to look at this is
off to a good start
Nokia 8 has most of the hallmarks of a
modern flagship while continuing the
design language of the last three models
it has an attractive and bass limb all
our minim design with an average
thickness of 7.3 millimeters if four
point six millimeters of thinnest point
and seven point nine millimeters it is
thickest it comes in a matte silver
matte blue polished blue and a very i
grabbing polished copper these colors
adorn the back of the device and not the
front on the front you get a 5.3 inch
quad HD - 560 by 1 440 display with 700
minutes of brightness it certainly looks
very bright and crisp in my brief
testing period so it's quite stunning
from the rear but the device is also
something of a fingerprint magnet and
it's very slippery those bezels are also
starting to look a little bit last year
compared to some of the other top of the
range phones it's also not waterproof
but rather splash proof with an IP 54
rating and specs wise this is once again
a very good flagship showing and it
should be a trade blows of the likes of
the s8 Nakia rate is powered by a 2.45
gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 and
it's backed up by four gigabytes of RAM
this should make it more than capable of
handling the most demanding tasks more
interesting is some advanced cooling
which makes use of a copper pipe and
graphite shielding in order to disperse
heat evenly across the phone that means
there shouldn't be any noticeable
hotspot on the body of the device and
reportedly that'll let you push the
performance harder and for longer
another thoughtful design choice was
placing the antenna at the top and the
bottom of the phone which should prevent
those from getting covered by your hand
while you use it and it should allow for
some of the best signal sensitivity in
the industry potentially leading to a
better battery life that battery is a
3019 milliamp hour battery with quick
charge 3.0 the phone also comes with 64
gigabytes of internal storage but this
will be expandable up to 256 gigabytes
using an SD card in terms of software we
can expect an entirely clean Android
experience with no customization or
bloatware this should also mean that the
device will receive quick updates and
Nokia promises that owning an ocular
eight will be one of the fastest ways to
get Android Oh in your hands of course
that remains to be seen but I've been
saving the best to last the star of the
show here is definitely the camera the
camera is a result of a partnership
between hmd and Zeiss and it's the core
experience that phone is designed around
the rear shooter utilizes two sensors
one color and one monochrome these two
images are then combined into a single
shot with greater contrast using image
fusion technology this is basically what
we've seen on other handset like the
honor 8 and the honor 9 both those
sensors are 13 megapixel but in a unique
twist so too is the front-facing camera
which utilizes the exact same camera
module in fact that also need to get
autofocus up front which is another rare
feature for a selfie camera so the
reasoning behind having a 13 megapixel
camera on both the front and the back
was to support what the company sees as
a Nokia's killer feature the both see
the Brophy feature allows users to snap
photos or record video using footage
from both the front and the rear camera
split down the middle 5050 where they're
shooting in this mode of recording
regular video that can then be streamed
directly to Facebook live or YouTube
natively from the camera app and what
also makes this a good choice of content
creation is top tier audio recording
which eases ozo audio using multiple
microphones it can capture a high
dynamic range and record binaural audio
that means song watching your Facebook
live stream with the headphones on will
be able to hear stereo sound with no
need to own specific software themselves
so in theory the audio quality should be
able to match the video quality when
capturing your story on the move so I
had to go at the cam
and I found it to be a good shooter
capable of some detailed contrasting
shot I wasn't able to get the photos off
the device though so we'll need more
time to test before we can make a final
verdict I'm also not sure the bo3 mode
is really anything that couldn't be
accomplished on any other device with
the right app but having that feature so
readily available means that more users
will be likely to try it and it
certainly really emphasizes what this
phone is all about whether it's
something we'll see more content
developers using in future or main to be
seen but more to the point this is about
the 13 megapixel front-facing camera
with autofocus that's a compelling
feature and it's one that will no doubt
appeal to vloggers backpackers or anyone
else who enjoys telling the camera on
themselves and when you couple that with
a sleek design the pure Android
experience and top of the range specs
I'm sure there'll be a large audience
for this phone the Nokia eight will be
available globally on September the 6th
for a price of five hundred and ninety
nine euros we'll have a full review
ready for you then so you can find out
whether this truly as a competitive
flagship from Nokia and whether it's a
good phone to document your life with so
