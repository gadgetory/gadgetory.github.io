Hindy the android authority app guide
were in April now which means it's time
for us to take a look back at the best
applications released in March of 2014
first up on our list this month is
Captain America the Winter Soldier it
was released by gameloft is sort of the
official mobile game for the movie the
gameplay falls into the category of
action adventure and the graphics are
comic book style which helps add to the
atmosphere of the game you control
shield teams to take down the big bad
guys and it's free to try for a couple
of levels and a 299 purchase after that
it's a fun little action game and
definitely worth at least a try if
you're into marble stuff most launchers
in the Google Play Store have a lot of
features and can get rather complicated
crescendo launcher has none of these
things what for sure though offers is a
simplified Android experience and this
can be great for a lot of people
particularly those who are finally
upgrading from a feature phone or those
of the senior citizen demographic it's
very minimal and extremely easy to
navigate the interface some might say
too easy but that's kind of the point
it's free in the google play store to
try out the first series of cut the rope
games are a favorite in the Google Play
Store they all have millions of
downloads and pretty decent ratings so
far cut the rope 2 continues that proud
tradition as it inches toward the
million download mark and rocks a 4.5
rating in the Google Play Store the game
has fresh gameplay elements along with
the classic ones as well as new
characters and new levels people have
complained about the in-app purchases
and the full video advertisements but it
appears as though the people who enjoy
the game outnumber the people who do not
enjoy it so that's something to take
into consideration oh and it's free if
you're more into some 2d platformers
dead links is a pretty decent game it
features a bunch of cartoony characters
in a game that goes out of its way to
not take itself too seriously it
features over 100 levels two game modes
four playable characters and a fun and
goofy storyline it's free to play with
in-app purchases word is the in-app
purchases are only a minor annoyance so
that's some good news if you like
platformers is definitely worth checking
this one out link bubble is a unique
browser that does only one thing it
opens links in the background of the
premises you no longer have to sit and
stare at a blank browser screen while it
opens the link and it'll either pop up
when it's done or you can set it to stay
in the background until you decide to
bring
forward there are other browsers that
have kind of the same functionality but
link bubble generally does it more
cleanly and with more minimalism which
makes it the preferable choice it's free
to try but the free version is a tad
bottleneck so the pro version for four
dollars and ninety-nine cents is by far
the more preferable choice even though
microsoft office was officially released
late last summer they made the huge
decision in march to make the app free
to use for android users this means no
more office 365 subscription is needed
and you can just open it up and use it
now it does require a Microsoft account
that automatically signs you up for a
onedrive account that said it is
compatible with the desktop version of
Microsoft Office and it does have a
fairly good design with seven gigabytes
of free cloud storage from onedrive it
means Microsoft has a Google Drive
competitor for realz Google Drive is
still better but keep an eye out on
microsoft office because it's starting
to be a really good option the only
really bad part about it is that it
isn't compatible with tablets nope music
is a very unique application it was
released by Samsung so it's only
compatible with their galaxy lineup up
devices and it's only for us residents
aside from those very debilitating
issues milk music is actually pretty
good it's powered by slacker radio so it
has a very good selection of music and
many tech pundits in the industry have
favorably compared this service to
others like Pandora even those who don't
like Samsung and TouchWiz have been
grudgingly admitted that the app isn't
all that bad so if you have a Samsung
device live in the US and like streaming
music it's worth giving this app a try
it's free to download and free to use if
you're into listening to the news
instead of music the news beat is a fun
little app to try it's a news
aggregation service that looks up news
you may be interested in but instead of
making you read it's the apple read the
news to you what's more interesting is
that the news will be read to you in the
manner of a radio show which includes
short jingles sound effects and the like
that really sells the atmosphere so it
doesn't really feel like robots reading
the news to you although it's
essentially just robots reading the news
to you it's a nice little app and it's
free to use in the Google Play Store
quizup enjoyed the rare and beautiful
event of being red hot on social media
for about a week or so and the result is
that the app is currently everywhere
it's one of the most downloaded apps
released this month and we at android
authority even did a let's play where
Joshua Vergara and myself went
head-to-head to see who would win it's
fun ninety percent of the time and the
other ten percent of the time it's
rage-inducing awfulness due to game
glitches or the occasionally wrong
answer to a question
the ninety percent is more than enough
for me to recommend the app because it
is free to play we covered smash hit in
our indie app of the day segment and
we're going to talk about it again
because it's simply a gorgeous
application it is an endless runner
style game where you throw balls at
various glass objects to avoid getting
hit there are Google Play game services
included if you're into that sort of
thing it's free to play but you can buy
the premium version for a dollar
ninety-nine which gives you the ability
to save your progress if you so choose
Star Wars assault team was kind of a big
deal when it was first announced it's a
star wars game made by lucasarts and
let's face it if any company is going to
make a star wars game it might as well
be lucasarts the title is an enjoyable
card gamer you collect cards of your
favorite Star Wars characters then face
up against popular villains from the
series you can level up the characters
engage in PvP battles and enjoy some
above-average mobile graphics it's free
to play with in-app purchases ranging
form four dollars and then a nine cents
to one hundred dollars and a big kudos
to Lucas arts for putting those prices
right in the google play description so
downloaders aren't blindsided threes is
a little time waster where you must move
tiles with numbers on them around and
merge them with other tiles that have
the same number so you merge two threes
together and it turns into a six then
you merge two sixes together and it
turns into a 12 and so on and so forth
to be honest it didn't seem like it was
going to be a lot of fun but this game
was actually capable of swallowing
surprising amounts of time and thus has
justified its spot on this list it's a
dollar ninety-nine which happens to be
33 and one-third percent off because
puns are funny if you have two dollars
then this is a decent app to spend it on
last up this month is our wildcard pick
which is called timehop timehop is sort
of a social media aggregation service
that lets you log into various social
networks and it tells you what you were
doing posting and whatnot a year ago to
the date so if you check it on April
10th it'll show you what you posted and
did on April tenth of all prior years
that you were on social media it's an
entertaining concept because reminiscing
is fun but there are some things that
may chase people away for instance there
is no google+ support and if you have
too many tweets on twitter you have to
have the app access your archives which
is a little bit tedious it's free though
so it's worth a shot if you're into this
sort of thing once again I'm Joe Hindy
