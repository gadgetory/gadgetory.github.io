Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly we
have a lot to talk about this week
including a new app that lets you unlock
your phone with your ear a potentially
new user interface for facebook a couple
of big game releases and a lot more so
let's get started first up this week is
an application called ergo the premises
that you can unlock your phone with your
ear and since you hold your phone up to
your ear when you make phone calls this
would be a perfectly natural way to
unlock your phone it's available in the
Google Play Store right now for 399 and
it's one of the more unique lock screen
replacements here's how it works you
download the app and then run it you put
the phone up to your ear several times
to get a profile and then if the apt
description is to be believed you can
then just hold the phone to your ear to
unlock things it seems a bit tedious to
set up as you have to take multiple
scans before the app can work also
reports from reddit and other platforms
say the apps real life performance is
shaky at best the good news is there is
still a pin you can enter if your ear
isn't cutting it it's probably not much
more than a gimmick but it seems like a
pretty fun little idea Motorola has been
busy this last week updating their
application library with updates coming
out for Motorola migrates and the moto
gallery the Moto migrate is the bigger
of the two downloads in this latest
update you can now sign in to iCloud on
your moto device and pull your iOS data
directly to your new motorola phone from
there sadly while this would be a great
tool for every smartphone to have
motorola has restricted use to only
their gadgets it's still pretty cool
that it uses iCloud directly instead of
other methods the other update was to
the moto gallery in this new layout
everything is displayed in a modern tile
format that seems to be growing
increasingly popular among Android app
developers added is more Hollow and some
kitkat specific features which makes
sense because only moto devices running
KitKat can use it being a beta tester
can be a lot of fun you get to try out a
lot of new features before everybody
else and if that's something that you
like to do we found a big giant list of
applications that you can beta test some
of the bigger names on the list include
Facebook Chrome Firefox Opera rdio nova
launcher IMDB and Spotify among others
while you may run into more bugs and
issues with the beta versions of these
apps than you would with the regular
stable versions you will
get first access to new features new
content and new UI elements before the
rest of the world unfortunately it's
kind of a rolling list some apps are
open to accept more beta testers while
some apps are currently closed so you
may not be able to jump into one of them
for the time being but hey these things
happen if you want to see the full list
check out the written companion in the
video description over the last week
some screenshots have been circulating
that originated at xda-developers that
show a brand-new and possibly improved
interface for the facebook it should be
immediately noted that the UI changes
triggered server side and not app side
so some alpha users may not have it
despite having the same version or a
later version of the Alpha Facebook
builds that said facebook seems to be
taking a much different approach by
making everything available in tabs with
a list of online contacts being
available in a right side slide-out menu
so far the reactions have been mixed
some people love the new UI while others
aren't so impressed many more still are
angry that this doesn't fix the frequent
wakelocks and memory consumption issues
that are plaguing facebook users now
there's been no official word yet as to
win or if the UI will be available to
everyone if you're a fan of ingress this
last bit of news should be of interest
to you knee antic Labs is teaming up
with well-known publisher HarperCollins
to create a new augmented reality game
called end game so far the details are
scarce but it appears to be a huge
project according to Harper Collins it
will integrate a trilogy of novels 15
novellas YouTube videos google search
google image search google maps social
media and interactive augmented reality
gaming all into one giant experience
even if the books aren't any good the
game is probably going to be awesome
along with the game in the first book a
bulletproof box filled with gold will be
placed in public using the game and the
book gamers can figure out the clues and
learn how to unlock the case which is
once again full of gold some controversy
seems to stem from the author being
james frey who has had a little bit of a
sordid past but hey google is involved
and so is gold so i don't think anyone
is going to mind who the author is so
who wants to see some trending
applications as usual if you want to
check any of these applications out you
can find the links in the written
companion which is in the video
description first up this week is to do
it to do it was updated with a brand new
set of features that developers are
calling todoist next
included our design tweaks a visual
scheduler and data syncing between the
13 platforms that you can run this app
on including computers and other
smartphone operating systems it's a
pretty big deal and worth checking out
bad hotel is a very popular iOS title
that has made its way over to Android
this unique tower defense / music
creation / simulation game revolves
around a hotel that you must build and
defend from bad guys the music changes
as you add pieces to your hotel so
different people will get different
experiences it's a dollar 99 in the
Google Play Store and aside from some
compatibility issues the reviews are
pretty good the Deus Ex the fall is a
square enix title that was announced
eons ago released for iOS last year and
has also finally made its way onto
Android in this action RPG shooter you
can enjoy pretty good graphics a long
and complicated story line and choose
between playing a stealth game or an
all-out attack game we're going to
review this one in the coming days so
keep an eye out for that everyone who
has owned an HTC device in recent years
knows about Beats Audio and now you can
get their music experience with beats
music the app is free but the service
costs 999 a month which is on par with
Spotify and google play music it
includes access to over 20 million songs
and some unique features like the
sentence if you'd like to try it out
they're currently offering seven day
free trials to everyone which is
extended to three months if you're with
AT&amp;amp;T with our last appt this week called
100 according to google you can check
out what's been trending on google using
this app which has compiled results from
a trillion Google searches you can see
the top 100 web search trends that are
separated into seven categories it's not
overly useful but a fun way to see what
was trending on Google in the year 2013
