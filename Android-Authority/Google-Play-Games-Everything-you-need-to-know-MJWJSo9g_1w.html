handy the Android authority app guy
we've been hearing about Google Play
games and Play game services since
before Google i/o it's been out for a
little while now and today we're going
to show you what it's all about and tell
you what it does ok so let's start out
with the bottom line here what does this
app actually do what it does is act like
a dashboard for all of your Android
gaming needs think of it like an Xbox or
a ps3 dashboard or even a steam
dashboard it doesn't do anything cool on
its own but it gives you access to all
the things that do so here's what it
does using this app you can view all of
your games if those games have Google
Play games support you can also view
things like your achievements it'll show
you all the games you've played the ones
you've played recently and the ones you
have currently installed you can also
browse featured and popular titles as
well as multiplayer specific titles you
can view your friends on Google+ who
also use Google Play games this is both
a good and a bad thing it's great if you
have friends who play and you want to
find them it's bad when you have 1,800
people in circles like I do and they all
sign up for Google Play games and then
don't play any games there is the
possibility of having a giant list of
people who play no games really that's
about all it does the things you can do
from the app is useful but the app
itself is really just a graphical
dashboard for gamers so they can find
everything they need in one spot whether
it be games to play or friends to play
them with so you're probably wondering
how you can use this app well if you
don't play games you can't this is for
gamers only and non-gamers will have a
pretty difficult time finding anything
useful about this app for gamers I pose
this question what do you use the Xbox
Dashboard for you see what friends are
online and you see what they're doing
right you can view the games you have
downloaded browse for more games and
launch games as well that's pretty much
what you can use this app to do probably
the best use for this dashboard is
finding multiplayer games
more specifically popular multiplayer
games that use Play game services and
that people actually play this is an
epic improvement to Android if you're a
social gamer by social gamer I'm not
talking about spamming your friends with
candy crush invites but like actually
play games online with real people so
here's what we liked it's a great place
to manage all of your android games
Android has long needed something to
kind of combine the Android gaming
experience into one solid spot and this
fills that hole
quickly mobile gamers now have an
interface with which to build and enjoy
their gaming networks it's early on but
more and more games are adopting the
play games philosophy before long there
will be achievements cloud saves and
proper multiplayer available everywhere
all under the same play games dashboard
we find there's nothing wrong with that
we do like that it keeps track of all
games not just those that have play
games features google still has a lot of
work to do but it's mostly little stuff
for instance you can view achievements
and friends who play games but you can't
narrow down your search for all your
friends who play a specific game or view
all your achievements all at once it
isn't that big of a deal but some search
filters and other economic improvements
would have been nice the only other
thing we didn't like is the people
section doesn't get narrowed down based
on who actually plays games instead it
seems to list everyone in your Google+
circles whether they actually play games
or not we have a whole Google+ app to
pay attention to non gamers who want to
hashtag Caturday on Wednesdays we felt
that maybe those people should have been
filtered out so we could pay attention
to our gamer friends overall this is a
really awesome idea that's implemented
for the most part really well giving
gamers their own interface to track and
interact their games is kind of a must
have these days since PC gaming and
console gaming both have similar
dashboards for their gamers of course
there is always room for improvement we
really wish they had filter non-gamers
out of the contact list finding people
who game is awesome but scrolling
through hundreds of people to find even
one of those gamers is the opposite of
Awesome so would we recommend it well
yes it's free and as the platform grows
and improves it will become an essential
app for any mobile gamer just remember
that the system isn't perfect yet once
