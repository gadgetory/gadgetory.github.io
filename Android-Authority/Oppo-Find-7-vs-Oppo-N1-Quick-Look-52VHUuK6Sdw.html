future hey it's Josh reguar from Android
30 what's going on everybody and this is
the Oppo find 7 vs. the Oppo n1 although
both handsets offer excellent build
quality there are several differences
between the two devices when it comes to
design language probably one of the most
obvious differences in the build
materials while the Oppo n1 featured a
matted plastic body the find seven
offers are carbon fiber backing on the
quad HD model and a brushed finish on
the back of the 1080p variant another
fairly obvious difference between the
two devices is the Oppo in one's unique
rotating camera found up top and the
fine 7 might not feature a rotating
camera but one of its most
distinguishing features is that new
skyline notification lights seen at the
very bottom of the handset the elbow
find 7 with its 5.5 inch display is
certainly not a small handsome but it is
considerably lighter and less bulky than
the Oppo n1 which features a 5.9 inch
display the Oppo n1 has volume rockers
and the power button all on the right
side while the find seven returns to the
same somewhat uncommon layout seen in
its predecessor to find five with the
power button on the left and the volume
rockers on the right as we've said
already the Oppo n1 offers a massive 5.9
inch display with a 1080p resolution
that brings in 373 pixels per inch
now while the display has rich and
vibrant colors it just simply pales in
comparison to the Oppo find 7 s 5.5 inch
display with a resolution of 2560 by
1440 that's quad HD as they're calling
it and an astonishing 538 pixels per
inch there are simply no other handsets
currently on the market that can even
begin to rival to find sevens very
photogenic display though the Oppo n1
does provide 0.4 inches more viewing
space and essentially comes down to what
matters more to you the resolution of
the display or perhaps the screen real
estate that is provided it is also worth
noting that the fine 7 will offer a
1080p model for those of you who don't
need the quad HD which should provide an
image quality that more evenly matches
the n1 albeit in a smaller package the
Oppo find 7 has an upgraded processing
package over the n1 with a 2.3 gigahertz
Snapdragon 800 for the 1080p model and a
slightly faster Snapdragon 801 for the
quad HD model that also sports three
gigabytes of RAM versus the 1.7
gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 found
in the elbow and one the bottom line
though here is that while the
and one provided a fast and very smooth
experience the fine 7:00 is even better
as color OS glides through its elements
and is still comparable to the
CyanogenMod that I have installed on the
Oppo n1 you're seen now while the Oppo
n1 featured a large 3610 milliamp hour
battery the fine 7 rocks are somewhat
smaller one at 3000 milliamp hours a
fine sevens high resolution will
certainly put more stress on the
device's battery but the Snapdragon 800
series is supposed to be more powerful
than the original Snapdragon 600 found
in the n1 between this and the fact that
the N ones display is five point nine
inches we wager that battery life is at
least somewhat calm comparable what the
fine 7 does have to its advantage
however is called multi step constant
current charging technology which
basically allows the handset to charge
from 0 to 75 percent in just 30 minutes
the elbow fine 7 also brings some new
features for upload that have now been
unseen thus far in other devices like
the n1 in their camp
first there's the microSD card slot
which allows for expandable memory and
is certainly a welcome change and even
more importantly the Oppo find 7 is the
first upload of I support LTE
connectivity
now while the n1 does come with the
o-click remote accessory and the out
touch area on the back that helps with
some navigation these are perhaps not as
important to general users as an
inclusion of those removable batteries
expandable storage and of course fast
charging times are always a good
prospect part of the opal enones draw
was its unique rotating camera which
offered a 13 megapixel sensor with dual
LED flash the fine 7 might not feature
the rotating functionality that was
found in the n1 but its camera is still
very impressive the camera is a 13
megapixel shooter that features the
latest Sony Exmor RS sensor alongside a
unique superzoom mode that takes a bunch
of pictures and allows the fine 7 to
focus in on more details the camera app
within all post color OS is largely the
same as what you'd find in the n1 though
there are at least a few minor changes
here and there like shooting in RAW
format and 4k video recording in the
software department once again both
handsets do use the same color OS ROM
which is based on Android 4.3 this means
that both devices have tons of special
features and customizations that are
unique to newer Oppo devices color OS
offers some cool features like a gesture
panel that allows you to draw
programmable gestures to perform a bunch
of different tasks aside from that the
home the home screens take on a rather
ethereal look with some interesting
choices in terms of the widgets and also
the color
scheme's but of course on the Oppo n1
and likely for the future of the fine 7
it is possible to install CyanogenMod
for a different experience however many
of the same features color OS provides
have been built in there as well so Oppo
continues to give its nods to the ROM
community being one of the few companies
completely open to this level of
customization built into their handsets
and so there you have it while the Oppo
n1 certainly isn't aging much at all yet
the fine 7 arises the occasion once
again and showcases the best of a
company that we're always excited to
watch keep it into Android Authority for
all of the best coverage of opus brand
new flagship and head on over to Android
authority comm for even more because we
