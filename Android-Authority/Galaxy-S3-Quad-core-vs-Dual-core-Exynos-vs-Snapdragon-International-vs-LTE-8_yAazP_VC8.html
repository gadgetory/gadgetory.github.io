thanks for stopping in once again this
is Clayton Youngberg coming at you from
the number one website for all things
Android Android Authority calm today
we've got a headset a comparison between
the quad-core processor and the dual
core processor located in the Samsung
Galaxy s3 alright today we've got a dead
comparison between the quad core Exynos
chip set in the international unlocked
version of the samsung galaxy s3 and the
Snapdragon s4 dual-core processor in the
carrier variants and a US version of the
Samsung Galaxy s3
so anyways I've gots a few 10 so anyways
I've got a few tests lined up to put
these two through the motions we're
going to be playing some dead trigger
both of them i've modded to fully enable
the Tegra 3 graphics on the game so we
get the full graphics we're going to put
these under a heavy load and then we're
going to be doing a quadrant test as
well as just some transition tests maybe
some web browsing maybe some camera
power but without further ado let's
check out the dead trigger gameplay
we'll open it up on both devices so you
can see our s4 is in a bit of a lead but
I did possibly press it just a bit
sooner on the Snapdragon processor I'm
not going to rate the game now even
though we got a prompt to rate the game
on the quad-core it still booted up a
little bit faster we've got our main
quest here now we're just going to go to
the main quest on each of these and then
I'll pause one looks like I press that
just about the exact same time so we'll
see which one comes out on top it's like
the quad cores I've get a little bit
ahead anyways before new zombies come
you can see that the Tegra 3 graphics
are enabled we have our steam and we
have our water so we will just pause on
the s4 Snapdragon and we'll kill a few
here I'm getting killed
from behind must be this crawler to know
that there was powers in this game so
anyways you saw that now we'll do it on
our dual-core s4 see it's still
rendering really nicely our water and
let's kill these guys a slight bit of
lag right there but a 2 gigabytes of RAM
does well especially when multitasking
now mind you I didn't have any apps open
before I open the dead trigger
application we'll walk under the water
that drips here you can see our water
dripping animation and we'll also do the
same on the quad-core version of the
galaxy s3 so your water renders very
nicely there it's like the speeds are
just about at par with each other I mean
they're not going to be too different
then we got our water heater so we have
the water on each device rendering it
just about the exact same speed really
nice and we'll just let ourselves get
killed and see if there's any lag
involved and there's not so we'll go
home on this device I press them at the
exact same time it looks like they
actually made it they're the exact same
time as well now we'll go into our task
management system in our half manager
we'll just long press the home button
they both came up at the exact same time
again we did have our task manager open
and our dead trigger we will remove all
and now we'll press once again to go
into our task manager you can see how
much RAM is free now of course the
Snapdragon s4 has a lot more RAM this
comes with 2 gigabytes looks like we
have a four hundred and 25 Meg's used
and on the quad core we have four
hundred and six megabytes use will clear
the memory and see what we get then so
we've got 327 and then we got 325 so
basically it's across the board as far
as RAM usage it's even across the board
but we do have a lot more RAM available
on the Snapdragon s4 now that being said
we'll close our task manager just so
there's no
running apps and will perform a quadrant
test now each of these are hooked to the
same Wi-Fi network so let's actually see
which one completes the benchmark and
we'll actually watch the entire
benchmark and make a note of the FPS
that it's running at so let's do this
looks like I might have tapped the run
benchmark just a little bit sooner on
the s4 but we'll see if that makes a
difference
definitely looks like our CPU is going a
bit faster on the quad-core anyways on
the exhaust chipset but once we get to
memory we will see a significant boost
in the Snapdragon model over the
quad-core except we were running at 60
frames per second fair def 61 here we
had a peak of 66 we have 61 all right so
when we check out our quadrant tests on
each of these will just pop our screens
on once again we got a 5585 on the
quad-core model of the Samsung Galaxy s3
and then we got a 40 959 on the
dual-core now as far as CPU we got
12,000 870 on the quad-core
we got 8,000 464 so we got a little more
than 2,000 more excuse me on the
quad-core model but then as far as
memory we got 7,000 34 on the dual-core
and we got 40 486 so we've got about
2000 more in memory on the Snapdragon s4
now our 2d is just about the same you
know this is still a super super good
score so beats out most the phones out
there so we'll go back we'll see if
these two core it we'll see if the two
CPUs have an effect on the camera and
we'll actually turn these both to
snapshot and so let's just take a few
snapshots both just as fast camera
performance is great anyways guys there
was a quick comparison between the
dual-core and quad-core variants of a
samsung galaxy s3 now as far as
benchmark results go the quad-core
Asano's chipset obviously scored more
but the ram the two gigabytes of RAM on
the dual-core model bumped it up to just
about
you know in the same tier of scores so
they're both great devices no matter
which one you guys buy I wouldn't really
base your decision on the amount of
cores in the International Version as
the two gigabytes of RAM can really run
basically a lot more applications just
because of all that extra RAM but
anyways guys if you like the videos go
ahead and subscribe to android authority
comm we got more where this is coming
