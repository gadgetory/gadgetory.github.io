from Android authority now there are
many reasons to want to write an Android
app maybe you've got a great idea when
you want to approach type it on Android
maybe you know about PC programming you
want to move over to mobile maybe it's
part of a college or university course
whatever the reason is writing Android
apps can be fun and rewarding and today
I'm going to show you how to write your
first Android app okay before we begin
we need to mention a couple of things
first of all you really need to know a
little bit about the Java programming
language to get you through this
particular tutorial now I've already
done a video on Java basics you can find
that video on the Android - YouTube
channel you can also find the
accompanying article on the Android or
thority website I do recommend that you
go and read that now when I made that
tutorial some people left in their
comments that they thought I was going
too fast through the material so for
this video I'm going to say two things
first of all I'm going to repeat certain
elements a couple of times just to make
sure that you've got them when they're
particularly important and secondly
please do use the pause button and go
back and watch things again if you
didn't quite get it on the first time
around okay so let's start okay so to
write an app you're going to need a
downloading installed Android studio
that's provided by Google and if you
can't find it you'll find the link to it
in the written companion to this video
on the Android authority website now
included in the download is the software
development kit for Android that all the
bits and pieces you need to develop an
app as well as the Android emulator so
that you can initially test your app on
a PC without needing to install it on a
real device however before you install
Android studio you're going to need to
install the Java development kit from
Oracle go over to the written companion
and you'll find the links to tell you
where to download the JDK now you need
to make sure you download the right
version I have a 32-bit or 64-bit check
which version of Windows are running and
download the right one because if you
don't you're going to have trouble
running Android studio install that and
then you can install Android studio
during the install you'll need to
configure how much memory to reserve
for the Android emulator now the
emulator runs Android in a kind of
virtual machine as an Android phone with
an Intel processor this is faster than
emulating an ARM processor on your PC
however to do this the virtual machine
needs to allocate some memory the
installation program will recommend how
much memory to reserve and it's probably
best to accept the default however be
aware that the combination of Android
studio Java and the emulator all running
together can be quite memory hungry and
your PC will slow to a crawl unless you
have lots of RAM google says you need
two gigabytes of RAM as a minimum and
that four gigabytes of RAM is
recommended however my main PC has 8
gigabytes of RAM and sometimes it still
struggles when you first run Android
studio it will perform some
initialization including downloading
installing the latest Android SDK this
can take several minutes so you will
need to be a bit patient when it finally
does all start up you'll be presented
with a nice menu that allows you to
start a new project open existing
project import a project and so on and
as you might expect you to click on
start a new Android studio project you
will then need to enter in a name for
your app in the application name field I
will suggest something like my first app
and in the company domain field you need
to enter the domain name of your company
if you're an independent developer or
hobbyist enter your own domain name if
you're just experimenting with Android
and won't be publishing your apps to
Google Play anytime soon then just leave
the domain as it is maybe you could just
change the word user to your own name on
the next dialog make sure the phone and
tablet is selected and that the minimum
SDK is set to API 15 Android 4.0.3 make
sure that where and TV are not ticked on
the add an activity to mobile dialog use
the default blank activity and then
click Next again on the customize the
activity dialog just use the default
values and click finish the integrated
development environment IDE will now
start this can take several minutes
especially if it's the first
we've created a project when the IDE
appears if you see the error message
rendering problems rendering failed with
a known bug then just click the rebuild
link as indicated next to the error the
default workspace for the IDE is split
into three parts excluding the toolbars
on the upper left is a project tree to
its right is the code editor and
designer and beneath them both is where
you'll see the various messages from the
compiler and so on at this point you can
actually compile and run the auto
generated code however it's not very
interesting so what we're going to do is
we're going to add a few things not very
much but just enough to give you a taste
of Android app development the project
tree holds the different files and
resources that you need to build your
Android app under the app node in the
project tree you will see several other
nodes like folders subfolders which you
can expand the top-level nodes are
manifests Java and res and res stands
for resources under manifests you'll
find the file Android manifest or XML
every application must have one of these
files it's an XML file with information
about the app including its name one of
the most common things that you'll add
to this file is the list of permissions
needed by your app for this simple test
we won't need to change anything here
under the Java folder you'll find the
Java code for your app in fact you'll
find it under a subfolder some called
something like condor example dot user
dot my first app or whatever is the
domain name that you entered earlier on
when we started the project under that
folder you'll find a file called main
activity Java this is the entry point
for your app and for our example app
this is the only Java file we're going
to need but we are going to need to add
some Java into this file so just again
so you got that the under the Java
folder you're going to find a subfolder
with a domain name of your company with
the app name appended to it and under
that you're going to find
mainactivity.java and that's the main
entry point
very simple out under the resources
folder the res folder you're going to
find lots of other subfolders now this
is where the different resources for the
project are kept that means graphics
string values menus and most importantly
where the definition for the user
interface is stored now the two that are
of interest to us for this example app
are layout and values under layout
you'll find a file called activity
underbar main.xml it is an XML file that
describes the user interface there are
two ways to edit this file the first is
to edit the XML code directly and the
second is to use the built-in UI
designer so under res layout you'll find
a file called activity main.xml and this
is the file that describes the user
interface for your Android app now once
you become proficient and an expert
Android app development you may find
yourself often editing the XML file
directly but thankfully Android studio
has a built-in UI designer and as you
change elements on the UI using the
designer it automatically creates the
corresponding XML file and that's what
we're going to do in our sample app in a
few moments the values folder contains
several different XML files and the most
important one for this example app is
strings dot XML rather than hard coding
string valued into the Java code values
are placed into strings dot XML and then
they are referenced using an ID now the
advantage of this system if a string
needs to be changed in multiple places
all you have to do is change it once in
strings dot XML and it will be changed
throughout all of the code it also makes
supporting multiple languages in the app
that whole much easier so just to repeat
that strings dot XML is where the string
values are stored and in the Java code
and in the XML file for the layout you
just reference the string using the ID
and we'll see about that
in a few minutes
so just to sum up then to create this
sample app that we're going to do today
you need to modify mainactivity.java to
add some Java code we're going to need
to modify activity underbar main dot xml
because we're going to change the UI and
we're going to need to modify strings or
xml because we want to add some
hard-coded strings like ok or tap me
into that file so let's start by
altering the text of the label and
changing its alignment first find the
activity underbar main dot xml file in
the project tree and double click
remember the activity main.xml is the
file which holds the user interface
definition at the bottom of the code
window there are two tabs design and
text make sure you are using the design
tab now click on the text hello world
that is shown on the rendering of the
phone if it's too small user zoom
buttons the plus sign the magnifying
glass to enlarge the rendering of the
phone in the property windows just to
the right of the phone image scroll down
until you find layout : Center in parent
click the space next to it and select
horizontal the hello world text will now
jump to the horizontal Center now to
change the text the string hello world
is held in that file we mentioned
earlier strings dot XML under resources
values if you double click on the file
you'll see a few lines of XML that
define a few strings used by the app
find the still line that says string
equal to hello world in angle brackets
then hello world and then the closing
string tab and change the hello world
exclamation point to tap me if you dare
now to add the button back on the design
tab of activity underbar main door XML
fine and click on the button in the
pallet list on the left hand side of the
phone rendering now click somewhere
beneath the text tap me if you dare on
the phone image
so it's somewhere in the middle now
double-click on the button so that you
can change the text the quick and dirty
way is just to change the text and leave
it hard-coded in the Java file however
since we've already been used to using
strings dot XML it's best that we carry
on using it at the end of the text field
is a button with three dots click on it
in the resources window that appears
click on new resource and then new
string value in the resource name enter
tap me and in the resource value enter
tap me exclamation point now click OK
and you'll notice that the button now
says tap me the final step is to add
some Java code which reacts to the
button being tapped one of the UI
elements of Android is called a toast a
toast provides simple feedback in a
small pop-up that appears for a few
moments and then disappears you've
definitely seen it when you've been
using Android for example in Gmail
navigating away from an email before you
send it triggers a message saved as a
draft toast toast appear automatically
and then disappear after a predefined
timeout for our sample app we will need
to display a toast
every time the button is tapped the
first step is to add some Java code find
mainactivity.java and add the following
code beneath on create the word view as
in view v will likely be in red with a
message bubble displayed near it this is
Android studio telling you have used a
new construct view without importing it
in the import section of the top of the
Java code this is actually very easy to
fix click on the word view and press alt
enter Android studio will fix it for you
if the word toast is in red then do
exactly the same thing click on the word
toast and then press alt enter now back
in the designer for activity under bar
main door XML click on the button and
scroll down through the property list
until you find on click
click on the combo box to the right of
it and it will see a list of functions
click on on button tap that's the
function we just added to the Java code
so now the on button tap function will
be called whenever the button is tapped
when it is called it creates a toast
called my toast that will display the
message ouch
to show the toast we just call my toast
dot show and that's it in terms of
writing the app now it's time to test it
in the emulator under the Tools menu
navigate to Android AVD manager this
tool shows you the current list of
configured Android virtual devices you
will have one device configured by
default
probably a nexus 5 click on the play
icon the triangle under the actions
column and this will start the emulator
now depending on the performance of your
PC and how much RAM you have the
emulator can take several minutes to
start up once the emulator is up and
running go to tools and click run app
this will compile your app and send it
to the emulator during this process
Android studio will ask you which
emulator to use you will see your
emulator in the list it should be the
default option so just click OK the app
will appear in the emulator eventually
you can now click the tap me button and
watch for the toast to appear towards
the bottom of the emulated device
congratulations it's actually possible
to run your app on a real Android device
and the easiest way to do that is to
enable USB debugging on your phone and
connect it to your PC the USB debugging
option can be found under settings
developers if you don't have a
developers option in your settings menu
then go to settings about and tap the
build number 7 times with the device
connected click on run out under the
Tools menu but this time don't send the
app to a virtual device send it to a
real device if your device isn't listed
either means that you haven't enabled
USB debugging or you need to install the
appropriate USB development drivers for
your device Google has some
documentation on this and you'll find
links to it in the written companion
well obviously this is just the
beginning but you have today written
yourself your first Android app with a
little bit of user interaction and what
you should now do is write your second
app and then your third app keep adding
to it keep learning Google has lots of
lots of training material there's lots
of documentation there's lots of sample
code but the thing to remember is just
keep having fun keep experimenting and
keep having fun you'll find it very
rewarding now do keep coming back to and
royal throaty calm because we're going
to keep posting developer related
content for you new tutorials new things
in the future so do keep tuning in you
