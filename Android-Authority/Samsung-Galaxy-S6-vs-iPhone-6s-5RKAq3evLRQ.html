the brand new iPhone is going to go up
against one of the best Android
offerings this year it's Josh regard
from Android Authority what's going on
everybody and this is the Samsung Galaxy
s6 vs. the Apple iPhone 6s now quick
disclaimer we are changing up the format
of the vs. video just a little bit so if
you want to see the full details on this
comparison you can head on over to the
card that's appearing right now so you
can click on it and go to the full
written companion for this video at
Android authority com actually when it
comes to design you kind of have an even
playing field here and the main reason
why is because the Samsung Galaxy s6
actually went with a glass and metal
design this year which eliminated the
replaceable battery and the expandable
storage which makes these two phones
actually offer very similar things in
terms of their bodies the iPhone
actually has the same body as the
original six now the 6s comes with this
rose gold that I'm using but otherwise
for both of these phones all of the
buttons and everything pretty much land
where you would expect them to be now
the iPhone being just that little bit
smaller is a little bit better when it
comes to handling but the somewhat
larger Samsung Galaxy s6 is still not
all that bad and you still get a lot of
power underneath obviously it's going to
be a matter of taste for you guys if you
want the glass panels then obviously the
galaxy s6 will be your choice but if
handling is what you need the rounded
sides and corners and the smaller
overall profile of the iPhone 6s will
probably better for you in display
especially if you're very spec hungry
you're probably going to think that the
galaxy s6 is a no brainer
you get quad HD resolution in this five
inch screen that provides a lot of pixel
density for sharpness and for working
for play and of course the Super AMOLED
display is quite nice for that higher
saturation in the colors but compare
that to the smaller and overall lower
resolution screen of the iPhone 6s which
still provides a pretty good experience
even though it doesn't have that high
pixel density for sharpness still it is
an enjoyable display to use and it
should be able to work pretty much for
the common daily user now what Apple has
added into this display this year is
called 3d touch now we're going to get
into it a little bit more in the
software section but ultimately the 3d
touch for this version of iOS actually
adds a fun
not on there that we think iOS has been
needing for some time performance is
another aspect that is kind of hard to
talk about because they're looking at
Android versus iOS two completely
different ecosystems that demand very
different things from their phones
obviously in the Android camp we have a
lot of high powered high performing
applications that require the best
specifications and you get that in the
Galaxy s6 with the exceed no 74 20 and
three gigabytes of RAM 2 gigabytes of
RAM and an Apple a9 dual-core that has
been updated from the previous a8 is
what you get in the iPhone but really
between these two devices you're not
going to have that many problems with
the very common tasks and even some high
performing applications will still go by
without any incidents no matter which of
these two devices you pick you're
probably going to have a really good
time no matter what your daily tasks are
definitely covered honestly it comes
down to how the operating system really
presents itself and it's what you're
going to be looking at wrapped around
all of the different applications you
would install already so that's where
you can kind of take your pick because
performance is no problem for either of
these phones just like InDesign hardware
is on a bit of an even playing field
because the two main features that
differentiated samsung from the apple
camp were the expandable storage and the
replaceable batteries which are not in
the equation anymore but samsung is
still able to boast the heart rate
sensor on the back which is nice to use
from time to time but really it's just a
bit of a curiosity rather than a full
workout companion now both of these
phones do have fingerprint readers
embedded inside of their home buttons
and they both work really well what we
will say is that Apple has been able to
enhance theirs so that you don't have to
keep your finger on the button when you
wake up the phone yes it is faster than
that of the Samsung Galaxy s6 but it
also kind of eliminates an easy way of
getting to the camera and one of the
best parts about the galaxy s6 is that
you can double tap the home button to
get straight into the camera even if you
have a way of getting to the camera in
the lock screen of the iPhone 6s it's
kind of stifled by the fact that it
unlocks right away before you can even
use it moving down to the bottom of the
devices you do get those two speakers
and they are on the same place which
looks kind of funny in the beginning but
ultimately the two speakers don't really
provide that great of an audio
experience the sound is often very tinny
and doesn't have a lot of body and even
if you can
pretty loud really you're only getting
so much from one speaker that's located
on the bottom what's right next to them
is more important however you have the
ports for charging and the iPhone 6's
does have the Lightning port which is
reversible and that is kind of nice but
it doesn't have fast charging or
wireless charging that galaxy s6 instead
can boast both of those things so when
it comes to powering up a 1750 milliamp
hour battery in the iPhone you're
probably going to be tethered for a lot
longer times the Galaxy s6 with its
somewhat larger battery can still get
about a day - maybe a little bit more
than a day's work with the power saving
features which is the case for the
iPhone as well but at least in the
middle of the day if you need to charge
up it won't take very long for you to
get the power that you need because fast
charging is a very indispensable tool
now when it comes to the cameras the
main story here is Apple's enhancement
to the camera package in the iPhone 6s
now you have 12 megapixels in the rear
camera compared to the 16 megapixels of
the galaxy s6 and both of the front
facing cameras have 5 megapixels to
boast about now we're going to cycle
through a number of pictures and we're
going to let you decide which one is
better for you but for us here at
Android authority we actually found that
both pictures no matter which ones we
took with these two phones really kind
of pleased us no matter what one phone
didn't really win that much more over
the other if at all and really it's up
to you to choose which color profile is
better for you now we will say that the
iPhone does tend to add a warmer tone to
everything and it adds more contrast
meanwhile the galaxy s6 puts a cooler
tone to everything and it's pictures a
little bit more evened out in their
range but the iPhone can also boast 4k
video recording now which is nice but it
doesn't have optical image stabilization
what it can do though is use the screen
as a flash when you're doing a selfie
picture now it's nice to have in a pinch
but it does wash out the subject too
much the camera of the Samsung Galaxy s6
provides a lot of manual controls which
we think is probably what gives it the
edge for us but if you just want a great
point-and-shoot experience you're
probably gone not going to get any
better than the iPhone here the auto
mode and the galaxy s6 is pretty good
but Apple has definitely been pioneering
that for a long time now and finally in
software it's a matter of Android versus
iOS and we'll start off with Android in
this case TouchWiz for the Samsung
Galaxy S
six which actually has been stripped
down a lot of the tutorials and some of
the features actually that kind of made
it feel too bloated have been stripped
away and you get a pretty Spartan
version of TouchWiz the most that we've
ever seen and the whole interface is
actually FEMA believing a built in theme
engine and then of course you have the
multitasking capabilities with the multi
window and the S window that are built
in but going from the customization
capabilities of Android you go to the
more cut-and-dry or what you see is what
you get version of operating systems in
iOS now what you get are icons on the
home screens all day every day and you
also get some access to certain places
like the command center from swiping up
from the bottom and the notification
drop-down which you can get to by
swiping down from the top other than
that recent apps screen is triggered by
double tapping the home button and
that's pretty much it what has really
been a big addition to this new iPhone
is 3d touch now in terms of the display
there's a layer of sensors right
underneath it that can sense how hard
you're pressing on the display
now you could tap or tap and hold or you
can press down really hard and it will
trigger some new functionality and that
mainly has to do with the home screen
where as you weren't able to put in
widgets or shortcuts on here like you
can in Android now depending on the
application you can press really hard on
the icon and you will have some
functions that get you straight into
some places inside of the app which is
great to have because if you want to
eliminate just that little bit of time
that it takes for you to get in through
the app then 3d touch will help you with
that other places in the operating
system that perform 3d touches are the
gallery mail and messages in which you
can actually press down hard enough to
preview the content now we don't really
think that 3d touch is actually that big
of a game-changer but we do think it's a
nice feature to have that adds to iOS
what we thought it was missing for a
long time mostly shortcuts and because
you don't have any widgets there aren't
really any easy ways of cutting some of
the time and taps and swipes down there
used to be time when applications were
available in iOS and not on Android and
the other way around was true too but
now you can pretty much get the same
experience no matter which of these
ecosystems you pick and that's pretty
awesome it just matters now which of
these interfaces matter more to you as
what you're looking at before you even
hit the app that you're going to use
both of these phones come in at around
the same price point actually using
t-mobile as an example you'll be looking
at 650 dollars out of pocket for the
full retail price sometimes a little bit
more but bear in mind that the galaxy s6
comes with 32 gigabytes in the base
model and the iPhone comes in at 16
gigabytes and neither of these phones
have expandable storage so if you want
more space in the iPhone specifically
you're going to be shelling out a hell
of a lot more and so there you have it
for the samsung galaxy s6 and to the
iphone 6s
these are two of the best phones that
are available for their respective
ecosystems and that's a really good
thing because they're also kind of on a
more even playing field the omission of
a couple key features in the galaxy s6
makes it more on par with the type of
offering that Apple has been providing
for years now and when you look at it
through that scope these phones actually
provide probably the best experiences
you can ask for in smartphones today
you're going to get the simplicity and
the ease of use of iOS or you can take
control of your Android iteration here
inside of the galaxy s6 with TouchWiz
and you have a lot of extra features to
boot 3d touch is a great addition for
iOS but we do think that it is mainly
what iOS has needed for a while
meanwhile in Android there's plenty that
has been offered in there that we
already love to this day so as always
thank you guys very much for watching
and I hope you enjoyed this versus
between the Galaxy s6 and the iPhone 6s
