Galaxy s8 in all its glory that's right
just several hours ago Edvin blast
leaked what is in all likelihood the
Samsung Galaxy s8 take a moment and just
breathe that in
so looks pretty similar to all the leaks
and rumors we've seen over the past a
week correct yes it has but let's look
at two videos that were leaked just
about 48 hours ago on the s8 itself a
leaked video of what appears to be a
working Samsung Galaxy s8 has appeared
online via the mobile fun TV YouTube
channel the video which is only a few
seconds long shows a white device which
looks very similar to what we've seen in
previous photos and leaks for the s8
though it doesn't provide much in the
way of new info it does corroborate
previous speculation regarding the edge
to edge display design a lack of the
physical home button and the sensor
setup on the top of the device which
presumably includes an iris scanner and
again that was all backed up by a leaked
video from slash leaks Samsung revealed
just this week that the s8 will be
unveiled in a month's time on March 29th
cool exciting right yeah well let's go
back in time for a quick history lesson
hello
not that far more like February 24th
2014 you know what that was the date of
the announcement of the Samsung Galaxy
s5 you see for weeks we had been getting
leaks and rumors for something that
looked like this I was pumping this I
was hyping this I was getting excited
about this but instead we got this Sorey
sic band-aid excuse for a phone huh
now I know what somebody was thinking
using a Jayce drama queen get over it
you're right but keep in mind that 24
hours before the device was released
publicly Josh was in Barcelona I
actually taking the first video shot of
the device and shared it with us
privately in slack because it was
embargoed so we couldn't share with you
and we saw such a huge difference from
what we expected to you know the reality
so I just want to tell you take it all
with a grain of salt I think it's highly
improbable that these videos and that
shot it's fake it's probably the s8 but
I just want to say that we have been
thrown for a loop and passed it's less
likely now because we have multiple
videos on it but who knows so do you
like the essay it's a major pretty major
design departure from the s7 are you
excited do you want it let me know in
