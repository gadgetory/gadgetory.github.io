handy the Android authority app guy
picking out the right web browser can be
difficult there are a lot of options and
each option has its own set of unique
features so in this video we're gonna
check out some of the best web browsers
for Android first up is Baidu browser in
terms of looks it looks like what you'd
expect out of a browser you can have
window tabs or actual tabs at the top if
you prefer there is also a night mode
swipe navigation and a decent list of
tools and actions that you can perform
it's a solid browser with a pretty
decent performance we've also reviewed
both browser before and coming back to
play with it again left the same good
taste it did last time it has features
like add-ons and themes as well as a
built-in app store it's a solid browser
option that also has a paid option if
you need more features but the free one
is pretty good all on its own of course
we give the obligatory nod to the most
popular browser on Android and that's
Chrome browser it offers two rec syncing
with your desktop version by logging
into Google along with a competent
browsing experience it has some swipe
navigation an unlimited number of
browsing tabs and it is a very solid and
stable experience also if you're going
for the all Google experience this is
the browser you're gonna want Dolphin
Browser is another popular web browser
that has improved a bunch over the last
year and a half or so not only is the
processing faster but it has a lot of
features including add-ons gestures and
sonar sonar is that Beach a real dolphin
will use your voice to search the
internet kind of like Google Voice
Search it's unique and it even has
themes Firefox browser is one of the
most popular browsers on desktops and
predictably one of the best on Android
it doesn't have any real off-the-wall
features but it does provide a very
satisfying web browsing experience it
allows you to sync to your desktop
version of Firefox to obtain your
bookmarks and there are add-ons that you
can add as well
Maxthon Browser used to carry a little
flag because it was included as bundled
software on devices before but we assure
you it isn't bloatware Maxthon has a lot
of features and most of them are behind
the scenes leaving you with just the
browsing experience
there are add-on support and it is a
solid browsing experience
naked browser may look simple but it's
no joke it forgoes most of the features
you'd find in these other browsers in
favor of pure speed and the UI is very
minimal and it does load pages very
quickly and display them very well there
are no add-ons no bloat features or
anything else it just loads websites so
if you have an older device or simply
don't
any of that other stuff you should
definitely give naked browser a try
as with most browsers next browser
focuses on speed unlike many of these
browsers it does this quite well it also
boasts a small footprint so it's ideal
for older devices who want better
browsing without the more bloated
options there are add-on options if you
need them but overall this is a very
nice browser we've reviewed opera
browser a bunch of times and that's
because it's a really nice browser it
has all the features you'd expect in a
browser and a relatively quick browsing
experience there are themes and add-ons
as well as the speed dial and discover
features to help give you a more
entertaining browsing experience it's
definitely worth a shot
puffin browser is definitely the wild
card app on this list it works well
enough on its own as a web browser but
it has some unusual features for
instance there's a built-in trackpad and
a built-in gamepad during most of the
year you can only load Flash content
during 12 hours of the day and the other
12 hours of the day you have to deal
without it there are also add-ons if you
need those it's definitely an
interesting browser you see browser has
fairly impressive performance and based
on the sites that recommends when you
open it is targeted to people who are
not in the United States which is
actually quite refreshing and includes
some features like speed mode which
helps you browse even faster an auto
pager which loads multiple pages at once
so multi-page articles are easier to
read once again I'm Joe handy the
