kind of the brand by which all others
are measured when it comes to making
small things that also sound good
now with the Bose Soundlink 3 there's a
new kid on the Bluetooth block does it
push the envelope or does it just fit
inside let's find out there actually
isn't a whole lot here right out of the
box opening it up you'll find the Bose
Soundlink 3 speaker itself and a wall
charger we're also looking at a cover in
this review but that is sold separately
and that's it unlike the seventies
transistor radio design of its
predecessor the Soundlink 3 has a more
sleek rounded and somewhat more subdued
look the wraparound metal grille is nice
but it looks kind of like plastic even
though it isn't on top you'll find the
very simplistic silicon button panel
which protects the speaker from dirt and
dust the sound leg 3 has a solid weight
to it which isn't surprising given the
materials used here this has pros and
cons looking at the good the weight
keeps the speaker from sliding around on
your desk or table on the other hand if
you're carrying this around a lot you'll
probably start to feel it speaking of
carrying it around though the Soundlink
3 feels pretty solid the cover we saw
briefly before can be found in various
colors for about 35 bucks this isn't
going to make the speaker bulletproof
but it will help soak up a few shocks
and is definitely handy connectivity is
very simple with the sound length 3 turn
it on and it immediately starts
broadcasting so your Bluetooth device
can find and pair with it this was
always easy and quick in my testing if
you need to pair again just tap the
Bluetooth button on top and there you go
there is also a standard sized auxiliary
jack on the back of the speaker which
allows you to connect other devices just
tap the aux button on top and your
connected as with other Bose Bluetooth
speakers there is no speakerphone
functionality here
shouldn't be a problem for most of us
but if this is important to you it's
worth keeping in mind
Bose claims a battery life of up to 14
hours on the Soundlink 3 up from around
7 hours with its predecessor in my
testing they seem to be very close to
the mark here I left the speaker running
all day and it was still running after
about 12 hours when I shut it off three
hours is all it takes you to fully
charge it which isn't bad at all
considering what that charge gets you I
tested the Soundlink 3 using a wide
variety of musical styles including rock
hip-hop jazz Punk electronica metal and
solo acoustic guitar and held up very
well throughout all of them the low end
is pretty heavily emphasized here I
noticed that even songs that weren't
particularly bass heavy had more low-end
presence than I was used to hearing when
played through the Soundlink
this is likely a plus for most people
and you can always back off the bass
with your music players equalizer if you
want now this does affect the low mids
slightly as they can be overshadowed by
the upper low-end at times the rest of
the mid-range is solid but certainly
isn't height the mid-range isn't boxy
sounding and all either which is a
common problem in Bluetooth speakers the
high end is fairly crisp with nice
detail and no harsh sounding bumps in
the frequency range stereo spread is
never going to be very good in a speaker
this size and while bose pulls a few
tricks to make it sound a little wider
it still sounds almost mono the main
question people will have is this does
the Soundlink 3 sound better than the
Soundlink 2 the answer is yes absolutely
plus it gets much louder than the
Soundlink 2 without distorted you
probably want to hear it yourselves so
here you go
overall the Bose Soundlink 3 continues
the trend of being the Bluetooth speaker
to be that said it sells for 299 dollars
that's 300 bucks in real world speak and
not everybody is willing to shell that
much out for any speaker still if you do
make the purchase I doubt you'll regret
it and that is it for this one folks if
you want to know a few more details
