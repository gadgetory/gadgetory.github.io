a9 with a new edition that has a
metamorphic design and some average
specifications that are going to be
optimized for the overall experience
it's Josh the regard from Android
authority what's going on everybody and
this is our first look at the HTC One X
design has actually changed quite a bit
from the a 9 to the X 9 now while the
people did think that the HTC One a9 was
a bit of a let's say ripoff of the
iPhone the x9 is actually trying to move
a little bit forward from that design
aspect and now we have the metamorphic
design which basically means that there
are smooth edges in the metal design all
around and as HTT says it is supposed to
be showing us and giving us a feel of
the nature that is around us but still
when you're holding the phone in the
hand it is actually quite nice to feel
even with this 5.5 inch screen making it
a little bit larger than the
conventional thin the conventional phone
and a little bit tougher to handle in
one hand going from side to side and
from top to bottom but speaking of top
to bottom the boom sound speakers
actually return in the x9 and they are
as close to the edge on the top and
bottom as possible and they provide some
good sound as we were able to test it
just a little bit in the noisy room that
we were in but we do like the design of
these speakers and we are enjoying so
far how they look on the top in the
bottom now if you look on the bottom
there we actually have a return of the
capacitive keys as well as the x9 is
going to use as they said hardware keys
in order to navigate this version of
Android marshmallow a small flap on the
side actually a small flap on the side
means that you have expandable storage
available with a microSD card slot that
is easily accessible now taking a look
at the display it is a 5.5 inch Super
LCD capacitive touchscreen that comes in
at full HD 1080p resolution it does
provide the kind of colors that we've
expected from HTC's panels and at 5.5
inches it should be more than enough
canvas to have some fun getting
underneath the surface the 1x9 is
powered by three gigabytes of RAM and
comes with a mediatek helio x10
processor now this is not necessarily
got the ring of the Snapdragon to it but
that's perfectly fine because this more
affordable mid-range
affordable somewhat flagship device is
going to give the kind of performance
that should be just
right for Android 6.0 marshmallow and as
HTC has shown in the past already
especially with the 89 they are looking
to streamline the experience of their
Sense UI overall we already mentioned
the two main hardware features of the x9
including the two front facing speakers
that are powered by Dolby audio and the
expandable storage that said we can move
into the camera which is a 13 megapixel
shooter that is very similar to the one
from the a9 but
HTC did say that it is improved from the
a9 s performance and also continues what
the a9 started in better camera optics
for the one line by HTC taking a look at
the camera app it is still the same
interface that we've seen before from
HTC which is pretty easy to navigate by
swiping on the viewfinder to get to the
different modes and it is still a pretty
simple shooter until you get to the pro
mode or the or the manual mode rather in
order to change the settings in a more
finite way and finally in the software
we still have these Sense UI the version
that came in the 189 and it could be
quite familiar but we do like what we
see in sense in terms of it sort of
streamlining its overall design it still
has the blink feed over on the side
which is still nice to use in order to
get some quick headlines and from there
you still have the app drawer and
everything that you would expect from a
sense powered Android UI so the One X 9
was originally announced at the end of
last year and has been available in an
Asian market but here at MWC they are
announcing its availability here in
Europe but we were not able to get any
full concrete details on the pricing of
the One X 9 and you can stay tuned to
Android Authority for that information
as it comes along so keep it tuned to
Android 34 the One X 9 and even more
from HTC here at MWC 2016</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
