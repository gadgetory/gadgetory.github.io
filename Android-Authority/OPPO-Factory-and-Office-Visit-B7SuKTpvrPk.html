after the launch event in Beijing a
storm actually kept us from getting to
Shenzhen on time so a morning ride on a
plane and then on a bus through the very
damp conditions in Chen's and finally
brought us to the Opel Factory where
we're going to see not only the creation
process for their phones but also all of
the testing that goes into their quality
control but first however we did have to
have a little bit of a powwow but before
long at the front office we were able to
get going and get straight to the
factory in order to see all that goes
into the Oppo phones but first we did
have to Don some pretty interesting garb
but before we even got in maybe just for
safety's sake but then again everybody
in the offices were actually wearing
Garbus our first stop was the SMT
manufacturing centre now what that
basically means is that processing
packages and all of the bits and pieces
that go into the actual processes of the
phones were created here and then tested
through rigorous routines in order to
make sure that they had high fidelity
now a quick history lesson told us that
this particular portion of the factory
originally was set to opus blu-ray
players so all of the different circuits
and the processors that went into their
blu-ray players were put here but of
course as the evolution went with oboe
it eventually went on to cell phones and
smartphones a lot of which were on
display at the beginning of this
particular portion of the tour the
sights and sounds to a factory like this
are probably what you would expect you
have dozens and dozens of people in just
this one room in hundreds and hundreds
inside the entire factory itself with
lights accompanying them and the
whirring and the sounds of the machines
that are really sort of the soundtrack
behind what is ultimately the creation
and the testing of a phone and now we
did look at the process of creating a
processor for one of these phones the r7
in particular and you can see the the
board's right here that are created in
different batches and not only are they
put inside different machines in order
to create the little bits and pieces
that are then melded onto the boards but
they are also tested later on to ensure
their quality in a number of different
can
this particular machine will not only
meld all of the pieces together in a
very high temperature heat but then
later on they will be put into a
computer and be tested for all the tiny
little parts to make sure that they are
working properly what we give OPA a lot
of credit for and as we were able to see
firsthand is the fact that elbow really
creates everything themselves in their
own factories they don't really
outsource pretty much any part of the
phone to another ODM or anything like
that but of course in an office like
this you have people not just working in
factories just like the one you just saw
but of course there are designers and a
lot of logistics going on on the
business side of things and offices such
as this that we didn't necessarily get
to see but here is where we got to the
Quality Control section and what you
just saw this person do is put some r7s
inside of this tumbler and essentially
this tumbler will rotate a lot of times
in just one hour
in order to test its structural
capabilities and even over here just
past it was a small 2-inch ish test in
order to see just how the phone would
fare in very tiny drops and even this
machine that keeps pressing the buttons
for 42,000 times a day to make sure that
they are going to last for the entirety
of their lifetime this particular one is
just a pressing test in order to see if
under some pressure the phone is not
going to cave or do get any dents or
anything like that and of course a big
old drop test machine that we got to see
a number of times here is a look at the
temperature and various conditions
testing from sub-zero temperatures to
super high temperatures they put these
phones in a bunch of different machines
in order to test whether or not they
will still be operable and all the
phones are seeing in this particular VAT
are actually on and performing one app
in order to see if they would continue
to do so even under all of these extreme
cold or hot conditions but of course
there are times when you just can't get
past good old human based tests but it
was at that point that we were able to
sit down have a drink or two and just
sort of rest up for what would become
our interview with three particular
people from the Opel line pure image
color OS and of course VOC charging
the software of the camera actually now
the design that interface is getting
simpler so it's easier for our users to
choose among different options and with
their latest TI pure imaging they are
offering more professional plug-ins for
the new service to choose so their hope
is that their users can enjoy the fun of
the universe under different scenarios
and on the following day our final visit
with Oppo was at their offices where we
met with a lot of our friends from OBO
either from the PR side of things to the
website side of things to even the
social media side of oboes campaigns and
of course they are celebrating their
ten-year anniversary so you see the
number 10 everywhere but it was in these
offices which was actually pretty green
and really high up on the building that
we really saw where the magic kind of
happens where the phones are created at
the factory this is where they are put
out into the world not only via a media
presence but also in all the different
ways that helpful wants to present it
even with their mascot oli who of which
they had a full costume available
including this huge head that one of our
friend Sean from oppa was happy to Don
but really it's an office setting where
everyone is working together in order to
create an image of Oppo that comes out
to not only all of you guys but also
through us and then the contacts with
people like us here at Andhra thority
their office was pretty incredible
actually considering it was near the top
of a building and it really included
things like break rooms and views of the
entire shenzhen city and Hong Kong WA
which is right across the river Bay and
really it was here that we got to just
sort of hang out with Oppo and after
everything that they were able to show
us at the launch and at the factories we
were happy to be here despite some of
the weather conditions so we want to
give one last thanks to our friends over
at Opel for allowing us to come by and
to basically see their workplaces
whether it was the factory or even the
office but don't remember for all of you
guys we just wanted to give you this
sort of glimpse into the inner workings
of a company like Oppo but we do still
have our content from the launch events
with the r7 and the r7 plus and you can
see them right over on the side in the
corner there and you'll be able to see
our first looks for those until then
keep it tuned to Android authority for
our full reviews of those and more and
make sure you keep it tuned here because
we are your source for all things
