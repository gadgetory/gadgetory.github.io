authority what's going on everybody and
we're over here at Hyundai once again
not at was it showstoppers are pepper
calm that we met it wasn't it was at pep
calm yeah we're on pep calm anymore
we're actually on the floor here at CES
2015 the huge Hyundai booth right over
here in the North Hall and I'm here with
my good buddy Rob great to see you again
man and we're gonna get a demonstration
from him about Android auto so you can
give us a just sort of a quick rundown
well how Android auto just sort of it
fits into the preliminary like driving
experience at the very least right so
you know there's a lot of people that
want to just use their their Android
experience in the car so we're providing
a way working with Google to project
that experience through their Android
auto auto right so we have software on
our head units you plug in your USB
cable and you get that Android
experience in your head unit you can use
your steering wheel controls your
buttons in the car to move tracks or
raise the volume and lower it you know
voice prompts through the steering wheel
voice button so very seamless
integration so we're really proud of our
work with that awesome all right well
let's take a look at the actual unit
itself what the best part is I least for
me right now is we don't have to be in a
car in order to see it we have these
lovely chamber units right here that are
going to give us an easy way of looking
at what Android auto would look like so
let's take a look all right so we're
what we're looking at here is our new
display audio system we just announced
recently and what we've done with this
system is remove the CD player remove
the built-in navigation and really just
give provide a screen for Android auto
users so people have Android phones can
easily just plug in their phone and here
we have a nexus 5 and just plug it into
our USB port 6 sec and android auto
comes up you can easily just navigate
right into it and now your you start off
in like a very google now like
experience where you have these cards
based on some of the things you do and
you have these shortcuts like google
maps
built right in
and you you can input things via voice
so
navigate to the MGM Grand
so just you know like on your song it
takes voice prompts you can also use the
steering wheel button we've got this
here to simulate what a steering wheel
button would do
I've got phone call phone at menu so
while you're in other modes of Android
auto it'll still give you the navigation
prompts on the top here so here's some
of the calls we made voicemail we've
used it dialed most of your voicemail
speed dial
and music is so this is on iHeartRadio
but let's say you have google play music
you can easily just switch to different
apps that are set up for Android auto
and each app has its own color scheme so
this layouts the same for any of the
music apps but the color scheme may be
different depending on what the branding
is or something like iHeartRadio you'll
see it uses more red you know following
their branding guidelines but also
there'll be different buttons relevant
to that app like you know favorite but
on Google Play Music you may have a
thumb up or come down button and in this
menu here is reserved for called car
apps so you may see like a blue link app
later on but you currently use this just
go back to our home screen but the nice
thing about our integration with Android
auto it's actually very seamless and
tied deeply in where let's say you're in
here and you're you know listening to
the radio or you know FM you can still
be navigating with Google Maps in the
background it'll actually just send you
the prompts right through it all runs
together so it's not like a separate
mode that the head units in it's
actually operating concurrently and
likewise you could be listening to music
out of out of your Android auto
experience while navigating or doing
something else in the head unit
so if we go back to home you can easily
just dive right back into Android auto
who won the World Series in 2013
the Boston Red Sox won the World Series
in 2013 so just like you normally
interact with your Android phone through
Google now and some other things in this
it's just like it's right this is all
running off your phone being projected
onto the our display audio system quick
question we just saw the demonstration
of Android auto that question that you
used about the world series in 2013 has
I've been the question you've been using
this whole time actually it has but I
also have been texting people and
calling people so we have a variety of
things that we do just to show that this
is the same experience that that you're
used to on your phone it's just when you
ask that question I in my head I thought
he's been asking that all the time to
this thing all right well Android auto
looks like it's going to have a great
integration with the Hyundai cars I
almost said it's not it but they're
gonna get inside a little bit but also
the integration with say blue link and
whatnot really will make this a robust
system we talked a little bit earlier
with one of your colleagues about sort
of the hierarchy of the different types
of radio units or center console units
and Android auto has a very important
place in the middle of that can you give
us can kind of elaborate for us what it
means to have Android auto in that
ecosystem yeah so we want to give our
customers freedom of choice right they
have whether they have an iPhone we have
carplay Android auto through Android
phones and also our native navigation
systems so we're not choosing one or the
other we're giving all the options to
our owners with the system like what we
saw now display audio that doesn't come
with integrated navigation or or CD
player it brings the price point down so
that Android auto is not tied to a
premium audio system that typically is
bundled with like an infinity audio
system integrated navigation on an SD
card those add cost by being able to
make this a more entry level system we
see this being standard on our most
premium models but also available on our
more entry-level models is like a
mid-grade system so we're gonna bring
Android auto basic to like most of our
customers through this go ahead
just out of curiosity that that top-tier
unit that you are talking about what
exactly does that want to entail if
Android auto is somewhat lower on the
hierarchy yeah so that comes with
integrated navigation through here or
navteq you know previously so there are
some things you know if you don't have
cell service unless you're running
offline mode on Google Maps you're gonna
be out of luck right so there's still
that reliability of integrated
navigation plus you get CD player so we
don't want CD players still also
Infinity audio that we offer in the
Sonata or a high-end audio and other
systems too tall bump together so
they're still that about 30% of our cars
are premium audio right so we see this
being more than the majority of what we
sell being like more of a core systems
our display audio where it's more
accessible at a much lower price point
than our being a bundled premium package
that's great being able to have
something as awesome as Android auto or
even just an upgrade from your let's say
crappy car unit can be just a big game
changer for a lot of drivers out there
well Rob thank you for the demonstration
it's always good to see man thank you so
much this is Android authority reporting
to you live from the Hyundai booth here
at CES 2015 make sure you stay tuned for
the rest of our coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
