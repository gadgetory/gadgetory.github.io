authority what's going on everybody and
we're over here at Hyundai once again
not at was it show stoppers or pep calm
that we made it was it was at Pep calm
yeah we're on pep calm anymore we're
actually on the floor here at CES 2015
the huge Hyundai booth right over here
in the north hall and I'm here with my
good buddy Rob great to see you again
man and we're going to get a
demonstration from him about Android
auto so you can give us a just sort of a
quick rundown well how Android auto just
sort of it fits into the preliminary
like driving experience at the very
least right so you know there's a lot of
people that want to just use their their
Android experience in the car so we're
providing a way working with Google to
project that experience through through
Android auto right so we have software
on our head units you plug in your USB
cable and you get that Android
experience in your head unit you can use
your steering wheel controls your
buttons in the car to move tracks raise
the volume and lower it you know voice
prompts through the steering wheel voice
button so very seamless integration so
we're really proud of our work with that
awesome alright well let's take a look
at the actual unit itself what the best
part is at least for me right now is we
don't have to be in a car in order to
see it we have these lovely chamber
units right here that are going to give
us an easy way of looking at what
Android auto would look like so let's
take a look alright so we're what we're
looking at here is our new display audio
system we just announced recently and
what we've done with this system is
remove the CD player remove the built-in
navigation and really just give provide
a screen for Android auto users so
people have android phones can easily
just plug in their phone here we have a
nexus 5 I just plug it into our USB port
tix a sec and Android auto comes up you
can easily just navigate right into it
and now you're you start off in like a
very Google now like experience where
you have these cards based on some of
the things you do and you have these
shortcuts like Google Maps
built right in
and you you can input things via voice
so navigate to the MGM Grand
so just you know like on your phone it
takes voice prompts you can also use the
steering wheel button we've got this
here to simulate what a steering wheel
button would do
got phone call phone menu so while
you're in other modes of Android auto it
will still give you the navigation
prompts on the top here so here's some
of the calls we made voicemail who use
it dialed your voicemail speed dial
and music is so this is on iheartradio
but let's say you have google play music
you can easily just switch to different
apps that are set up for android auto
and each app has its own color scheme so
this layouts the same for any of the
music apps but the color scheme may be
different depending on what the branding
is there something like iHeartRadio
you'll see it uses more red you know
fall under branding guidelines but also
there will be different buttons relevant
to that act like you know favorite but
on google play music you may have a
thumb up or come down button and in this
menu here is reserved for cult car apps
so you may see like a blue link app
later on but you currently use this just
go back to our home screen but the nice
thing about our integration with android
auto it's actually very seamless and
tied deeply in where let's say you're in
here and you're you know listening to
the radio or you know FM you can still
be navigating with google maps in the
background it'll actually just send you
the prompts right through it all runs
together so it's not like a separate
mode that the head units in its actually
operating concurrently and likewise you
could be listening to music out of out
of your android auto experience while
navigating or doing something else in
the head unit so if we go back to home
you can easily just dive right back into
Android auto
who won the World Series in 2013
the boston red sox won the world series
in 2013 so just like you'd normally
interact with your android phone through
google now and some other things in this
it's just like it's running this is all
running off your phone being projected
onto the art display audio system a
quick question we just saw the
demonstration of android auto that
question that you used about the World
Series in 2013 has that has I've been
the question you've been using this
whole time actually it has also have
been texting people and calling people
so we have a variety of things that we
do just to show that this is the same
experience that that you're used to on
your phone it's just when you ask I
question in my head I thought he's been
asking that all the time to this thing
all right well Android auto looks like
it's going to have a great integration
with the hyundai cars i almost said
sonata but look again side a little bit
but also the integration with a blue
link and what not really will make this
a robust system we talked a little bit
earlier with one of your colleagues
about sort of the hierarchy of the
different types of radio units or center
console units and android author has a
very important place in the middle of
that can give us can kind of elaborate
for us what it means to have android
auto in that ecosystem yeah so we want
to give our customers freedom of choice
right they have whether they have an
iphone we have car play android auto
through android phones and also our
native navigation systems so we're not
choosing one or the other we're giving
all the options to our owners with the
system like what we saw now display
audio that doesn't come with integrated
navigation or or CD player it brings the
price point down so that android auto is
not tied to a premium audio system that
typically is bundled with like an
infinity audio system and integrated
navigation on SD card those add cost by
being able to make this a more
entry-level system we see this being
standard our most premium models but
also available on our more entry-level
models is like a mid grade system so
we're going to bring android auto basic
to like most of our customers through
this go ahead
just out of curiosity that that top tier
unit that you are talking about what
exactly does that one entail if android
auto is somewhat lower on the hierarchy
yeah so that comes with integrated
navigation through here or navteq you
know previously so there are some things
you know if you don't have cell service
unless you're running offline mode on on
google maps you're going to be out of
luck right so there's still that
reliability of integrated navigation
plus you get CD player so we want CD
player still also infinity audio that we
offer in the sonata or a high-end audio
and other systems it's all bunk together
so they're still that about thirty
percent of our cars are premium audio
right so we see this being more than the
majority of what we sell being like more
of a core systems our display audio
where it's more accessible at a much
lower price point than our being a
bundled premium package that's great
being able to have something as awesome
as Android auto or even just an upgrade
from your let's say crappy the car unit
can be just a big game changer for a lot
of drivers out there well Rob thank you
for the demonstration it's always good
to see man thank you so much this is
