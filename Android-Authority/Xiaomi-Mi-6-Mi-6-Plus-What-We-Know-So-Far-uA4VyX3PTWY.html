like the latest and greatest device but
a lot more people just want the best
bang for your buck option and Xiaomi is
gunning for you with the me six and the
me six plus I'm hoping Shelli has
confirmed that the me six will be
launched on April 19th in Beijing Xiaomi
made the announcement in its own forums
however it mysteriously made no mention
of the me six plus it remains to be seen
whether that will launch simultaneously
now shell may also didn't make it clear
when the actual release date will be but
that should be pretty clear in the next
few weeks now we have a pretty good idea
of what to expect with the v6 and me six
plus because of the rundown that was
posted by slash leaks let's start with
the processor we initially expected that
the me six and me six plus will be
powered by a Snapdragon 820 one assuming
that Xiaomi couldn't get its hands on
Qualcomm latest Snapdragon 835 chipset
due to supply shortages now it looks
like both devices will feature the
Snapdragon 835 processor aside from the
me six model with the smallest internal
storage space of 32 gigabytes now this
could be why Xiaomi didn't announce the
devices at the Mobile World Congress
they may have wanted to wait until they
could secure the latest chipset the
smaller of the two devices the me six is
rumored to feature a five point one five
inch display with Full HD resolution
four or six gigabytes of RAM and offer
three storage options 32 64 128
gigabytes it's believed to house a 19
megapixel camera on the back with Sony's
MX 400 sensor and an 8 megapixel selfie
snapper on the front it could also sport
a 3200 milliamp hour battery
dual SIM support and a fingerprint
scanner additionally it's expected to
run Android 6.0 marshmallow with the
company's user interface on top those of
you looking for a bigger smartphone
might be more interested in the new 6
plus though the device is rumored to
come with a 5.7 inch 1080p screen and be
available in two storage options 64 or
128 gigabytes of space both of which
come with 6 gigabytes of RAM this device
may also appeal to those who would love
taking photos
phablet may sport a real dual camera
setup with 12 megapixels sony AMX 362
sensors and an 8 megapixel selfie
snapper on the front now the shell Meeny
6 plus is said to come with a bigger
4,500 million power battery as well as
dual-sim capabilities but strangely said
to run a newer version of Android and MV
6 according to the spec sheet it will
ship with Android 7.0 M you get onboard
which is kind of weird considering that
we expected both devices to be announced
at the same time perhaps the me 6 plus
will follow later now from a marketing
perspective that may be a good thing
because you capture two news cycles if
you have two separate launch dates so
want to see now at the beginning of
January the first pics claiming to show
the Xiaomi me 6 have appeared online on
my drivers comm the device in the image
looks quite different from the me 5
especially the back which is why it
initially was believed that Xiaomi would
opt for a different design language
altogether however more images and
renders have leaked since then and they
tell us quite a different story if you
take a closer look at one of the renders
of the devices which was posted on Weibo
you can see that aside from the dual
camera setup it looks more or less like
its predecessor it has a home button on
the front small bezels on the sides of
the screen and a curved back that should
make the device a little better in the
hand now we've come across additional
photos and we assume that the device
shown here is the me 6 plus as the
features show two cameras on the back
just like the me 5x sports a-class back
which contradicts some rumors claiming
that Xiaomi might opt for a metal design
this year however there is a chance the
Chinese manufacturer will announce a
ceramic addition of one or maybe even
both smartphones as it did in 2016 with
the me 5 pro version now rather than
listing out all the different prices for
all the other variant options you should
really check with the link below where
you can go into detail and look at the
article but tell me what you guys think
I mean bang for your buck wise this is
looking really really good xiaomi is
killing it in this area and I especially
like that they made a five point one
five inch variant not a massive phone
for people with normal sized hands let
me know what you think in the comments
