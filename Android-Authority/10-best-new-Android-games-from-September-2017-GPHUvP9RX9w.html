handy the Android authority app guy and
it's about that time of the month to
round up the best new Android games that
were released in September of 2017 if
you want to check out any of these games
for yourself you can find those links in
the video description below
codecs of victory is a new strategy game
it combines several strategy elements
and that includes Kingdom building as
well as turn-based combat you build your
base upgrade your various units and then
do combat with the bad guys the
developers boast a 20 hour storyline
over 25 units to unlock and upgrade and
randomly generated levels that makes
each playthrough just a little bit
different the game runs for four dollars
and 49 cents with no in-app purchases or
advertisements don't starve shipwrecked
is the latest game in the survival
franchise it plays a lot like its
predecessor your goal is to survive for
as long as possible that includes
finding food building shelter protecting
yourself from the elements and also
other bad things you can even build a
boat and explore the waters around you
if you want to the game is currently in
beta and that means there are some bugs
otherwise it's a pretty decent
experience Gemini is a new atmospheric
puzzle game it came out on other
platforms a few years ago and the game
is now finally on Android you play as a
star and the player finds a second star
and together you do a bunch of random
stuff it has various elements including
puzzle runner and others the mechanics
are relatively simple and you shouldn't
have any problems playing the game it
currently runs for a dollar ninety-nine
with no in-app purchases or ads iron
marines is the latest tower defense game
from Ironhide game studio who also did
the popular Kingdom rush franchise this
game takes place on multiple planets and
it features 14 campaign missions along
with 10 additional challenge missions
there are a variety of towers and bad
guys along with heroes upgrades and a
lot more the game is just as good as
we'd expect it does run $4.99 with
in-app purchases and that may be the
only part we don't like so much life on
Mars remake is obviously a remake it's a
Metroid style adventure game that's been
ported up to mobile phones you explore
the world of farms find upgrades for
your suit and figure out what happened
at the now abandoned Research Station
the
lepers have promised Bluetooth
controller support in future updates
that will be crate because the on-screen
controls can be a little bit wonky it's
a fun little old-school title and it
runs for a dollar ninety-nine with no
in-app purchases or advertisements
little alchemy - is a new puzzle game
the game gives you some materials to
start with you combine those materials
in order to create new things and then
you use those things to create other
things there is a large library of
craftable items each one has its own
little flavor text as well the game
includes hints stats and a recipe book
filled with all of the stuff that you've
made it's also relatively inexpensive
and kid-friendly storm bound kingdom
wars is another new strategy game this
one includes card collecting mechanics
you get the cards you use them in battle
and then try to defeat your opponents
the mechanics aren't difficult to learn
and it also has that indie mobile game
look in terms of graphics and sound the
game comes with a single-player and
multiplayer option a bunch of cars to
collect and a whole lot more this one is
a freemium game for what it's worth
Terra battle 2 is the latest game from
Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi
it follows in the footsteps of the first
one with many different improvements
this one features a deeper and more
prominent storyline than the first Terra
battle in addition the unique puzzle
style battle system is slightly improved
from the first game this one is having a
few control issues at the moment along
with a few bugs
however we assume that fixes are coming
sooner rather than later and it should
be pretty decent once it's all patched
up The Walking Dead march to war is a
new strategy builder your goal is to
build up your defenses from the horde
and other players it features cameos
from the series and the storyline
follows the march to war storyline from
the comics in practice the game plays
like almost every other mobile strategy
game you build stuff you upgrade stuff
and then you take on other players in
PvP it's not really that unique and it
also has several issues and bugs but do
keep it on your radar because it could
be good some day world of Brandes isn't
technically a new game it's a port of a
much older game from other platforms
it's an MMORPG that boasts a whole lot
of content that includes three races six
classes and two regions for exploring it
also comes with PvP over 4000 monsters
and a guild system the game is still in
beta and that means there are bugs
however it seems to be close to a final
release we suspect the final rule
we'll add in app purchases until then
though the application is free to
download and play and that about does it
for this one folks don't forget to hit
subscribe and ring the bell to get the
latest android authority videos as soon
as they come out also all of these games
