Android authority and Huawei is making
quite the splash with its latest
offering it's a really big phone with
some pretty nice specs actually and a
very affordable price tag let's go ahead
and take a look at the huawei ascend
mate - wow way doesn't have a huge
presence in the US when it comes to
smartphones but they're looking to
change that with the ascend mate - and
starting with the design the ascend mate
- is essentially just a rectangular slab
with some slightly rounded corners and a
tapered back it's a pretty simple design
nothing too unique about it but it is a
pretty good-looking phone for as simple
as it is the dark grey band along the
sides may look like metal but the phone
is entirely made of plastic and the
removable back has a nice texture to it
so the phone is very grippy and easy to
hold onto and speaking of the removable
back taking the back off will give you
access to your sim and microSD card
slots but the battery however is
completely sealed in so you're not gonna
be able to swap batteries here even
though it's made of plastic it feels
extremely solid in the hand it doesn't
bend or creak so I had no problems at
all with this phone when it comes to the
build quality taking a tour around the
ascend mate - you'll find the 3.5
milimeter headset jack up top micro USB
port on the bottom nothing on the left
and you're very conveniently placed
power and volume keys on the right and I
say conveniently because the ascend mate
2 is a really big phone so having the
power and volume keys on the side make a
world of a difference when it comes to
the handling of this phone I'm not
saying the ascend mate - is a one-handed
device by any stretch of the imagination
but the side Mountain Keys does make
one-handed experience a little bit more
manageable the single speaker is located
on the back towards the bottom and
obviously if you've got your phone
facing upwards you're going to get
muffled audio but for what it is the
sound quality is acceptable but it
certainly isn't going to win any awards
now the biggest reason why this phone is
so large is because of that 6.1 inch
display on the front and that's pretty
much all there is on the front there's
no capacitive or physical keys because
Huawei opted for on-screen keys
it is 720p but honestly I still think
720p is a very respectable resolution
when it comes to displays on smartphones
since the resolution is being stretched
across a 6.1 inch screen I do notice
pixels in some of the finer details like
the folders but it's nothing that really
bothered me too much and for the most
part it's a really good-looking display
it's very bright
viewing angles are good and it's got
really nice and punchy colors and
because this display is so big it's
really enjoyable for watching videos and
playing games even if it is only 720p I
still find this to be a really nice
looking display overall when it comes to
performance the ascend mate 2 is being
powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400
clocked at 1.6 gigahertz the audrina 305
GPU and 2 gigs of ram which I was really
surprised about because most mid-range
phones in this price range usually
shipped with only one to one and a half
gigs of RAM the rest of the specs are
pretty much on par with other mid-range
phones but in regular everyday usage I
didn't have any issues with performance
whether it was swiping through home
screens opening and closing apps or
multitasking everything ran just fine
without any hiccups at all gaming was
also solid I was able to play pretty
much anything without any sort of
noticeable lag or dropped frames so
overall I was pleasantly surprised and
its phones like the ascend mate to that
go to show that you don't always have to
have the latest and greatest specs to
have a phone that performs well on the
back of the ascend mate 2 is a 13
megapixel camera so it sounds like it's
going to be a relatively decent shooter
at least on paper but let's talk about
the camera UI first and it's actually
very minimal you won't find too much
going on here but you've got your usual
settings like ISO white balance exposure
etc and a few shooting modes that you
can play around with but nothing out of
the ordinary with 13 megapixels pictures
are very sharp and detailed but overall
picture quality is just average at best
color reproduction is decent but I
noticed that this camera always has the
tendency to overexpose with pretty much
every single photo that I took leading
to a lot of very unbalanced shots it
does have an aperture of f28 ovo so
low-light photography certainly is
possible and it's probably one of the
better cameras that I've used when it
comes to low-light now I usually don't
talk about front-facing cameras because
most of the time they are really basic
but the front-facing camera on the
ascend mate 2 is a 5 megapixel
wide-angle lens so it's great for taking
some high-quality selfies and Huawei is
capitalizing on the selfie craze with
their own feature called group V if you
can't figure out what it is by the name
essentially a group V is a selfie but
with a group of people it's not anything
groundbreaking by any means it's
basically just a panorama shot with the
front camera but I did find it to be a
feature that made the front camera a lot
of fun to use the ascend mate 2 is a big
phone and with a big phone comes a very
large 3900 milliamp hour battery this is
basically a small tablet battery inside
of a smartphone and this phone pretty
much lasts forever I was able to easily
get at least 2 days out of it before
having to recharge and I got over 8
hours of screen on time which is just
ridiculous for a phone and I can easily
say that this is the best battery life
that I've ever experienced on any
smartphone and finally onto the software
and the ascend mate 2 is running Android
4.3 jelly bean which is kind of
unfortunate hopefully this is a device
that Huawei will feel compelled to keep
updated but we're just gonna have to
wait and see on that on top of Android
4.3 is flyways emotion UI and it's quite
the departure from your typical Android
experience there is no app drawer so
everything lives on your home screen so
you'll have to use folders if you want
to keep things clean by default the
emotion UI is very bright and colorful
but if that's not your style you can
change that through the built-in theme
app to something more scaled-back
there's also an easy mode with very big
colorful and easy to read shortcuts if
you want a more simplified experience
another notable feature is the Wow
button or window on window give you
access to standard Android soft keys and
the ability to run a limited amount of
apps on a screen at the same time
overall while the emotion UI does stray
from stock Android quite a bit and most
likely won't be for everyone the
features that it brings to the table are
actually useful without being gimmicky
now besides the great battery life and
the large display the best part about
this phone is the price it's available
now for $300 directly from Huawei and
that's without a contract and it
supports 4G LTE on carriers like AT&amp;amp;T
and t-mobile in the United States and
that is not by accident Huawei is
actually targeting this phone towards
the u.s. market so they built it with US
carriers in mind so there you have it
for the huawei ascend mate 2 for $300 I
think it's a fantastic phone obviously
there are other great phones out there
in this particular price range but
you're not gonna find another phone like
this with a display this large and a
gigantic battery that lasts forever for
only $300 it's a big phone with a small
price and if that's exactly what you're
looking for the ascend mate 2 is
definitely worth a look but that is it
