original android hangout show on google+
I'm Derek Ross time scott henderson and
we are joined by johnathan franklin and
daniel Charlton thank you guys for
joining us as usual great to have you
here must be here alright so so this
week on the show we have a lot to talk
about we're talk about the Android
ecosystem and how it's doing really well
in China we're gonna go over a bunch of
app updates as we all know android 4.2
came out a bunch of apps have to be
updated for compatibility there's a
whole bunch of device updates this week
apparently a whole bunch of nexuses were
sold and then sold out under root and
ramen while we're going to talk about
some cyanogenmod drama but it's been
resolved unfortunately that had to
happen uh we're gonna go over our nexus
4 giveaway we're gonna give a special
code away so stay tuned to later in the
show and for carrier news and OEM news
later on the show and talk about how
carriers are pretty much l teeing all
the things right now it last but not
least trying to talk about patent wars
and how HTC and app will have come to
some sort of agreement interesting and
so as I said we're talking about the
Android ecosystem real quick so
apparently in China Android is huge over
ninety percent market share that's crazy
so pretty much China and Android are a
match made in heaven android is kicking
ass in China um and there don't bury
well elsewhere in the world to right now
Android accounts for nearly three out of
four smartphone sales globally and in
quarter three so I mean we knew already
knew that we knew that it was huge but
you know 75% of all smartphone sales and
23 we're Android mm-hmm that's pretty
significant I mean well the iphone 5 ml
is apple tree you know i think when you
look at markets like China where Apple
had a late start one of the biggest
things that holds people back from going
to Android or other platforms as though
I've bought so many applications on this
ecosystem about so many applications
through itunes they'll have that you
know holding them back or anything
because they're you know android kind of
caught up to iOS by the time that Apple
even got a phone over there so yeah they
have no justification whatsoever to lock
themselves down to that ecosystem yeah
no I mean 75% globally is still huge
it's more than utah more than three
times what apple's share is it's just it
is crushing it though this is something
we know we know androids dominating yeah
that's why this is the android authority
hangout show and not the the iOS
authority handle or the android ketchup
show yeah ketchup alright so so Scott we
said a whole bunch of apps got updated
this week yeah first like I want to
start off um google released a lot of f
updates this week and i'm getting sick
and tired of just seeing in the what's
new bug fixes or improvements I want
them to elaborate just a little bit as
to what they fixed what they improved
I'd be I'd be very curious to know that
I mean wouldn't you guys want to see a
more in-depth what's new a changelog you
know I mean it's been common practice
for a while now especially like for
Google+ which it was updated which'll
you'll get to to update it and then to
have the same damn change log for the
past like for updates like I mean I
understand if it's a bug fix if it is
say it's a bug fix you know but but
still I we don't need to have you know
major new features every single time but
it is nice to at least know what was
what was done exactly Todd okay so let's
start off with one that hasn't been
updated for a long time and that's
google voice the upgrade to android for
that to basically had some issues with
google voice and had some force closes
and basically the update for me is still
running for dot one dot to seems a lot
faster also it does work on my
seven which is not force closing and
it's working beautifully this is a nap I
think that they need to update way more
often what was the last time you they
updated it was he gone I think when it
got hollow there was a marshal it was
during ICS so it at ICS compatibility
and now they just updated for jellybean
I think that's a ridiculous amount of
time but if you with it with it this
still has some issues that need to work
out to it's it's a compared to gmail and
say you know messenger from Google+ or
gtalk it's really a very slow laggy app
the even being a little bit faster than
it used to be that's not saying a lot
because it runs pretty terribly yeah
yeah it's a very glitchy app yeah I
think that is going to cash a lot more
data and then be less glitchy but you
know whatever okay so let's move on to
google play books bug fixes Google Play
magazines minor fixes Google+ basically
at the same changelog as before as
derecho stating i personally am having a
problem with just opening up google+ and
going into the stream and it not
refreshing for me and when i try to
refresh then it doesn't show anything it
just doesn't refresh but would I back
out of the app then it notifies me that
it's been updated its yeah I have that
happen from time to time it's pretty
annoying yeah it is um they still not
fixed that so my google on the nova
launcher got a four dot to compatibility
same with Apex Launcher and in not a
really android app update but kind of a
Google+ integration update you can
one-click install android apps through
google plus links which is very
convenient and a nice it's more than
just apps you can do music you know as
well I assume you can probably do books
and magazines I haven't tried it but
I've done it with with music and
probably maybe you can even do it with
movies too you just take it you take the
URL yeah yeah so you're the Play Store
on the one the web and you take the URL
for set appt piece of music whatever and
then you
and paste that into a Google+ post as
soon as you paste it in there it comes
up with a nice pretty little google play
you know click here to install click
here to buy click here to listen you
know whatever link it's really nice uh
it's I'll tell you what it's going to do
it's going to drastically increase app
today's music sales you know it app
installs whatever I mean the fact you
can easily share that and you in it in
everybody's stream they get a big fat
install here button or a big fat by here
button I think it's going to increase in
sales that's great and that's great for
you know people have content on Play
Store yeah and i think that uh you know
they're pushing so hard for Google+ to
be a platform and if it becomes the
central platform of you know social on
the web if that ever happens then it's
definitely going to increase a lot of
stuff but they still haven't given us
really a search function or a filter
function for what kind of posts so if
you want to see all the apps that your
friends or people that you circled share
that'd be kind of cool um okay let's
move on to box for android you have the
ability now to download entire folders
for offline viewing that's very nice
something that was limited in that app
you also have an in-app file editor
which is nice and then also ask astro
file manager got updated given image
viewer and you also have SkyDrive
support like a lot of these lockers data
lockers or sinkers are getting SkyDrive
support work I think they're realizing
that a lot of people do have windows and
it will be soon one of the big players
which is exciting yeah it's not just
windows microsoft especially with office
2013 is making SkyDrive very essential
to businesses now so it's for you know a
lot of people in enterprise are going to
need to have SkyDrive access yeah and
speaking of you know lockers in the
cloud on dropbox hit 100 million users
yeah which that is a great milestone and
i think that all these other companies
are you know trying to innovate and
trying to help better ideas in order to
get more subscribers and more people
that use their service because ideally
they want your data yeah um
then Google's blogger for Android a very
big update a lot of user experience type
stuff it is now hollow themed and just a
lot of bug fixes and stuff gmail search
improvements you can search by file size
and but I don't know if that's for the
Android version is it that's desktop
yeah that's desktop that's the actual
website no but that's pretty cool it's
all related yeah that's a good update to
talk about yeah like it also in the
Android app because I saw several
several places that were reporting on it
we're showing off like during the search
on an errand it might be a universal
search function yeah yeah okay that make
sense yeah like it's to the gmail
back-end like the app just magically it
doesn't now because they change the way
search functions that's very cool very
good to know dare we say it just works
yes I up and then uh now that we're
continuing on with apps the google apps
for iOS is rumored it's rumored in beta
testing this will be exciting to see
what they offer iOS users if it's a
fully baked type of service as opposed
to kind of a have big thing that they
did initially and then Apple got angry
about and then they decided to do their
own thing but I'm excited to see what
they've been missing out on and I'm
excited for them to see um you know what
the advantages are of having a Universal
navigation type thing for my turn I
Derek device updates yes so apparently
the HTC evo 4g LTE I love that device
you notice a mouthful to say um barely
it's getting jelly diverse and it's not
getting uh you know the the new jelly
bean 4.2 obviously it's it's just going
to rock the old 4.11 for now but that
looks like it's gonna be rolling out
here very shortly if not already and
other HTC devices uh made some headlines
this week the HTC droid DNA was
officially unveiled on Tuesday the same
day as a bunch of other devices a
in my opinion that was bad other people
think that that was good they're playing
off of the launch but that's that's
besides the point we'll get to that
later and the droid DNA has an
international cousin we found out about
today the HTC deluxe or the HTC DLX
which sometimes is referred to as the
HTC d lowercase L X the HTC di X you
know what do we really don't know what
what it uh was referred to in the past
some call it the HTC dicks I'm called
the HTC deluxe whatever so apparently
it's finalized as the HTC deluxe for the
international crowd cool um a little bit
about the the DNA and we'll get to this
one under root and ramen but it looks
like the right now the DNA can be
unlocked at least the demo models that
people are getting can be unlocked from
the HTC dev unlocker so that's very cool
so it might actually you know get a
bunch of AOSP support from developers
and it's exciting so speaking of AOSP
support let's talk about some Nexus
devices that finally went on sale a
couple days ago so the Nexus 10 yeah
went on sale next is for went on sale
and then brand spanking new Nexus 7 with
hspa+ went on sale and the cool thing
about those three devices I just named
they're also out now so all versions oh
no no baby Nexus 4 is both eXistenZ and
the hspa+ Nexus 7 so basically every new
device that they launch Jack's that do
the three things had a high demand or
they didn't have a whole lot in the
first run or both or a little bit of
element I think a little bit of both I
think they overshot there so I wonder
why they actually you know these advice
launch first you know first launched in
Australia and a bunch of Google+ friends
in our posting hey I bought it I bought
it and then like 35-40 minutes into it
it was all sold out like huh okay
alright see how it's gonna go next
morning you wake up early in the morning
and you find out the exact same thing
happened in Europe pretty much they went
on sale and you know 40 minutes later
you know they're all out surfing
okay it's going to turn into an all-out
war here in a few hours so the rumor was
at twelve o'clock eastern are 9 Pacific
that you're going to be able to buy the
the Nexus the new Nexus devices and
there wasn't any official word it was
all you know speculation rumor everybody
assumed and then 830am happens uh or
1130 depending on where out in the
country and all of a sudden you can
start buying devices a half hour earlier
than then people thought you could and
man you know the servers were getting
hammered people weren't able to add to
cart their card items disappear they're
getting server errors basically android
fans hammered the hell out of the google
play store and some people got devices
some are shipping some will be here
maybe tomorrow and the next day and a
bunch of unlucky people got an email
today saying that yeah um your device is
on backorder it could be three weeks
before you get it so i guess let us know
in the comments did you buy a net a
Nexus device which one did it ship did
you get an email confirmation a tracking
number is it on its way did did you get
told oops sorry wait three weeks in did
you pick up a bumper you know is that
part of the delay some people are
speculating that so that's a go around
here so sedans you order any of the new
Nexus devices I did ordered the eight
gigabyte Nexus 4 I actually was able to
get you order in at about one-thirty so
pretty late but I got a purchase
confirmation and then I had again
anything sense that no you know no
notification that my device is on
backorder but also no shipping
notification or any communication of any
kind nice nice um I heard that um if you
have a email that you got sent that said
it was going to be delayed three or four
weeks are they offering free shipping on
those devices if usually some because
you can still pull out and say that you
don't want it but if you if you just be
in you will get free shipping which is
kind of cool how much was shipping on
your device I think it's like six
dollars okay so it's a yeah and that's
sometimes they're gonna say yeah that's
nice it you know and we're say in the
comments you're some people are you know
haven't heard anything yet no they don't
have a tracking number confirmation or
they don't have a poops we're sorry
backorder email there in limbo so yeah I
think that's one thing that's one thing
to note about the entire launch is I
know we're all Android and Google
enthusiasts but we have to be honest
about the fact that Google has to get
better retail if they want to be a
player in this marketing you know put
devices out there not really competing
with the samsungs and the university's
models but they've got to get better at
that they have to have better at in
person type of customer support over the
phone they have to adopt a retail
mentality there over the phone support I
had to get my Nexus forward place
because that the first one I had the
touch me without responsive but they're
over the phone sporulation a nexus for
the nexus 7 he was talking about yes
sorry the nexus 7 so months ago but
they're over the support was really
really good it's awesome the support is
good there's not a clear way to get to
it reassured on you think that Google
needs to step up their game because they
sold out within under an hour and every
market day BK it became available they
sold out with under an hour under a half
hour maybe even here in the US like some
people put it like 20-25 minutes so big
mahalo Jesus could have been solved had
been taking pre-orders now okay because
i anticipate the market does this not
happen to do the online sales for
iphones it the same thing happens the
day they sell out in 30 minutes online
and hits the fan it's this is a
problem with big popular I don't have a
problem with that's selling out that's
perfectly fine the problem is part of
the reason at least in us why it sold
out so quickly is because they were
having so much problems with their
servers and this is Google Google server
failing the people were ordering 16 and
20 devices because they kept tried to
add it to their cart and then it didn't
work and then the try it again and then
it did work and then they get them like
the confirmation and realize that they
had like 16 devices on their cart yeah
and so that's why people were able to
get them later in the day as well
because they cut you know people would
go back and cancel 50 of those and free
them back up for sale I so we're just
asking about the giveaway just because
we're talking about the devices we're
not giving away yet we're gonna give
away the the code in the details on the
giveaway here a little bit later in the
show so still stay tuned still you know
still watch it live listen you know if
you're doing something else that's fine
we're we're still going to do it we're
just talking about the the Nexus devices
right now because a lot of stuff
happened yeah yeah so so uh me uh yeah I
succumb to I'm so much peer pressure
tech pressured Android geekiness
pressure I'm week I had decided that I
was not going to get it because it does
me that that watch the show that know me
know that I have 2g GSM here where I
live now at work and other you know
other surrounding areas i frequent
there's hspa+ 21 and work there's
actually t-mobile as 42 and a couple
other areas you know about half hour
away or so have hspa+ so electron all
lost so anyways I I did a big you know
cool call research I did like a week or
two ago and I decided that wasn't going
to get it because i have for
service here oh and then everybody i
know started talking about it and then
you know people that I know in Europe
start talking about then people I know
and Australia start talking about and
then people that I'm friends with here
start tell me up I'm watering it here in
an hour yep I'm ordered here in a half
hour and then some Frenchy I talked to
uh the UH he he gave me some good advice
and talked me into it but I wasn't all
ham I one of my buddies and that's
actually on the show sometimes Derek
more he he told me he was getting in on
say you know what if you're getting it
now I have to get it too and then I
decided there's such high demand for
this phone that if I get it and in two
weeks I me I'm gonna I'm gonna use it
hard and then Thanksgiving vacation
thanksgiving weekend holiday weekend
we're here is coming
no I'm going to be using a lot of mobile
data and using my phone hard talking the
family and everything that's gonna be a
pretty big test so if it fails for me
there's such high demand for the phone
I'm gonna be able to sell it for what I
paid for it and i'll be out a few bucks
on my plan oh well you know and at least
I'll know and I at least I'll know that
I tried to use it and I can't or I can
and that's the biggest thing if the
demand wasn't so high and I wouldn't be
able to sell it for what I paid for
you're not gonna try to price craft
anybody but someone wants to take it off
my hands for me yeah I'll definitely do
that already have a few offers on the
table so so yeah I bought 10 by the
tracking number I have a confirmation
for those of you they're curious i
ordered it about 1133 am I got my order
in before the mad server crash or rush
and I have a tracking number it says it
left Kentucky this afternoon will be
here tomorrow fingers crossed confidence
hi I'm betting I'll be screwed and won't
get it to monday though that's just me
so let's talk about a couple other
devices here we've spent a lot of time
than the new Nexus is launched so other
other big devices up kindle fire 8.9 is
now shipping the LTE version is going to
be starting next week remember the LTE
version comes with it was a dumb
eighties network and they give you a
limited amount of a data usage for free
it's actually not bad in my opinion
prettier though yeah it's / it's per
year but in a bind and it's not that bad
um t-mobile's a galaxy s3 is getting a
jellybean you can get it through keys or
over the air update and Google TV not so
much a film but it runs android so i'll
talk about that google TV received a
whole bunch of updates this week let's
talk about some app so there is two
major app updates the first one is you
too well mean that that's fun so if you
have a google TV and you have an android
tablet or android phone you can now
stand or fling q content movies yum TV
shows you know whatever funny stuff
music videos whatever you want
of the millions and millions and
millions of videos on the YouTube you
can queue whatever you want to on your
TV now now you can do some of this
before through other methods or you can
control it with the youtuber mode but it
wasn't is fun it wasn't as intuitive as
it is now so like I said you can you can
do this from your Android device and the
nice thing about it is is you can do it
for multiple Android devices so if you
have friends / family over whatever mom
you know kids in the house whatever wife
you know whoever all of you can add
content to watch on on the TV and
everybody can control what's currently
playing so the videos playing that you
played and somebody besides I don't
wanna watch this yeah they they can make
him pause it skip it choose to watch
something else so uh but but uh it's
still fun that everybody can control it
I know I was testing it and I'm sitting
there queuing up a whole bunch of videos
and I wondered why the video I was
watching us watching a lindsey stirling
the one her dubstep violin videos and it
kept stopping what the hell why'd it
stop so I hit play and plays for like
five more seconds and stopped it's like
man this sucks this is buggy you know
and I poked my head around the corner my
wife's sitting there laughing like she's
sitting here on her phone like like
pause in the video but what was need is
a on her phone since she had added
things to the cue on her phone it popped
up whatever was playing so you know she
died like notification saying hey this
is playing do you want to stop it you
know look control the volume skip it add
your own things and also on the YouTube
app you can go to a TV q section where
as you can see every single video that
is in the queue so you can add as many
as you want to uh know if there's a
limit I've added dozens um now it was
kind of hard for me to figure it out
that you can actually remove those at
first I didn't think you could I noticed
on the the picture of the video
thumbnail there's a little blue down
arrow and I thought hey look that's not
supposed to be there and I click on it
and it didn't do anything but if you
click right you mean you really have to
be very very precise but if you click on
the little down arrow it actually gives
you the options to then remove the
videos that are playing so if you decide
you don't want them in the queue anymore
you can remove them but it's a I think
that needs to be
made a little bit bigger most people
probably will have problems with that
until they tried out a few times or even
maybe not even know it's there um so if
you guys tried that all you try the
YouTube flinging a YouTube sending
queuing it all on your device's try to
just me personally if another person
with a different google account comes in
and it's in no way associated with my
google TV does that automatically get
queued and they can control her as long
as you're on the same Wi-Fi network yes
you just had videos you just had to be
on the same Wi-Fi network so if you have
some YouTube you know content you know
that you want to add back and forth yo
Marcus at party or you want to have mean
comedy night uh no but yeah you can do
it I i think this functionality but will
be great i I mean if you guys remember
this is kind of like the Nexus Q
remember the Nexus Q could do similar
functionality so when you can do this to
to music that you have through google
music when you can do this through TV
and movie app um chances are this is the
first of many apps that will be able to
do that now that's just a guess well but
I would assume that once they realize
that this takes off the google TV will
add other functionality in the future i
mean it it's great i I think it's fine
you know it really is so another google
TV update is uh the TV and movies app
you know where you could search for
content the minyan live shows movies and
TV shows and then you went in and you
customized it by your ratings and
everything that hap has been renamed
it's no longer you know a search at I
it's called prime time and for me on my
vizio I was not told to update the app I
i went to the play store and saw there
was an app update and updated it I'm I
know other people had it pop up saying
there was an update and other people
didn't so just luck of the draw guess
whenever it was pushed to your device
and whenever you saw it so couldn't go
an update that's called prime time now
it's a there's a little bit of UI
changes it's a little more intuitive and
said uh the search features are a little
bit better overall to it's a great
update and the some of the features i
haven't actually used yet that you're
going to be
able to see content related to what
you're currently watching so you're
watching a certain movie or certain TV
show a certain sports a sporting event
it'll come up with you related content
that's immuno similar to that um or
other things that are showing that are
related to it so it's a heck of an
update and last does that trickle down
to the review I know you'd said that the
YouTube updates due to the prime time
change as well I'm a bad google TV
ambassador I don't know the answer to
that question I don't know if the review
gets that I'm gonna say yes I um yes I'm
gonna say it does because I I'm yes it
does um I'm not too sure that it's going
to get the next thing we're going to
talk about though yeah um the next thing
is is a platform 3 the google TV version
3 it's right now rolling out to the LG
TV and that's a heck of an update that
the biggest thing about it is is voice
search so I believe we talked about this
a few weeks ago on a show and that when
the video was first leaked and we'll
talk about it again just just real quick
so voice search we all know what it is
we use it you know google search voice
search you know android has had it
forever but now you know it ties into
the knowledge graph and this is coming
to Google TV so for example you say into
your microphone that is built into your
remote or you talk into the Android app
and you say show me movies with
Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale and
it comes up with the dark knight you
know some things you can do with Google
now like if you said that into Google
now right now so yeah it's very cool I
me and you know you don't know the name
of a TV show you don't name a movie you
just speak about it talk about it and
the voice search you know since it's
built into the knowledge graph it will
it will find it or try to to find it you
can say you know channel you know I want
to watch Fox yeah you not to say awww
man what's Fox is it the 5327 my channel
numbers anymore they change it around a
few years ago and I don't know if they
are
yeah yeah yeah so you don't have to know
that anywhere you can just tell your TV
what you want and it's going to do it
very cool i guess it's rolling out to
the LG TV right now other devices are on
other devices will get it soon no ETA s
maybe by the end of the year fingers
crossed confidence high and if you have
questions about the microphone um
current devices I think that the sony
has a mic built in um other things like
like the vizio co-star and review they
don't have a mic built in um but future
Google TV devices will come with Mike's
built in to their remote and I said the
Android app should should be able to
take that off your shoulders for you it
should be able to do it so you not to
buy a new motor buy a new device yeah so
they also are being Apple to the punch
on Syria integration for Apple TV
getting there people of voice TV right
now do you remember all I I don't know
how long ago so I'm just gonna say a
long time ago maybe a year ago maybe six
months ago there was a patent that was
found by Google where you were going you
were look you know that the diagram said
you're going to talk into a device to be
able to control everything and
everyone's like wow this is Android at
home this is Android at home well me you
know I bet and it's not i'm betting it's
actually you're talking to your advice
and controlling your TV your entertainer
it said you're going to control an
entertainment device i have it that was
a google TV pet not long as it sounds
exactly like it all right so let's move
on off of devices o said let us know if
you're getting the nexus is as I said
and you know if you had success or your
raging or are you had fails um let's
talk about rooting and ramen real quick
so I don't spend a whole lot of time on
this because I don't want to beat a dead
horse or spread drama rumors but it's a
big you know it cyanogenmod is huge in
the Android world so just in this
affects everybody so that's that is in
the routing and roaming basically so
it's worth mentioning so the cyanogenmod
dot-com domain was was basically held
for ransom you can go there website and
read all the details we don't need to
get into all that but the
a few things that they found out what's
happening was a stiva cyanogen himself
was you know getting impersonated maybe
two vendors or and so forth OEM saying
hey I'm Steve Kondik you know give me
this give me that may I say you can go
then read all the details but uh the
team is now regained control of all
their social media accounts that and you
know they they're they're getting
control of cyanogenmod com in the
meantime they transition to cyanogenmod
org and you know and I actually noticed
that yesterday maybe the day before
before the announcement actually came
out I went to cyanogenmod com I saw
redirected to organize what the hell
when did that happen so I started so I
start looking around trying to find you
know when that happened so I and then I
you know the next day the blog post went
up i was actually confused when i first
saw that but apparently the the
situation has been resolved amicably so
you know the you can find all the all
the information all the posts and say
they're all over google+ over sine law
com or double work um said yeah there
and read it we all need to spread the
drama but if you want to know a little
bit more about it so the daughter TL DR
version is is something bad happen now
it's all good um um so the nexus 4nexus
s motorola xoom hspa+ next 27 are all
left out of a osa p for now yeah so it
looks like the nexus s and the zoom
aren't just aren't gonna get 4.2 yeah
yeah yeahs there or they reached end of
official end of life right the nexus 7
the hspa+ nexus 7 and the new york's
brand new nexus 4 are still not in
though and David you remember it's a
still not and not ain't never going to
be Dan do you remember about his last
februari um you and I were talking to j
BQ actually mainly you because you know
a lot more about this than I do it with
a quail calm about their licensing and
the nexus 4 i'm sorry the nexus one and
jb you came back and said that you know
her for the past four years you know
qualcomm has been the same way i mean to
get the rills to
radio code you know I mean everything
from from them was a Hewitt is yes so
it's interesting that knowing that that
we have you know the same problem of
four years later yeah no I mean it all
indications are that Qualcomm is the
holdup on that with some kind of
licensing negotiation issues I know that
it's certainly Google's goal to get them
into AOSP my my suspicion is that it
will get there it's just going to take a
little bit of time which and in the
nexus 7 I mean that's a radio
licensing you know gsm radio licensing
so it'll it doesn't have a Qualcomm
Qualcomm processor so how many might
have an awesome radio okay it could be
um but they really aren't that many
options anymore for open hardware no was
with Texas Instruments and they were
probably the most open out of all of
them but Qualcomm and then what's your
alternative you got samsung's new song
and yet about it Samsung's a little bit
better in testing is really the only
user of Samson's products so that's kind
of erupted block because you've got
Intel which that's off the table right
now and you know that you don't have a
lot of really open hardware options even
when you're so I mean and almost every
device in the world right now is a
Qualcomm radio so you're going to have
to fight them regardless so you might as
well just take the processor yeah maybe
Nvidia's grey tigra great processor just
supposed to have its own integrated
radio built by a sarah maybe that'll
change the game but they do that they
haven't shown really the capacity to
match qualcomm radio making ability all
right so if you're you're into ruin and
rom and you're gonna want to know about
when's my device getting android 4.2 as
a custom rom so those of us that are
rocking the verizon galaxy nexus for at
least another day or two another three
weeks or for the next year um you're
going to know when am I getting 4.2 well
yeah verizon I give it to you yeah so so
you rely on custom roms so right now
there's three um did I know of three
custom roms out there for the verizon
galaxy nexus on AOSP 4.2 there's there's
a mozzies of rom you might remember him
he was one of the first devs to get
jelly bean 4.1 out for the tour l.a last
summer so and he's at it again 4.2 is a
fully working too little fully working
in quotes i say mean all the hardware
works the for whatever reason the
current build he has has the old leaked
keyboard that has the the blue letters
with the white with a white text though
if you want the most up-to-date keyboard
you gotta replace the keyboard no big
deal you know it takes a second the
flash a new keyboard or delete the APK
and put a new one in reboot the big deal
um and I I guess people are having force
closes with daydream if they put it on
the clock and I guess that has to deal
with the AOSP desk clock versus the
actual proprietary Google version them
desk clock I don't know if that can be
resolved or not but the the easy fix for
that is to delete the desk clock APK the
AOSP one and put in the proprietary
google one the desk clock googled on a
PK you put that in there and then it
fixes that problem so two minor little
inconveniences that can be fixed I don't
know if the other two have those issues
or not I actually having ran them I've
seen people talk about em rom another
one called pure jelly I don't know
anything about those two I only went
with a DAB that I was familiar with and
it runs great I'll have any problems the
location services and Google now works
great all the apps run great it's you
know it's not slow battery life is good
I you know I'm I'm liking it you know
for however long I need to play with it
or indefinitely if GSM signal just
doesn't love me and I have to give my
nexus 4 back so yeah it's fine i'm happy
with it for now eventually if I have to
stay with it I'm probably gonna run
bugless beast because you know what I I
like bugless beast it's a basically
stock um moving on to other 4.2 roms and
then we'll get to the nexus 4 giveaway
part 2
the acer iconia a500 my oh my old
android tablet it was the first tablet
to get jelly bean besides the Nexus 7
and the same developer random Blaine
he's back he's at it again and he has a
almost nearly working for point to build
right now as of this morning and he may
have fixed it since am but has it this
morning there was no bluetooth no camera
no audio and that's basically I think
actually that's how it started out
that's all started out when 4.1 came out
I'm sure that's a list of things that
aren't working mean those are all sort
of expected to not be working you'll get
that work in a couple days and you know
what I can't wait to put it on my son
actually uses that it that's his tablet
so I can't wait to flash my son's tablet
form it's kind of like a geek dad you
know uh achievement unlocked for me oh
and last but not least for root and rom
and i can finally stop talking because
i've been talking a lot um twerp it
didn't support as well as a clockwork
mod e i didn't support the new multiple
user accounts with android 4.2 what it
did is it android 4.2 moves the SD card
into / SD cards you know / 04 the first
user / 14 the second and so forth and so
forth so since all your data is now
located in SD card / 20 it had some
issues couldn't didn't work properly you
had to look for you had to poke around a
little bit more to get stuff to work so
uh not a big deal actually i mean i
flash roms off without it you know even
you don't need it but the compatibility
issues have been resolved in three two
point three point two is now available
I'm i don't use clockworkmod I don't
know if clockwork might have been
updated Kosh is usually pretty good with
that I would assume it is or will be
extremely know most on google plus three
was looking for a way to fix it just to
an app update put a miniature the ISO
impossible hotel manager in new recovery
bill I don't know if they were able to
come up with a way to do that though I
suspect not just because I know what's
involved with that kind of a change
alright so so let's get to the part
you're all waiting for scott anderson is
going to talk he's going to tell us why
his how he sleeps on bed that is covered
in junk oh okay so I nexus 4 giveaway
code part 2 how can i participate you're
probably asking yourself well we have a

first article so if you guys won go
there and check it out ends in three
days okay so let's move on to some
carrier and OEM news Sprint is letting
up LTE networks in nine more cities
basically that brings up the total 241
cities and 125 more to come um and then
verizon is starting to preload the
amazon appstore and ecosystem on android
devices so
hurting with the droid DNA which do you
guys like this is in another form of
bloatware yes it's bloat it's not as
atrocious as some of the stuff they put
on there in the past but it's good
they're not putting the V CAST app store
on and they're put another a story yeah
we lost v cast and we gained five more
apps to replace that one v cast at you
know that may I guess know if we're
better off or not because it's
pre-loaded it's still preloaded with ton
of apps in you if Verizon does that
unlike all their upcoming devices I see
that they're gonna get a lot of money
and yeah yeah I'm sure of a run or I'm
sure Emma's out of paying them a load
for this yeah zzz Bryce is not hurting
for money now either yeah they're just
that Street here but verizon does love
to make more money yeah I don't know
that um the ability and Ice Cream
Sandwich to disable these kind of
applications isn't motivating them like
well you know if you can figure this
stuff out and we just preload some more
stuff on there and they won't care yeah
I still wish you could actually delete
them how do to at least sprint has the
decency to make their bloodline
removable one can I want to make about
my Nexus back door thing um I saw that
somebody in the comments have to take it
do not trim that there's no relevance to
trim back well okay so Nexus back order
is all one word there's no space not to
worry about spaces Nexus back order all
one word no spaces I'm actually going to
ask darcy how many entries for nexus
back door there are and you know if you
want to if you want to create a mean
with scott anderson and nexus back door
i will share this feel free i'm i'm okay
with that and actually i encourage you
to share it i encourage you to do it
scott ian is a nexus back door okay
let's move on to other carrier news so
verizon ads LTE to 20 new areas it now
covers eighty percent of the population
and not Derek and probably never Derek
hey now right but you know in 6 months
when I'm six months Verizon's gonna
completely replace their LTE network 3g
network with LTE they said so in six
months I will have LTE at my house and I
won't be able to use it if I'm on the
nexus 4 yeah you bet you'll be on 2g GSM
but but i'll be rocking 2g gsm so I'll
be all right what that when they like
your LTE up is gonna be the day that you
leave them actually the day after you
leave him that will be one that will be
when they flip the switch on your arrow
I'm not renewing my contract I call you
can PA oh we're rolling that out with
healthy tomorrow this is conveyed on
here um and AT&amp;amp;T is adding LTE and eight
new cities I know that Minneapolis where
I am um got it and I was at work today
look at her own you know in the AT&amp;amp;T
tower looking around and they were like
wow um it's it's fast because nobody is
I mean there are a significant amount of
ps3's there on it and I know at where I
work I know 15 people that have them so
a lot of people love that dog it's crazy
but yeah there were given great speeds
um anywhere from 15 to 30 megabits down
so pretty fast for a big city to this
for a bigger city yeah and then Qualcomm
is now I'm worth more than intel and
that's big news yeah yeah check Zilla
just got surpassed by Qualcomm that is
cool yeah it's good news to see I think
intel has more of a fight in them than
its perceived to be but oh I don't think
they're going down without a fight but
it or not I'm shooting past that I mean
Qualcomm is really riding in the back of
its radio more than its processors
that's not but i think intel has a
legitimate mobile strategy that we kind
of underestimated times birthday they
have a chance I've had a chance they
certainly have more of a
it's then then arm does getting into
mobile or not armed that getting any
servers yeah indeed I'm excited to see
what they do to try to leapfrog if they
can um it'd be kind of cool they did I'm
up for innovation yeah is a they got a
good road map so we'll find out and then
in more exciting news Apple stock
continues to slide down twenty-five
percent from all-time high basically it
started going down right before oh it
was actually made out to the iphone went
on sale was when the iphone 5 got
released it started tank is typical
apple huh yes Pam Allen stick in the
stock peak and it actually came out and
it's been downhill ever since yeah
typically it peaks and then you know
goes down but then comes back up but in
this case it's been a steady roller
coaster down and if I percent that's
like a hundred and sixty six billion
dollars in two months well you know in a
lot of tech stocks are down Google's
down over fifty bucks from what it was a
month ago so sure it's not just Apple
not a not a hundred and ten dollars
though yeah that's true um and then
another we're gonna say about the Apple
oh yeah the apples given dividends of
2.5 billion um that's kind of
interesting because that's what they got
from Samsung so I think that was kind of
funny yeah I mean typically they don't
don't get a lot of defense so I'm sure
that asleep they don't like three times
in the past 17 years and I think the
timing for this one I think was just a
samsung we're giving away the money that
you gave us you gotta pony come oh yeah
okay let's move on to Dan's favorite
section patent Boris naturally um so
yeah HTC an apple have come to a
cross-licensing agreement they lay down
their arms against one another the
details on it are still all very much a
mystery different analysts are expecting
it to be between six and eight dollars a
device
that's largely based on what HTC has
said its annual cost is going to be for
this agreement so six to eight dollars a
device sounds like a lot but in the
scheme of things it is not apple has
been running around telling people that
they are owed forty thirty to forty
dollars per device so six to eight is a
lot less than 30 to 40 per device and
six to eight is actually very close to
two point two five percent of the profit
per device the same number that might
that Google's Motorola has been asking
for their patents so it seems like it's
generally good that they've that they've
resolved their problems but it's also
looking like Apple capitulated for a lot
less than what they've been asking
everybody else for ah the flip side to
that is Samsung is apparently completely
unwilling to settle with that full on
similar terms um I can't blame them
though because all indications thus far
have been that Apple is refusing to
budge from the thirty to forty dollar
mark for samsung um so why they did for
HTC I don't know uh James HTC is her
group because the science they're trying
to kill the weak link here you know yeah
they're giving a better deal to the weak
link because they're hurting and then
they know that they will take what they
can get in order to have some security
and it's kind of sad but that's what
they're doing and they're preying on the
weak they are hiding the wounded and
they're tackling them I would love to
see HTC see a rebound based upon the
fact that they can pretty much run
rampant now with innovation and not have
to worry about exactly not not that
Microsoft doesn't do the same but
Microsoft generally just settles for
licensing it's nice it's almost worth
six to eight dollars a device just to
shut Apple up yeah abbs I have to worry
about import bans and not worry about
stepping on small really insignificant
patents and have your phone device
launched completely held back for
something that small yeah there is a
10-year license agreement and it is
ongoing so any new patent that either
company adds in the next ten years is
covered so they don't have to worry
about Apple inventing something tomorrow
are getting some
patent granted to them next week on
something that they obviously didn't
invent just now HTC doesn't have to
worry about it so for the price that
they're paying for this $68 device is
probably worth it just to not have to
deal with it yeah they're probably
playing there's no telling what their
pros and what okay knowledge device to
fight yeah the legal fees are ridiculous
yeah so Samsung while they're unwilling
to settle they also we had heard jacked
up the prices of their processors that
they billed for Apple there's a lot of
speculation that this was a retaliatory
move by Samsung uh they're their
executives come out and denied that they
said more or less this was a completely
scheduled hike like yes we did hike the
prices but that's what the contract said
we were going to do and we get it
exactly when the contract said we were
going to do it so Apple dever comments
on their agreements with hardware
vendors so we aren't going to get a
whole lot more detail out of this um the
fact that Apple hasn't been complaining
loudly about it suggests that this
probably was just what the contract said
it's interesting that the twenty percent
hike you know it's just that's a big
it's a big hike I mean it's a big
increase I mean I would suspect that
part of that was factored in because
Samsung spent a lot of money building a
brand new fabrication facility more or
less for Apple this is the cost of
materials the raw materials to get this
i would love to I would love to think
that they were secretly being
retaliatory toward Apple just burst upon
but I just don't think that's the case I
mean the cost to produce anything
related to well like electronic
components in general Silicon and metal
prices have just gone through the roof
absolutely you have to and that's been
over the last decade they've just been
gradually increasing so you can't expect
them to keep it at the same price it's
not a type of industry that's getting
more that much more efficient with his
calls over years to be able to
compensate for that plus these devices
keep getting better and these chips keep
getting better and as they get better
part of that is getting a lot more
complex and a lot more difficult
to physically build got a quad we got
quad core chips right it's a smaller
process or still producing the metal
it's all installer it's it's expensive
to make them so I'm not at all surprised
by the idea that I was a contractual
increase um but in in other
schadenfreude news the UK judges that
had ordered Apple to put up their
apology and then ordered Apple to take
down and replace their apology issued a
good basically pitch slapped to Apple
they're making apple cover all of
Samsung's expenses um going a little bit
above and beyond just typically when you
lose a court case you're gonna have to
cover your opponent's legal fees this is
going a little bit above and beyond that
covering things that aren't normally
included with legal fees basically all
of their expenses all the bills for all
the Samsung witnesses and everybody that
testify all they're like reimbursement
fees and hotel fees the whole nine so
Apple is gonna make it's certainly not a
billion-dollar you know court decision
but in what should have been hey you
know coast an apology wash your hands
walk away and you know live to fight
another day this is turning into an
actual drain on Apple resources so I'm
just speaking Apple we have a question
in the comments about some apple news
here and we have a few minutes here to
wrap up so but let's uh let's reflect on
the recent rumored news that the iPhone
5 is going to begin though I saw iPhone
5s is going to begin production very
shortly if not already now remember the
iphone 5 just came out in September so
so what do you think of that I think
that should is struggling to produce
enough iphone 5s right now that they
can't possibly start building the iphone
5s in quantity it's time to wake up
Derek why is it that what is it what is
it what is it indicating for Apple that
they would be that desperate that they
feel like they need to adopt a six-month
release cycle it's the
onslaught of Android devices that come
out every other week and they're
realizing that once a year is not
cutting it and they cannot unless they
innovate their platform a lot they can't
you know leapfrog or stay on top with
hardware for more than a couple of weeks
if that well the devices that they put
out have consistently been behind dating
all the way back to the iphone 4 vs evo
4g hilarious youtube video really like
their hard work has been behind for a
while but the only thing advantage was
that they've had over the years has been
like the graphics processors yep
everything else they've been pretty much
and sometimes rightfully so like with
LTE and but on the other hand you know
felt like they're even it doesn't cost
nearly as much to even make an iphone 5
because it doesn't have an NFC radio it
doesn't have a lot of other hardware
features are making like a ridiculous
profit margin yeah that's it's a hundred
eighty dollars to produce that you're
selling them for our 750 day it made it
that's us you know this best be on
profitable and approaching ludicrous and
it you know I if they were to speed up
the release cycles it's telling you that
they're getting desperate um yeah I
don't think that they'll necessarily put
out a 5s that soon but if they did they
really don't have a lot of time to
improve on software by that point it's
kind of like you look at the ipad 3 vs 4
and they could do some minor hardware
guards but the people are already pissed
off of that you know with me they're
gonna add NFC you know i don't i don't
think i have a way to really monetize it
efficiently they i think i've invested
too much into the past book and their
technology and you hear all these
different types of you know airlines
that Arjun asking don't you remember the
patents from a few weeks back that Apple
had for NFC where they were going to use
a mobile device on us that was it that
was in air plant airports or subways
you and I very well know just because
you have a packet patent does not mean
that you're going to use it it means
that you are protected and you have
something you know what I mean yeah
except a lot it's a hit or miss they
could they could or could not use it
applicants in a very troll-like manner
where it has absolutely no intention of
ever using them for something like that
it's gonna build it just goes back in
the day HP was patenting something every
day I understand that I mean that's the
apples pending stuff for things along
the lines of google glasses and yeah i
don't i don't see where they have any
kind of ecosystem to produce anything
worth of though scram they're
selling now the oakley goggles that have
the head-up display that's powered by
android right there on the apple website
and is constantly a nice little better
that is hilarious they're slowing
android on the apple website but I and a
machine also makes a good point on
google+ that uh the iPad Mini is kind of
a cry for we need to compete everywhere
but we can't because there's so many
there's such a big diversity with
devices we covered that a few weeks ago
on the show how it was this is a glue
this whole advice there there this year
from the iphone 5 and ipad mini was
their first line up of reactionary
devices i agree with that a nutshell
okay so for all of you guys are
