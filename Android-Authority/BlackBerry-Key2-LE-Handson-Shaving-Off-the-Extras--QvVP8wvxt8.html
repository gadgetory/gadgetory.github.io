reviewed the BlackBerry key - and it was
pretty good I liked it but for a lot of
people it just didn't make sense
blackberries have always been pretty
niche devices but in 2018 if phone with
the full physical keyboard is just kind
of weird for a lot of people and it was
also $650 which is also kind of weird
especially considering it had a
Snapdragon 660 now this isn't a weak
processor by any means but it's not one
of Qualcomm flagships and if you're
paying that much for a phone you're
probably gonna want to get a little more
power out of your device
so apparently blackberry I heard your
call and now they've built a phone that
they think can actually take on a lot of
other budget devices this is the
BlackBerry key - le alright so the key
to le looks really similar to the
original key - and I mean like really
similar it's pretty much got the same
frame but this year it's made of a
polycarbonate plastic which makes it
about 30% lighter but it actually felt
pretty good to hold in your hand it
still feels like metal and that's not
really something I expected out of an
all-plastic device they also rounded a
lot of the corners that were originally
really chamfered and sharp on the
original blackberry key - and it just
feels more like a modern-day phone now
the keeps you felt great don't get me
wrong and I love the industrial design
but this phone feels a little bit more
like something you would actually get in
the budget category and if you're gonna
charge less per device you obviously
have to have weaker components the key
to le is using a snap during a 6:36
processor which is newer than the 660
but it's not necessarily better it's
just kind of clocked at a lower speed
the rims been cut down to 4 gigabytes
instead of 6 and the storage options are
now 32 gigabytes and 64 gigabytes and
that's a little low for my liking but I
kind of understand why they did it since
they're now trying to hit a more budget
category the camera still looks the same
but it's just been reduced in megapixel
count so you might not get images as
clear as the ones that I got on the
BlackBerry q2 now to be fair you're
still getting a lot of the really great
things about the BlackBerry key - you're
getting the exact same screen you're
getting the same full QWERTY keyboard
and
kept the convenience key and the speed
key now they did tell me that the keys
are 10 percent smaller than they are on
the key 2 but they still feel pretty big
in the hand and I didn't really have any
problems with them while I was using it
today
unfortunately cutting cost means they're
gonna be cutting some sensors out of the
keyboard so you're not gonna be able to
use that keyboard as a trackpad anymore
you're still getting the headphone jack
USB C port and downward firing speakers
and of course you're not getting IP
water resistance or micro SD card
expansion just like you didn't get in
the BlackBerry key - and the most
obvious change that you've already seen
in my hands on here are the colors there
are three new colors of this phone and
you're getting slate which is like a
gray black mostly gray a champagne which
is like a gold around the sides and I'm
kind of green on the back and then
you're getting what they're calling
atomic which is really just this vibrant
saturated red color so blackberry told
me that they pretty much did this
because they didn't feel like they
needed to stick to this industrial
design that they got on the BlackBerry
key - they had the opportunity to just
kind of mess around with colors on this
light Edition since it's not really that
serious with the curved edges and all
that other stuff and I think it's pretty
cool I mean the red color really pops
out and if you're someone that wants to
get a phone that looks different this is
probably the model you're gonna get
anyway
so all this context and whittling down
doesn't really matter unless I tell you
the price well the 32 gigabyte of
storage model is going to cost you $399
and the 64 gigabyte model is gonna be
449 and that's a pretty decent price I
think I mean the specs aren't the
greatest but what you're really paying
for here is the type of phone you're
getting the full QWERTY keyboard and
you're getting something that looks
completely different from every other
phone on the market right now anyway
that's just the heart information meshed
with my two cents and we have a full
article on all the specs on this phone
if you want to dig a little deeper but
let me know what you think about this
device was it weird of blackberry to go
out and make a light addition of the key
to or you have a key to yourself or do
you think that this is all just
completely ridiculous let me know in the
comment section below and make sure you
go stay tuned to the article and check
