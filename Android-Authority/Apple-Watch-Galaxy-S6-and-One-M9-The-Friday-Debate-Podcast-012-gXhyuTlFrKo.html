Friday debate podcast by android
authority discussing topics in android
every single week i am of course your
host for the fdp Joshua Vergara what's
going on everybody and once again I am
joined by the usual panel of hosts
andrew grush Jonathan Feist and Joe
Hindy as we take on a very device
centric look at some particular devices
that came out or as we learned in the
beginning of the podcast haven't even
come out yet in the case of the Apple
watch but we did talk about the samsung
galaxy s6 and the s6 edge along with the
HTC One m9 of which are really close to
being released and out to the public and
of course you can find the reviews for
all of those devices on android
authority calm but nonetheless we talked
at length about our thoughts on the
Apple watch and even smartwatches in
general and then get into which of the
two flagship devices that just came out
we would want to buy with our own money
as always you can follow android
authority across all social media
networks and if you're watching the
YouTube version of this podcast thank
you for watching but one of the best
ways of listening to the Friday debate
podcast is through your favorites
podcast programs pocket casts iTunes
stitcher and of course we're going to be
getting these podcasts up on soundcloud
very soon as poor the request by a lot
of you so that is going to happen very
soon and we'll let you know when some
changes to the podcasts are going to
happen soon by the way but we're going
to let you know about those in a small
episode that i will post probably about
five minutes long pretty soon where
we're going to get your feedback your
suggestions for topics and we might even
do some Q&amp;amp;A based upon some questions
you want to know about us without any
further ado here is episode number 12 of
the friday debate podcast by android
authority hope you guys enjoy
it's in the way that she use it I was
just like rag verizon crap i forgot to
bring a joke this week that's what she
said haha tasers I love that one that's
from from one of my favorite podcasts
anyone here to listen to harm in town no
community creator Dan Harmon oh man my
favorite one and they that's the song
that they always use whenever it's like
the end of a movie where everything has
been resolved and there's like that
freeze frame like breakfast club style
of the guy with his arm in the air I
need to do it's in the way that she used
it oh man oh man so has everybody been
since last week we had a double future
last week so i hope everybody got a very
nice dose of the fdp last week that
almost sounds wrong if you took out the
f I'm pretty sure I to marcus's as
explicit we just got flags by I by apple
right sorry guys i'm on team are not
talking about the apple watch yet and we
were no no oh man that's gonna be this
is gonna be a fun podcast guys I can
feel it in my bones yeah has everybody
been since the last week's double
feature I've been good very a very
concise and succinct response from Joe
for once look at that yeah just just
been uh going through the motions doing
my stuff it's gonna slowly get shorter
and shorter and one day I'm gonna ask
how how are you doing Joe each other
yeah man good cool how are you crushing
um yeah doing good its it it's been very
rainy around here so that's been kind of
sucky I've been stuck in the house a lot
more than I'm like hmm so but otherwise
yeah it's been pretty much same as usual
hopefully not too much cabin fever I as
opposed no I try to try to get out when
it's not right ok and then Phi see if
I'm not mistaken you're coming to us
from an N 9 no no oh you're gonna spoil
it all I had
to turn it right off because it keeps
crashing the router with skype oh so I'm
going to play from an ipad mini oh no no
narc side click which leads into how my
week has been you know I've been with
tap times I've got the ipad sorry the
ipad air to the iPad Mini 3 you know
I've been putting him through their
paces and I've just been finally getting
all of my verses articles out so I did
the ipad air 2 versus the Nexus 9 last
week and I just put out kind of a side
by side of the ipad air 2 and the iPad
Mini 3 here last night and sorry at the
time that you are listening to this
podcast it would be two days ago I you
know it's been it's been exciting
putting these things through their paces
and it's been an awful lot of work to
put the works together but you guys know
that especially with all the galaxy s6
and at one m9 stuff you've been putting
together lately yeah definitely I mean
there are there's there's almost endless
amounts of content that we're trying to
get out but you know we obligations are
always kind of mixed up when it comes to
being like the ones with the devices so
a lot still coming I have like a camera
shoot out that's very close to being
done which actually I'm actually kind of
happy that I held off on the galaxy s6
camera shoot out because ever since I
first put together the batch of photos
and videos that I want it I took even
more so I'm even more familiar with the
camera than before and I'm gonna do the
same thing with the one m9 most likely
while I'm out in Seattle over this
weekend I'm actually going to be going
up there with my girlfriend to see my
best friend and yeah this is kind of a
habit that I'm kind of not too happy
about these days I've done it for the
last however so long had been with
Andrew authority but when I go somewhere
for like a siesta or some sort of break
I tend to bring my work with me anyway
but yeah maybe one day I'll finally like
be able to not do that but that's gonna
happen this week so the one m9 is is the
phone i'll be using throughout my four
days in seattle and her is pretty cold
up there so hopefully uh the the cold
touch of the metal won't kill me oh it's
so cold let me tell you oh boy yeah if
that metal gets too cold just pick up
the one m9 it'll heat your hands right
up or I'll just plug it in yeah
the thing about the m9 it's like this
one's plugged in that it gets like
really warm so I'll just bring an
external battery with me hope to cold
it's almost like having to plug in your
car just don't get to the morbid this is
why I will never survive in snow but if
if it's not obvious to all of our
listeners just yet we're already jumping
into it just without even knowing it's a
very device centric episode of the
friday to be a podcast this week we're
going to revisit a couple of topics that
we have kind of talked about in the past
but now that the releases I've actually
happened by the time this podcast comes
out or is released rather we have a few
devices to talk about but we're going to
go ahead and get one out of the way
first feisty kind of give us a segue we
all got talk about the Apple watch a
little bit a lot of reviews are coming
out people are getting them on the wrist
actually I was out in about an LA
downtown LA today I did notice a lot of
people wearing it and I expected there
to be a line outside of Apple that
doesn't seem like there was um I don't
know if anyone has a full pulse on how
the Apple watch is doing but does it
look like its it has the clout that the
iphone does or there are people
clamoring for this this product does
anybody have a have a bead on that no
aside from the obvious reasons why that
would be a nobody but yeah what were you
guys I krushi well I mean uh I don't
think I mean I've heard a lot of granted
I most of my friends and people I
associate with our uh use Android or
actually have a couple believe not that
use Windows Phone ah but the Apple
people that I do have in my life didn't
they really aren't that excited for it
so from my end no I haven't heard a lot
but even if there isn't a lot it doesn't
really say much this point because if
you remember the iphone initially wasn't
like a super hot seller in its first
generation it was at my beer but we're
talking about a company that didn't have
then we're talking about a company that
up until that point was kind of unknown
I mean oh yeah that's not true yeah we
had a coffee huge okay that's true the
iPod the iPod was huge and so this is
the whole new product category for Apple
and Apple consumers have to be you know
I think it's going to take a few
generations for
will decay her it should have been like
enough I just kind of feel like there
should be enough momentum behind quite
literally everything that they had
already that everyone was just going to
flock to it I mean obviously at the
announcement I mean I remember watching
the entire thing I even live tweeted the
thing and just giving my opinions I'm
just all of the information there I just
remember thinking to myself that
everyone is gonna buy this just because
it's apple and I'm kind of unsure of
whether or not that's still true and
from what I observed down in downtown LA
it doesn't seem like it is yet what'd I
just say yet you you know that you don't
see a lot of advertising yeah I mean
yeah I've seen a little advertising but
it's not been like blasted everywhere
least not for what from where I've seen
have you guys seen a lot of advertising
I think I saw one thing on TV the other
day oh I've seen the end quite a few
times by now really I guess I don't
watch a lot of TV TV cific or gutter
okay um I I mean I've been watching TV
pretty I mean a lot of last couple days
like watching like agents of Shield's if
I haven't seen anything on television
about the Apple watch yet I didn't even
know it uh it was released until I saw
that the you know the Virgin a couple
other places had reviews up today like I
didn't even know it was out and actually
I didn't even know it was released like
to the public until josh said he saw
people in la wearing them not I'm saying
I haven't really seen anybody Oh haven't
ok I have has it been released to the
public I thought it was by now but I
could be wrong but the reviews
definitely are coming out um then it
just shows you had just how just about
my android authority is not yet so yeah
yeah I know I'm listening to you guys
talking I'm like everything you guys are
saying is like brand new information to
me oh well you know I mean I'm a tech
blogger I should know this stuff but
usually I you know I know when since
yeah we're totally off base here there's
a reason we haven't seen anything lining
up the reviews are out but the watch
itself doesn't come out till you 24 Oh
24 oh well ok if I could I could say I
know brushy said that he hasn't seen
much of the advertising yet but I have
seen so much that it made me think that
it was out already I guess I kind of
assumed with all the reviews and stuff
that but I guess Apple does tend to let
the reviews happen earlier
you know then the release on some of
their stuff and their because it's a new
product category two they're trying to
drum up you know get up a little bit
about a little over a little off be off
to a bad start didn't even know nobody's
check that oops but before we uh we
started recording I said there's gonna
be a really good podcast I've been wrong
so far it's been entertaining yeah we're
proving we're not Apple fanboys at least
yeah no no one could ever say that we're
Apple fanboys ever except for maybe
feisty over there I'm waiting for I'm
definitely waiting for a youtube comment
on the YouTube side of things was like
oh they lost all credibility when it
comes to Apple products were like good
like so you guys want me to abuse a
relationship of mine and give you some
insider information on the Apple watch
yes for this yeah my wife's cousin
actually works at the local apple store
and chatting with him the other day just
general conversation I wasn't
specifically asking about the watch but
he and the rest of the employees they're
getting some rather intense training
look for the watch coming up and not
just general device you know here's the
specifications but they're actually kind
of taking a jewelry approach he said
mMmmm so they're you know they're gonna
be pushing the wad I shouldn't say
pushing the watch but you know marketing
the watch in store from a jewelry and
accessory perspective instead of a
device perspective I mean that that
sounds a little bit smart but at the
same time it's going to be weird seeing
those kinds of jewel cases and stuff and
the apple store and much less have that
that I bet you they're gonna get like a
model some dude in this some dude in a
suit standing outside of the apple store
psycho have you seen the Apple watch
various a very successful looking woman
in her mid 30s wearing a pantsuit like
you notice my gosh wink like it with
mincha literati sorry gone yeah I was
adding on to the nonsense I was just
bouta go ahead that's all I was gonna do
I was gonna say there gonna be some guy
standing up front possibly me wearing an
Android wear watch me like all
you see in the new Apple watch all right
not to totally derail this but have any
of you seen the of what was that it was
on one of the late night I came from
what show where that was the Apple
pocket watch didn't know no but that
sounds hilarious I can't remember who it
was maybe it was I don't remember i
watched so many late night you know the
skits and stuff but anyway it was just
it was just an iphone with a one of
those like staying with you one of those
Clips you know that useful a clipboard
clip to it and then it was a a wallet
chain it was pretty funny i wish i had a
link but about a week ago but it just
popped in my head when he said that the
apple yeah they called the apple pocket
watch yeah and it's like it's like it's
more than just a clip and a wallet chain
it's it was some ridiculous price like
2,000 something you know it was but it
was pretty funny but an apple got 300
pre-orders that night for a product it
didn't exist so I do ask well you know
while we're on the topic even if we uh
this isn't the released week for it but
it is the review released week I guess
for this device amparo it's the embargo
embargo firm yeah so uh I guess does
anyone think that I mean I can see some
rich people buying the the expensive
$10,000 edition 17 but I guess for me
the thing is people spend that much on
watches yes but those watches last many
years I would think you know I don't you
know I'm sure there are between who
trade out their watches every year but
usually when you invest 10 grand and a
watch you're keeping it for a long time
do you think Apple huh I mean I haven't
heard anything from Apple but do you
think they have any kind of you almost
think they'd have to have some kind of
like contingency like hey we'll replace
you know we'll be able to replace the
band you don't look through the watch
internals for so many years you know
Apple show them something along those
lines because the fact is spending ten
thousand dollars or something to be
obsolete next year seems pretty crazy
then we'll see that's that's an
assumption that we're making that it
will be obsolete the thing that we've
seen with smartwatches up until this
point is that as long as the intern as
long as the software itself doesn't
massively evolve the internals can
remain the same and there's so many
Android wear
applications and iterations out there
that all kind of basically follow the
same type of specification sheet that
you know I want to be surprised if the
Apple watch was a standalone product and
they never refreshed it of course that's
that's a little Christie say and imagine
but i think that the release cycle for
an Apple watch is not going to be
something that makes ten thousand
dollars a waste that's what I keep
thinking well I suppose it's true to an
extent because they're probably doesn't
need for a brand new one every year but
as bad or technology hopefully some day
gets better that would make a difference
you know true and that also assumes and
I don't like assuming but that also
assumes that Apple uh things that they
got the design of this first one so
right don't know i don't agree with that
at all oh yeah do you guys like the
looks of this thing i mean at all up i
actually don't mind it so much i don't
think it's that bad click shut the
nonbeliever sorry yeah don't hang up on
me but you know as far as a SmartWatch
goes having a display on it it you know
it's not too until you turn it on and
look at the US that's another story but
physical build I can live with it as a
SmartWatch you know I did kind of agree
it was one the review started coming out
that I started really reading up on the
build quality of the thing and I I do
kind of agree it does seem to have a
nice Sheen to it you know and it has
this this this air of build quality
that's quite nice and I will admit that
I've seen the videos from particular
websites of the occult a crown I believe
the knob yeah that's rolls through
everything that's actually not a bad
idea I like it I'll admit I like that
aspect I thought that was cool but I
called a crown for real yeah it's called
the crowd narcissistic bastard zzz's
that's actually the term for that I look
at an apple specific term Oh am I
thought it is a watch term real watch
term I think yeah that's that's what
it's always been called on a watcher I
did not know that I just it just seems
so like ridiculous Apple calls all the
crown recall the watch face the jewels
so you can have the crowning jewels all
the time feel like a king when you buyer
10
another smart watch like yeah it just
sounds like something Apple would do I'm
sorry if it's actually going around that
is my bad yeah yeah everyone feels like
a king when they have the Apple watching
the first time the watch goes on the
silence well yeah I guess I guess our
sophisticated cells probably just refer
to it it's like a knob but it is
technically called a crown just to be
fair that's not an apple thing and it
does know that I agree with jose i like
to call something like a knob that just
doesn't sound like apples thing like it
all sound it doesn't sound regal enough
if we're gonna continue with this whole
royalty analogy um well yeah I 2.5 d
glass is what it's usually called but
that's you know the shape of the top the
rear of it aside from just being an
optical sensor for heart rate monitoring
it actually looks like what the back of
expensive watch would look like and I
can't help but think that most of these
review units happen to be at least the
mid-range ones because I imagine the 349
one is not going to really have that
same that same look then you know you
got to give credit where credit to do we
I obviously looked at a couple of
high-end websites that are kind of
around our level on in terms of video
production if not higher the obvious one
being the verge and you know they they
obviously have their filmmaking creating
the image of this watch so what looks
incredibly nice and very very shiny on
video might end up looking like a dud in
real life to me through some but ya know
I I agree that I guess when I first saw
the Apple watch and ever since then it
wasn't that's ugly I mean at first it
kind of like it's not that it's ugly
it's the Apple usually tries to you know
not just do another me too they try to
outdo their design in some way and the
Apple watch if you didn't know it was an
Apple watch you would just think it was
any other smart watch you know mm-hmm so
there's something wrong with the design
in my opinion there's just nothing
special about it either if that makes
sense you know sure but it has been a
crown come on exactly presently shoulda
called it was the I crowd holy crap I
would have fit right in this opportunity
the thing that's getting me about all
the reviews though is at
it feels like the HTC One m9 thing all
over again words it probably has
pre-release software um I was reading
yeah Burgess why I made it down to the
point where he said it was like oh yeah
you know we reached out to apple and
they said that they were gonna update it
to fix a lot of these issues and I
stopped reading the review right there
it's like what the hell is the point of
continuing to read if the whole
experience is going to be different in
the next 14 to 21 days you know so it's
the same thing with Android wear if you
guys remember when Android worth where
first came out like oh my god it was
terrible like I remember like turning on
my watch and screen tearing all the time
like apps wouldn't open properly I
turned off the Google fit step counter
because it thought that me typing was me
walking so I had like a hundred thousand
steps every day I was like I can't do
this I need to turn this off so
congratulations you've walked a hundred
thousand steps today I was like
congratulations you're being disabled
forever so like you know and then you
see like the results from that like you
know was been you know 810 months later
and you know it's the OS is almost in
theming it's got the same basic core
functionality stuff but it's you know so
much better it's got a lot more polish
and like even my you know the LG G watch
that I have you know on me it works so
much better there's less drops it's
faster you know the apps work better the
the faces apply better and work better
no more screen tearing and it you know
like a josh was saying like you know
that the specs probably don't need to
change you know 12 months from now once
Apple gets a few of these updates down
the line you know it's going to be I
think that it's gonna work a little bit
better than it does now so I think you
know I think it's going to be a one of
those things it's a wait-and-see kind of
thing I think it's too early to say
whether the watch is actually good or
bad right now well you know bowl it's
right now that obviously reviews are
going to focus on and right now that
we're going to hopefully get our own
versions hopefully 23 49 versions who
knows I really do hope the entra thority
doesn't go too crazy on the Apple watch
out against the mid-range ones or
anything we don't need the super
expensive ones always need to be able to
compare the UI we don't exactly
we care about the bill call you maybe we
can even go to a store and just look at
it and compare it to a couple things
like for example like did you watch more
the urbane and stuff um or the while we
watch you know whatever but it's it's
the right now that people are going to
be focusing on and it does seem like
everything so basic still you know it's
still a full-on Notification Center and
this was this is the one that I that I
saw pretty much across the board
everyone was unhappy about it's a
catch-all for all notifications so
you're literally getting a beep and
vibrate for every single little thing
that happens on on your phone and it's
that's obviously where a lot of these
smartwatches kind of fail because a lot
of people don't want to be reminded of
just how much they're missing and that's
the kind of the reason why Anna and I we
don't have to bring it up like fully
right now and talk about it but that's
the reason why I really enjoy the pebble
ecosystem yeah i was gonna ask pop quiz
for everyone except for phi since he
doesn't have android wear um are all of
you using your Android wear watch right
now is on you uh no i have my fitbit on
right now yeah i have a Fitbit on right
now is what I go and then feisty you
don't do you have any any of you to
purchase none at all at this time no not
at all i got a Fitbit in the mail but
and this is because you're joining our
our fit group or whatever what do we
call it no it's officially called but
yeah okay i am carrying my weight a
little bit inappropriately at the moment
yes i'm joining the curl the club yeah
see that's the other side of the coin is
the fact that some of the functions that
these smart watches have i've given up
on on these smart watches as being a
viable fitness tracking platform I just
can't I just don't think that they are
um I have very specific needs when it
comes to my health obviously with you
know diabetes tracking blood sugar but
also i like i like i really like to
track my heart rate as accurately as
possible and see the progress that I
make thrown a workout I don't have a
Fitbit but I have a polar and for a
hundred and I i used the heart rate
monitor strap that goes under your your
war on your torso I should say and yeah
I like having that and it does activity
tracking why not I actually haven't worn
any of my android wear
or even my pebble since i got this polar
and I guess that's where my idea what
the Apple watch comes in is that you
know even though I did order the pebble
time and i can't wait for it to come
because i actually really like the
pebble ecosystem because it's very
customizable those issues of like catch
all notifications can be fixed with
third-party software that users create
based on user needs I love that but you
know I just for my basic needs i I
really don't need something that tries
to be everything hey I've learned that
too I I like I still like my Moto 360
right now my wife's using it I still
like it but I guess after a while I mean
what about I don't want time I miss it
was if I'm out and about for a long
period of time and you know it was kind
of nice to get certain emails and stuff
on my wrist it was you know at home it's
not really useful at all um and then the
whole battery issue I just got sick of
charging all the time and granted the
Moto 360 is not nearly as bad I'm
battery life as people believe it which
actually that was the point I was gonna
make earlier it's the bad thing about
and this isn't just the Apple watch or
the Moto 360 this is pretty much applies
to all technology unfortunately a lot of
the times the software is not perfect at
the gate when you get to give you units
and but those impressions last forever
you know yeah definitely oh and trust me
do I know the day I got my HTC one a9 I
got like 37 did you wear oven mitts when
you grabbed a comment yeah exactly lets
you get you anything kidding are you
having kidding me did you not read any
of the 90,000 reviews that all debunked
that stupid claim nope first impressions
last forever and apparently the HTC One
m9 can cook bread if you lay it on top
of it right one day we're gonna do a
segment on the channel where Joe
responds to everyone's terrible YouTube
comments I'm just gonna use that voice
the whole video oh did you wear my
babies I'm so down cuz that's how I
answer them in my head anyway so I want
one place I wanted to
revert back to feisty mentioned the
software in Apple watch I kind of wanted
to get your thoughts on it like
obviously none of us have actually used
the software that will be on the Apple
watch but it sounded like you had some
opinions on it you want to kind of
elaborate on that face you know Joe just
mentioned it those first impressions one
of the absolute first pictures i saw the
Apple watch like after the official
announcement was kind of that home
screen with all of those bubbles and I
honestly bent over laughing it was to me
it was absolutely horrid and I haven't
gotten over that mmm you know man just
got like this image of who's the guy
that does the design for Apple Johnny
I've right I met in like that guy like
having like a kid and the kids at home
blowing bubbles in his chocolate milky
looks in there goes oh you i I've got it
got it was electric car and drove to
Apple headquarters like I got it guys I
got it bubbles it's hard to make a it's
right it's hard to make a scene in a
movie really dramatic when you're
speeding off in a car when you're
driving a Prius um did you guys see that
video by the way on on YouTube created
originally by are you know a friend of
android authority or mando ferrara is uh
where he got that that Spanish video of
that guy laughing about telling a story
and he put subtitles about how the
macbook the new macbook was created oh
yes I'll so good I give him props for
putting that out there that was such a
great great comedic video if you haven't
seen it you guys totally should Joe and
Andrew I look yeah definitely take take
a look take a look at it after the
recording um so uh Apple I had one more
thought about the Apple watch and I'm
totally blanking right now um do you
wanna do do do they're not happy
thoughts on trying to piece it together
right now trying to
because i think it's darcy message me on
slack and i'm totally til you put me out
of whack um man what was it that i
wanted to say oh um I remember live
tweeting the event and when the Apple
watch was announced and they said that
up to seventeen thousand dollars thing I
I guess the one thing that kind of gets
me about the whole Apple ecosystem in
general is that people are going to pay
as much as they want for the version
that they want that's perfectly fine but
but the one that gets me the tweet that
I put out that got like the most
retweets and favorites or whatever was I
swear to God if I hear kids begging
their parents for the most expensive one
usually well seventeen thousand dollars
that's like that's like one year's
tuition at an average college and that's
that blows my mind I cannot believe that
and it just can't turns me off to the
entire thing in general the fact that if
I see this super expensive version out
in the wild I wonder where human weren't
mankind's priorities lie so now what you
said especially when I mean yeah people
spend this much on like I said before
people spend this much on watches you
know people who have money but when they
do it you know to be fair they're
talking you know it's a 10 plus year
investment I mean that's still a lot of
money more money that I would ever spent
on a watch but if you have the money so
be it but to spend money on something
that's technology that you know like you
said it may not go obsolete as quickly
as you know we might think but it's
still gonna go obsolete eventually you
know yeah it's unlikely muscles go chime
in that was out you feisty ya knows me i
was going to channel the apple haters
just for a moment here but you know and
and you brought up this video about the
new macbook and it kind of plays off of
that as well we're in the video spoiler
alert basically the guys are laughing
off the fact that they're ripping off
the customers and i can't help but feel
that a little bit with the expensive
watch here we're in you know it's
different material different experience
you know you're getting something for
what you pay but at the same time it
feels a little bit like you know what
let's just charge 17,000 for it maybe
maybe 18,000 you know just
uh you extra service you get a free
t-shirt you know whatever it may be but
it's like they were playing craps and
yeah I'm just gonna like it to rolling
like Dungeons and Dragons dice oh that's
oh yeah there you go 10d 20s and just
add them up well you know one thing to
think about I remember reading this
while ago and I kind of uh you know when
it comes to these watches you know real
watches that cost that money money you
have to realize it like a lot of the
times they're made by some like one
person who spends like six months hain't
you know six months hand making them
every little component you know putting
it together you know intricately whereas
the seventeen thousand dollar Apple
watch is not handmade obviously well
yeah it's handmade but it's you know
like 1700 Chinese kids well yeah yeah
but it's not you know it's it so I guess
I'm saying at least there's you know
some value to be said that well this is
this you know some of these famous
watchmakers might only make two or three
watches a year you know and so you're
buying their time you know you're not
just buying a product you're buying
their time your bank oh you're
supporting their life you know life's
work but that's not the same case with a
techno with a digital device that it's
not because when you because when you
buy an iphone or ipad or an Apple watch
the those factories in China those
workers never get they don't feel that I
remember that reminds me of the love the
tweet that I put out during the
announcement they were showing the like
the procedure putting together the new
macbook or putting together than you
watch and they're all these like die
casting and all this metal and stuff
like that I remember tweeting out is
this what a Chinese factory looks like
and then Michael Fisher yeah he tweeted
he responded to me and he was like
totally including all of the all of the
dramatic lighting and oh man oh they did
mr. they missed the part where the
disgruntled Chinese workers are hocking
loogies into the product as it's being
assembled that's what I would freaking
do oh my god
here's the diecast metal and there's the
screen crystal nothing Leila yeah I mean
it'sit's kind of harsh we are might be
being a little bit harsh on apple with
all that stuff but honestly it's this is
how you might be channeling what a lot
of people are thinking you know cuz the
the way that Apple has created this
Commerce when it comes to their own
products you know i I've I can't help
but think about just what it's like to
be if you you know if you haven't been
out of the u.s. to see just what
Commerce is like in other countries i
really recommend you you you try like
going to like hong kong and just
realizing that the entire city revolves
around things and whenever there's a new
thing that comes out you could just go
to a corner store and they have a bunch
of those things for sale right there at
at marked up prices cuz you know because
what they do is they they get it
themselves and then mark them up because
just that's just how much people want it
people will pay that much for four items
just to be ahead of the curve so to
speak and it's almost as if Apple is
playing into that and I don't think the
u.s. is quite on that level but I'd be
afraid of that being the case so and you
know it's that um set mentality
especially amongst Apple fans cuz you
know Apple fans by Apple things you know
almost regardless of its actual value
just because it's Apple things yeah and
I think that's why the Apple watch is
ultimately going to be popular eight if
it's just like the cheaper ones you know
the three you know the 349 ones like I
think that's that's how I hate to say it
because you know the floor all four of
us except for feisty has a all three of
us except professor whatever I wasn't it
has an android wear smartwatch and it's
like you know it's that they can't seem
to break into the mainstream with it but
you know Apple you know can leverage its
culture because android doesn't have a
culture like that like people don't walk
around and go I got the latest Android
because no one knows what the hell the
latest Android is anymore but you know
with Apple's I got the latest Apple
watch there is only one Apple watch yeah
i mean the outside we should I don't
know this on top of my head cuz I don't
deal with devices like you guys do but I
don't even know
the latest Android wear watch is right
now mmm like I know is your abano out
about the urbane you means whatever say
this is this is why I'm really bad in
these kinds of device centric podcast it
I'm a software guy don't know this stuff
now those photos are still on their way
so she yeah i see like i want in the
huawei won the waba which i like the
huawei watch see I didn't even know the
wall we watching like that's the problem
everybody knows the Apple watch is
coming everybody knows the Apple watch
you know there is no the Android wear
wash there's like 16 of them and some of
them are out and some of them aren't and
some of them around or some of them are
square and while you do get that like
variety you don't get that like punch
you look at that the Android wear smart
watch the boom the big the thing that
you advertised on television like an
apple has that and they have the culture
of people that will buy the shit out of
it for like no reason whatsoever so I
think that like in terms of like
mainstream popularity I think apple is
gonna win I'm not sure about mainstream
popularity buying yes but I don't know i
don't think i would not be shocked if
the same thing happens that we're seeing
with every other wearable device and
that's that they say statistically no
one uses a wearable whether it be a
fitness tracker or a watch for more than
six months before they get bored and
they move on and i wouldn't be surprised
of Apple watches the same way you know
yeah I'd say people were going to
continue using it I just said all about
them it was gonna be a thing that people
know about easy like the average
consumer knows that there's kind of sort
of like an Android where's where do you
even buy the damn things well this is a
desolated this is a culture that was
cultivated by Google and it was because
you know look at what happened when
Samsung started to kind of butt heads
with all the other manufacturers like
HTC and LG saying that they were the
phone they were the android phone or
they were the one to get whether or not
that's still true is up for debate but
look what Google did they start pulling
the reins on Android and now there's
there's kind of now now they have this
whole campaign and you see the weird
commercials all the time on you
I'll be together not the same which I
love that campaign to be honest but
that's the thing like it's also going to
cultivate this culture of we're not
going to have any one device in Android
that is the definitive device and that's
I think what Apple knew coming into the
ecosystem coming into the market was
that they had to create the one thing
the one platform and you know in that
sense they've succeeded they haven't you
know but it also makes them a very
closed-off company it makes them booty
key in that way you know it makes them
the montblanc of pens you know like like
in that sense it all so that's kind of
so they can charge seventeen thousand
dollars for watching exactly yeah look
at the point though isn't it like that
that's kind of their whole shtick is to
be like you know we are Apple you know
nothing outside of Apple is Apple you
can only get Apple if you buy Apple
example up Apple Apple Apple Apple Apple
Apple Apple orange no get the hell out
Apple our podcast so it turns into us
i'll be coming begins at forty five is
not all just chanting it Apple Wow
seafight she's got to be careful I know
he's been a little quiet you know he's
got to be careful because he says too
many negative Apple things his ipad is
going to explode how do you like I
turned that function off okay I say what
do you talk about you can't disable
features in iOS you can call ever they
tell you so having I want to I want to
come on here from Phi C then if do how
do you feel about because because Andrew
Joe and I we've all been speaking at
length about the implications behind
having a platform like this you know
having used you know you're you're now
in the tablet world with the iPads ipad
air ipad mini whatnot um how how do you
what do you fall in what we're talking
about this this commerce idea that
apple's created for its far as consumers
you know i totally agree you know that
they've kind of got that lockdown on
their products and there's no question
that there's kind of a cult following to
the apple and you know the whole iOS
system
I do think that they overcharge
sometimes in some cases i do believe
they're ripping off the customers just
because they can pay off for the most
part don't get me wrong it's still early
days that I've really never used ipads
before i've only had these things for a
short time but they are very solid
devices and they are yeah i haven't
pushed them hard but they're good units
and i'm okay with them hmm not get on
the watch again i haven't touched the
haven't dug deep into apps yet i'm still
so ingrained into android that I haven't
thought about it I haven't really needed
to you know I'm trying to do all of the
things that what I assume a basic user
would you know would want out of an ipad
but and I haven't pushed it like every
thursday i do my android customization
post and i'm always you know digging
deep using you know Tasker zooper widget
to build my own home screen I haven't
done any of that on there on iOS yet and
and I have no idea how to do it now
watch from a consumer level now Joe was
talking about how is it you know Android
wear isn't gone you know hasn't gone big
very much and I think a lot of that has
to do with no like he was saying just
the availability in the marketing behind
it where it's kind of us it nerds tech
geeks and stuff that that know about the
watches where's on the Apple side
exactly what Joe was saying is it's
going to be the average Joe if you will
now finds out about this watch they're
gonna walk into the apple store for you
know support or whatnot you can still
laughing at my joke joke the other day
yep average average user average joe's
gonna walk into the apple store but like
hey they've got to watch and they're
gonna buy one you know budget pending of
course but one other aspect something
that we've been really looking at in
tabtimes anyways is the business side of
it
um now I don't know if you guys remember
what it's like to go to it a day job I'm
not going to say a real job but you know
report to somebody at a specific time
every day there's a lot of
bring-your-own-device going on in the in
the corporate world where you know
people are getting to use their own
android devices their own iPhones what
have you and I think I'm taking a wild
guess here but when watches make it into
these corporate inventory I think it's
going to be the Apple watch not an
Android wear watch that's fair I think I
think there's a little bit more room in
the third party application space for an
Apple watch to have especially when you
consider all the different security
applications or even certain certain
apps that that people on the corporate
work space would be able to use I kind
of agree with that because Android wear
for all intents and purposes now is a
notification center it doesn't really
give you too much else so um but yeah
let's all agree with that all right we
have been talking for Apple for quite a
while at this point and quite honestly
I've had a lot of fun going up and down
that particular road because we we had
we don't have some peaks and valleys
with that topic but yeah a little bit
but because think I've had a great foot
not a foot not even knowing when it
releases yeah so are we coming
eventually yesterday 409 loosing I swear
to god though I've seen that adds so
many times that I thought had come out
already but anyway um so we this is a
device centric episode of the debate and
we are revisiting particular topics
which is why we're kind of loosey-goosey
buy it right now so our our second half
of the podcast is going to be devoted to
what has been or will be very soon
released around the time of this podcast
release the samsung galaxy s6 s6 edge
and of course the HTC One m9 now I of
course have the s6 and the s6 edge Joe
if I'm not mistaken you just got your m9
right damn Skippy you did mention it
earlier and Joe was the one that said I
don't care what anybody says I'm getting
the m9 I think you were you were all
in from the get-go right Joe dude I got
that thing two days after the pre-orders
opened it isn't only not supposed to be
really released in stores for like
another two days or something they just
sent the pre-orders out early something
like that yeah that they yeah they
released the pre pre that release too
pretty yeah so like I mean I had my
before April even started yeah I said I
was getting one and I got one like I
woke up super early it was like sitting
there's f5 f5 oh yeah there it is nice
got it I did he reports that people on
like if they pre ordered it some people
got it that day cuz I think they were
able to get it from particular carrier
stores if i'm not mistaken because some
like t-mobile or AT&amp;amp;T stores had them in
stock so if you hadn't ordered it that
day and called your local store and they
happen to have it you could just drive
right over and get it um so I heard that
and a lot of people were happy about
that so obviously I have me with the s6
lon with the s6 edge we've done
extensive coverage on it already with
even more to come I'm very interested to
hear some sort of like mini review from
Joe on the m9 like so what are your
thoughts so far on your brand new
purchase okay i'm getting ready to write
up something on probably google+
sometime next few days about it um first
first impressions are really really good
um there are some applications that for
some reason don't seem to like the HTC
One I then like a swiftkey for instance
likes to skip button presses like it
doesn't happen on the HTC keyboard or
any other keyboard I've tested just
swiftkey were like it skips a button
every now and again or Final Fantasy a
record keeper feels unwise for some
reason but like overall like you know
using the interface using social media
browsing all that stuff even blink feed
blink I had the one m7 because I was
really excited about that one too and I
used bling feedback then and I was like
man it needs more customization there's
some sites that i really don't want to
look at you know blah de blah de blah
and like that they seemed to have fixed
all the problems that i originally had
with blinkfeed to the point where i
actually uninstalled feedly and i don't
use it anymore um i will admit yeah
blinkfeed has really made some leaps
forward and I
I do enjoy reading it it's just I don't
think that ok so do you actively go to
blink feed on a regular basis to catch
up on news oh yeah during pretty much
all of the lacs not during all of the
lacs parts of my day but during all the
five to ten-minute lacks parts of my day
ok cuz it strikes me as that thing you
have when there's nothing else to do
it's not necessarily like oh I need to
figure out what's happening now I do you
know um I think that's how I am with
Google now with the the briefing on
samsung phones like it's just there when
there's literally nothing else to do I
know exactly like it is it's the smoke
break take a poo app you know yeah it's
it's the best one for news to I I mean
but uh they just say it's it's a good
phone like it's one of these like I had
this conversation with one of you guys I
think it was when you guys were we were
talking about how the HTC One didn't
have anything that was really
exceptional or was that Sony no we were
saying that about Sony how there was
really nothing truly exceptional about
it and like the the one of nine is kind
of the same way like there's nothing
like except for the speakers obviously
the boomsound speakers are still the
best smartphone speakers hands down
period ever but there's really nothing
about the phone that makes it like oh my
god it's like the s6 edge where it's
super unique or you know it's something
ridiculous it is just a really solid
smartphone like the battery life isn't
amazing but it's solid you know like
that the performance is actually pretty
amazing most of the time except for the
apps that don't play nice with it yet
but you know it's got a lollipop thing I
bet though to be is between the lollipop
thing in the octa core 64 bit processor
you know is probably just like a mixture
of those things it's like you know what
my Rams not being used that much but
it's just that the missing the taps on
the swiftkey keyboard is the only thing
that's driven me insane at this point oh
that's something like I actually applaud
you for a wine and put a different
keyboard on no cuz I think that's one of
the worst experiences I had on that
phone I don't like the HTC keyboard it's
so horrid and I that was a good written
review but it wasn't the video but I
yeah I don't know what I did it really
is bad like i was i was typing okay and
i typed it Oh Meg because I hit the M
instead of the L and it like auto
corrected it to like souffle I was like
okay HTC we need to have a conversation
one of the one of the most fundamental
aspects of a keyboard then every
keyboard needs to have is when you press
space it should change the word that you
misspell to the word that's correct and
more often than not when I hit space the
word that I had misspelled remained and
I that's the part that I hate a lot it
so it's only when you did like spelling
issues in it because I like I use a
that's a lie I never use punctuation
when I actually type so like apostrophes
or something that I make the keyboard
add in when i type in a th 80s it'll put
the apostrophe and for that but when i
type in th BTS it won't auto correct
anything yeah like not even add the
alligator out of the apostrophe I get it
would be funny but like tolerable
amounts of funny but it doesn't correct
anything so it's like but I totally get
that and then the only other thing that
I add that I've had a gripe with is the
camera software yes not the camera
itself because the sensor is actually
I've I post some pictures on google+ and
on twitter uh the sensor is actually
really good like it especially a
surprisingly good in low light like it's
not again it's not amazing it's not
phenomenal but it's really really solid
way more solid than i thought it was
going to be the post processing is
garbage yep holy balls and up did you
see that thread that i posted and
slacked the other day Josh I did I did I
did I did take a look at it and it feels
nice to have my thoughts validated in
that way because that's that's really
where I think the whole has been for
android is in how it processes the data
that the sensors create because for the
longest time we've been blaming the
camera the camera this this this
ambiguous entity called the camera when
in reality all of these sensors whether
or not they come from Sony or from any
other sensor company you know the
majority of them obviously being from
Sony how what we're doing is when we're
saying the cameras bad we're saying Sony
effed up and Sony just doesn't do that
with imaging they're one of the best
imaging company
out there the sensor is able to capture
all the data it's just a matter of what
the software does to that data in
post-processing and people don't realize
that the term noise reduction should
actually be said a lot more often and
camera reviews for smartphones because
they were it's been used way too often
and the m9 is very guilty of it yeah by
a pro tip if you have an HTC One and
under you're planning on getting one
here's how to fix at least one of the
problems are two of the problems one cap
your ISO at 800 do not let it go higher
than 800 for the love of God if you want
to see black it all in your photo don't
let it go higher than 800 and then the
other thing is a go into the settings
and turn up the sharpness to negative 2
which totally just at least from what
i've read totally disables HTC's
smoothening sharpening pros processing
yeah and gets a writ gets rid of pretty
much all of that like inky not solid
line e thing that happens when you take
photos and non perfect light and like
just those two things alone have like
elevated the camera to like at least
twice as good as I thought it was going
to be see that's the thing it perplexes
me that this company that had they
basically took their that the same exact
settings that they used for the
ultrapixel is now given that the
ultrapixels were far less mega pixels
per se than what they have now at 20
megapixels it seemed to me that they
took the software and the settings from
the ultrapixels and put it into this 20
points a 20 megapixel sensor one that we
they really didn't have to do that they
have started from scratch bad idea yeah
oh can you can do you have to do noise
reduction when a when a photo is kind of
small and you're going to blow it up but
now that the photo was blown up enough
then they shouldn't need to use all the
old software the other thing that i read
that helps out is to set it from the the
image quality set it from high to medium
because it's it turns it down to I think
16 megapixels instead of 20 and then you
get a little bit of additional detail
yeah detail from the down sampling yeah
and then the last thing that i read that
helps out is to change the aspect ratio
to 10 7 instead of 16 9 because that is
the natural size of the sensor
so HTC doesn't screw with the you know
the image at all it's pretty much is the
the camera sensor itself with the with
the most minimal amount of HTC
processing available without knowing to
go to places like the internet for
example to find out those little tips
and I hope that I hope that we've helped
some some m9 users I hope you're
listening and you try those out let us
know how the results go in the comments
but yeah the average user is not going
to know to be able to turn those things
off and whenever I review a camera I i
use it as an auto iteration i I do do
some manual stuff and mess with the
settings a little bit here and there but
for the most part I'm looking at it from
the eyes of a consumer that just wants
to turn on the camera try to get a good
shot and that's the reason why the s6
has been so good to me is because it's
camera to be honest is probably the best
Android camera that has come out in
recent years and or recently I should
say and that's why you know now that
we've heard Joe's thoughts on it and
obviously I have my review and lon has
his review out now I want to pose the
question to feisty and brush do you guys
think you're going to go one way or the
other in this in this little battle
between HTC and Samsung or are you
waiting for something better go ahead
crush well um as far as am I going to
actually buy one of their probably not
but if I had to choose Samsung which is
actually really shocking for me because
I've been criticizing Samsung to
everyone I know uh I've been pretty much
a samsung hate her for a while I thought
that I'm not gay crew later but I
haven't been very impressed by the
software I've been very impressed by the
aesthetics i want to say the hardware
cuz so Samsung has always had decent
hardware it's just the way it looks you
know yeah but I guess for me the galaxy
s6 edge is I like the way it looks I
know that's kind of a yes I know that
the edge features are pretty much
useless to be honest well this is the
thing i will say about the edge features
and i'm sure lon will will would would
would support me on this particular
claim the edge features you almost never
even notice them because they even there
whereas on the note edge when you would
turn on the screen every now and that
like like for example the thing I hated
the most about the note edge I know you
can turn this off okay but when the
camera controls would move to the edge
it was the worst idea ever and it just
made that camera so hard to use and then
every now and then you would have the
edge pop up and show you like hey look a
new story came on and Yahoo News who
gives a crap and but on the s6 edge none
of that absolutely none of that it's
just a screen that happens to slope
downward on both sides well yeah and it
comes down to basically the only reason
to really buy an edge is aesthetics
you're not buying it for the special
features i mean if you are you're doing
it wrong you know it's there's not
enough there you know but i actually
have had the opportunity now to uh today
to mess with all three of them um
because i have a friend who runs a
verizon store and so i got about an hour
with all three of them and so obviously
that's not anywhere near the time that
you've got him with them but enough to
least get an idea for how they feel in
the hand and stuff you know and i really
liked the amine yeah it wasn't a lot
different but i was surprised i guess i
thought it would be I thought the edge
screen we get in the way of handling it
really didn't know it almost helps
honest yeah it helps well and you're
touching yeah you're just touching the
metal frame basically I mean you're not
like yeah I yeah if they actually felt a
little better than that in the standard
galaxy s6 and it just looks cool and
that's for me though the real reason I
mean the real reasons why I'm not that
impressed with the m9 though is I know
that I know that there that the
overheating has been exaggerated Joe but
I do know it does get hot you know will
ring ain't NCOs you get you warm okay
yeah I guess hot probably the right way
in all fairness read all of the HTC One
series device it is true get warmer than
most because of the metal frame you know
a of the all aluminum design i guess
would be better i think that's probably
a thing to do it you know i got i had
the my had the one m7 and I you know
having it outside in a case on a summer
day I could really get it like pretty
warm like hot warm like hot or he goes
he like you could be like that teenage
girl that burned
hold in her chest bye did you hear that
what yeah her her iphone 6 was under a
pillow and she was in her her her upper
chest was lying like you know you could
you hug a pillow ah you fall asleep in
that particular the the phone was I
think running some sort of task
overnight and and it was plugged in so I
it heated up so much and the the cotton
of the of the pillow allotted to heat up
so much that it actually like sort of
burned that portion of the pillow which
then burned like her chest yeah she she
Tony Stark yourself that is hilarious
and obviously you know on the local news
everyone went nuts is like are these
phones being young I'm gonna kill us all
or something like that but yes that's
the thing every phone is gonna kill us
all apparently um maybe I have they done
any been test yet I determined that the
s6 or the s6 edge bend and bass in a
bent at the same what's the term the
resistance the same resistance that the
iphone 6 did yeah but it was a different
point they were bending it from so
really behind 6 or 6 plus because the
six didn't Bend that badly was the 6
plus that had the problem oh I don't
remember which one of us I think the
tested against okay I talk to Jace about
this because he's doing a video about it
right now and I I had to make sure to
ask him about that too or well he asked
me about it when I asked him but it's
like the iphone 6 didn't bend it didn't
have the bendy problem it was the 6 plus
yeah and then like it was found out that
like the note 3 could bend it like the
same resistance so it's it's like the
big super thin flat phones seemed to
have the problem with the bending but I
was just waiting for like someone to be
like oh I drove my car over this thing
and it bends and gate 2015 because
that's the way the internet is now and
it's extremely disappointing people
don't even realize why we put gate at
the end of certain things they just
played sarcasm to make it it is sarcasm
to mock people that's why we use the
gate thing guys and gates is us going
head with all these idiots complaining
about bending and no offense you know
it's an idiotic thing to do i'm sorry
like she's like oh my god
if you put enough pressure on something
at bens huh it'll be is the laws of
physics oh my god it's a freaking
disaster oh yeah so the heat uh really
isn't that big of a deal but I guess I
do know that they've had that you know
there's been benchmarks only proved so
much but there's an benchmarks kind of
showing that the new throttle the HTC 19
down a bit oh they do yeah and so I
guess to me it just seems like X nose is
the better option this time which once
again is something I never thought I'd
be saying I'm actually really impressed
by Samsung you know cuz I've had a lot
of criticisms about the ex knows
processing packages over the years to
you know I never thought they were that
great and I've had a lot of criticism
about Samsung's design and the only
thing I really don't like about samsung
now is I'm still not a fan of TouchWiz
but I played around with a little bit I
think I could live with it if I was
actually too it's so much better now and
I think I could live with it I still
couldn't say I would love it but I I
think there are some legitimate added
features that TouchWiz has now that it
doesn't have performances an issue well
I think you know that i think i could
find it worthwhile i do think that it
will and we have to remind our listeners
and viewers that obviously if I this is
not something that's very easy to say in
a review because obviously you want to
you want to review a phone based on the
marriage that it gives you the mayor
said it's a given rather at the outset
but it kind of remains that any one of
these phones be given that the
performance is at an all-time high now
with all these phone you're not going to
get like stutters or a lot of crashes
all the time now if you don't like
software that's on there be like lon and
he said right after the review was done
he put the Google now launcher on there
and it was it was gangbusters he loved
it so much and so that's you know there
are options out there so oh yeah well
and there's you can even go further than
that you know you can get you know
seijin mod you know there's things you
can do sure well not yet not yet not
only yeah yeah be I just think that will
be if you're willing to wait until next
year Oh Bart yeah here's the thing the
community the the the actual maintainer
is like Rama community is actually far
more efficient and quick
these things than the actual company
yeah i agree i guarantee you there's
gonna be there's going to be an alpha
cyanogenmod 12 for the s6 and s6 edge n
HTC One m9 before summer well before the
end of summer I would I guarantee it and
it's cyanogen themselves are still going
to be working on whatever the hell they
need to be working on right now but yeah
I mean uh really though am I am like
would I buy them I would almost by I
actually almost considered buying the
galaxy s6 probably not the edge just
because I'm a cheapskate so I'd go with
the cheaper options are basically the
same thing I do like the edge better but
once again I'm cheap um but I guess for
me since I have kids i don't think i
could buy the s6 even if i wanted
because of the glass design you know
because that's what happened to my nexus
4 was it went the way of yeah my kids
destroyed well back then just one kid
destroyed my and my nexus 4 so I don't
think I want to go glass back again you
know okay and uh that's why I kind of
like you know but then metal is the same
issue because metal you can get dent and
I don't know I kind of like plastic for
the fact when you have when you're a
family man plastics kind of useful
because you can drop that thing and have
it be a naked cased phone and you're not
going to have any issue yeah it used to
be a feature when you drop the phone and
the plastic back fluo I know yeah it was
fun yes alright so feisty oh yeah let's
uh let's hear your side of the story on
s6 or edge or m9 when it comes to my
wallet none of them to your own book
over here nah so here's the the big
thing for me and this is gonna boil down
to some just little things and possibly
stupid you might shake your head at me
but we usually do yeah I'm used to it
it's a good thing this is an audio call
I can't see you I am not in love with
HTC right now I've had some little
things mostly just the screen
sensitivity and screen alignment issues
with a few devices at celeb yeah it's a
little thing and it's other devices but
I'm not in love with HTC right now just
a rough patch feisty Oh it'll blow over
yes no as we go back a long way trust me
thanks about the nexus 9 and then you
got like some budget HTC stuff right
correct yes yeah but you know even going
way way back back to windows mobile with
the first full screen that the HTC touch
it was like a four no sorry like a three
point two or three point four inch full
touchscreen device it was crazy you know
before the even the iphone was out but
yeah anyways we got two of them one was
perfect the other one screen or the
screen touch orientation was just it was
toast it was garbage and yeah just the
accumulation of little things up having
a hard time trusting HTC right now that
I need to put one of their devices in
hand I need to touch the m9 and I guess
that's the moral my story here is is you
know the advice I give anybody is if you
can do not purchase a phone before you
can touch it before you can put it in
your hand and push a few buttons see if
you like it now I really like the look
of the s6 edge I can't deny it it looks
great but I also use phones a lot
one-handed and the the base of my thumb
touches the side of the screen a lot
again I have to touch the edge but just
looking at it I think it will not work
for me which leaves the s6 and again
another little thing I do not like
hardware home buttons I'd I was against
offer button in the beginning but you
know sorry what was that Ozma say like
someone told me recently that that's the
reason why they never buy samsung phones
and I kind of don't understand why what
what is it about a tactile home button
that is so bad
I do not have a mount right behind my
steering wheel in my car or maybe I do a
cell phone mount right there with the
phone in view while I'm driving it
honest I don't have that the mount
itself holds you know it holds a phone
fairly gently if I have a software home
button I can touch that without device
falling out of the holder if you know
all of the phones I've tried with a
hardware button I've got a few LG
devices I've tried when I have to push
that home button the phone falls out of
the hole dirt into my lap or down onto
the floor underneath me and that's just
not safe when you're driving never mind
having a phone there that's that's
perfectly fine so yeah it's situations
like that or you know if you're just you
know laying there for example and you're
just using your index finger and you've
got your phone resting say on your knee
which is exactly what I'm doing right
now I have to readjust the phone so that
it's in a place that I can put enough
pressure to push that hardware button
instead of just the electrostatic you
know touch of the the touchscreen home
button it's a little thing but you know
there's options up there and these three
phones I'm afraid are not the right fit
for me okay all right well I mean it
looks like we have a lot of a lot of
different opinions on different sides of
the coin I mean obviously Joe is very
happy with xem nine and then found ways
of making the camera experience a little
bit better one quick question Joe um you
have the m7 and yet i'm thinking you may
have had a little bit of time with the
m8 maybe you didn't own it but you had
the m8 for you you know what it's like
to use the m8 nope oh no no I went from
i went from the m7 to the note 3 and
then I didn't upgrade it all in 2014 got
it so you might be the case scenario
that a lot of people were expecting with
the m9 where if you had the m8 going to
the m9 is not necessarily the best
choice because the m9 has such a similar
build and feel to the m8 but you might
be the kind of person that we all as
reviewers when we were all there at HTC
frequencies we on we all thought you
know if you have the m7 you haven't
upgraded at all like this would be the
next logical step so okay so if you if
you never had the m8 then that's fine um
does the m9 give enough of a different
change for you coming from the m7
definitely oh definitely um it first of
all I mean it's point 3 inches bigger
and that's very noticeable especially
when you're coming down from a
five-point can I went from a 4.7 inch
screen to what was the note 3 a 5.7 inch
screen yep a bunch of them you know and
then coming back down to five was a much
it's it at that point 3 inches means
more than you think it would you know
just like an organ ah maclee um thing is
it's really difficult to judge something
based on it like from like a software's
perspective yes there is a lot different
than when I cuz i only made it to jelly
bean I didn't get the anyway for the
lollipop update on the one m7 because I
don't have it anymore but um it's just
you know the way I look at things like
that is you know I have a laptop when I
upgrade my laptop it's going to have a
15.6 inch screen it's going to have a
keyboard and a back in the front and a
battery and some ports on the sides of
it all laptops are designed invariably
the same way and like when I look at
cell phones it's the same thing like I'm
going from a glass metal plastic brick
to another glass / metal / plastic brick
and I think the idea that it's you know
like that upgrades are worth it you know
based on whether or not they're worth it
i mean like i went from a 32-bit
architecture to a 64-bit architecture i
think that's going to play eventually
you know that's gonna matter eventually
um you know i went from having to root
my device to get lollipop to just having
lollipop which has been a different
experience believe it or not like having
a root enabled you know having like a
rom because i had i had to run a note
for port to get lollipop on my note 3
and that thing ran like garbage
terrible rom if you have an 03 don't
flash a note for port they're terrible
we like having it like you know without
having to root it and having it is nice
um like it I can't I never tell people
to buy phones like that is just a policy
of mine need don't ever listen to me if
you're going to buy a phone I'm the
person listen to what you've decided on
whether or not you're going to buy phone
um but you know the way I look at it is
you know the camera is better you know
you're going from four cores to eight
cores 32-bit to 64-bit same ram probably
close enough to the same OS close enough
to the same speakers you know I would
people know what they really want in an
upgrade whether I want something
ridiculously different or something
that's pretty much the same but works a
little bit better but in my mind's eye
it's worth the upgrade from the m7 and
the m8 uh strictly for the updated specs
in mime in my opinion that is my opinion
ok I will pretty much I think people
were are it's pretty obvious where I
stand on this particular side I am a big
s6 fan and I have warmed up to the edge
after not really knowing it knowing what
it was it didn't really make sense to me
at mwc but after using it for a week now
about two weeks I do really enjoy it
it's really the camera that gets me
though like having to fiddle through so
many options just to get a decent shot
of the m9 whereas on the s6 I can I can
be pretty sure that I'm getting a good
looking photo every time not every time
but most times that kind of does it for
me I'm obviously I'm coming from the
video / photo creative side so if it's a
good camera that's gonna be the first
thing that I flocked to but these are
not the only phones that were going to
have this year obviously it is only now
April and LG g4 exactly the g-force
coming out I wait endure I'd love this
one upmanship than LG is doing with
their phone it's like oh you're back as
a glass horse is gonna be littered oh
1.9 f 1.9 aperture 1.8 like well i would
have been that i would have been a G
flex 2 owner i will tell you that much
if it would have been as good as it
looked at sea yes it's gotta beat you
and it wasn't honest it wasn't yeah
exactly but I was really hyped I was
willing to buy it but then you know the
reviews came you know you're
doing everything that again I guess they
have to do that's that's LG's thing they
have to do something great with the
software or else I'm still not going to
buy in you know the tattoo was great the
g3 was pretty great it wasn't it wasn't
so revolutionary that I would have
bought it in a heartbeat the way that I
kind of feel the s6 in the edge are but
really it's it's all about that software
if there if there are cameras gonna be
that good and have laser-guided out of
focus I do like that idea but if the
software is as clunky as it was in the G
flex 2 i'm not gonna be very happy with
it i really do think that then of course
we have sony a couple other
manufacturers who knows what the chinese
manufacturers are gonna come out with
this year they are gonna be some great
stuff so obviously this is not the only
debate we're going to have this is just
focusing on this particular dichotomy
between HTC and samsung so it's nice to
get all of your guys's feedback on it if
there's anybody else and here in the
chat that wanted to kind of give any
last opinions on this particular topic

ahead and sign us off I think I'm good a
great week folks sure I always for all
things an Tom wait early aren't am so

hesitate to do those anyone else have
