youngberg with android authority calm
your number one source for all things
android today we're going to be doing a
head-to-head comparison between the
jawbone jambox bluetooth speaker system
in the brave and 625 s speaker system
now as many of you may know these are
both bluetooth speaker systems both of
them are great quality they're both are
the same price range and they have
similar specs but they are marketed to
different niches so we're going to go
ahead and show you guys the detailed
comparison between both of them give you
a demo and then let you decide of course
so anyways we'll just go ahead and take
a look at the brave and really quick as
you can see it is surrounded with this
nice rubberized coating it's all along
the edges right here we have our nice
brave and branding right here and then
we have a nice steel grill where you can
see the speakers in each on the bottom
we have just the same exact setup these
are a little bit raised right here so
you get a nice sort of solid feel when
you stand the braven up in its upright
position like this looking on the side
as you can see here we have our call
back button which is actually our
speakerphone button this is also what
will hold in order to sink our Bluetooth
device this is our power switch we get a
audio confirmation that the device has
actually booted up we also have a micro
USB in and we have a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack in as well as a volume
rocker then on the other side we do have
our USB out because this supports
charging you can actually plug in a mini
USB cable and charge your Android device
then we have our headphone out and our
battery level check now also what comes
with the braven is a nice little
accessory we have this flashlight can
simply plug it in here and we have a
nice light so anyways there's a lot of
cool features with the braven of course
the braven is marketed towards more of
an outdoor niche of users this is going
to be something you bring on bike rides
and stuff it's really durable really
rugged and it with stands a lot of
damage and a lot of just up being tossed
around and stuff like that and that's
where it differs from the jawbone jambox
so anyways this is the jawbone jambox
and
before we compare the two I will just
show you the outside of the jawbone
jambox as you can see here we do have a
nice mesh grille and we do have some
rubberized top and bottom coatings here
that we can actually remove if we peel
up as you can see it did give a little
but it's not too loosely fastened it is
fastened on there pretty tightly now
anyways we have our power switch for the
jam box here on the side much like the
braven so you can see we simply move it
up and we get audio confirmation on the
jam box as well then we have our 3.5
millimeter headphone jack in and our
micro USB in and you can see on this
side there are no outputs or inputs on
the jambox getting a nice side to side
profile view here we can see that the
braven is a little bit taller and in
fact just a little bit wider and the
weight on the braven is coming in at a
330 grams and the Jawbone's weight is
347 grams so the weights are not too
different from each other they're both
the same way although that will have to
say that the jambox feels a little bit
heavier than the braven anyways on top
the jambox we do have our volume up
volume down in our blue jersey ready
connecting device come on button sort of
interrupted me there but anyways we'll
go ahead and demo both these out these
are both bluetooth units and of course
on your Android device you can simply
connect via bluetooth but for the sake
of the video and ease of use i'm going
to go ahead and actually connect via our
headphone jack also because i think it
has a little bit better audio quality
when you do something like that so first
off we'll go ahead and plug into our
brave in 625 s another important thing
to mention the brave and 62 5s is coming
in at 170 nine dollars with most
retailers while the jam box is coming in
at two hundred dollars so these are both
pretty steep as far as price but i would
have to say that the braven is a little
bit more of a value and just by the
looks and stuff i kind of like the brain
a little bit better but let's go ahead
and do some sound tests you guys aren't
left in the dark knowing what these two
awesome bluetooth speakers sound like
you
sounds really really great go ahead and
turn it down just a little bit go ahead
and manipulate our controls as musics
playing as you can see there i was
turning the music down using our volume
rocker just like that the bass and
treble is really nice has a nice clean
mid as well but the base is just really
heavy you can feel it vibrate in your
hand and you can say the same with the
jawbone jambox which will here in a
minute but go ahead and listen to this
for just a second
sounds great anyways while the phone is
still actually playing hopefully it will
play will go ahead and plug into the
jawbone jambox and also you can already
notice the difference we have a little
bit more of a filtered sound with the
jawbone jambox I'd say we're getting a
nicer sound with the braven but the job
on Jay box is doing a very nice job the
base is really heavy on this as well I
can feel it in my hands so anyways guys
some important points between the two of
them the braven is going to be more
marketed towards the outdoor enthusiasts
a little bit better as far as durability
we have this nice rubber coating
protects from Falls it's also a little
lighter than the jawbone jambox the
jawbone jambox is more for an indoor use
it's a little more expensive as well the
braven is a little bit bigger but like i
said it's more durable and in fact it is
lighter than the jawbone jambox now I
can find both of these online at the
respective retailers through Amazon will
provide links as well we're also going
to be given away one of the brave ins
and I'll have to say that the braven
does have a little bit better sound
quality than the jawbone jambox and to a
test that will just do one find a little
test here
so as you can see the volume is just a
little bit better on the braven so we
are getting a little bit of feedback
here towards the end but as far as all
the stuff that we've actually broken
down you guys the audio quality I would
have to say goes to the braven weight
category goes to the braven as well and
so does value and I'd also say that the
durability does too but if you like the
look of the jawbone jambox and it's
something that really tickles your fancy
I'd say go for it it's a great system
has great bass mids trebs all the whole
nine yards as far as anything audio
files will want out of either of these
systems so anyways guys go ahead and
check one out for yourselves pick one up
if you need a nice Bluetooth speaker
system and thanks for watching the
review guys this is clean youngberg with
