handy the Android authority app guy
after the intro we'll take a much closer
look at the new Google Music the first
thing you'll notice is the complete
change in design google music has
adopted the same kind of card view that
you would find in the Google Play Store
so while the experience is vastly
different from the old Google music the
design elements are actually quite
similar to some current google apps when
you open the interface and click on the
top left you'll be shown a list there is
listen now my library playlist radio and
explore this not only helps you enjoy
your own library but gives you an
interface to explore google music and
the content you can find there when you
go to any area where there are artists
songs or playlists they show up as
little cards not unlike in the Google
Play Store this is definitely nicer than
the list view that Google Music used to
use at the bottom right is a three dots
button and we'll talk more about that
here in a minute the whole interface
essentially revolves around this main
premise when you're exploring new
artists it's more or less the same
interface as selecting an artist from
your personal library so once you get
used to the functionality you can get
through the whole app without much of a
problem as a whole the interface is more
colorful and more complicated gone as
the dark background with a simple
ListView where you just select your
songs it's more focused on the entire
experience of google play music instead
of just replaying the music in your
library this leads us in the
functionality if you strip it all the
way down the functionality is about the
same you open the app you select some
music and then it either plays it from
your device or streams it from your
library if you've uploaded it to Google
you can still use the play music for
everything that you could before
nothing has been removed however the big
improvements come from all the
additional stuff you can do you can now
browse music directly from the Google
Play app rather than being required to
open the Google Play Store and browse
that way so you no longer need two
applications to get the full experience
of Google music that said the biggest
change is how it rolls the personal play
music experience and the Play Music
Store all into a single experience you
cannot enter one part of the app without
all the other parts following you
you'll be recommended music based on
your playlists and radios and you'll be
shown your own music when exploring new
stuff the last basic feature we'd like
to cover before we get into the paid
stuff is the radio function you can
create radio stations based on an artist
in your library so if you like the band
local
hu can create a station and it'll play
music from the same genre as local h you
can also create stations based on albums
songs and even genres of course it would
be irresponsible if we didn't mention
the most talked about new feature of
played music the subscription service
for now at $7.99 if you sign up before
June 30 2013 and presumably $9.99 a
month after that they're calling this an
all-access pass and it is pure awesome
here's how all access works you can
listen to anything available on the
Google Play Store it's really that
simple any artists any song available on
the Google Play Store is yours to listen
to just go to the artists page find a
song and click it and it'll play right
away essentially Google's music library
becomes yours lastly to best use this
service each artist has a three-dot menu
button that we mentioned earlier by
pressing on that you can start a radio
station using any artists song etc as a
base thus you can launch a radio station
from anywhere and listen to music
immediately overall the new Play Music
experience is amazing it's finally grown
up into a full-fledged Google service
and it's one that all music lovers can't
appreciate even without all access
features your library pops out at you
and why only Google can manage and the
design is a change so dramatic in a
positive way that it makes the app fun
to use again with the all-access pass
all bets are off the way it's designed
you can literally blend your entire
library with Google's entire library and
not even notice the whole app is your
oyster to do with as you please as
stated earlier this may not mean much to
Spotify customers since Google doesn't
have the 20 million tracks that Spotify
does but when Google expands our library
to match that Spotify will have a hard
time convincing people to hang around
