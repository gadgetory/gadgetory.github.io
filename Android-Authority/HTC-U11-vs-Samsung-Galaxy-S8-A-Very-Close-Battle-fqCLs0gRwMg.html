authority and HTC has always been sort
of an underdog and if there ever was a
year to root for the underdog this might
be the year the HTC u 11 was just
recently released but how does it stack
up to arguably one of the best Android
phones currently on the market let's
find out with the HTC u 11 versus the
Samsung Galaxy f8 so for the full
rundown on both of these devices make
sure to check out their respective
reviews if you haven't already as this
comparison is going to be fairly light
on specs and focus more on how these two
devices compare in terms of how I feel
about them and their overall experience
even though it may not look like it at
first glance the SI + u 11 are more
similar than they are different they're
both being powered by the latest
Snapdragon a 35 and 4 gigabytes of RAM
so these are very fast phones they're
also both dust and water resistant with
IP 68 on the s8 and IP 67 on the U 11
that wasn't intentionally supposed to
rhyme but it did they're also built from
very similar materials you've got mainly
glass bodies and metal frames and they
both feature curved edge glass on the
front rear panels that seamlessly melt
into the metal frame you won't find any
sharp or rough edges on either one of
these devices which makes them both very
comfortable to hold and they just look
extremely sleek the only downside of
course is that they attract finger
prints like crazy but the U 11 is
definitely more eye-catching device when
looking at these two from the back the
mirror like finish or liquid glass
surface as HTC likes to call it is not
only unique but it's very beautiful to
look at especially with how some of the
colors are able to shift and change
depending on the lighting and angle if
you're looking at the SI Nu 11 from the
front the s8 will more than likely be
the one that grabs your attention the
screen practically goes completely edge
to edge and the bezels are incredibly
thin allowing the screen to truly be the
center of attention the screen itself is
also just gorgeous to look at with
fantastic colors brightness and vibrancy
it really is the best-looking display on
Bart phone right now that isn't to say
that the you 11 screen is bad by any
means in fact it's actually quite the
opposite it's a great looking screen in
its own right and because it's still
sixteen by nine you won't have to deal
with any awkward black bars above and
below the display but it's certainly not
going to turn any heads being surrounded
by much thicker bezels the other benefit
with the thinner bezels in combination
with the 18 and a half by nine aspect
ratio is being able to have a larger
screen in a smaller body both the Si and
si plus have a bigger screen than the
you 11 and the si plus is fairly
comparable in size to the 11 despite
having a screen that's over a half an
inch larger just because the SI has a
better screen does not mean it's the
superior smartphone the SI does have its
flaws and there's a few things that I
actually think the you 11 does better
than the s8 the first and most obvious
one is the fingerprint sensor the you 11
fingerprint sensor is in a much more
convenient location and in my experience
is much more reliable and a lot faster
the SI does have alternative methods for
unlocking the phone like the iris
scanner and the facial recognition but
this bill doesn't really make up for the
awkwardly placed fingerprint sensor if
you care about headphone jack and the
convenience of having a headphone jack
the s8 will be the way to go
but the U 11 offers a far better audio
experience both through the external
speakers and through the headphones The
Weeknd hollow-sounding single bottom
firing speaker on the s8 just doesn't
compare to the tweeter and woofer combo
of the U 11
not only does the U 11 have two speakers
but it's leveraging the entire body of
the phone as an acoustic chamber which
makes it sound much louder and fuller
the Elevens included you Sonic USB
type-c earbuds feature active noise
cancellation and sound fantastic for a
pair of earbuds but you can still plug
in any headphones that you want with the
three-and-a-half millimeter to USB
type-c adapter this adapter also has a
DAC built inside of it so any pair of
headphones that you have will sound much
better on the u11 then they would on the
s8 and you should be able to properly
drive much higher impedance headphones
the last thing that the U 11 does better
than the S 8 / s 8 plus is battery life
despite having a smaller battery
or in the case of the s8 the same size
battery I find myself getting through a
full day with you 11 much easier the
upside to the SI is that you have
wireless charging so you have more
options when it comes to charging which
is great
but if you care more about battery life
the you 11 does a much better job now
even though these are both Android
devices these software experiences are
very different but it's sort of a toss
up because I think the software on the
SI + u 11 are very good in their own
ways
Samsung has done a fantastic job of
improving their software over the last
couple of years and aesthetically it has
a very clean and minimalistic look on
the s8 the icons text and colors are
much more appealing now and there's a
lot of nice little touches like the
Infinity wallpapers or the new swipe up
gesture to get to the app drawer the
biggest problem that Samsung still has
what the software is all the extra
bloatware and Samsung applications that
duplicate what Google is already doing
HTC took care of this problem last year
with the HTC ten so you won't find any
duplicate apps on the U 11 but the Sense
experience itself could use a revamp
considering it hasn't changed all that
much over the last year or so and it's
starting to feel a little bit dated AI
assistants are becoming a pretty big
trend and even though the SI + u 11 come
with Google assistant that didn't stop
Samsung and HTC from creating their own
you've got big speed on the SI + sense
companion on the u 11 and it's not see
companies creating some competition but
neither one of them are doing anything
groundbreaking or different from what
Google is already doing for you
Bixby is also very half-baked right now
and since companion doesn't have a voice
component so you'll still be relying on
Google assistant or Amazon's Alexa
Wendy's support for that comes out
historically when deciding between the
cameras of Samsung and HTC Samsung has
always been the better choice but this
year the decision is going to be a lot
tougher both of these cameras are
incredible in terms of picture quality
Samsung does crank up the colors in
contrast a lot which most people
including myself don't really mind but
if you'd rather have a more natural and
lifelike image the u11 does a much
better job what really separates these
cameras are the features Samsung decided
to have a little fun this year by adding
some snapchat as filters which snapchat
users will really appreciate and the
front-facing camera now has autofocus to
help you take better selfies the 11 on
the other hand is really great if you
enjoy shooting video it can record 3d
audio and has five axis image
stabilization to help you get smoother
looking footage it's been a long time
since both Samsung and HTC black ships
went completely neck-and-neck and if I
had to pick I would still go with the
Galaxy s8 but only by the narrowest of
margins
I absolutely love the screen and the way
it feels in the hand and it's what keeps
me coming back to the galaxy si but it's
definitely a very tough decision having
to pick between these two devices but
let us know your thoughts down in the
comments below which one would you pick
would you pick the galaxy si or the HTC
u 11 let us know in the comments and as
