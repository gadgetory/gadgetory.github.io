curved phones and at the forefront are a
couple of companies hoping to make the
best of those curves and today we're
going to take a look at LG and see what
they can do with a top to bottom curve
on their new smartphone hey it's Josh
regard from Andhra Authority what's
going on everybody
and this is the LG G flex okay new
challenge let's see how far I can get
through this entire review without
making one curve bend or flex pun the
six-inch screen makes for a pretty large
device there's really no other way
around it this is just a big phone the
sides are pretty thin however and
completely bare but that is due to LG's
new button layout that was first
introduced in the g2 and it returns here
on the G flex that is the index finger
position on the back of the power button
flanked by volume rockers and also the
power button on the back does double as
a notification LED light overall this is
a glossy plastic design that really does
encompass the entire phone in some
pretty fingerprint Pro material however
once you get past all of that - the next
thing you obviously notice or maybe the
first thing you notice is of course that
curve when it comes to the form factor
the curve really doesn't change the
handling all that much sure it actually
helps you to somewhat reach the top of
the screen but it still requires quite a
bit of hand gymnastics the main function
of the curve however is obviously
durability as we've shown in a couple
videos before the phone is able to
become flat without any problems and
bounce right back into its original form
this is mostly useful for people who
probably put their phones let's say in
their back pockets and then they forget
that they're there and they end up
sitting down or if you're like me
sometimes you just leave the phone on
the couch and at times when you sit down
you don't know if you just broke your
phone at least with the LG G flex you
won't really see many problems with that
you'll have a little bit more confidence
in the phone because it is able to be
very somewhat malleable but just enough
so that it provides a little bit more
safety and no the phone does not feel
weird in the pocket especially in the
front pocket where you would think a
side to side curve might be a little bit
better no definitely not the LG G flex
fits very squarely in the front pocket
and actually doesn't feel weird at all
so don't worry about that all of you who
have been
and then finally we come around to the
back and this is another kind of
variation that is available in the G
flex it is the self-healing back this is
a back made of a material that is
supposed to have small scratches slowly
fade away and pretty much not be there
at all yes it can work on small
scratches but anything from moderate to
heavy scratches obviously won't be going
away our drop test proved this because
very deep scratches did happen onto the
back of the phone when we dropped it on
its back and after a few hours yes they
improved let's say the color came back
but certainly they were not eradicated
and it never quite improved after that
and even for the small scratches it's
more of a first client's type of thing
if you look very closely at where those
small scratches once were as you might
not be able to recognize them you might
actually see remnants of them still
there the scratches don't completely go
away but they do get improved somewhat
it's kind of like polishing a crater
like I said during the drop test so this
is not a phone that is meant for
one-handed usage it's meant for
two-handed usage but that curve
definitely does serve a purpose and in
terms of the design it might allow your
phone to survive the elements a little
bit better than most of the ones you've
probably owned before now when it comes
to the display we might find one or two
kind of peculiar choices this is a six
inch screen that brings 720p resolution
and 245 PPI and as you can see here the
curve does somewhat distort the image
that you can see there however it really
just turns out to be pretty cool
and really doesn't take away from the
experience it is far from experience
breaking yes I did ask the question
myself why is screen this big and
potentially this good knowing what LG is
capable of using 720p resolution rather
than 1080p resolution it seems like a
bit of an odd choice but you know what
after using the phone for a little while
I do have to say that that 720p
resolution you actually really don't
notice it after some time do I notice
the lower resolution in the YouTube
videos yeah a little bit did ruin and
otherwise a good viewing experience
no definitely not for the distance that
the screen may be away from your face
the text still looks quite good
and even when you zoom in it still
generally stays that way ultimately LG's
prowess with screens is properly
represented here regardless of the
resolution and besides the good colors
make for enjoyable media all around
you'll have a good time watching pretty
much anything on this phone or playing
anything on this one or even reading
anything on this large screen and that
is a testament to how LG is able to make
even 720p resolution work for you on a
six-inch screen if there's one place
that LG didn't want to have any
compromises it is in the performance
aspect yes the G flex comes with the
best powered processing package
available the Snapdragon 800 backed by
the audrina 330 and two gigabytes of RAM
there is no shortage of power speed and
reliability from the snappy optimus UI
the good performance was needed in the
LG G flex because of the added
multitasking additions the ones you
probably know already are the slightest
side and then LG added into this phone
dual window which is basically a multi
window version that LG has put into this
phone rest assured you will be able to
get all you need done on the powerful G
flex even sometimes all at once so aside
from the curve and the healing back that
were already covered in design the
hardware is pretty largely simplistic
the phone comes with 32 gigabytes of
storage which is a pretty respectable
amount considering you don't have any
higher or lower capacities the usual
bevy of connectivity tools are included
and are largely standard now speaking of
which phone calls did come in just fine
with everything coming in crisp and
clear in the phone speaker through the
LG G flex and when it comes to the main
audio speaker it is actually not that
bad it gets quite loud and has some
richness to it now where the G flex
really shines when it comes to hardware
is in the battery usage the phone easily
handled a full day of moderately heavy
usage and is likely to be able to handle
yet another half a day if the power
saving was on if you're just a moderate
user of your smart phone then you could
get maybe about 2 days worth of life out
of the G flex thankfully that is one of
the main trade-offs when it comes to big
phones they might be large and it might
be a little bit harder to handle but the
battery inside matches the size and will
likely last wide
while from a big phone like the LG G
flex you could kind of expect a big
camera and that is exactly what you get
here with a 13 megapixel camera optic
package that alludes to some pretty high
quality pictures while we could expect
that the G flex take some cues from the
g2 camera it does not come with optical
image stabilization unfortunately while
the app does come with quite a few ways
of getting creative there are a bunch of
modes including HDR panorama and dual
camera shooting along with a couple
different ways of using burst shot modes
one of the cool additions happens to be
in the LED light that covers the power
button on the back you are able to keep
the phone turned around in order to get
a high-quality portrait and once you see
a green light on the LED denoting that
it has detected your face and has
focused on it you can press the volume
down button in order to take the actual
photo it's kind of a nice and neat
feature that allows you to get some nice
self-portraits without having to rely on
the lower quality front-facing camera
pictures do tend to be quite good from
this camera though the optics tend to go
for the slightly overexposed photo so
for those of you that might be photons
if you look at the picture you might see
it's a little bit lighter than you want
it to be and it's even more apparent
when you use HDR since it's looking for
that high dynamic range it'll tend to
give you a much more detailed photo but
still slightly overexposed however
overall the pictures do seem to come out
quite well and are more than useful
especially from a 13 megapixel shooter
like this as I said before the camera on
the G flex performs about as well as it
should so if it's the only camera you
have on you you could definitely do a
lot worse and finally we make it to the
software portion many of the features
that were introduced in the g2 do make
it onto the G flex however I will say
that there really aren't any features
that take advantage of this curve the
only one that kind of does actually has
nothing to do with the curve it is just
that when you are on the lockscreen and
you move the phone up and down it
follows along that axis and allows you
to see the background of the lockscreen
sort of move along with it yeah that's
pretty much it
all of the features that are available
in the Optima Co I do have to do with a
lot of multitasking the main ones that
are available in the LG G flex include
the Q slide apps which are small
overlays that provide small multitasking
abilities with little windows that allow
you to get a few little things done
after that we have the slide aside which
was originally introduced in the g2
slide aside allows you with a
three-finger swipe to move aside entire
applications and stack them together
once you are ready to switch to a
different application just slide back
with your three fingers and you will see
all of them stacked and available for
usage and then finally the newest
addition and arguably probably the most
useful one is the dual window now this
is a multi window functionality that is
very welcomed on a large screen such as
this hold the back button at any point
and you will be greeted with a list of
applications that you can put on the top
or the bottom and then after that when
the two apps are running at once like
let's say YouTube and let's say the
browser for a website you can always
switch the to move the bar up and down
it's a very nice addition for especially
a large screen that you can take
advantage of all that real estate with
but overall the Optimates UI tends to
really shove its features into your face
after all when you bring down the up the
notification drop down you'll see all of
the options right there in front of you
and there's not a whole lot of room for
gesture notifications so overall the
Optimus UI tends to lower its simplicity
quotient but in the end I do like the
utilitarian take on Android even if it
doesn't come off as the most elegant
setup ever now while we don't have any
official pricing when it comes to the LG
G flex in the West it has been on sale
in South Korea for maybe a couple weeks
now and in South Korea the price
converted from the South Korean one and
over to the US dollar comes in at about
nine hundred and forty dollars now
that's a really hefty price point but
what we do know is that the phone is
coming to AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile and Sprint and
for a high-end fund like this I wouldn't
be surprised if you had to do a two-year
contract and this phone still came in at
that high-end price of 299 dollars and
so there you have it the LG G flex what
we have here is a phone pioneering what
is shaping up to be an interesting trend
what the new form factors will mean for
functionality will vary by
phone but LG took it to mean durability
and style and in the end the G flex gets
plenty of points for style especially
for achieving what it sets out to do
great performance a wonderful screen
proving that resolution sometimes
doesn't even matter and a totally
different profile make this a phone made
to turn heads in a growing market of
large phones you don't have to bend over
backwards to find yourself enjoying this
one you don't define us out bending over
odd damn it as always thank you guys
