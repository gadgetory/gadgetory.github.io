was brought to you by bitdefender mobile
security welcome back to another special
edition of Android weekly my name is
Jace and if you miss the live broadcast
of the Samsung Galaxy s5 launch we have
you covered we also find out who won
they prediction game hint we have two
winners with t-shirts coming your way
here now today's launch commenced with
some lovely but painfully long
orchestral music until we finally saw
the goods BAM no more rumors this is the
gs5 now the first thing you'll notice is
that there is no faux leather as the
rumors suggested but a perforated back
at first I was not impressed with what
looked like a bad throw back to 1950s
furniture but the more I look at it the
more it grows on me the second obvious
thing you'll notice is oh yeah what
happened to the promised by Samsung's VP
where he said it would be a very
different design come on Samsung it
looks a lot like the s4 if you're gonna
tease us tease us with some real goodies
like the fingerprint scanner and the
camera the camera looks fantastic one of
the coolest new features of the device
is the 16 megapixel ISIL sensor the
galaxy s5 is the first device to
integrate ISO cell technology and it
should reduce noise and bloom even in
difficult lighting conditions samsung
also revamped the camera app with a
simpler mode selector and easy access to
the apps many features and settings with
features such as phase detection
autofocus real-time HDR selective focus
mode shot and more mode and studio now
the most contentious issue has got to be
the fingerprint scanner and we were
right there is one and it looks pretty
interesting it is indeed an integrated
swipe based fingerprint scanner on a
physical home button as opposed to an
on-screen scanner as was once rumored
now let's dive deep into those hardware
specs the display is showing a 5.1 inch
Super AMOLED display Full HD with 432
PPI the processor is a Snapdragon 800
but it is running at 2.5 gigahertz
higher than most other competing
smartphones the audrina is 330 RAM 2
gigabytes storage 16 and 32 gigabytes
the battery is 2,800 milliamp hours the
camera is a 16 megapixel real LED flash
with iso cell technology and 4k
recording but that 4k recording is
limited to five minutes with a 2.1
megapixel front camera it's running LTE
on all networks and the weight is a
hundred and forty five grams colors come
in black white blue and gold it is
waterproof and dust-resistant and of
course it comes with Android 4.4 now
many of you will want to know who won
the t-shirt contest for the most
accurate and timely prediction of the
Samsung Galaxy s5 and its hardware specs
and I went through two to three hundred
entries for that thank you for that a
lot of you get some really good guesses
most of us overestimated yours truly
included so the winner for the first
person who gave the most accurate
prediction was mr. Randy Jacob and Randy
gave almost all the same specs he
guessed wrongly on the faux leather like
almost all of us did but one thing that
he did not only he was one of the
earliest but he pointed out the water
and dust-resistant feature so Randy
you're the winner but I did go through
all of them and there was one entry that
I just had to mention here and that is
by mr. Richard Gao Richard you he gave a
very lengthy well-reasoned researched
argument on why he thought the specs
were going to be as he guessed now he
overestimated just like I did too but
because he did so well I wanted to set
it a teacher to you a t-shirt to you too
Richard so Richard and Randy I will be
contacting you via google hangouts you
can give me your address and t-shirt
size all I asked is you guys take a
selfie of it please you can cut off your
head if you don't wanna see your face
and I will make you famous I just want
to show that people are getting their
t-shirts wherever they are in the world
thank you for watching guys if you have
any questions you can ask in the
comments below for Android QA I'll have
two episodes this week and I will be
sure to get to them talk to you guys
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
