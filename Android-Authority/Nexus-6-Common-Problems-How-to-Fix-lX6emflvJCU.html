to you by domain.com so are you having
issues with the giant phablet the Nexus
6 well we got the top six solutions for
six common problems so here we go now to
kick it off let's talk about random
rebooting here are the potential
solutions corrupt or fragmented data and
your phone could be causing an issue
back up any important data and perform a
factory reset disable active
notifications this is sometimes helpful
you can also disable the primary
messenger application and try using
hangouts instead enable Google Play
services and GPS high-accuracy you can
also make sure your device is fully
charged and lastly wipe the cache a
partition on your phone as this can
remove any fragmented data and number
two is what's going on with the
Bluetooth connection here you want to
start by turning the Bluetooth on your
device on and off again if the problem
continues clear the cache a for
Bluetooth by first going to Settings
apps all Bluetooth share and then clear
cache a you can also go to Bluetooth
share and tap clear data you also want
to restart the phone after clearing the
data and cache a if this doesn't work
try booting the phone into safe mode now
some of you may be suffering from
abnormal battery drain here's how to
deal with that third-party applications
could be causing excess battery drain so
disable any power heavy applications
that are running in the background
unless they are frequently being used
you also want to ensure that all
applications are updated to the latest
version try uninstalling power-hungry
applications one by one to see if the
problem can be isolated turn off
vibrations and reduce screen brightness
if possible try rebooting the device
with all third-party applications
uninstalled or a factory reset this
should help clear out any damaged files
in your data now let's talk cloud print
errors and forced closings here is where
you want to update your Cloud Print
application and ensure that the device
is fully up to date then go to settings
apps all then cloud print and select
both clear cache a
clear data a tempter factory reset to
get rid of any fragmented data now if
your screen isn't bright enough in the
sunlight try this first go to settings
then device then display and change your
settings you should be able to alter the
brightness of auto brightness on your
device
you also want to try turning on adaptive
brightness to automatically optimize the
level of brightness on your phone screen
in regards to the light around you this
setting is generally on as default and
still allows for brightness settings to
be altered when needed
now many Nexus 6 owners suffer from slow
charging and if that's you you want to
try this now if the phone is charging
slowly you want to disable all unwanted
applications press the back button twice
when exiting an application instead of
simply tapping home this closes the app
from the background and prevents the
excessive drain of power you also don't
want to play games when the Nexus 6 is
charging as this requires extra
processing power you also want to check
the charger cable and make sure that
it's working by attempting to charge
using another table or charging a
different device with the same cable and
see if you have the same problem try
charging through direct connection to a
laptop or a computer see if that helps a
malfunctioning app could be causing the
problem try booting the phone and safe
mode and see if it charges faster if so
perform a factory reset and reinstall
apps selectively to isolate which app is
the culprit now this is by no means a
full comprehensive list of all the
possible problems Nexus 6 owners could
have but if you do have a problem put
them in the comments below or in the
forums at Android authority and I'm sure
there are other Nexus 6 owners who can
help you out
with their own experiences now I think
most of you have noticed that I've been
enjoying playing with domain name
extensions because it's not just about
combo or garnett anymore there's all
bunch of crazy options like guru expert
club company or of course dot ninja and
I thought it would be a great wedding
gift if someone were to buy Kevin dot
ninja and give it to our own ninja as a
wedding gift because the big man is
tying the knot domain.com is the place
to go when the next great idea hits you
it's one-stop shopping for all your
domain name and web hosting needs and
the guys at domain.com wanna hook all

web hosting when you use our coupon code

coupon code Android when you think
domain names think domain.com now this
is where I traditionally try and answer
some questions that come in the comments
and the truth is you're now all making
me self-conscious about my out and about
it's hard to undo but you'll notice in
this show I try to emphasize my about
but it's one of those things you know
and I just had to say you know there are
more Americans making fun of Canadian
saying eh then there are Canadians
saying eh just want to put that out
there
