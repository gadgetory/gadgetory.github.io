Android authority and you guys have
probably already seen it by now the
official Ironman edition Samsung Galaxy
s6 edge and it's pretty freakin sweet
but the biggest problem is there aren't
that many of them and they're really
hard to get and if you happen to find
one you're going to be paying an arm and
a leg for it so a company by the name of
slick wraps has come up with a solution
with their hero series skins that gives
you that Ironman look and feel at a
fraction of the cost but is it really a
viable solution to the real thing well
that's what we're about to find out so
I'm going to be perfectly honest here
when I first heard about this skin I was
a little bit skeptical as to what the
quality was gonna be like and how well
it actually imitates the real thing but
now that I actually have it I have to
admit that I was pretty pleasantly
surprised by it I have some really great
quality the skins really nice and it
looks pretty much like the real thing
especially if you're looking at it from
a distance you wouldn't be able to tell
that it was a skin it looks exactly like
the the real Iron Man Edition Galaxy s6
edge now the next thing that I want to
talk about is the installation process
and not necessarily how to install the
skin because it's pretty simple and
straightforward especially if you've
installed the skin before in the past
this will all be very familiar
terra-tory but if you haven't I would
definitely recommend checking out slick
wraps as installation instructions on
their website and they sort of recommend
that themselves there's a little card
inside the packaging that tells you to
check out the installation instructions
if you've never installed a skin before
but the process does take a little bit
of time especially if you install pretty
much every single piece and there's a
lot of components to it obviously
there's a front in the back piece then
you have the side pieces that wrap
around the metal frame and then there's
all the smaller components like the
camera the heart rate sensor and the
fingerprint sensor as well or the home
button rather so it does take a little
bit of time and I would say that it sort
of ranges between easy and moderate
difficulty depending on which pieces
that you're trying to install and
another thing that would recommend is to
have a blow dryer
on hand just in case you're dealing with
any parts of the skin that are a little
bit finicky and don't want to say down
you'll want to blow-dry them to make
sure that they adhere better I didn't
have any issues with the skin lifting so
I didn't really need one but that's just
another tip that I can give to you guys
as far as how to install this skin now
I'm not a hundred cents sure if all of
slick wraps is packaging is like this
but the one that I have came with a
bunch of duplicate pieces for a lot of
these smaller components so if you do
happen to mess up on any of the pieces
you do have a extra piece to work with
another thing to note is the skin for
the home button so if you happen to use
the fingerprint sensor to unlock your
phone if you do use this skin the
fingerprint sensor will not work
obviously because you have a sticker
covering the button now so it's not
going to be able to read your finger
anymore so that's just something to keep
in mind but if you don't use the
fingerprint sensor at all it's obviously
not going to be that big of a deal one
of the coolest things about the skin is
that it's not limited to just the s6 and
the s6 edge you can actually get it for
a couple of other phones including the
iphone but the benefit with the s6 and
the s6 edge is that you can actually get
the additional skin for the samsung
wireless charger that you can turn into
an arc reactor so if you have an s6 or
an s6 edge you do have that as sort of a
bonus as far as pricing is concerned
you're looking at $25 for the actual
skin itself and an additional $4 for the
wireless charging skin keep in mind the
wireless charger itself is not included
so you do have to buy that separately
but I think this is a great alternative
to the real thing and it's only a
fraction of the price to the real Iron
Man Edition galaxy s6 edge and I think
slick wraps did an absolutely wonderful
job with it it looks really convincing
and the quality is absolutely there and
it fits extremely well
so if you're an Iron Man fan it's
definitely worth the look but that's
going to do it for this video guys if
