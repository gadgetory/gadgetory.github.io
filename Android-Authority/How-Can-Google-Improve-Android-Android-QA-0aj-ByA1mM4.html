Jace and today my friends I am on a
mission that's right I Jace will strive
to lead the Android army to improve our
beloved Android now I love Android but I
am going to say some things today that
will upset some Android love and geeks
but it needs to be said so here we go
okay you see this this is the iphone no
it's the original iphone the phone is
seven years old my wife still uses this
phone today why because it works and
it's fast and it's reliable no you can't
play Angry Birds or a lot of other you
know more current iOS apps on it but it
does everything she needs to do she
texts she browses and she does emails
and makes phone calls and it does that
just about as well as it did seven years
ago you see this my galaxy note it's
only three years old and it doesn't do
anything as well as the iphone does yeah
I know host of android authority just
said that an iphone that seven years old
is better than a much more recent
android phablet you know why because
android sucks on older phones and
entry-level phones you see i had the
privilege to travel to over 19 countries
around the world and many of those
countries were poor developing countries
I'd be in a village where there was
nothing but mud huts but in addition to
those mud huts they often had a cell
phone and this was way back in the late
90s there would be one elder in the
community who would manage the use of
some sort of mobile phone and this
mobile phone became like the the center
of the community socially not only would
they use it to make phone calls but they
would use it to make banking
transactions it became a social center
that the community would rally around so
much of the developing world has just
passed over the PC revolution and are
now knee-deep in the mobile revolution
hence the huge demand for smartphones
right around the world there's huge
demand and right now android isn't
meeting that need very well and right
behind androids heels are the Chinese
manufacturers who are exceedingly good
at producing you know sufficient quality
electronic devices at scale china has
also invested millions of dollars an
alternative operating systems if Android
continues to leave themselves vulnerable
those Chinese companies are going to
exploit that I know I would if I were
them android needs to fix that number
two is a direct line to Google services
so for example if I need to set an
appointment for another meeting so I
don't forget I first have to wake the
device unlock it or enter my password
then select the app that I want to use
wait for it to load of course and then
input that data now those are the steps
or barriers that's put in between me and
the tests that I want to complete with
my phone now Google now of course is an
attempt to reduce all of that just to
voice dictation or work voice
recognition which works fantastic on
flagship powered phones the vast
majority of those billion plus users
that Google touted at Google i/o last
year those people aren't using you know
kitkat they aren't using nexus fives or
the note 3 they're using you know sub
125 dollar powered Android devices and
they don't use those google products
very well if at all so for people like
me who are very a DD and fast-paced i
want those barriers removed so i can
just tell the phone what I need it to do
and get it done now and not have to
fiddle with a whole bunch of steps in
between number three privacy management
now of course this is all tied into what
has got to be the biggest news story of
last year regardless of your interest or
niche and that was the privacy
infringement on behalf of the American
NSA the National Security Agency now I
don't to blame just the US because
there's evidence to believe that many
countries intelligence agencies are
doing the very same thing but they are
watching everything we do on our phones
on our browsers
everything not just expect a suspected
terrorists and not just you know
suspected suspicious activity but like
everyone for everything and Google does
allow us to manage our privacy at least
a little bit if you go to your account
on google you will see there are some
options to manage and control your data
and control how Google uses that data
but it's limited now for those of you
don't know google makes their you know
billions of dollars a year on selling
relevant ads to you and me and those are
relevant ads because they know what we
do they know what we search for the know
when we watch they know we don't watch
and they target their ads to make those
ads most relevant to our interests and
that's fine I'm okay with that there's
nothing wrong with that it's a great
business model but let me manage that
data in my personal privacy much more
than we are now and that is going to go
really far to making more people feel
comfortable about using Android number
four is fragmentation now before you
roll your eyes I know that this is a
tired exhausted subject where many tech
pundits have over used the term
fragmentation so I'm not going to go
into detail here other than to say that
if you watch this show right here i did
go into detail about why android updates
take so long and how fragmentation plays
a role in that you may want to check
that out there's also another show this
week where i talk about that check it
out that's number four number five is
google play cards now I know when I've
talked about this in the past many of
you had said that Google Play stores are
readily available but I want to point
out that i can go to any corner store or
kiosk I think anywhere I've ever been
and buy a prepaid phone card that's what
I mean by being accessible these google
play cards if they are really accessible
at every possible store or kiosk is
going to make it much easier for
developers to make more money on android
and thereby give you know a more fuller
android experience to android users
wherever they are because most of the
world in the developing world they don't
use credit cards like we do here almost
everyone's got a credit card hexham you
know students have credit cards and so
it makes it easy for
to use itunes and the google play store
but for the rest of the world that is
really restrictive so we need those
google play store gift cards everywhere
and it will make developers happy and
users happy all right android army your
homework for this week's Q&amp;amp;A is if you
think i am full of it where you think I
missed something please put it in the
comments below what do you think needs
done to improve our beloved Android
here's what I am going to do I am going
to put 5 comments under my own name in
the comments below one for each point
that i mentioned that needs to be done
to improve android if you agree with
them thumb them up if you disagree thumb
them down i will also some up or thumb
down your own suggestions and we will
see which persons suggestions rise to
the top the first non android authority
host that has the highest thumbs up will
win this week's t-shirt love to connect
with you here on google+ or android you
don't wanna forget about my brothers in
android Josh Joe and the tech ninja
Kevin and of course Chris I shall talk
to you next show on androids QA</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
