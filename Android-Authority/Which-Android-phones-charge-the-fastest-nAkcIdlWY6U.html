Laura T now our smartphones all use
batteries in fact they're rechargeable
batteries and when the battery is
depleted we plug in the phone to
recharge it it's something that we do
almost every day sometimes without even
think we just plug in our phone and off
we go and do something else but since
it's something that we do every day
wouldn't it be nice if we can actually
find out which phones charge the fastest
well we've done some tests and today
we're going to find out which are the
fastest charging phones on the market
today so if you're ready let's go phones
and the result just let me tell you
something quickly about how mobile phone
batteries charge the battery in a mobile
phone charges in two phases
the initial phase charges a phone
rapidly up to 80 percent and then the
last 20% uses less energy and actually
takes a bit longer to reach that top
level that's why quick charging
technologies like quick charge 2.0 from
coal coma quick charge three point zero
can say the phone is charged to 80% in
so minutes because that is the first
phase of the charging cycle however the
second phase of the charging cycle can
actually take much longer than we maybe
would think because there's less and
less energy being put into the mobile
phone now is what I was just measuring
how many minutes it takes to charge
these phones we've also used a special
little dongle to tell us how much volts
and how much amps are being drawn by the
phone to charge up its battery and that
gives us an interesting graph that shows
us those two distinct charging cycles so
what fold did we use well here is a list
of the phones in alphabetical order the
BlackBerry Prive the galaxy note5
the HTC One m9 the huawei mate s the LG
g3 the LG g4 the LG v10 the Moto X force
the Moto X style the Nexus 6p the Oppo
r5 the Sony is eight five the Sony z5
premium and the Asus zenfone 2 so
amongst those phones we get quite a
range of different battery sizes and a
different range of charging technologies
let's start by looking at the battery
sizes as you can see the Oppo r5 has the
smallest battery fox eyes at just
2,000 milliamps followed by the mate s
and the one HTC One m9 then we see in
the middle quite a block of phones
including the note 5 the LG g3 the LG g4
and so on that use a 3000 milliamp hour
battery now 3000 milliamp seems to be
the median battery size in our group for
this test today and then towards the
bottom we see some phones we have some
larger batteries including the
BlackBerry Prive the z5 premium the
Nexus 6p and lastly with the biggest
battery the Moto X force which has a
batch of three thousand seven hundred
and fifty milliamp hours now some of
those phones just use a normal charging
circuit some of them use a quick
charging circuit like Qualcomm quick
charge 2.0 and it's variations from
Samsung and from Motorola so it will be
interesting to see how quickly they can
all charge up their batteries so I want
to start off by showing you the charging
profile of the huawei mate s it doesn't
have any particular quick charging
technology and it just uses a normal 5
volt 2 amp charger so let's have a see
what its profile looks like so as you
can see this phone draws 7.5 watts from
the charger for an hour and a half now
it does this level of 7.5 watts by using
five point one volts
and one point for six amps now as the
battery level reaches 80% the amount of
what's going into the battery starts to
decrease it drops down to five watts at
one hour 40 minutes and right down to
two watts at the two hour mark in fact
it goes down to almost one watt as the
battery reaches a hundred percent now
the total charging time is over two
hours for the huawei mate s now the
Huawei doesn't have any particular quick
charging technology however let's have a
look at a phone that does have some
quick charging technology namely the HTC
One m9 now as you can see here the phone
starts by charging at 12 watts and it
does that for the first 40 minutes and
then it creeps down to 10 watts as we go
past the hour mark and then when the
battery reaches 70 percent of its charge
the amount of wattage starts to drop
significantly and in fact in the end it
goes under 2 watts and this gives a
total charging time of all
so over two hours so we can see the
difference between a normal charging
circuit and a quick charging circuit by
the number of watts that are drawn from
the charger by the phone however that
didn't really seem to affect the overall
charging time let's have a look another
example what we see here is the charging
profile of the Motorola MOTO X force and
as you can see it starts by drawing 20
watts and it does that for around half
an hour and then as the phone hits it
about 70 percent mark it starts to drop
significantly however never goes under
five watts and as a result of that we
can see that it has a charging time of
one hour and nine minutes so we can see
that if enough energy is pumped into the
battery by the charger then the battery
can be charged quite quickly if you want
to see more charging profiles you want
to see more graphs of the amount of
wattage and the battery levels and the
time index used to charge each of these
phones please go to the Android or
30.com website where you'll see more of
them in the written companion that goes
along with this video now that we've
looked at the charging profiles it's
time to look at which phones actually
charge the fastest so without further
ado here are the results and as we can
see with that 20 watts of charging
during its initial phase the Moto X
force is the phone that charges the
quickest at just 69 minutes that's
followed closely behind by the Moto X
style the LG v10 and then slightly a bit
longer the galaxy note 5 now what's
interesting here is the LG g3 which is a
relatively old phone still does a very
good job in charging and is able to
charge its battery in under a hundred
minutes now the other end of the scale
we see the Sony Zed 5 and the BlackBerry
Prive both have very long charging times
longer in fact than the huawei mate s
that we looked at originally earlier on
in this video
in fact the BlackBerry Prive sticks out
quite differently there from all the
other phones
so it's ranged in to see which phone to
charge the fastest however since they
all have different battery sizes it
would also begin to see which phones
actually charge at the highest rate so
in the next graph I've taken the number
of minutes taken to charge the phone and
the battery size to calculate which
phones actually charge the phones
fastest per minute so let's have a look
and it's no surprise with that 20 watts
of charging during its initial charging
phase the Moto X force is still at the
top
in fact so is the Moto X style and the
LG v10 and the galaxy note 5 we also
find that the LG g4 and the LG g3 are in
that top list however there are some
changes towards the bottom for example
the Oppo r5 has the smallest battery in
our group but actually also has the
lowest charge rate and although the
BlackBerry print was the slowest it's
not actually the slowest phone in terms
of how much it charges per minute
talking of the a5 I'd wanted to mention
that Oppo does have its own quick
charging technology one that uses 5
volts but at 4 amps to give a total of
20 watts how we tested the r5 and the r7
and we couldn't get them to go above the
normal 1.5 or 1.8 amps during the
charging cycle it would have been nice
to see that because the Oppo r5 has only
a two thousand milliamp hour battery and
it would lovely to see how quickly that
could charge using 20 watts
however in our testing it never seemed
to kick in so sorry about that so what
does all this mean well clearly the
charging technology from motorola is the
best the Moto X fourth and the Moto X
style are the top of our charging tables
and LG seems to do a pretty good job of
charging their devices because the LG
v10 the LG g4 and the LG g3 are all in
our top six we mustn't forget of course
the samsung galaxy note 5 which also has
a good rating in our tables at the other
end of the table we see that Sony and
Blackberry don't have a very strong
showing and personally I was expecting
more from these two very well known
companies well please do use the
comments below to tell me what you think
about the charging times of these
devices is charging time something that
sways your decision when you come to
choose a new mobile phone or don't you
just care because you just plug it in
overnight and the next morning the phone
is charged it doesn't really make any
difference to you also please don't
forget to subscribe to Android or ''tis
youtube channel also you can follow me
and android authority on social media
don't forget to check out the other
videos that we are producing for you and
as for me I'll see you in my next video
