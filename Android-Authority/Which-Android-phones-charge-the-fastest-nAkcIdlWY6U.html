royal authority there are smartphones
all use batteries in fact they're
rechargeable batteries and when the
battery is depleted we plug in the phone
to recharge it it's something that we do
almost every day sometimes without even
think we just plug in our phone and off
we go and do something else but since
it's something that we do every day
wouldn't it be nice if we can actually
find out which phones charged the
fastest well we've done some tests and
today we're going to find out which are
the fastest charging phones on the
market today so if you're ready let's go
now before we know the actual phones and
the result just let me tell you
something quickly about how mobile phone
batteries charge the battery in a mobile
phone charges in two phases the initial
phase charges a phone rapidly up to
eighty percent and then the last twenty
percent uses less energy actually takes
a bit longer to reach that top level
that's why quick charging technologies
like quick charge 2.0 from Cole como
quick charge 3.0 can say the phone is
charged to eighty percent in so minutes
because that is the first phase of the
charging cycle however the second phase
of the charging cycle can actually take
much longer than we maybe would think
because there's less and less energy
being put into the mobile phone now is
what I was just measuring how many
minutes it takes to charge these phones
we've also used a special little dongle
to tell us how much volts and how much
amps are being drawn by the phone to
charge up its battery and that gives us
an interesting graph that shows us those
two distinct charging cycles so what
folded we use well here is a list of the
phones in alphabetical order the
blackberry prive the galaxy note5 the
HTC One m9 the huawei mate s the LG g3
the LG g4 the LG v10 the moto x force
the Moto X style the Nexus 6p the Oppo
r5 the Sony is 85 the Saudis 85 premium
and the Asus zenfone 2 so amongst those
phones we get it quite a range of
different battery sizes and a different
range of charging technologies let's
start by looking at the battery sizes as
you can see the Oppo r5 has the smallest
battery Fox eyes at just
thousand milliamps followed by the mate
s and the one HTC one m9 then we see in
the middle quite a block of phones
including the note 5 the LG g3 the LG g4
and so on that use a 3000 milliamp hour
battery now 3000 milliamp seems to be
the median battery size in our group for
this test today and then towards the
bottom we see some phones with some
larger batteries including the
blackberry prove the z5 premium the
Nexus 6p and lastly with the biggest
battery the moto x force which has a
batch of 3750 milliamp hours now some of
those phones just use a normal charging
circuit some of them use a quick
charging circuit like Qualcomm quick
charge 2.0 and its variations from
Samsung and from Motorola so it'll be
interesting to see how quickly they can
all charged up their batteries so I want
to start off by showing you the charging
profile of the huawei mate s it doesn't
have any particular quick charging
technology and it just uses a normal 5
volt two amp charger so let's have a see
what its profile looks like so as you
can see this phone draws 7.5 wats from
the charger for an hour and a half now
it does this level of 7.5 wats by it
using 5.1 volts and 1.4 6 amps now as
the battery level reaches eighty percent
the amount of what's going into the
battery starts to decrease it drops down
to five watts at one hour 40 minutes and
right down to two watts at the two hour
mark in fact it goes down to almost one
watt as the battery reaches a hundred
percent know the total charging time is
over two hours for the huawei mate s now
the huawei doesn't have any particular
quick charging technology however let's
have a look at a phone that does have
some quick charging technology namely
the HTC One m9 now as you can see here
the phone start by charging at 12 watts
and it does that for the first 40
minutes and then it creeps down to 10
watts as we go past the hour mark and
then when the battery reaches seventy
percent of its charge the amount of
wattage starts to drop significantly and
in fact in the end it goes under 2 watts
and this gives a total charging time of
so over two hours so we can see the
difference between a normal charging
circuit and a quick charging circuit by
the number of watts that are drawn from
the charger by the phone however that
didn't really seem to affect the overall
charging time let's have a look at
another example what we see here is the
charging profile of the motorola moto x
force and as you can see it starts by
drawing 20 watts and it does that for
around half an hour and then as the
phone hits it about seventy percent mark
it starts to drop significantly however
never goes under five watts and as a
result of that we can see that it has a
charging time of one hour and nine
minutes so we can see that if enough
energy is pumped into the battery by the
charger then the battery can be charged
quite quickly if you want to see more
charging profiles you want to see more
grass or the amount of wattage and the
battery levels and the time index used
to charge each of these phones please go
to the android authority calm website or
you'll see more of them in the written
companion that goes along with this
video now that we've looked at the
charging profiles it's time to look at
which phones actually charge the fastest
so without further ado here are the
results and as we can see with that 20
watts of charging during its initial
phase the moto x force is the phone left
charges the quickest at just 69 minutes
that's followed closely behind by the
Moto X style the LG v10 and then
slightly a bit longer the galaxy note 5
now what's interesting here is the LG g3
which is a relatively old phone still
does a very good job in charging and is
able to charge its battery in under a
hundred minutes now the other end of the
scale we see the Sony's 85 and the
blackberry prive both have very long
charging times longer in fact than the
huawei mate s that we looked at
originally earlier on in this video in
fact the blackberry proved sticks out
quite differently there from all the
other phones so it's ranging to see
which phones charged the fastest however
since they all have different battery
sizes it would also be eating to see
which phones actually charge at the
highest rate so in the next graph I've
taken the number of minutes taken to
charge the phone and the battery size to
calculate which phones actually charge
the phones
fast is per minute so let's have a look
and it's no surprise with that 20 watts
of charging during its initial charging
phase the moto x force is still at the
top in fact so is the Moto X style and
the LG v10 and the galaxy note5 we also
find that the LG g4 and the LG g3 are in
that top list however there are some
changes towards the bottom for example
the Oppo r5 has the smallest battery in
our group but actually also has the
lowest charge rate and although the
blackberry print was the slowest is not
actually the slowest phone in terms of
how much it charges per minute talking
of the are fibers wanted to mention Oppo
does have its own quick charging
technology one that uses 5 volts but at
four amps to give a total of twenty
watts how we tested the r5 and the r7
and we couldn't get them to go above the
normal 1.5 or 1.8 amps during the
charging cycle it would have been nice
to see that because the Oppo r5 has only
a two thousand milliamp hour battery it
would love to just see how quickly that
could charge using 20 watts however in
our testing it never seemed to kick in
so sorry about that so what does all
this mean well clearly the charging
technology from Motorola is the best the
Moto X 4th and the Moto X style are the
top of our charging tables and LG seem
to do a pretty good job of charging
their devices because the LG v10 the LG
g4 and the LG g3 are all in our top 6 we
mustn't forget of course the samsung
galaxy note5 which also has a good
rating in our tables at the other end of
the table we see that Sony and
blackberry don't have a very strong
showing and personally I was expecting
more from these two very well-known
companies well please do use the
comments below to tell me what you think
about the charging times of these
devices is charging time something that
sways your decision when you come to
choose a new mobile phone or don't you
just care because you just plug it in
over night and the next morning the
phone is charged it doesn't really make
any difference to you also please don't
forget to subscribe to hand-roll
thorities youtube channel also you can
follow me and android authority on
social media don't forget to check out
the other videos that we are producing
for you and as for me I'll see you in my
next video
