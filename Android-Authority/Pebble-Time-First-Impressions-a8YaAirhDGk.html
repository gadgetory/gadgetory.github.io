SmartWatch has finally made it to my
doorstep so it's josh of a guard from
android authority what's going on
everybody and it's time to unbox and do
the initial setup for the brand new
pebble time now quick disclaimer the
unboxing is going to be very simple i've
already taken off the small little area
here to open it up but what I do like
about this packaging since it is the
Kickstarter version is that it has this
on there so it's pretty nice that pebble
even with the Kickstarter version not
the retail version already has some some
custom packaging here but once you open
it up there it is very simply with the
quick start guide right here some
important safety information and the
warranty for it and from there we have
the actual pebble time itself now the
pebble time has a bit of a design that's
a little bit reminiscent of the ax Seuss
Zen watch in my opinion in a Zen watch
was one of my favorite designed Android
wear watches but this is the one we have
here now one issue that I do have is
with the silicone band it's really
flimsy not that it's going to break
easily at any point of course but really
it just kind of doesn't feel quite that
sturdy not necessarily have a very high
quality but we do have also the charging
cable that is right here and it looks
like it's just a little bit different
from the previous ones from the original
pebble and also the pebble steel that
came after it so those are just the
contents of the box itself and then
we're going to go into the actual setup
for the pebble time but before we turn
it on and install the pebble time app on
my android device we are going to take a
look at just the design real quick you
can already see in the reflection of the
light there that there's quite the bezel
around the actual display but we are
going to be dealing with a color display
which will be able to see in just a
second the various little pins that are
down here and if you have a replacement
strap in my case i'd like to have wide
replacement straps then it should work
pretty well right here and i'll probably
show that the end of this video look
over to the back right here and you can
see that the pebble is definitely this
is the kickstarter backer version now
it's possible that the version that
makes it to retail stores might be a
little bit different but at least for
now we do have a clear indication that
this is the one that I
edged for on their kickstarter and then
some pins up here for what might be and
hopefully will be various smart straps
that go on to the pebble otherwise we
have the various buttons here on the
side that are available for navigation
in the middle selection and up and down
to the men different menus and a back
button right over here to go backwards
in the navigation system alright so here
we are with the brand new pebble time
app now one thing you should know is the
pebble time app is brand new compared to
the original pebble so this is a brand
new application you're going to install
separately on to here and you can
already see that there are some good
reviews on it already go ahead and just
open that up and it's going to get bring
us through the initial setup so here we
are I have double time I'm going to go
into my pebble account our pairing
process very similar to the original
pebble just using bluetooth here to pair
it to the phone and then all
notifications will come from here and
all different applications will come
from the app as usual we go through the
settings screen and we have to make sure
that pebble time is available for
notification access and we can choose a
different watch face so these are all
the different watch faces I've already
seen a few of them already and the one
that I've really enjoyed and I wanted to
have one here is the Enigma there you go
that's a wonderful looking watch face in
my opinion alright and we're all set
it's from here that we're going to find
different apps that are available for
the pebble time now all of the
applications from the original pebble
will work on the pebble time it's just
that they have to be kind of reconfigure
in order to work with this color display
here you can really see that line of red
in the middle of my enigma watch face so
you can see I already have notifications
kind of flowing through something from
slickdeals right here and Instagram and
you can see this is a nice display with
some color in it which looks even better
from before which I really enjoy click
on here on the side and we can either
mute slickdeals on the pebble time open
on the phone so will open automatically
or just dismiss I'll go and just dismiss
that one if you do the same with the
Instagram one
and there you have it just some nice
transitions in and out of the different
elements and if I go down here there's
sunset we're going into tomorrow i have
a few tasks available a lot of things
that i have to get done now if you're
the kind of person that calendars a lot
then the pebble time forward and
backward is really going to be useful
and i may not be the most heavy calendar
user but this is going to be really nice
to have so i've gone ahead and set up a
few applications for use with my pebble
time as may be expected already some of
the applications that were available for
the original pebble may not be fully
updated for the pebble time to take
advantage for example of the color
screen for example nav me is one of them
you can see it's still black and white
but that's not that big of a deal or
still remains functional which is the
biggest and most important thing but if
we go over to music bus and you can see
my s6 active back there ready to play
some music I've set a music bus and it
already has some really nice features on
it like the ability to just slide out
the different controls on the side and
you can already see it updating the
album art now if I were to hold here and
go back one more time and you can see
I'm changing the music already do one
more and head over to this particular
song it will slowly change the album art
and you're actually able to see it there
which i think is a great feature so
that's one of the examples of that that
the color screen actually provides even
more functionality and some better
aesthetic for a number of applications
that music boss is one of them I'm a fan
of the pebble ecosystem so naturally I'm
pretty excited to use the pebble time
and bring you my full review in the next
number of days or so it's not that
Android wear is really behind or worse
than pebble by any means I just sort of
like the way that pebble presents its
smartwatches especially with the tactile
buttons that are on the actual unit it's
a little bit easier for me to navigate
among the different elements of the OS
without having to really look at the
watch in certain situations if I
remember how many presses it takes to
get to an application it's easy for me
to just go in and control it but the
original pebble as you can see in the
shot right here I did cater to my
personal style with a Richard Tracy
brand leather strap now I did think that
with the grooves on the bottom and on
the top of this
time that that strap would work pretty
well on here and you can see me trying
to put it on here and unfortunately it
just ended up looking kind of weird so I
might need to be on the lookout for
another watch strap still luckily
Richard Tracy brand is doing another
Kickstarter for a wide bands made
specifically for the pebble term that's
made of silicone so I'll probably going
to end up changing the look of this with
one of those as far as initial setup
goes it looks pretty nice the animations
do keep things from being completely
fast the way that they were in the
original pebble but they do make it look
a lot nicer which I'll say that much if
you're dismissing a notification for
example has to do that little animation
rather than just saying dismissed and
going straight back into your operating
system which is a little bit more of a
pet peeve of mine rather than an actual
problem and going through the different
applications is not that difficult at
all unfortunately with a higher amount
of storage on here you do have to scroll
to the quiet a bit and press those
buttons a lot which might be a little
bit of a nuisance but we're going to
find out if that truly is in my full
review so i hope you enjoyed this
particular unboxing and initial setup of
the pebble time it's going to be on my
wrist for the foreseeable future and i
will bring you my full review very soon
