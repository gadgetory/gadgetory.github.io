for change it was a keyboard centric
smartphone that ditch the company's own
mobile OS and chose instead to go full
on Android well they're following up
that device with yet another Android
powered one the detect 50 which might
have one of the lamest names in phone
history but it's actually being targeted
towards enterprise and business users
add to that it's locating costs of $300
it's signaling yet another shift for the
company blackbird was being a bit coy
about the detect 50s design when it was
unveiled during its live stream in fact
many folks said it looked like an all
cattell Idol for well that's confirmed
because they said that they actually
reached out to TCL for the design
there's nothing wrong with that just
because this is a practice that has been
done countless times before given its
price point the look and feel the phone
is what you'd expect for something that
costs $299 you have a rubbery textured
rear surface and accented metal trim
bezel around the sides and a slim and
light package that makes it more
manageable to use than the Prive let's
be real here for a moment there's
nothing special about the design and it
kind of makes you wonder what's their
focus seeing that they've got someone
else to actually go ahead and design the
phone it seems like their focus is being
placed more on something else maybe
software right what else is there say
about the screen here other than its
specs just a refresher
it's a 5.2 inch 1080p display of some
kind with an oleophobic coating and a
24-bit color depth that's what it seems
more like an LCD screen than AMOLED just
because the color black doesn't achieve
the same pitch black tone we get with
AMOLED it's detailed it offers decent
clarity at all angles and the brightness
output appears to be more than
sufficient now all this makes it
apparent that black bear recognizes the
popularity of an all touch smartphone so
it feels right for this phone tackle on
that form factor the detect 50 gets its
processing punch from a snapdragon 617
chip and 3 gigabytes of RAM
now this combination won't raise many
eyebrows but in reality this phone
doesn't need all the horsepower that
flagships claimed to deliver most folks
who are thinking about buying this phone
are probably more interested in the
software and security
still the phone manages to exhibit a
tolerant level responsiveness with most
basic tasks for phone that takes pride
and security there's just one thing that
people might think that makes it
incomplete and that's a fingerprint
sensor well the company chose not to
offer one due to compromising the
phone's cost now while we understand
that it's a bit tough to swallow
especially now that we have sub $100
phones with them again there's really
nothing that's too glaring with the
cameras here it's fashioned with a 13
megapixel rear camera with an LED flash
and the front facing cameras an 8
megapixel one they all seem like
legitimate contenders and if you want
you can program your phone's convenience
key to open up the camera and that's by
your choice speaking of the camera app
it's pretty ordinary we haven't spent a
whole lot of time with the phone yet but
we're really curious to see how these
cameras perform the black bear ID tech
fifty follows in the same footsteps as
the prepared by running Android and the
company's detect software that's all for
overseas what's happening to the phone
like what services and hardware being
accessed by the apps and also informs
you about the phone's overall security
status the Android experience is a
welcome one
but it's enhanced by the protection of
detail the problem here with the
software is that there's nothing that
differentiates the experience here at
the BTEC 50 and say last year what we
saw with the prif they're essentially
the same say for the convenience key
integration quite frankly the detect 50
is the key borderless version of the
privy while that's a generality there's
still the matter of specs and that's
where the prep will continue to be
regarded as the superior one there's
still hope for the detect 50 even though
the software experience is similar and
unchanged that's because its design will
certainly appeal to the masses with its
all touch form factor price wise it also
has an advantage because its price lower
at $299 that's an aggressive price point
to be at right from the onset despite
that it has a lot of other phones to
compete against in that price bracket
those who are particular about their
phone security will want to keep this
one in consideration but for a little
bit more there's also the Prive right
and that's our quick hands-on look with
the BlackBerry D tech fifty if you guys
