price Samsung Galaxy fame hey everyone I
am Chris wook now when you think of
Samsung phones you probably think of its
flagships like the Galaxy s4 but what
about it's more budget oriented options
how little is too little when it comes
to specs well let's take a look and see
what we've got here the Samsung Galaxy
fame has a 3.5 inch display and is
powered by a single core 1 gigahertz CPU
for memory were looking at 512 Meg's of
RAM and four gigs of internal storage
which is expandable by micro sd on the
back we had the five megapixel rear
facing camera capable of shooting VGA
resolution video paired with the 0.3
megapixel camera up front a 1,300
milliamp hour battery provides the power
essentially the Galaxy fame takes the
look and feel of a lot of other recent
Samsung devices throws them in a blender
and then shrinks them all down the power
button and volume rocker for example are
right where you'd expect them it is a
little curvier than say the s4 and while
it's not that thick it feels thicker and
heavier than other Samsung phones
because of its smaller general size for
some it might be a little too small but
for those with smaller hands it could be
a nice change of pace
the display is usually one of the low
points with phones like the galaxy fame
and we didn't find any exceptions here
the small three and a half inch screen
size and resolution of 320 by 480
results in a pixel density of just
around 165 pixels per inch not
surprisingly that leaves us with a not
too sharp screen there are also issues
with contrast while the screen can get
fairly bright it looks washed out at
pretty much any level of brightness to
gauge performance we turned to our usual
test suite 10 runs of antutu benchmark
left us with an average score of just
above 5,000 but individual runs when as
low as 3,100 and as high as around 8400
though that one seems to have been a
fluke
we tried Epic Citadel but it refused to
run real-world performance definitely
felt a little sluggish
especially scrolling through the home
screens or the app drawer light gaming
is a possibility but don't set your
expectations too high the galaxy Fame
runs Android 4.1.2 jelly bean skinned
with Samsung's TouchWiz UI while
TouchWiz definitely has its fans we
would have preferred something with less
of an impact on performance in this case
looking at included apps we have most of
the usual suspects from Samsung s
planner
chaton and game hub for example but no s
voice the document editor Quickoffice
my files and the always handy Dropbox
are included as well looking at the
specs and the budget nature of the phone
we didn't expect much from the camera
but were somewhat pleasantly surprised
at least in well-lit situations colors
can be a little washed out depending on
the subject but photos were fairly sharp
and detailed in low-light photos get
ugly pretty quickly with blurring and
noticeable visual noise while the camera
is capable of recording video the
resolution is limited to VGA or 640 by
480 resolution so while it's okay for
capturing a quick moment it's not going
to look too nice on a computer or on a
TV
packing a 1,300 milliamp hour battery
might seem a little crazy but keep in
mind that it doesn't really have to
power a whole lot during benchmarking
and testing our review unit was down to
around 50% in about five hours but that
was pretty heavy use getting through a
full 18-hour day shouldn't be a problem
but if it is the battery is replaceable
so you can always carry a spare or get
an extended battery ignoring the budget
price the galaxy fame has two major
things going for it its Samsung e style
and its smaller size if neither of these
options matter to you there are a ton of
other options available for the money if
you want to know more we have a full
written review at Android authority comm
