by Toyota alright and now we're gonna
take a look at the biggest of these
zenfone bunch a beeees josh regard for
authority what's going on everybody and
this time we have the asus zenfone 6
alright and as as has been the trend
with all of his end phones obviously the
size is in the name so the zenfone 6
right here comes with a six inch screen
a TFT IPS display with 720p resolution
underneath so what we have here is a
very nice well performing screen here
that should allow you to get a lot of
great media you know you can watch your
media play games on here and it should
all look really great
underneath actually let's talk about the
body first it is still the plastic body
that we've seen from all of the zenfone
2 thus far and while it might not be a
glossy or even a soft touch plastic per
se it still looks very nice and actually
provides a very very light handling
phone at only 200 grams really it for a
six inch phone this is probably one of
the lightest that I've actually ever
handled the processor underneath is that
Intel Atom processor that comes in that
Clarkson ad 2 gigahertz that provides
some pretty good speed here Asus is
really putting their eggs in intel's
basket saying that it will provide the
speed that is comparable if not better
to the snapdragon performers out there
and we're going to definitely see how
that translates underneath the screen
right here as you can see them going
through the zen new high which is an
early build right here but you can still
see that is a very nice interface very
simplistic in a way it does have some
stock Android elements but it puts its
own colorations and its own design
elements on top of course as you can see
here the notification drop-down has a
nice circle circle centric design if
that's the way you want to describe it
there as far as storage goes they are
keeping it pretty low on these phones to
make sure that they are very affordable
as 8 or 16 gigabytes of on-board storage
are available here on the zenfone 6
after that there is expandable storage
via a micro SD card slot which is true
for all of the devices and that is a
very welcome addition along with a quite
large 3230 milliamp hour battery that
will allow this to go for quite a while
so this is the zenfone 6 just kind of
showing you the new offerings from
they are really looking to hit the
market very very aggressively with these
aggressively priced phones this one
comes in at 199 dollars a very low price
for a phone that should provide very
good performance in a very nice
experience for all of those out there so
like I said we're here with a Susan at
the Trump Towers and we're taking a look
at all the new offerings that were
announced yesterday at their beautiful
and fun press conference so stay tuned
to Android 34 all of the best show
coverage including all of our coverage
here at CES 2014 and once again thank
you to Toyota for sponsoring our CES
coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
