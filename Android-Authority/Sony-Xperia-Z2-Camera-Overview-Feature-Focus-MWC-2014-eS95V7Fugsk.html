by bitdefender mobile security hey you
start your guard from Andhra Authority
what's going on with your buddy and here
in this feature focus we're going to
take a look at the camera here this is
the same camera on the z2 as it was an
experienced new one but it does have a
couple of enhancements and definitely a
performance enhancement due to the new
processor inside of the Xperia z2 and
also some optimizations that Sony has
put in so we're going to jump right in
I'm going to go ahead and swipe to
unlock and here we are at the camera and
as you can see it loads up very quickly
and in a matter of seconds I've already
taken a picture it's just a great
example just how good the performance is
on this camera but first let's go
through the settings the settings do
have a there's a burst with long press
that you can have on right here as far
as the video goes you also have the
steady shot which is a way of
stabilizing your video if you have
shaken hands and then after that there
is also kind of a touch capture right
here which is pretty common when it
comes to us these smartphone cameras and
you can also use the volume key as a way
of zooming or even doing the shutter
button if you don't want to use a
dedicated camera button which is located
right over here what using a dedicated
camera button is not a problem at all
you can see there that I'm focusing on
things fairly quickly by pressing
halfway down on the shutter button
easily
and of course going all the way takes
the cake takes the picture now let's
take a look at the modes here we have
the intelligent Auto which is that
iconic icon that they use for it but if
we head into I'll go ahead and just move
this over a little bit so it's little
bit easier to see we have all of the
modes right here and these are the same
that were found in the Xperia z1 for the
most part like for example the AR effect
which one of the shots that you probably
saw is it's an augmented reality so if I
were to put the camera and make it look
at like a particular surface it would
add elements onto there like dinosaurs
walking around and whatnot
there are also creative effects a vine
app which is always lovely for those of
you who love mine there's also a time
burst shift that we can kind of use when
it's not going to be everything is kind
of stationary here but essentially what
happens is when you hit the shutter
button it will take a bunch of photos in
case your subject moved or you didn't
get what you wanted and what allow you
to pick which picture you'll you
actually want
oops let me head back over to the camera
the other modes that are available that
have been added in the main one that has
been added in is the 4k video now we
won't be able to show you a fork a
sample quite just yet but once you get
our hands on this I will be recording a
lot of 4k video with it you'll see just
what kind of quality is capable of 4k is
definitely one of the features that is
really coming out on all of the smart
phones in the Xperia z2 is really you
know no exception but overall we see
that the performance on this camera is
really high in something that we really
enjoy about it Xperia z2 takes from the
z1 the powerful optics and while the z1
might not have had the the best quality
photos particularly in the darker
portions or in low-light shots we did
see that there isn't an upgrade to it
somewhat in the z1 compact now does II -
should continue that tradition and we'll
see
when we get our hands on the review unit
exactly what does the picture quality is
like so here we are with the Sony Xperia
z1 we're just taking a look at all of
the features on it the camera in
particular really makes us happy due to
his performance I'm going to go ahead
and just preemptively rotate the phone
hit the camera it comes right up
I focus very easily on the spot and boom
we have a camera shot already it's just
very fast and for those of you who want
speed in order to get the shot that
you've been waiting for then this this
phone definitely has some of the speed
to help you with that so keep it tuned
to Android authority for all of the best
coverage we're here taking a look at the
Sony Xperia z2 stay tuned for more
coverage this is the last day of the
show but we still have more for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
