thorium lock at MWC 2017 got out of the
motorola press conference doing quick
hands-on look between these two new
devices they announced the Moto G 5 and
g5 + now of course as the name implies
the g5 plus is slightly larger because
it features a bigger display but first
things first to talk about design
because that's the biggest change with
the line just because before it was kind
of cheap side but now it has those
totally more premium design now the
difference guitar here is that there's a
slowly thicker frame wood on the back of
the g5 whereas the g5 + has a slightly
thinner one here now the g5 + feels will
more claim because it has more of a
metallic finish whereas the standard g5
has almost of a plasticy feel but that
one like the new direction of the design
line which they feel a lot better more
substance behind them and there's a good
amount of weight - so they don't feel
hollow or just too light of course one
of the other differences between screen
sizes you have a five inches point in g5
5.2 inch explained on a g5 + ferry as
far as the overall footprint that are
almost similar and they both have 1080p
resolutions other differences between
the two include the fact that the
standard g5 here there's an ox on the
bottom you could actually remove the bot
via back cover and gain access to the
battery code you can replace it but with
the g5 plus it's not something you get
access it's pretty much closed as it is
so there's no way to replace the
batteries you wanted to there's also a
difference in the type of processor
they're using both from Qualcomm but to
Snapdragon 430 in the g5 and 625 I
believe in the g5 + but honestly even
though there's the slide advantage the
g5 plus they look pretty quick right now
and of course these phones are targeted
for people who aren't gonna do a whole
lot except for the basic stuff
and in that regard it pretty much took
like there's also slight difference with
their cameras although you wouldn't
probably notice the g5 has a 13
megapixel camera with an S 2.0 after
lens while the g5 bus has a 12 megapixel
camera with an F 1.7 aperture lens one
thing to take note of Suzette they don't
have NFC so we're looking for Android K
or just quick transfer via NFC you're
not going to get it with these two hands
it's unfortunately but they do have
fingerprint sensors which is nice or
both hands are going to be launched
internationally but the g5 plus is the
only one that's going to make it to the
US if you're looking to pick up the Moto
G pod is going to cost you 199 euros
while the g5 + in the US when it comes
out it's going to be $229 and there's
going to be another model for the US
market a 4 gigabyte version of the 3/5
plus which is going to be $299 and
that's a quick look at the Moto G 5 + 3
5 + cards you want to learn more about
any of them you can check it outside the
Android authority calm John be signing
