authority and the latest flagship from
meizu takes what was already great about
the mx-5 from earlier this year and puts
it in a larger package but what does
this pro version of the phone offer
besides just a bigger size let's find
out with the meizu pro 5 it's no secret
that meizu has been designing their
smartphones to emulate apples for quite
some time now and the same way Apple
releases a smaller and bigger version of
their flagship smartphone meizu has also
filed in those steps meizu has dropped
the MX name but the pro 5 is essentially
just a bigger version of the previously
released mx-5 so it has the same exact
design with an all metal unibody
construction and rounded off corners and
sides which makes it pretty comfortable
to hold it's been relatively lightweight
and feels solid in the hand as you would
expect from an all-metal body but it is
a little on the slippery side due to not
having any sharp angles or a textured
back to help with the grip the pro 5 is
still however a sleek looking and
attractive device despite not being the
most original of designs the buttons and
ports are in their typical locations
with the power and volume buttons on the
right side which are both very clicky
and tactile along the top is the
standard 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
followed by the dual SIM tray on the
left with the secondary slot doubling as
a micro SD card slot for expandable
storage up to a hundred and twenty eight
extra gigabytes if you need that extra
storage and finally on the bottom
there's a single speaker but instead of
a micro USB port like on the MX 5 meizu
has maybe switch over the USB type-c for
the pro 5 which was a very awesome
change to see in typical meizu fashion
there's no capacitive or on-screen keys
instead you just have a single home
button but it also doubles as a back
button by lightly tapping on it and a
sleep / wake button when holding it down
the home button is very easy to press
but the feedback is a little bit mushy
and the button itself feels kind of
cheap almost toy like in a way the
screen measures in at 5.7 inches 0.2
inch increase over the mx-5 which makes
the pro 5 a pretty large phone but if
you're used to phones with 5.5 inch
or larger screen sizes you'll have no
problems adjusting to the pro/5 it
retains the same 1080p resolution as the
mx-5 and although it would have been
nice to see a bump up 2 quad HD I really
had no problems with 1080p on this
particular panel text and graphics are
still very sharp and easy to read and
consuming media is quite enjoyable as it
usually is on such a large screen it's
an AMOLED display so the colors are
bright vibrant saturated and full of
contrast with excellent viewing angles
and all of it is covered in 2.5 D glass
for those subtle curves along the edges
2.5 D glass has been the rage and a lot
of smartphones but this is actually the
first time Mizzou has ever used it and
it blends in quite well with the curved
body lines of the pro 5 inside you might
be surprised to find the Samsung made
Exynos 7420 the same processor that
powered the Galaxy S six considering how
powerful and efficiently Exynos 7420 is
this is a rather smart move by meizu to
use this chipset Ram will be dependent
on storage capacity with either three
gigs of ram on the 32 gigabyte version
or 4 gigs of ram on the 64 gigabyte
version ours is the 32 gigabyte model
and performance has been as good as you
would expect with such an ample amount
of RAM and one of the most powerful
processors currently on the market the
profile flies through all the basic
stuff like swiping scrolling opening and
closing apps and web browsing without
any issue navigating through the
interface is very responsive and fluid
and more intense tasks like graphically
demanding games and heavy multitasking
also proved to not be much of a problem
either the pro 5 is definitely no slouch
in the performance Department so no
matter what you throw at this phone it's
not going to let you down the pro 5 has
all the usual connectivity options for a
modern day smartphone like Wi-Fi 802
DPS Bluetooth 4.1 and LTE but band
support is quite limited which meant
HSPA+ data speeds during my usage on
t-mobile it was still plenty fast for
all of my needs including YouTube but
just something to bear in mind for
anyone in the state's looking to import
this device the single speaker on the
bottom gets surprisingly loud and sound
quality is actually quite decent but it
gets easily muffled when you're tightly
gripping the phone during gameplay or
watching videos in landscape so you
might find yourself adjusting your grip
fairly often in order to not block it
you
pro/5 does however come with built-in
hi-fi audio which is great if you use
your smartphone as your primary music
player and will give you a much better
audio experience when using headphones
just like previous MX releases the pro 5
features a fingerprint scanner embedded
in the home button that's very easy to
use and features a tap and hold setup
process that's very similar to what
we've seen from the likes of Samsung and
Apple it's fast and reliable enough that
you won't have any problems using it but
it isn't the most accurate fingerprint
scanner that I've ever used the majority
of the time it usually unlocks on the
first attempt but sometimes it'll
randomly miss read my finger even though
it's squarely placed on the home button
if I had to put a number on it I would
say it works flawlessly eight out of ten
times so the times that it doesn't catch
my print on the first go-around it's
definitely not enough to ruin the
experience battery life on the pro five
has actually been really good it's got a
large 3050 milliamp hour battery and
I've had no problems getting through a
full day a lot of the times I was easily
able to squeak out another half a day on
a single charge it with a couple hours
of combined gaming and YouTube watching
which was pretty impressive and screen
on time consistently surpassed the four
hour mark the pro 5 is also capable of
fast charging through its USB type-c
port with Mizzou's M charge 2.0
technology which really came in handy
anytime I needed to quickly top off my
device the main camera on the rear is a
21 megapixel shooter with phase
detection and laser autofocus the sensor
is made by Sony which is usually a
pretty good sign the phone is capable of
producing good looking photos and the
profile can grab some great-looking
shots and adequate lighting there's
plenty of color detail and sharpness to
be had and the HDR image processing
brightens up the image and brings back
plenty of hidden details in the shadows
without looking unnatural it's when the
Sun starts setting or the lights get dim
that everything starts to fall apart and
they fall apart rather quickly images
begin to look soft and muddy with very
little detail and the camera tends to
overexpose leading to a lot of overblown
highlights what really cripples the
camera experience on the pro 5 is the
camera software itself the software is
pretty simple and straightforward but
the entire interface is tailored for
portrait orientation and doesn't rotate
when switching a landscape which makes
it extremely cumbersome to use common
modes like HDR are buried in the
settings and when using the camera in
landscape mode toggling between
different modes becomes a slow and
unintuitive process when you have to
read everything sideways or rotate the
phone back to portrait for selfies the
camera interface works wonders and the
five megapixel front facing shooter can
certainly get the job done but otherwise
the camera UI makes for a less than
desirable picture taking experience the
pro 5 is running on android 5.1 lollipop
but you wouldn't really know it due to
mazes fly me OS which alters the entire
Android experience altogether there's no
app drawer so all of your applications
will reside on the home screens but this
is nothing new and has been the ongoing
trend with Chinese OEMs for quite some
time now and it doesn't seem to be going
anywhere anytime soon the UI however is
actually quite clean with some very nice
transparencies minimalistic looking
icons and isn't overly colourful like
some other skins
although the pre-installed wallpapers
might lead you to think otherwise
why me OS may not be your typical
Android experience but it also doesn't
try to overwhelm you with features
there's just a few built in to keep
things interesting most of which are
just your base like double tap to wake
swiping downwards to bring down the
notification shade or drawing different
characters on the screen to open up an
application there's also what meizu
likes to call smart touch which
basically puts a virtual joystick of
sorts on your display that can be
repositioned anywhere on the screen it
can be configured to do a variety of
different actions some of which are
identical to the gesture controls you
can double tap to close an app so I left
it right on the screen to switch between
tasks and show the notification shade
just to name a few the 32 gigabyte
version of the pro 5 is currently
available for roughly 438 US dollars and
485 dollars for the 64 gigabyte version
respectively this isn't meant to be a
cheap affordable phone from a zoo but it
definitely isn't a bad price for the
phone that you are getting Mazur devices
are not really meant for the US market
so the lack of LTE band support is
rather unfortunate but if you're a fan
of the meizu lineup this phone isn't
going to disappoint with an all-metal
build a fingerprint scanner a beautiful
5.7 inch display USB type-c and some
very powerful internals driving the
whole experience the pro 5 is easily the
best flagship meizu has released the
date and certainly shouldn't be
overlooked as always thank you guys so
