Android Authority now in 2012 we saw the
release of the Raspberry Pi a single
board computer that sparked an entire
computing revolution now in 2015 the
Raspberry Pi foundation released a new
model this time the Raspberry Pi 2 with
a greater level of performance mainly
due to its cortex a7 quad core processor
and the 1 gigabytes of onboard ram and
it amazingly still had the same price
tag just $35 well recently the Raspberry
Pi foundation have done it again they've
released a new computer a new board and
this time it's called the Raspberry Pi 0
and here it is the Raspberry Pi 0 it's
small its elegant and yet it runs Linux
with a desktop gives you a web browser
and also allows you to write programs in
C Java Python and so on and the amazing
thing is it costs just $5 ok there's no
getting around it this is just a circuit
board
there's no consumer-level case here
there's nothing shiny you just get a
tiny little circuit board however what
you can do with this circuit board is
absolutely amazing so let's take a look
at it when you look at this ball the
first thing you'll notice is the system
on a chip the black blob in the very
center of the circuit board now it's a
system on a chip based on the arm v6
architecture you also get a GPU and 512
megabytes of RAM now down towards the
bottom of the board you have a mini HDMI
connector and two micro USB ports one is
for supplying the power and the other is
for data connections and to the right of
the board you have the micro SD card
slot where the operating system is
stored and where you'll keep your data
now compared to the Raspberry Pi one on
the Raspberry Pi 2 there are some big
things missing for example there's no
Ethernet port also the GPIO pins that
were so popular on the Raspberry Pi 1
and 2 are missing instead you just have
these 40 holes in the circuit board and
if you really want to use them you
either have to solder wire directly to
these little holes or populate it with a
header the other interesting thing about
this board
is the use of microUSB which means you
can't plug in anything like a mouse or a
keyboard directly into it you're going
to have to use a micro USB adapter and
that brings me to the point of hidden
costs now although the board itself only
costs five dollars you are going to need
to spend some more money to get this
board up and running at a very minimum
you're going to need to buy yourself a
micro SD card to put in here because
without it you can't boot any of the
operating systems on top of that you're
probably going to need to use a micro
USB to USB connecter converter adapter
so you can plug in a mouse and a
keyboard if you're plugging in a mouse
and a keyboard you're going to need a
USB hub you're also going to need a
Wi-Fi dongle to give you any kind of
network connectivity and unless you
actually happen to have a mini HDMI
cable at home being a need to buy a mini
HDMI to normal HDMI adapter so these are
some of the hidden cost now I reckon
that on a minimum you need to spend
about another $20 to get all the bits
and pieces that you need and that would
include the SD card and a micro USB
adapter you may need to spend double
that or even more if you need to buy
things like HDMI cables and a might and
a mouse and a keyboard and a hub you
could spend a lot more but I'm hoping
you've probably got those things
knocking about at home that you can at
least borrow when you're configuring
this board now I talked about the hidden
cost but let's just remember what you do
get for just five dollars you get a
fully working 32-bit computer that can
run Linux and multimedia software
including 512 megabytes of RAM and its
own built-in GPU $5 that's pretty
amazing the operating system of choice
for all the Raspberry Pi board is of
course Linux and the Raspberry Pi
foundation do provide their own version
of Linux and is being actively developed
by the community and by the developers
there at the foundation and of course
with that you then get a full Linux
environment including a desktop
including a web browser including
compilers including Java including
Python including Perl including anything
really you want including lots of stuff
from Wolfram Alpha it really is a
complete kit and so the software side of
this thing is really done really well if
you remember the Raspberry Pi 2
support the Windows 10 IOT core now you
don't get that with the Raspberry Pi
zero or the Raspberry Pi one you'll need
a Raspberry Pi 2 if you need Windows 10
IOT core now in terms of performance the
Raspberry Pi foundation with an amazing
thing this little board runs at 1
gigahertz now you remember the original
Raspberry Pi runs at just 700 megahertz
although it could be overclocked but
this one comes with a default speed of
one gigahertz and it doesn't even have a
heatsink on it it's amazing I remember
I've got my first 1 gigahertz Pentium 3
I think it was at the time and we were
all just so amazed that we could get to
this 1 gigahertz barrier and I was
running Windows and it was just in these
big PC desktop and here I have a 1
gigahertz machine $5.00 on a tiny little
circuit board what about that hey now in
terms of the performance because it is
running 300 megahertz faster than the
Raspberry Pi 1 it is faster than the
Raspberry Pi 1 if you head over to
Andrew Authority comm you'll find a full
written article that goes with this
video and there I've got some
benchmarking numbers I show you the
difference in the Raspberry Pi 1 there
are 2 pi 1 overclocked at 900 megahertz
the Raspberry Pi 0 and the raspberry pi
2 now although the Raspberry Pi 0 is
faster than the Raspberry Pi 1 it isn't
as fast as the Raspberry Pi 2 and of
course it's only a single core computer
compared to the 4 cores that you get in
the Raspberry Pi 2 now that means the
disadvantage is is that the desktop
performance is slow it's usable but it's
slow let me give an example if you open
up the web browser and type in yahoo.com
you can wait for about a minute before
the page will load and render however if
you're doing little projects in Python
or in C or in Java if you want to do a
little bit of text editing if you want
to just learn a bit about computers
about programming then that won't be a
problem all of those things run
seamlessly on the desktop and they run
even faster if you run them from the
command line a quick bit of command-line
hacking you can write little C program
you can compile it and it all works
absolutely fine now one other thing
worth mentioning is because this is
using a low power arm v6 core this thing
can run from a battery and so here I
actually have
Raspberry Pi zero connected to a battery
external battery pack which I have in my
pocket the same kind of battery package
would use for charging your mobile phone
here is my adapter from microUSB to USB
in here at the end I have a Wi-Fi dongle
and this is actually on the network if I
pick one upstairs to my desktop I'd be
able to connect this to it and use it
right program on it while it's here
running from this back tree so that's
pretty amazing that's great if you want
to do little projects at home robots or
other little mobile projects you'll be
able to run this thing from a battery
and it will give you full control over
everything you do and you can even
kicked over the network to update the
software compile changes do whatever you
like and it's all running off a battery
I think that's a really good feature
because it's size this will slip much
easier into little robots little cranes
little things that you want to build
because it is much smaller just really
dependent how big of a battery pack you
want to put on the back of it so what
does all this mean well basically it
means that the Raspberry Pi foundation
done an absolutely amazing job a tiny
little board like that for just five
dollars now if you want high performance
single board computing then really you
need to go with the Raspberry Pi to the
desktop is much more reactive it's much
more fluid it's got 1 gigabytes of RAM
equals the quad core processor it runs
much nice and it's only $35 which is
still an amazing price however if you've
got some little products that you want
to do around your house and robots home
automation anything to do with the
Internet of Things if you want to be
able to build it'll servers then really
for $5 $5 you got to buy a bucket load
of these little boards problem is
they're so popular at the moment they're
all sold out you I look everywhere I
can't you can't find them anywhere I
really hope that the Raspberry Pi
foundation just start cranking these out
by a hundred thousand because I'm going
to buy another ten or something because
they're just so useful for putting into
all these little projects and I have in
my head up here and I hope you'll find
them just as useful my name is Gary Sims
from Andrew authority and I hope you
enjoyed this video if you did please do
give it a thumbs up also I don't use the
comments below to tell me what you think
about the Raspberry Pi 0 don't forget it
only cost $5 when you're talking about
it just
five dollars tell me what you think
about it what projects you have in mind
what you think you could use it for also
don't forget to subscribe to and royal
authority YouTube channel also don't
forget to follow me and Android
authority on social media and as for me
I'll see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
