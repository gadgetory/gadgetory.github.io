there's a good chance that you bought
yourself a Fitbit or a Garmin with the
very best of intentions but then you
used it to count a few steps track your
sleep for a bit and then got bored of it
they say that whatever is measured
improves but in my experience you
actually have to do something if you
want to lose weight and get into shape a
few decades ago technology like this
would have been the reserve of elite
athletes so if you bought yourself a
fitness tracker and then just discarded
it or you're just using it to count
steps then you're doing it something of
disservice the problem is a lot of us
don't know how to get the very most out
of these devices and that's what this
video is for I'm going to show you how
you can use a fitness tracker to get
into a much better shape to lose weight
to improve your cardiovascular fitness
to have more energy and it's just going
to take seven minutes a day ok so the
first thing we're going to do is collect
a little bit of data about you
specifically we're looking at your
lactate inflection point or your lactate
threshold this term is also used
sometimes synonymously with the term
anaerobic threshold this is basically
the point at which your body has to
switch from an aerobic system to an
anaerobic system so aerobic means using
oxygen this is the energy system use
when you go for a long-distance run
whether that's a long jog or bike ride
it's called steady-state cardio and it
basically works by burning fat and using
that as a source of energy so you can
keep on going this form of energy can
last the longest you can run for hours
like that before you tire out but if you
go too fast then you'll find that your
aerobic system isn't quick enough to
supply that energy as fast as you need
it and so you switch to the anaerobic
systems and in this case you'll be
switching to the lactic acid system or
glycolysis this means that you're
burning the glucose in order to create
ATP that is stored in the blood and in
the muscles more readily available and
this is also when you create lactate as
a by-product and lactic acid and more
specifically hydrogen ions build up and
make your muscles more acidic eventually
you get that sense of burning you can't
keep going that's why we can't run we
can't sprint full-out for too long
before we burn out so in order to get
this information using our fitness
tracker
we're going to do something called the
30 minutes
and warning up front it's grueling it's
horrible so the idea is that you're
going to strap on your fitness tracker
something with a heart rate monitor
preferably a chest warm strap synced to
a Fitbit or a Garmin something like that
if you don't have one then a wrist wall
monitor will be okay it just won't be
quite as accurate as a chest worn strap
now you're going to run or cycle as fast
as you possibly can
for a full 30 minutes and it's going to
be horrible because you're literally out
putting as much speed as you possibly
can the idea here isn't to kill yourself
the idea is to see how fast you can go
for 30 minutes so that means that you
might have to stop a points and slow
down a lot or even walk but that's fine
if you have to walk to recover your
heart rate that's the whole point we're
getting an average to see what the
highest heart rate you can maintain is
so don't push yourself too hard if
you're someone who has heart problems or
is very overweight or for any other
reason you're unsure about whether this
is a good idea then don't risk it
instead you can use your max heart rate
which is simply the highest heart rate
that you reach during a typical workout
listen to your body be safe don't be
crazy and say what you're gonna then do
is after your 30 minutes you're going to
look back at your data discard those
first 10 minutes and then you're gonna
take an average heart rate for the last
20 minutes and this heart rate is your
lactate inflection point or it's your
lactate threshold heart rate that is the
point at which your body switches to the
anaerobic state so if you can reach that
heart rate then you're in the anaerobic
state okay and so now we've got this
data we can create our training program
our seven-minute workout and this is
going to rely on something called
high-intensity interval training you
might have heard of high-intensity
interval training before it's very
trendy right now and rightly so it's a
fantastic way to Train so basically
high-intensity interval training means
that you're alternating between periods
of high intensity and lower intensities
my sprint for a minute and then you
might jog very lightly for 30 seconds to
recover or you might sprint for 30
seconds and then jog very lightly for a
minute depends on how you want to mix it
up bioscience is very popular right now
high-intensity interval training has a
ton of benefits because it's pushing you
into your anaerobic state in theory when
you're going at your full intensity that
means that your body is burning all that
available glucose in the muscles and in
the blood that means that when you
switch back to an aerobic form of
exercise you've now got no choice but to
burn all of that energy from your fat
stores and this process continues
throughout the day because you've
lowered your blood sugar level you'll
have this kind of afterburn effect and
that means that your calorie burn will
be greater for hours after you finish
working out on more point about this
workout I'm going to recommend that you
use some form of cardio resistance
training that means that you're doing
cardio but there's something pushing or
pulling against you so you might be
doing battle ropes or kettlebell swings
or cycling on a bike with a resistance
set to high when you train this way it
protects you from cannibalizing your own
muscles and at the same time builds more
muscle at tones and firms muscle which
is great for body recomposition
and also helping to burn more fat in the
long run because muscle is more
metabolically active than fat just
having more muscle on your frame will
help you to burn more fat you can even
alternate between exercises that target
the upper body and the lower body and
that way the heart has to work even
harder to send blood up and then back
down and the great thing about having a
good fitness tracker is that you can
probably set an alert to let you know
when you go into certain heart rate
zones so if you have this on your
display as well as a timer then you can
follow along with this workout and not
to keep looking at a computer just keep
checking your watch ok so the first
thing you're going to do is warm up for
30 seconds and then you're going to dive
straight into one minute of fast
high-intensity exertion and the aim here
is to make sure you reach and then
surpass your lactate threshold heart
rate remember if you weren't able to get
this number during the 30 minute test or
if you have any health complaints then
instead you can use 70 to 80% of your
maximum heart rate now recover for 30
seconds so that slower exertion then
give you 30 seconds fast one-minute
recovery 30 seconds fast one-minute
recovery 30 seconds fast
one-minute recovery and then a 30 sec
and cool down that seven minutes total
and it should be plenty to make sure you
keep passing into that anaerobic state
whilst at the same time giving yourself
that chance to recover that's all very
well and good and if you do that every
day or five days a week then you should
notice some benefits in terms of your
fitness your energy levels will go up
your mood will go up you'll sleep better
however it doesn't guarantee that you're
gonna lose weight and the reason for
this is that weight loss really comes
down to simple Maps you need to stay in
a caloric deficit that means you need to
eat fewer calories than you burn so if
you add this seven-minute workout to
your routine then you should lose weight
but if you eat twice as much in the
process then you're going to kind of
neutralize those benefits so we need to
track our colors going in and we need to
track our calories going out
unfortunately
apps and fitness trackers have got us
covered on both of those fronts so
you're going to use my fitness power to
track the calories coming in and this is
an app that lets you scan the food you
eat it lets you enter food manually in
calories and lets you search from a
database any food that's got a barcode
you can just eat and then add that to
your daily total and it will
automatically add all those calories
some of them nutritional information
your macros things like fats and protein
and it's just a really easy way to get a
good picture of what you're eating every
day the great thing about my Fitness Pal
is that it syncs with most fitness
tracking apps Fitbit jawbone Garmin and
that way you can automatically see how
many calories you're taking in right
next to how many calories you're burning
and you can even see the total whether
you're in a surplus or deficit and how
you need to improve going forwards so in
short we using our fitness trackers and
our heart rate monitors in order to
calculate a lactate inflection point
from there were then designing a
seven-minute workout that's going to
allow us to stay inside that anaerobic
threshold so that we're triggering the
most change in our bodies then
throughout the day we're measuring how
many calories you are consuming and how
many calories were burning we're making
sure our apps have got the most relevant
information and using all of this we can
maintain a deficit increase our fitness
and transform our bodies in just seven
minutes a day boom so you found this
video useful interesting guys if you did
then please leave a like please share it
around and comment down below to let me
know how you use your fitness tracker
because this is just one example of how
