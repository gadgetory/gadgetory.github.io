your smart phone your very powerful
smartphone into a computer all you
needed was a doc that connected to a
monitor but it now gets an update it's
Josh Vergara what's going on everybody
and this is the Samsung Dex pad now one
of the biggest issues with the Dec
station last year was that it wasn't
very portable it was a complete dock
that allowed you to put the phone in it
I had a couple of fans in it and then it
had to connect to any monitor and
hopefully have some peripherals
connected to it as well having a keeper
in the mouse is not really as portable
as people would want it to be so the Dex
pad addresses this and it is now a flat
surface that you can use your phone
screen on that becomes a virtual
keyboard and mouse by default the screen
acts as a virtual trackpad allowing you
to navigate the Dex which stands for
desktop experience and you can go
through the entire interface using it
like a touchpad going through this
version of Android that allows you to
use any app you have installed on your
phone now a number of applications may
not work perfectly on here because they
have to be developed and updated for the
Dex experience it's when you click on
the text input field that the phone
screen shows up as the same on-screen
keyboard that your phone uses typically
Samsung also announced a few upgrades to
the Dex experience like output in 2k
resolution all powered by the smartphone
they also worked with a few developers
to optimize further applications that
include games like with Final Fantasy 15
Pocket Edition there are very few
partnerships still like for example with
Photoshop it was announced with the
first Dex station but we have yet to see
full optimization even with the Dex pad
Samsung does include decks labs in the
SDK so any developer can optimize for
Dex and it's just a matter of time
before more of them do with plenty of
areas that still need to be addressed it
still remains to be seen whether or not
a concept like Dex is something that
people could use on the regular you
still need a monitor and for the best
possible experience you need to have the
other peripherals on hand so maybe this
might be a better solution than the one
from before we certainly think so but is
it still something you would use on the
daily let us know in the comments below
and then stay tuned to Andrew authority
for even more from Mobile World Congress
and head on over to Andrew authority
