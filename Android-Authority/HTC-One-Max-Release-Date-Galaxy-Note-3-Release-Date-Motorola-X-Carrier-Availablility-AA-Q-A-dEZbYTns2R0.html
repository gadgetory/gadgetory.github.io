Authority for a free trial hey everybody
I'm Chris look you ask we answer its
android authority qa4 July tenth 2013
Ruben asks what do you think the HTC One
max might be released also what specs do
you believe might be official on the
handset thanks and keep up the great
work thank you ruben as of right now
there's still no official word on when
we're going to see the HTC One max but
last month a financial analyst said that
he'd expect to see it in the second half
of 2013 as for the specs I think it's a
pretty safe bet to say that will see a
Snapdragon 800 at least two gigs of ram
and of course the ultrapixel camera the
HTC One max is rumored to have a 5.9
inch display which i think sounds about
right and I wouldn't be surprised to see
it come in that size though we'll see
Peter says hey Chris I'm thinking of
buying the samsung galaxy s4 what are
some of the more common problems with it
there are two main complaints I see
about the samsung galaxy s4 the first is
lag either when pressing the home button
or scrolling through home screens
luckily we did a tips and tricks video
for the samsung galaxy s4 which includes
remedies for both of those problems the
other problem I hear about someone often
is overheating now overheating can be
caused by a lot of things but not
everybody seems to experience it for
example when I was testing the samsung
galaxy s4 I never ran into that problem
so that's kind of up in the air
Vikramjit asks when is the samsung
galaxy note 3 release date will it be
coming to any us or canadian carriers
well last month we talked about some
rumors that we might see the note 3
sooner rather than later but since
Samsung's premiere event in the UK came
and went without unveiling the note
freak I think it's safe to say that like
last year they'll unveil the note 3 at
IFA and we'll see a release date in
September just like with the note 2 and
for the second question yes the note 3
is bound to be one of Samsung's biggest
phones of the year and more
ways than one so we'll definitely see it
on more than a few carriers in the US
and canada matta asks is there any way I
can use my HTC One S as a TV remote
control like you can with the galaxy s4
maybe a nap well kind of but it's not
going to work exactly the same way see
both the galaxy s4 and HTC One for
example have built-in IR blasters just
like a normal TV remote so they can
control any TV you can find apps to
control certain things though depending
on your setup say if you're a plex or
XBMC user they both have remote apps and
some smart TVs from companies like
Samsung LG and Panasonic have remote
apps as well Gary asks does the samsung
galaxy s4 support 64 gigabyte micro sdhc
cards yes it does Adrian says I'd like
to use lock screen widgets and shortcuts
on my galaxy s4 when I have it on a
pattern or pin will Samsung be releasing
a pact so I can do this unfortunately
there's no word on any sort of update
coming out for this we will keep our
eyes peeled though so fingers crossed
mara says Chris I'm a new owner of the
HTC One and i was wondering is there any
official news that the one will be
updated android 4.2 or 4.3 well i don't
know where you live but an update for
the HTC One to Android 4.2 is currently
rolling out in Europe so it should start
to hit elsewhere pretty soon when it
comes to 4.3 there's no official word
right now but the google play edition of
the HTC One was spotted running Android
4.3 when that will end up in the hands
of customers is up in the air right now
but it's safe to assume that eventually
we will see it Frank asks will the
motorola x be available on AT&amp;amp;T or just
verizon like other motorola droid phones
well good news Frank last week it was
confirmed that the motorola x will not
be a droid branded phone though it will
be coming to verizon according to
filings with the FCC it looks like AT&amp;amp;T
Sprint and US cellular will be getting
the motorola x as well there you go
