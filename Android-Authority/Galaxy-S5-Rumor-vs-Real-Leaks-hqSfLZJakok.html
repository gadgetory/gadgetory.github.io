brought to you by bitdefender the number
one ranked antivirus technology go to
bitdefender com to learn more welcome
back to a special edition of Android
weekly my name is Jace and today's brief
show is for the purposes of
distinguishing between all the BS rumors
and the genuine leaks regarding the
galaxy s5 now in a more somber note I
wanted to extend my sincere condolences
to my brother and Android Joe Hindy who
suffered a deep loss when the men's
olympic hockey team and the women's
olympic hockey team suffered a whopping
defeat at the hands of the canadians
again and as a canadian I I'm wanted to
say I'm sorry Joe I'm sorry and so what
i will do is i will change my country's
colors from white and red to white and
all right now as happy as I am that the
rest of the world has to submit to
Canadians God like hockey powers I have
to say my brain has been rattled in the
past several weeks with all the
conflicting rumors when it comes to the
Samsung Galaxy X 5 so the purposes of
today's show was to sort through that
and give you my personal take on the
most credible leaks and rumors that we
can count on for next Monday 2 p.m.
eastern standard time we're going to
start with design now if you remember
when the s4 was launched many people
complain that the s4 just looked too
similar to the s3 so Samsung executives
have gone out of the way in the recent
months to make the message clear that
the s5 will look and feel different than
the s4 in fact Lee young-hee executive
vice president of Samsung's mobile
business recently mentioned that the
display and the feel of the cover would
be the most noticeable changes now in my
mind that is doublespeak for a faux
leather back a very high resolution
screen and possibly a screen with very
little to no bezels moving on to
hardware the following is the most
recent and what I
the most accurate leaks regarding
hardware specs the s5 is expected to
debut with a 5.2 4-inch 2560 x 1440 mo
light display with 560 ppi it's
important to note however that a New
York Times report claims that the
handset will actually have a 1080p
display and a not so called 2k display
so which rumors right perhaps both this
is not the first rumor we've heard that
there might be two versions of the s5 we
expect a Snapdragon 800 perhaps an 805
and a Texan O's variant other specs
include 3 gigabytes of ram 32 to 64
gigabytes of storage 16 megapixel rear
camera and a 3.2 megapixel front camera
and a 3200 milliamp hour battery now
let's dig into that fingerprint scanner
rumor shall we I found recently a blog
post from Sam mobile that made a claim
with quite a bit of confidence that the
galaxy s5 will indeed launch with a
physical home button fingerprint scanner
but they also claimed that once the home
button scans your fingerprint a
real-time image of your fingerprint will
be displayed on the screen now if people
saw a leaked images of that that might
lead them to incorrectly believed that
there was an on-screen fingerprint
scanner which from an engineering
perspective is much more difficult in
2014 so I'm going to call it I think
that's what it is let's wait and see now
let's talk software and we have many
more credible leaks regarding the whole
deal between Google and Samsung and that
the fact that Samsung has agreed to
scale back their TouchWiz customization
and use a much more closer to vanilla
version of Android so I think it's
pretty clear that that is what's going
to happen I know many of you have asked
when this magazine UX will be brought to
all devices and not just tablets I
suspect that it won't we shall see
Monday afternoon now for all you shutter
bugs let's talk camera the galaxy x 5 is
expected to feature a 16 megapixel
sensor on the back and may even feature
iso cell technology this is basically
new technology that promises in
used to light sensitivity and higher
color fidelity even in poor lighting
conditions now let's talk pricing and
availability there is some indication
that the flagship device will be a
little bit cheaper than some people
expect or we will have two different
versions one with a high resolution
display that would be the top tier price
and a lower 1080p resolution that would
be a little bit cheaper I hope so she'll
see how that goes now when it comes to
availability we are expecting a launch
in April we shall see how it goes don't
forget Android army this Monday 2 p.m.
eastern standard time is the official
launch of the galaxy s5 I will be
watching and working furiously all night
to try and get out an official video for
you giving everything you need to know
you can expect late Monday night or
early Tuesday morning it's coming watch
for it you don't want to forget about my
brothers and Android Josh the tech ninja
Kevin and Chris and Joe Joe buddy try to
point out that no Canadian NHL team has
won the Stanley Cup in 21 years for
getting the obvious fact that every NHL
team is stacked with the gods of hockey
Canadian hockey players</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
