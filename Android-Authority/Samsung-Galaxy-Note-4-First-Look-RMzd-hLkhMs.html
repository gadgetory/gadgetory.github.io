improvement on the previous note in
every way
hey it's Joshua regard from Android
Authority and this is your first look at
the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 as always
we're going to start off with the design
and yes you can finally rejoice that the
galaxy line now is including metal in
their designs you really do have to feel
this to believe it as the flat size with
this metal frame really make this feel
like a great device in the hand
especially over the original note 3
which we thought was a pretty good
design to begin with you can see here
the metal on the sides and we also have
quite a bit on the top and bottom where
all of the different ports are going to
be held it is essentially the same
design as you remember from before
except this metal frame really enhances
the feel but on the back you still get
that faux leather that has that textured
feel to it and does feel pretty
comfortable in the hand still the
obvious improvement when it comes to the
display is in regards to the resolution
you now get quad HD resolution in this
5.7 inch screen which allows you to
really enjoy a lot of media as you can
see in this video right here which looks
very vibrant because of that super
amoled display and on top of all of that
you also get a pixel density of over 500
pixels per inch which makes for a great
experience when it comes to text in the
short time we've already had to play
with the Galaxy Note 4 we really enjoyed
what we were seeing when it came to this
display performance continues to get the
needed boosts as this year you will
still be able to get this version of the
note with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 or
the Exynos that they will have for in
other versions of the phone but the
performance is still as great as it can
be especially with all that this phone
can do speaking of the hardware we do
get an extra microphone on this phone
this time with two on the bottom and one
on the top as you're seeing right now
what this allows is for selective
recording where you will be able to put
the phone down and it will be able to
detect the voices and sounds of eight
different directions in order for you to
turn off or turn on various voices you
can see the extra mic here right now but
also we have that USB port on the bottom
and we do have something to say about
the fast charging that Samsung has
apparently introduced here while we
weren't able to really test it ourselves
apparently it will get up to half a
charge in 30 minutes which were super
excited to test out and then we move on
to the cameras which have their own
improvements as well it's a 16 megapixel
resolution on the rear facing camera but
now also comes with smart
oh is I know that optical image
stabilization is huge for a lot of you
smartphone photographers out there but
the front-facing camera has also been
bumped up to 3.7 megapixels and an F 1.9
aperture to really make the selfie game
a lot better for all of you what you're
seeing here is a 120-degree a selfie
mode which allows you to use a panorama
mode to get everyone in your shot so you
will be able to get the best selfies
that you can possibly get and finally in
software we will obviously do a focus on
the S Pen in a little bit but we did
want to say that TouchWiz continues to
do its improvements despite looking
pretty much the way that we would expect
it to but multitasking has been given a
big focus here as the recent apps screen
right here has been enhanced now to be
able to allow you activation of multi
window straight from it as you can see
here I'm activating these two different
applications gallery and Facebook but
I'm also being able to create a floating
Facebook here on the fly just by holding
the dot in the middle you will see that
multitasking has really become a bit
streamlines because you can go in
between all of these different modes
especially on the fly even with apps
like the camera and the Apple is for
multi window and floating apps has been
expanded somewhat to allow you to be
able to use a lot of different
applications at once in any way or
fashion that you choose but of course I
want to be a note device without the S
Pen and as far as the actual pen itself
goes it has been given a bit of a
thinner profile but also some texture on
it but it's largely the same pen that
you remember from the note 3 with some
added functionality we do still have the
air command menu but it has been changed
somewhat a little bit I'll start off
with the action memo which allows you to
take notes on the fly already and after
that you can manipulate the text inside
of the note in order to perform a number
of tasks but now you also have a
shortcut on the bottom right of the note
which allows it to convert into an S
note application now speaking of s notes
there have been a couple of pens
introduced here the calligraphy pen and
the fountain pen which take advantage of
the now enhanced touch recognition the
pressure sensitivity of the S Pen to
give you even more freedom over what
kind of strokes you have on the actual
screen itself in order to really make
your handwriting your own voice memos
typed notes and handwritten notes are
all still par for the course when it
comes to the note device but probably
the biggest enhancement here has been
the snap mode it is
addition that allows you to snap a
picture of any surface items let's say
handwriting on it and it will be able to
recognize what is handwriting and what
can be used as images and I'm doing that
exactly here with my notes in which the
section on design that you can see will
be manipulate like handwriting is in the
S note application I will be able to
select the entire block by holding the
button down with the S Pen and then
dragging down much like you would with a
mouse and then from there I'll be able
to take all the information and paste it
somewhere else
it is also editable in the way that you
are able to edit handwriting and within
that I can erase the writing and add
more to it that selection that you are
that you saw already with the
handwriting also applies to other places
as well you can use the s pen like a
mouse and you will be able to select a
lot of different elements at once by
holding down that button and dragging
and so there you have it for this first
look at the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 there
are so many enhancements across the
board and we really like what we see
that even this video that I've given you
it doesn't really feel like it's even
scratching the surface for example the
heart rate monitor on the back can now
be tapped while using the front facing
camera to easily take selfies but that's
only another example of further
enhancements that Samsung has been
putting into the note line and in this
particular version we do feel like the
note line has matured to what we feel
like it should have been this whole time
the metal frame around allows it have a
very great feel in the hand the software
enhancements especially with
multitasking really give it an even
better feel and of course the s-pen is a
better companion even now for all of you
who love to handwrite notes and to be
able to jot anything down on the fly
