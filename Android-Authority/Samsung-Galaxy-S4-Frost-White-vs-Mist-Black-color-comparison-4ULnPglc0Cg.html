here from android authority calm your
number one source for all things android
and today we're doing a color comparison
between the white frost in the black
mist samsung galaxy s4 smartphones if
you've had any trouble deciding go ahead
and watch this video and tell us what
you think at the end okay so much like
the samsung galaxy s3 before it the gs4
has shipped in two initial colors those
being the black mist and the frost white
versions of the phone now what we're
going to do today is show you various
clips in different conditions of both
the colors of these phones so you guys
might have a better idea of which phone
you would like to purchase if you're in
the market for a brand new gs4 now
before we get any farther i'll say that
my personal preference lies with the
black miss galaxy s4 so here's a
side-by-side shot and obviously the
capacitive buttons are off and you can
see that the home buttons are different
on each galaxy s4 i prefer the home
button on the black because the bezel is
more apparent and as you can see on the
back there is a hidden texture in each
and here's a shot of the galaxy s4s on a
black background you can see they're
next to each other and their brightness
is all the way up so you'll notice a
little bit of difference on the bezels
so right here i'm holding the galaxy s4
in the broad daylight and you can see
the LED flashing still and it's a little
easier to see the sensors but on the
white galaxy s4 you can see the sensors
very very clearly here we have the
galaxy s4 is in the dark and you can see
that the capacitive buttons give off
light into the body of the white galaxy
s4 while they don't on the black galaxy
s4 the top bezel on the black galaxy s4
is very impressive because the LED light
remains invisible when it's not actually
flashing and it's the same on the white
galaxy s4 except for you can see the
sensors a lot easier and that may be a
turn off to some now the white color is
very nice and you can see the texture on
the back especially right here around
the camera now with the black miss
galaxy s4 the texture really pops out
anyways guys thanks for watching this
short video comparison make sure to tell
us which galaxy s4 you'll be purchasing
if you're in the market for one and why
you chose it thanks a lot this is
