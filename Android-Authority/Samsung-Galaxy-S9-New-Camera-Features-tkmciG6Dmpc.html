nine brings to the table that is
probably revolutionary it would have to
do with the camera and we're gonna take
a closer look at it for those of you who
only want to see what these camera
features are it's jaja for gara what's
going on everybody and these are the new
features for the cameras of the galaxy s
9 and s 9 plus let's go ahead and start
off with just some fun here slow motion
is not really a new feature as it
appears in a number of recent Samsung
releases mainly in the form of 120
frames per second video but with the
updated camera of the s9 4k footage can
be captured at 60 frames per second
making it a beast for videographers but
when you do the math you're able to get
120 frames per second at 1080p and then
go all the way down to 720p at 960
frames per second however Samsung has
put in an auto mode that allows the
camera app to figure out when the motion
is happening and then it begins
capturing that super fast motion we
tried this one or two times and the
video that came out of it was quite
enjoyable when you go to it inside of
the gallery it'll actually add music or
even a couple of effects before you
actually share it with anybody else and
then here come the AR emoji one for all
of those people that have an emoji envy
Samsung has brought its own brand of
special emoji to the galaxy s 9 and they
are quite customizable using either
camera faces can be captured and
transformed into an avatar that
resembles kind of like a bitmoji if you
are a snapchat user the face capture
results in more of a caricature rather
than a really accurate depiction and
even then people can customize the AR
emoji to be beyond recognition for
example there are a ton of hairstyles
and you can change the colours to a
number of different options and I was
able to get my long hair back because of
that and lunch just wanted to have
bright white hair so that was his
prerogative there's a variety of eyewear
and all colors can be changed to what
you want clothing options were a bit
sparse but we're sure that updates will
provide even more settings for this and
we want to be surprised if there were
themed or even sponsored elements of the
AR emoji that people can use as you've
seen with other avatar creation systems
once you're happy with your AR emoji
just hit save and the camera will save
all the options so that when you use
let's say the front-facing camera it
will provide you with your AR emoji and
you can actually move your head around
make the face do things like raising
your eyebrows or opening your mouth and
making it make faces that you are
actually making in real life but that's
not all the mode will actually save over
a dozen different gifts that are locally
stored for easy sharing again this is
probably something that will grow over
time as more gifts can be created by
this mode and Samsung can easily just
update this feature in the future and we
go from that into the nitty gritty the
stuff that real photons might actually
really be excited about and we're
talking about aperture it doesn't sound
all of that fun but it's a little bit
more technical and when you think about
it inputs this smartphone closer to
proper DSLRs than ever before as you can
see here the opening of the lens is
either wide open or closed down
depending on the setting in aperture
terms the closed setting is f 2.4 and
the open setting is f 1.5 let that sink
in for a second you're able to choose
between these two aperture modes this is
a hardware solution where as you would
see the same effect in a lot of software
solutions in the past but in order to
get more light into the lens you can go
to F 1.5 and you'll also get much finer
depth of field focus but if you have a
wider scene like let's say a landscape
the F 2.4 will be better suited for that
but it won't allow as much light to get
into the lens purists will probably be
happy that not everything is relying on
soft or for once but of course if you
want to do that soft focus is still a
mode that is available and finally let's
talk a little bit about multi frame
processing this is something that you
might have seen in mainly the Google
pixel phones with HDR plus it's the same
general idea but of course Samsung
doesn't have the massive machine
learning library that Google does hit
the shutter and at any moment the camera
will capture 12 photos usually in three
groups of four and all of the frames
will be processed for their detail for
their contrast and for how much noise
needs to be reduced or just in general
processed we were told that this has
done a few different times in a split
instant made possible by the memory the
DRAM built into the actual camera module
itself the results are hopefully going
to be exceptional though we're sure that
the camera will still be a high
performer given the track record of the
Galaxy S line you're seeing some
examples of these pictures right now but
of course we will give you even more of
our thoughts and you can give us yours
after we give our full testing in our
full review and so there you have it a
specific look at the cameras of the
galaxy s 9 and the s 9 plus by the way
the s 9 plus camera does have the
telephoto lens on there now bringing
some note 8 flavor to the line
but the rest of what we've covered above
is available in either phone which is a
great prospect for users who don't
really need the zoom but don't want to
feel like they're missing out on
anything else by picking the smaller of
the two devices let us know how you feel
about these camera updates and if it
might be enough for you to actually pick
up the latest Samsung device yourself
keep it tuned to Andrew authority for
more about this phone and we're gonna be
pitting it against a lot of other
devices just to see where it stacks up
against the competition keep it tuned
here to Android authority and don't
forget to head on over to Andrew 30.com
for even more from MWC because we are
