is Kevin de tech ninja oh yeah today
we're going to talk to you about how are
we going to provide the best coverage
for CES that's right already CES is here
and just a few more days will be packing
our bags heading down to Las Vegas but
before we do that as we pack our bags
let's talk about what's in our bags hey
what is going on guys lon here from
android authority and this is what i
plan on bringing to CES 2015 starting
with the bag itself and the bags that i
plan on bringing is a canon bag it's a
pretty common bag you can find it fairly
easily on sites like amazon and best buy
but the reason why i like this bag is
because it has a bunch of velcro
compartments on the inside that you can
actually manipulate so you can easily
fit pretty much anything that you want
in there so i can fit my camera a couple
of lenses and my audio equipment and
there's even little compartments for
like the SD cards and stuff like that
and batteries that i plan on bringing as
far as audio goes i will be bringing my
zoom h4n which i'm actually using right
now and i have my shotgun microphone
which is the audio technica 875 r which
is plugged directly into the h4n right
now via XLR and that's what i'm
recording audio with in this video so
i'll be bringing both of these along i'm
not sure if i'm going to be using the
shotgun all that often but i figured i
bring it along just in case i will
probably be using this more just because
it's a little bit easier to use and
there's no cables to really have to deal
with with the h4n so but those are the
two items i plan on bringing to record
audio and the camera that i'm using is
the canon 70d this is my camera of
choice is the camera that i used to
record all of my videos and the lenses
that i plan on bringing is the Sigma
seventeen 250 millimeter f 2.8 lens and
I will also be bringing the kit lens as
well which is the 18 to 1 35 millimeter
lens and that's part that's pretty much
it as far as lens
is in camera gear goes and my tripod
that I'm using is a manfrotto tripod
it's the zero 55x pro3 I believe is the
model number it retails for about two
hundred and ten dollars or so in the
head that I plan on bringing is the
manfrotto 502 head and you've probably
seen this head before it's a really
common head a lot of youtubers use this
particular head because it's very fluid
and that's how you kind of get those
really nice smooth licking pans is with
this head right here I will also be
bringing this if you don't know if this
is this is a white bounce card for
calibrating the white balance on your
camera so colors look more accurate and
whites actually look white stuff like
that that's kind of the simple 5
explanation but that's essentially how
that works and as far as video editing
goes i will be using a 15-inch macbook
pro i actually don't have it right now
it it's one that i'm going to be
borrowing because i actually don't have
on the go editing equipment all i have
right now is my imac lets you see back
here so i will be borrowing a 15-inch
MacBook Pro to edit my videos and I use
Final Cut Pro just in case you were
wondering alright this is kettle tech
ninjas bag this is a pretty basic
amazonbasics bag that i bought three
years ago when i bought my first camera
it gets the job done simple bag has a
lot of zippers at apartments for
different things and it carries my
camera just fine I don't shoot on the
goal that much when i do i usually don't
carry a bag but when i do need a bag
this is the bag that i use it's pretty
good it works pretty fine um let's go
over a couple things that i have in the
bag and the front zippers i have a
battery thing so i have this lime fuel
portable charger that i use and also i
keep this guy right here which is made
by tilt which is pretty much the same
thing as separate plugs into the wall
it's a portable charger so these are two
things that I really do keep in my bag
to make sure i want devices are charged
and also i carry these Jaybirds blue
blood x earbuds whoops i carry these
guys for travel and for working out
and for dropping obviously all right
once you get once you open the bag a
little bit more and go to this top
zipper you'll find that I have the
v-moda excess headphones and the reason
I like these because they are made with
military precision and grade there's a
like these they're made with
military-grade construction so this is
metal and this is Kevlar so I won't
worry about dropping these or breaking
them because if I do they are pretty
heavy duty and there's nothing really to
worry about these I like to have when
I'm traveling very good to have and put
these guys back open the bag obviously
right here there's something missing
that is my camera my camera is a canon
6d that is my go-to camera and also what
lens i'm using right now is my 28th but
to 135 wide-angle lens not my favorite
lens in the whole wide world but it is a
lens that I like to use to get a nice
wide angle so that's the lens i use now
if I didn't have this lens and I'm
actually shooting us it's like 50
millimeter it look like this so I like
to get that wide shot beautiful okay um
right here is a light that I like to use
I put on top of my camera on a hot shoe
and this enables me to get a little bit
more lighting that I had before very
important when you're shooting on the go
I have a hot shoot flash as the case i
need to take some images this first lens
we're going to take a look at is my
tamron 2.8 90 millimeter macro lens so i
can get some really really close shot
some beautiful beautiful close shots
that's what this can do for me this is
my go-to lens this is my Sigma 2.8 50
millimeter lens this lens is awesome
awesome great lens this lens that you'll
see on my android authority review
videos probably ninety percent of time
i'm using this guy right here and also
we have a little guy the Nifty Fifty can
at 50 millimeter can't leave home
without it probably the best hundred
islands you can buy I just keep it in my
bag at all times i have a lab mic right
here and i plugged my lab mic right into
the
sky the reason you can see this right
now is because this is my zoom h2n I'm
going to use this for on-the-go shooting
right now I have it going right to my
camera via this aux cable but i usually
keep this on the stain and I talking to
it and treated at the shotgun mic but I
can plug my lab right into this record
to it directly so that's my microphone
setup I have a few more accessories and
stuff and these little pouches right
here in the front so this is pretty much
what's in my bag but I do have one more
thing in one more bag that I like to
carry GoPro Hero 4 silver I love this
guy and we're going to use this a lot
pretty much at CES I'm going to have
this for a lot of behind-the-scenes
coverage that we're gonna have so super
pumped about using this guy here it is I
also have the waterproof and a
waterproof mount right here sorry the
waterproof housing have this guy right
here so anything that get a little
sloppy and dirty in Vegas I can protect
my camera with that and also have the
headrests the head mount and also the
shoulder mount here as well so I can
mount the camera in many different ways
and also I have a selfie stick yes best
believe i have a full selfie stick which
is really cool to have with a go pro so
I am prepared with the GoPro in Vegas
also I have the V 360 camera now I just
didn't unboxing on my youtube channel
about it but it's a camera that can
shoot in a full 360 motion with video
and pictures I'm going to take it to CES
and I'm going to play around it a little
bit and you may see some of the stuff
from the v360 pop up in some of our
videos who knows and that is it guys
that is what I'm taking to CES and of
course it's Joshua vagar from android
authority what's going on everybody and
i'm here to show you what is in my bag
for CES 2015 which is just around the
corner so we're going to show you what
we're going to be using in order to
bring you the best coverage of the
Consumer Electronics Show of 2015 but
before I even get to the bag itself i
want to show you something that I care
with me along with it all the time this
by my side and that is of course this
tripod right here this is a month Frodo
combo tripod that has the 19 TX Probie
legs right here and actually a
discontinued now fluid head the 701 HD V
I've had this ever since the first CES
and I thought I've been to two years ago
and it has been a great workhorse ever
since I have had no problems with this
and let's get into the back itself here
is my bag and some of you might know
that I'm a big fan of Timbuktu I've used
their messenger bags for a long time and
I did use them for the show as well but
after Aoife realizing just how badly it
was making my back in my shoulder ache
by using those messenger bags and
everything that I put into them I
decided to move over two backpacks
because they seemed more comfortable and
that has been the case and I'm looking
forward to using this at CES on the side
over here is a cup or rather bottle
holder that has my moral one this is one
of the tools of the trade that I used to
stay healthy on the road what you'll see
here is it's a regular water bottle that
has a compartment up here in order to
put supplements or in my case protein
powder and the actual cap that holds it
in place and keeps water from seeping in
can be used for the blender ball as well
so you can easily make protein shakes on
the go one way for me to stay healthy
but also inside of the bag itself you
see that flap that opened i also have a
leak proof and very effective travel mug
that will hold bulletproof coffee and if
you don't know what that is i'm going to
do a little bit of an expose on it at
CES so you'll see what bulletproof
coffee is and why i use it all the time
why I drink it all the time rather and
this mug will keep it hot for up to 8
hours which is perfect get this laying
down and on the front we have this one
zipper pocket right here that holds my
portable battery and some cables along
with my business cards of course and
those cables are for the audio set the
audio setup includes my bluetooth
headphones right here that you've seen
you wearing a few videos already these
are sony MDR headphones that have an
extra base capability on top of the
bluetooth connectivity and the zoom line
of products is usually really great i
use the h2n along with the lapel mic
plugged right into its my computer that
i use for editing
is a 14-inch ultrabook this is the MSI
GE that has been great for me ever since
to EFA's ago and before then I was using
a huge 15-inch sager that was about this
thick it was a pain to lug around so I'm
really happy i have this particular
laptop now and just for good measure
even though mice are just fine to use
for editing i like to have more
precision inputs by using these this
this tablet with the with the pen input
by Wacom the bamboo tablet of course and
then finally we'll get into the cameras
so you probably know already by now that
i use the panasonic gh4 now this is a
fork a shooter but i will admit i don't
use the 4k recording all the time i use
it when i know that i want to crop into
the actual shot and be able to do so
without losing shot fidelity and the
lens on here is the all-purpose 12 235
2.8 i do like to bring secondary cameras
though the one on bring in this year is
one of my favorites it's the panasonic
gx7 gx7 and panasonic i'm a big fan of
what they do in the micro four-thirds
segment and this will be used for
behind-the-scenes anyone on the team can
use it it could be nice and easy because
it has a brand new prime lens on there
the 15 millimeter 1.7 x leica so it's
just wide enough with a low aperture for
low-light shooting and thus it should be
able to be easily brought around for
behind the scenes / vlog action so that
is just a look at a whole of the stuff
and now that I'm looking at it's
actually quite a bit of stuff that I
have in my bag and aside from just the
cables and all the tiny little tools and
even my mouse which is right here but
nonetheless that is what's in my bag for
CES 2015 and this is what is hopefully
going to be bringing you the best
coverage of the Consumer Electronics
Show of 2015 so keep it tuned to android
authority for all of that best coverage
