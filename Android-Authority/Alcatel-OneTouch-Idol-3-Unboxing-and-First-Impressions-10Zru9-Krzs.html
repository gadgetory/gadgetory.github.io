experience at an even better price point
but let's now find out what it's all
about because it's Josh regard from
Android Authority what's going on
everybody and it's time to unbox and
give my first impressions on the Alcatel
OneTouch Idol 3 and here we are with the
Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 one of the main
reasons why I wanted to do this unboxing
is because well look at the box there's
even this little slider right here slide
to unlock and sure enough this phone is
coming unlocked one of the main aspects
of this phone the fact that it comes at
a very good price point for an unlocked
device open up the panel down here and
it folds right up and the word unlock
looks like is everywhere unlock
unexpected unlock bright open this up
over here oh and the fact that it comes
with a 5.5 inch full HD display so we
are working with a 5.5 inch version of
this unlock loud means that you have a
dual front facing speaker set up by JBL
audio and unlock moments no panel up
there down here it says 13 megapixel
camera with a Sony sensor all great
specifications that should be coming in
a what could be considered a mid-range
device but we will see if that is the
case in our full review live unlocked we
have the phone right here on the side
and all of the accessories over here
including the sim tool right here the
micro USB adapter wall adapter some
headphones right here which let's take a
look at those right now so if they're
going to be touting the audio
capabilities of this particular phone
you want to see what kind of headphones
that comes with now these look like in
your monitors comes with a little remote
on there including a microphone and
these headphones sure enough are by JBL
which is a great a great addition to
have especially in terms of audio on a
smart phone JBL do some great stuff so
there go the parts right there
there you go and we have the microUSB a
board right there and even a little USB
that says alcatel one touch right on it
now we have the actual phone itself
bring that up and there it is 5.5 inches
is the size that we're working with on
the OneTouch Idol 3 and it already feels
pretty nice pretty light actually and it
has sort of a look that mimics what kind
of reminds me of a Galaxy Nexus to be
honest maybe even the Nexus 4 that came
after it so it looks like a bigger Nexus
4 but with some nice styling on the back
with this brushed look and we'll go
ahead and remove the plastics and get
going with this particular device as we
take a look around the device like I
said it is pretty light especially for a
5.5 inch phone and we have the nice
shiny frame going around and even on the
top and bottom lip portions of the phone
where the front-facing speakers are
housed do you have them right down here
in these particular areas like that sits
pretty nicely in the hand already and
the button layout I should say is
mirrored from ones that you might be
accustomed to so more left-handed
oriented for example the power button is
right up here but if we come on over to
the back of course the 13 megapixel
optics are right there on the top and we
have it this brushed look right here
that looks quite nice I have to say idle
right here and I'll go to one touch
right on the bottom if you look at the
bottom real quick the micro USB charging
port is over on to the side and you can
see that there's almost this sandwich
look right here with the nice shiny
frame being centered on to a black frame
in between and there we go set up and
ready to go I am going to throw my sim
card in here and just looking through
the interface right now it looks like we
have a lollipop style build and a lot
of the icons are already set up on the
main home screens this is one of the
animations that Alcatel puts into their
version of lollipop at folding animation
now I will tell you one thing when we
were at MWC and we got our first look at
this phone it looked like there was a
tiny bit of stutter in that particular
animation there but it doesn't look like
that's really the case right now
obviously we're going to see what
happens when I get all of my
applications on here and start taking up
some of the space underneath and just
kind of going around things look pretty
nice so far we have no recent screens
just dip I'll go ahead and open up a
couple of applications things look to be
pretty speedy thus far definitely not
too many hiccups if any at all bringing
down the notification drop-down we have
all of the settings here very lollipop s
and we're going to go ahead and just
confirm that real quick as I continue to
show you how this phone seems to perform
Android 5.0 point 2 indeed there you go
yeah and things are looking good so far
I'm going to be putting all of my
applications on here but nonetheless it
still looks like a very nice piece of
kit very good stylings all around and
well really I'm excited to kind of put
this through its paces to find a phone
that brings a great and reliable
experience especially if we were to
consider the camera experience which we
will do in the full review having it at
a price point that is this accessible is
probably going to be its main selling
point not to mention the fact that you
have the dual front-facing speakers at a
price like that and one of the
interesting developments on this phone
is the fact that you can actually flip
it over if you wanted to take calls a
certain way as well I know that we can
turn on the screen rotation and that
will be fine so let's go ahead and do
auto rotate and turn on the reversible
there you go and there's a little bit of
a notification a bit of a dialog there
about reverse calling if I were to turn
it over it's going to oh that was a nice
animation bring it around to the other
side so no matter what orientation you
pick this thing up there's a symmetry to
this phone that makes it easy to use no
matter which way you're looking at it
and the fact that the speaker is on both
the top and bottom configuration you're
going to be able to take calls one way
or
the others bring it over and take a look
at that animation again that is pretty
nice so that is just the first
impression on the Alcatel OneTouch Idol
3 I have to say I like what I see so far
in the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 Sochi
with that brush design on the bag has a
very nice profile and the metallic look
all around the frame it does look really
nice and it's a lot lighter than you
would expect a 5.5 inch device to be
this is like a Nexus 4 blown up a little
bit if you want to make some comparisons
there but with dual front-facing
speakers that DJ app if you remember
from MWC we saw that there was a DJ app
that would take streaming music services
or local music and give you a way of
mixing them together to have a little
bit of fun that's definitely something
we're going to test out and of course
the 13 megapixel camera on the back but
still I have to say one really nice
touch that they made here was the fact
that if you were to turn the phone
around it would have that nice animation
right there I actually kind of liked
that a lot and right now it's upside
down and if I got a call I could
actually use the phone no matter which
orientation it would be in make sure you
keep it tuned to Android 34 all of the
best coverage and make sure you keep it
tuned here for even more on the Alcatel
OneTouch Idol 3 stay tuned for even more
