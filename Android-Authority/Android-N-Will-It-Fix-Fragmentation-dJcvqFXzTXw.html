brought to you by Atlassian build what's
next so we suspect that Android n the
newer version of Android that's just
around the corner is going to try and
tackle the age-old problem of Android
fragmentation how by creating a front
end and a back end
now let's promo let talk about what is
Android fragmentation and why does it
matter to you well if you look at this
chart right here these are the current
nine versions of Android running across
all Android devices there are still
people using Ice Cream Sandwich from
like four years ago that's not a big
deal if you're a hardcore geek you're
just missing out on the coolest newest
features of Android but imagine for a
moment if you are an Android developer
who are trying to make your bread and
butter on your app not only do you have
to make sure that your app is compatible
with those nine versions of Android but
Android has an almost endless variety of
Android devices check this chart out
this is current from 2015
ouch can you imagine the nightmare that
most Android developers have this is why
most new developers when they're just
starting out and had limited resources
start with iOS this is iOS as
fragmentation far far less that's the
problem what Android n appears to do is
to effectively break Android into two
distinct pieces a back end and a front
end the back end is Google crafted and
would be the same across all devices but
the front stage is totally customizable
allowing different brands to deliver the
kind of feel and experience their users
are accustomed to receiving moto still
gets to have moto display Samsung can
still integrate blocking mode and Lenovo
can still put whatever they want on
their lockscreen that's all part of the
front stage the experience that is on
display to you the user now the back end
of Android would control things like the
nuts and bolts that actually make the
operating system work things like
security fall into this category meaning
individual companies would no longer
have to worry about keeping up with
Google's monthly security updates Google
just adds the patch to the back end and
everything on the front end keeps on
truckin now it should be noted that
Android n is so alpha right now that it
could intimidate the crap out of a pack
of bodybuilders this could have massive
ramifications for the overall
fragmentation of the OS by making the
appearance and app handling aspects of
Android distinct from the core the inner
workings Google could be making the
operating system much much easier to
update this would save man
power money time and frustration right
across the board now this all sounds
very interesting but my question is if
manufacturers are given greater control
over the Android experience on the front
end what's that going to mean for an
already varied experience across Android
devices let me know what you think in
the comments below
unleash your team's potential with
Atlassian's collaboration software so
you can work and communicate better
together a sign track and manage tasks
for any project no matter how complex
that's the clarity of JIRA create and
share content organize results and bring
team members up to speed that's the
flexibility of confluence now what I
especially like about Atlassian is that
it doesn't force you to communicate with
your team in one way if it's too tedious
to type at a conversation in a chat box
you can do video chat that's a good
thing that's Atlassian comm unleash the
potential of your team build what's next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
