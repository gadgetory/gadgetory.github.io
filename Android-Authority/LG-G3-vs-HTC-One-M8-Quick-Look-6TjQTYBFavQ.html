plastic versus hairline brushed metal
hey Josh a regard for mandroid authority
what's going on everybody and this is
the LG g3 versus the HTC One m8 as we
start off with design the LG g3
quote-unquote metallic skin is supposed
to be scratch resistant and oleophobic
which is good news for the devices
durability but on the other side the m8
proven metal build gives it a timeless
and elegant appearance and improved
resistance to shocks but on the front
the LG g3 is almost all screen which
contrasts with the EM it's much lower
screen to footprint ratio HTC's device
features not only large dual front boom
sound speakers but also larger bezels
especially on the bottom side yes that
is because of the HTC black bar the g3
on comparison has its speaker located on
the rear which is not ideal but
hopefully it can make up for it in
loudness in our future tests the g3 is
rear mounted cameras flanked by a dual
LED flash and the laser focus system
while the signature volume and power
buttons make their return on the back
now in a sleeker form that is more
flushed to the device's surface but the
g3 may liken style compared to the m8
and make support in function Audi thanks
to the removable back plate that exposes
a micro SD card slot and a removable
battery but all in all that when it
comes to design we really do think that
both of these phones are quite great the
HTC One m8 is one of the best designed
phones out there and on the back of it
you have the hairline brush mail design
and of course that dual camera up top
but it is also one of the narrowest
phones to use in the hand providing some
really good handling especially from a
left-to-right reach the LG g3 on the
other hand does have a 5.5 inch screen
and it is very large but it is one of
the best-handling large screens out
there so in a way you can put some good
handling in the in the cab of either of
these devices but at 534 PPI very few
devices can match up to the LG g3 in
terms of sheer pixel density but now all
users will be blown away by it simply
because for many users Full HD is
already pretty good both displays then
are superb as the Full HD 1080p a
resolution screen of the HTC One m8 has
already really great but if you are
gunning for the absolute best and
sure we could recommend the quad-hd g3
the image display is half an inch
smaller than the g3 but the overall
height of both devices is pretty much
identical another benefit of those super
slim bezels on the g3 the LG g3 comes
with a quad-core Snapdragon 801
processor revving in AD 2 2.5 gigahertz
and 2 gigabytes of RAM with the audrina
330 while the m8 features the same
amount of RAM and the GPU but this time
has a 2.3 gigahertz Snapdragon 801 when
it comes to hardware you can't go wrong
picking either of these phones as both
the g3 and the m8 offer a rich spec
sheet and feature sets maybe the only
feature you might wish for is the
resistance to elements though the One m8
does have a limited level of resistance
to splashes if longevity is a priority
for you the g3 comes with a removable
3000 milliamp hour battery as opposed to
the 2600 milliamp hour unit on the m8
but to be honest in practice the
difference may not be as big due to the
g3 power thirsty quad HD screen both
phones do feature a micro SD card slot
that let you add up to a whopping 128
gigabytes of storage as well as all the
usual connectivity and sensor options
now kind of on paper the LG g3 s camera
isn't a huge improvement over last
year's g2 perhaps but it's not all about
the megapixel count so the g3 comes with
a unique laser assisted focusing system
now which should let the phone focus
much faster to the scene that you are
shooting especially when compared to the
previous row is powered LG g2 you also
get os plus here the enhanced version of
OS that was originally found in the LG G
pro 2 and we did say that it was a great
performer on already the m8 has quite a
few tricks of its own however even if
its features a smaller resolution for
ultra pixel sensor more akin to the HTC
One m7 but chief among these new
features is the selective focus feature
using the dual camera up top that makes
use of the depth sensor on the phones
back now resolution is going to be a big
hot-button topic when it comes to the m8
vs. pretty much any other phone out
there and if that is a contention point
for you then perhaps the LG g3 with its
great optics now with a better focusing
system will be the one that is a little
bit more preferred and finally in
software this is one of the more
intriguing sections because LG's
simplified and flattened its user
interface on the g3
and for the most part it's a very
welcome change many of the needless
flourishes are gone replaced by stylish
designs and we're especially glad to see
that the notification drop-down is a
whole lot cleaner and has more room for
what really matters quite a few
enhancements have been added into the
software suite as well by LG as it is
trying to be a real concierge to you to
give you the information that you need
through smart capabilities one of the
most interesting software features of
the g3 is the smart notice a virtual
assistants feature that at first glance
does look quite promising but on the
other side the One m8 comes with HTC's
well known blinkfeed homescreen which
does give it a feather in its cap over
at the g3 which doesn't have any news
psychic homescreen and blink feed is one
of our favorite news aggregator app
applications along with Sense 6 which is
very simplistic very stylized but also
very minimalistic which keeps the
operating system pretty fast and so
there you have it for this quick look at
the LG g3 versus the HTC One m8 we will
be doing these comparisons more in depth
later on especially when it comes to the
cameras but for now we want to just show
you what one was offering over the other
and if one is better for you then well
you got two of the best smartphones
available today there are a bunch of
flagships and the LG g3 was just
announced so stay tuned for more
coverage on that versus other ones so
