brought to you by gamefly welcome back
to android weekly my name is Jason this
past week saw a lot of people distressed
over the rumored news that Google+ could
be dying even though Google's PR rep
vehemently denied it as did Google+
community manager you had people like
Danny Sullivan of search engine land
calm making the poignant observation
that if Google+ is dining Google minus
is going to be awesome yes that's right
apparently according to TechCrunch in
the wake of vic and otras departure from
google he was the product visionary
behind Google+ Google is then going to
scale back the resources on Google+
substantially The Wall Street Journal
corroborates part of the story at least
reporting that the Google+ team has been
relocated within the Google campus from
its previous central position teams that
are deemed important inside Google are
placed closer to the office of the CEO
so as to make the move a signal of
demotion of sorts then again teams move
around the campus all the time said the
source of TechCrunch so let's unpack
that just a little bit and only talk
about what we know and what we can infer
from what we know we know that conductor
is gone but we don't know why we know
his replacement is David bez burry the
current vp of engineering at Google Plus
who is a very smart guy at a top Google
executive but not known as a product guy
lending further credence that they're
going to scale back on google+ but let's
talk about Google's primary business
model it is search search search search
that's how they make billions of dollars
every quarter and the reason they
created google plus and put so much time
resources in it was to create those
social signals that data that intimate
details about you and me there is no way
that Google+ is going to die or they're
going to let it die it may morph and
change into a way that allows them to
capitalize on those social signals but
Google+ will be with us for a long long
time in some form or another all right
moving on to news about the 1+1 so after
plenty of teasing and heavy marketing
the 1+1 was officially unveiled in
Beijing we now know that the one plus
one is officially a 5.5 inch display at
1080p with a Snapdragon 801 and Adreno
330 it has three gigs of ram at 13
megapixel camera and it has a 3100
milliamp hour battery running
cyanogenmod 11 specifically customized
for this phone I have told you guys
before that I think that Chinese
manufacturers are taking over I think
opa1 is just the beginning this is
really exciting this phone has flagship
power and yet it is cheaper than the
nexus 5 holy crap but if you're not in a
position right now to buy that seemingly
fantastic phone you were always in a
position to play affordable games you
see when you become a gamefly member you
can rent any of their eight thousand new
and classic titles they have to choose
from across all consoles and handhelds
rent up to four games at a time and keep
them for as long as you like and for
those of you who want to graduate and
play with the big boys gamefly members
can play hundreds of pc games with
unlimited pc play yeah so all you
hundreds of people who friended me on
battlefield you have no excuse when I
home you you can all get a 30 day free
trial if you goto gamefly.com /a thority
moving on to nexus 8 rumors so didja x
has surfaced a rumor that HTC won't be
manufacturing that 8.9 inch tablet
display that was rumored a couple months
ago but an 8-inch tablet there by
building the aptly named nexus 8 digit
I'm sources also claim that Google is
being less aggressive with its tablet
strategy this time around as the nexus
tablet line has already served its
primary purpose boosting androids tablet
market penetration what's interesting
about the reports wording is that digit
I'm sources indicate the nexus 8 will be
the company's third gen smaller tablet
meaning that we may not see a third
generation Nexus 7 but we should be
cautious and remember that digit I'm
doesn't have a perfect track record when
it comes to these rumors so please take
it with a grain of salt thanks for
watching a droid army my name is Jace
last week I asked you all a tshirt
question I asked you to help out William
who asked the question as to how to
speed up his slow phone
and I asked you to give links to back up
your instructions and give a clear easy
step-by-step guide not everyone followed
those instructions but I found someone
who did a great job and they did it
pretty fast and his name was Benny mega
dish Benny you win the t-shirt buddy so
Benny you can contact me via a google
plus hangout and private hangout and
give me your address and your t-shirt
size but for the rest of you who are
still asking me questions on google+
hangouts like a private messages there's
just too many of you and it's not public
so if I answer you no one else can
benefit from the answer so the things i
do monitor are the google google
comments and twitter but other stuff i
won't respond to you so please don't be
offended if i don't respond to you i'm
gonna ignore it okay so don't forget
about my brother's an Android Josh Joe
in the tech ninja Kevin and love has
joined us now he's doing a great job
with his reviews and the sound guys so
we've started a new channel the sound
guys you want to subscribe to the sound

great questions about Bluetooth headsets
i'm looking forward to their content see
you next week on android weekly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
