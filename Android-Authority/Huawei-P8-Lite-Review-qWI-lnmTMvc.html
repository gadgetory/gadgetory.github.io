talked-about and buzz worthy categories
in mobile technology budget smartphones
are better than ever and Chinese
manufacturer Huawei is trying to wedge
their way into the demanding US market
with their latest affordable offering
hey guys Phil Verena with Android
authority and this is the review of the
Huawei p8 Lite the design isn't striking
it's more expected and resembles most
smart phones these days with protruding
sides made to look like brushed metal
the plastic from the front and back come
to meet the silver sides much like a
glass sandwich design along those sides
running up the right there's the SIM
card and microSD card slot which
incidentally only allows expansion up to
32 gigabytes then there's the power
button which like the HTC One m9 sits
right below the volume rocker this I
found to be a problem with the m9 and
remains an issue here they are
distinguishable enough though so there
shouldn't be any issue of accidentally
pressing the volume keys thinking
they're the power and vice versa
up top microphone port and headphone
jack are opposed and on the right
there's nothing to see so we look
straight to the bottom where the typical
speaker grills and microUSB port reside
the all glass front has a 5 megapixel
front face and the notification light
with the Huawei branding adorning the
bottom on the back the camera module
sets upper-left with the flash
surrounded by a glossy plastic bar
stretching the whole top the rest though
still plastic resembles again the faux
brushed metal design with a smooth
texture which it while comfortable to
the touch does create a slippery surface
the overall square design combined with
a thickness of just seven point six
millimeters helped with holding in the
hand and given the smaller form factor
make it fairly easily pocketable device
the p8 Lite sports a 5 inch 720p display
calculating out to about 294 pixels per
inch which isn't all that impressive
especially as full HD is more the
mainstream and qHD the flagship luxury
but this is a budget phone after all the
screen tends to a warmer color palette
but you do have the option of going
cooler or even warmer in the settings
menu
the major complaint though that I have
is its brightness it's by all respects a
dim display I find that I can't
comfortably use it in regular day use
without the brightness
to a hundred percent despite all that
the screen is actually quite beautiful I
love how the colors are displayed and
they have a certain pop to them up the
brightness and add a few more pixels and
it would have greatly helped the
experience the p8 Lite CPU is a
lower-end snapdragon that we've seen
before and other lower end smartphones
the octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615
there's hardly any noticeable lag and
the experience is mostly fluid and I've
never felt like the phone had to catch
up to me it was fast and responsive now
this phone is meant for the US markets
who packs the LTE bands necessary for
use on t-mobile AT&amp;amp;T and all other GSM
networks this unit ships with two gigs
of RAM and 16 gigs of internal storage
but you can expand that storage up to an
additional 32 gigabytes the bottom left
justified single speaker actually
produces loud crisp sound it isn't as
full as other more expensive phones but
it is clear and doesn't produce an
irritating tinny sound as with most
phones with bottom facing speakers it's
easy to cover them while holding with
two hands so be careful to avoid it the
standout noteworthy feature has to be
the battery which at 220 milliamp hours
seems to last and last
getting through a day is completely
guaranteed and you're likely to get
through most of the following day if
you're a light user I was only able to
drain the battery in one day by using
the p8 Lite mostly for watching video
and a lot of web browsing I got around
five hours of screen on time and it
could have easily been more if I had the
screen at less than 100% brightness but
to my earlier point you need it that
bright so while the screen resolution
and brightness are a letdown they do
have their upside and completely
reliable battery life featured on the
back is a 13 megapixel shooter at an F
2.2 aperture if the phone's asleep you
can get into the app quickly by double
tapping the volume down button for a
camera with no oh is it takes decent
photos particularly outdoors colors
aren't too saturated a little on the
duller side but still more than
acceptable low-light struggles as with
most phones in the budget category with
noise and general lack of detail there
are also features too like the now more
popular beauty mode and filters as well
as HDR and an all focus mode that lets
you change the focus after the shot is
taken the front face ER is 5 megapixels
with an F 2.4 aperture and
is definitely mediocre outdoors the
shots look okay but on the darker side
and lacking in any richness in color and
in lower light it'll get you by but
don't lean on it too heavily for the
perfect selfie software is unfortunately
another area of disappointment we're
running the older 4.4.4 kitkat and
although there are talks of a lollipop
update no date has been announced but on
top of KitKat Huawei uses their emotion
UI a more colorful approach leaning
towards a rounder look especially with
the icons there is no app drawer though
so it's up to you to organize your apps
in folders emotion UI has its own
features too with motion controls and
smart assistance with a one-handed UI
mode that allows the dialer on your
phone to be either left or right hand
justified the navbar can also be
adjusted to whatever arrangement you
like with the option to also add a key
for the notification drop-down you also
have your choice of themes to help in
giving a different look but there aren't
that many to choose from so don't bet
that you'll find your favorite the p8
Lite is available now in either a black
or white finish for 250 bucks off
contract and as an added bonus does come
with a two-year warranty so this is a
tough one
for two hundred and fifty dollars how
can you go wrong if this phone was on
its own I'd have no issue recommending
it as the budget option but as there are
other awesome offerings from Alcatel One
Touch and a soos I just find it
difficult to do well guys thanks for
