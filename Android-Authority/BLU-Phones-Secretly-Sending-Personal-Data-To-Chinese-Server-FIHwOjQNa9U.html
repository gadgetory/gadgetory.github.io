manufacturers were really catching steam
and some people were saying hey you got
to be careful about those Chinese
manufacturers because they could be
planting stuff on your phone to monitor
you steal your data and use that against
us - I don't know drug our children or
something you know people like this guy
Infowars guy most people at least here
in Canada make fun of people like him
because he sounds bloody insane and I'm
here to tell you 1776 will commence
again if you try to take our firearms
and tell you sort of have to admit that
he was right about a good number of
things not everything don't bring out
the tinfoil hat people just yet but you
gotta admit that he was right about a
lot and he was right about this because
at least some of it was true so instead
of eating my hat I'm just gonna wear it
the unlocked smartphone company blue has
now admitted that several of its
handsets have been secretly sending out
personal data collected from their
owners the data was transmitted via a
third-party app that was installed on
six of its phones according to the New
York Times the security firm crypt a
wire first discovered that an app in
some of Blue's phones was transmitting
data to a Chinese server every 72 hours
it's not yet clear if the data was being
mined for advertising purposes or to
collect intelligence for the Chinese
government however the story adds that
the company that wrote the software
claims that the app was made for a
Chinese phone manufacturer to monitor
users it also claims that it was not
meant to be installed on handsets sold
to a u.s. audience I think I'm getting a
signal here blue has since admitted that
about a hundred and twenty thousand of
its phones have been collecting
unauthorized personal data in the form
of text messages call logs and contacts
from customers via the wireless update
app the six phone models that were
affected were the r-1 HD the energy x
plus two the studio touch the advance of
4.0 l - the Neo XL and the energy
diamond blue now claims the offending
app has since been self updated and the
functionality verified to be no longer
collecting or sending this information
however it's likely that many blue phone
buyers won't be able to trust the
company again after the serious breach
of security there's no word if the
company will offer any refunds but it
did say that quote our customers privacy
and security are of the utmost
importance and priority and that any
customers with questions about the
situation should call them at one eighty
seven seven six oh two eight seven six -
dang that is nasty
that's horrible I bought one of those
phones one of those models I got it from
my mother-in-law and she loved the phone
it was big and thin and fantastic it was
fast I won't be buying one of those
again that is a whole
Renda slit that like gives in to like a
lot of the even xenophobic and racist
fears about China it's it's it's crazy
now blue is not a Chinese manufacturer
they are actually an American company
but they have their phones many of their
phones manufactured in China again
reinforcing this fear and there's at
least some truth to it do any of you
have blue phones what do you think about
this or what are you going to do about
it
