show is brought to you by magnetic balls
puzzle game hello again ladies and
gentlemen I'm Joe Hindy the android
authority app guy this is google play
weekly let's get right to it in our
first bit of news this week google has
added song lyrics to their knowledge
graph this is an interesting move
because we've been so relying on sites
like AZ lyrics and MetroLyrics for so
long the lyrics are posted on the search
and you can read the whole thing on
google play music if you so choose it
doesn't have all the song lyrics yet but
we imagine it won't be that long until
it does on another note this sucks for
sites like AZ lyrics at metrolyrics who
are about to see a mammoth drop-in
visitors very soon there is a brand-new
humble bundle out with a bunch of games
from noodle cake studios that means it
includes games like super stickman golf
2 Mikey boots tower dwellers and a whole
lot more you can pay whatever you want
and get four games or you can beat the
average which is six dollars and sixty
cents at the time of the making of this
video to get at least three additional
games and if you pay eight dollars or
more you get all the games it's a lot of
games to play and it goes to a good
cause so go ahead and check it out
earlier this week Google put the
banhammer on using user testimonials and
apt descriptions there are two big
reasons for this the first being that
developers have been known to pay people
to leave good reviews that they can then
use for testimonials and the second is
because developers use testimonials to
mention more popular applications so
they can game the search results with
this move Google is keeping things a
little more honest and let's face facts
no one is reading those testimonials any
way to celebrate the holidays google has
over two dozen games on sale right now
some of the games are pretty good to the
sale includes goat simulator both Rayman
games Dragon Quest Deus Ex the fall game
dev story machinarium and the room too
what I like most about it were the range
of games there are shooters adventure
games puzzle games rpgs and pretty much
whatever floats your boat we'll have a
link to these in the briton companion
which is in the video description below
in our last bit of news this week google
announced their end of the year sale
which includes over 100 music albums the
sale encompasses all kinds of genres and
time periods so there's probably
something there for everyone after a
cursory glance I found some Paramore
Lana Del Rey Kid Rock before he went all
country dr. dre Pearl Jam Marvin Gaye
Katy Perry and a few compilations if
you're shopping for music you should
definitely check these out you can find
the link to it in the written companion
which is in the video description below
let's
take a moment to talk about our sponsor
magnetic balls puzzle game is as the
name says a puzzle game it's totally
free with no in-app purchases and it's a
great way to kill a few minutes the
balls use a magnetic kind of physics
that caused them to move even after you
fired them and you must connect three or
more to clear them out of the way you
can play arcade mode or story mode it's
a fun little time waster and it costs
literally nothing to add to your app
drawer so who wants to see some trending
applications as usual if you want to
check any of these applications out you
can find the links in the video
description below shutter 1 dragonfall

help them make better eye contact and
improve facial recognition which are two
of the bigger problems people with
autism face from the looks of it Samsung

seem to have kept the science and
studies in mind there are some issues
here and there but all apps have those
on release day Knights of the Old
Republic is an old RPG from bioware that
is now on android it contains a very
long story line with multiple endings
