handy the Android authority app guy
mother's day is fast approaching and if
you're stuck on what to do we'll show
you some fun mother's day applications
here after the intro first on our list
is bakery store Mother's Day Edition
this cafe world style game is a fun and
simple little game that your mom may
very well enjoy if she's into those
Facebook flash style games developers of
the game have added some extra items
into the game to give it more of a
Mother's Day feel it's a free app so
it'll cost you or your mom nothing to
give it a try and see if you like it
while finding a fun video game for your
mom isn't exactly the best gift we'd
like to cover all of our bases here and
a lot of moms actually like these kinds
of games these days next on our list is
probably the app that most people may
actually use it's called mobile coupons
and deals and as the name suggests it
shows you a plethora of deals and
coupons from a number of stores they've
updated their app recently to show
Mother's Day specials at stores so if
you're looking for a fun gift for mom
this app may help you find it it's free
in the Google Play Store so there's no
harm in giving it a look you simply
select the stores you wish to see
coupons from and it'll show it to you
there's even a big button at the top
that says Mother's Day deals to help you
get right to the point it's definitely
the most useful app on the list of
course mothers always enjoy a little
heartfelt words from their kids and our
next app called Mother's Day poems aims
to help with just that it features some
poetry about Mother's Day that people
can use for a variety of things whether
it's needing a few lines for a card or
just something for your mom to read this
app can help out as with all the apps on
this list this app is free on the Google
Play Store so if your Mother's Day plans
could use a little more poetry we
recommend checking out this app and
others like it the list continues with a
wallpaper app that'll get your mom's
Android phone and the spirit of Mother's
Day with a nice background image
obviously this isn't going to be your
coup de Gras but it can definitely help
with the ambience and give a more
complete Mother's Day experience the
wallpapers are actually pretty decent
although there aren't that many of them
as I said a second ago though this is
more of a peripheral thing and likely
won't be the focal point of your
Mother's Day festivities last on our
list is an app called Mother's Day cards
this fun little app has a collection of
Mother's Day cards that are already
ready for you to send to your mom this
can be helpful if you've forgotten to
buy a card already or if you'd like to
take a look at a different selection
than what's available at your local card
shop there are plenty of cars to choose
from you can even find them in different
languages if you surf for long enough
you can send them through email or
messaging we would have liked to have
seen a social network share option but
you're sending Mother's Day cards not
the latest if it fits
I sets picture if you take a look at our
leaderboard you can see how these apps
compare to one another as always we
don't rate these personally this is how
you the people have rated them in the
Google Play Store there isn't any bias
on our part if you want to check these
apps out for some Mother's Day ideas
we've included the app links in the
video description where you can download
all of them for free from the Google
Play Store once again i'm joe hindi the
android authority app guy feel free to
subscribe to our youtube channel or
check out the social media links in the
video description</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
