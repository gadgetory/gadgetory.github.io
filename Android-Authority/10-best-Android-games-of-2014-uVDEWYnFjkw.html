mobile version of the popular football
slash soccer series produced by EA
Sports it features improved graphics and
gameplay over last year's release as
well as updated rosters and more stuff
to do it is true that EA has put a
number of in-app purchases in this title

sports games released this year that can
compete with the complete experience
that FIFA 15 provides football fantasy 6
was released earlier this year as a
remake it received a graphic overhaul

creepy and it's brilliant goat simulator
is a game that took PC by storm some
time ago and did much the same on
Android earlier this year in this game
you play the totally realistic life of a
goat as you fly around crash through
walls blow things up and cause general
mayhem the game single-handedly brought
back the phrase it's not a bug it's a
feature and away few developers could
ever match the graphics are pretty good

defense game that is the prequel game to
the original to Kingdom rush titles this
seems to have plugged all the holes that
the prior titles had as the game

5 star rating in the Google Play Store
the game features new towers new bad
guys and a host of other gameplay
features and improvements to the
mechanics
Monument Valley was the darling of
Android gamers in 2014
the game featured brilliant optical

puzzle game that has you trying to find
and figure out those illusions
it comes with a simple but dark story
and unique colourful graphics after the
regular game and expansion was released
called Forgotten shores for a dollar
ninety-nine altogether it's 15 of the
most unique levels you may ever play

complicated story and great graphics the
