floor I'm one of the last days of CES
2019 and today we want to bring you the
best Chromebooks that we've seen so far
there's a lot on this list but we're
just going to go through our favorites
so without further ado let's go
the first Chromebook is the Acer
Chromebook 315 and this is the first AMD
partner out of the gate it packs a 15.6
inch IPS display with a full HD
resolution serve just for you with touch
and non touch flavors you'll see a
decent amount of system memory and the
usual limited storage capacity as we've
seen with other Chromebooks and that
means you might end up pushing photos
and videos onto a microSD card after
installing your favorite Android apps
besides AMD's involvement we really love
that this Chromebook has upward facing
speakers now most laptops have speakers
on the bottom and that just does not
give a really great sound experience
it's really nice that these speakers are
facing up on this laptop otherwise
you're gonna get a USBC connection in a
backlit keyboard and it weighs just 3.7
pounds it's gonna be available in it
February for a starting price of two
hundred and seventy nine dollars next
week about the HP Chromebook 14 which is
the second model revealed up the show
that is using an AMD processor now
compared to a sears model this is a 14
inch screen so it's a little bit smaller
and it uses an HD resolution display
you're also gonna see less memory than
you did have on the Eastern model but
you do have the same amount of storage
you also have a micro SD card slot that
helps you expand your storage if you run
out and it's got USB type-c and a pair
of USB type-c ports HP's new Chromebook
14 is gonna be available January 20
seconds with a starting price of 269
dollars let's check out the Asus
Chromebook flip see four three four and
this laptop does not have an AMD
processor it's actually got a newly
announced core Y series processor that's
an eighth generation from Intel and it
draws way less power
Asus has also increased the former 12.5
inch screen to 14 inches but retain the
same full HD resolution as the name
suggests the c43 4 includes a 360 degree
hinge which basically means that you can
flip it around and basically use it as a
tablet Asus has it jammed a 14 inch
screen into a 13-inch aluminum chassis
which enables bezels measuring just 5
millimeters thin you'll be able to get
this laptop with up to 8 gigabytes of
system memory up to 128
veidt's of internal storage and a
microsd card slot which supports up to 2
terabytes of storage and you can find
this laptop with two USB type-c ports a
USB type a port for peripherals and a
headphone jack bayes's Chromebook
flipsie 4 3 4 is going to be available
in the coming months with various
configurations and starts at five
hundred and sixty nine dollars last but
not least we've got the HP Chromebook x3
6014 g1 now finally HP showed up with a
Chromebook this targeting professionals
at this show the x360 14 g1 is the
company's first Chromebook that supports
an Intel Core i7 processor it's using a
14 inch IPS touchscreen with Full HD
resolution it is backed by 16 gigabytes
of system memory and up to 64 gigabytes
of storage this HP Chromebook relies on
a 360 degree hinge which you can use in
like tablet tent or regular laptop mode
and it's ideal for professionals that
want to share their work at the office
or maybe use the pen that's compatible
with the device you'll also find some HP
classroom software two USB type-c ports
a USB type a part a micro SD card slot
backlit keyboard and a battery that
promises up to 13 hours of battery life
the HP Chromebook x360 14 g1 is going to
be available at this month for a
currently unknown price make sure to
check back for the best laptops of CES
2019 and they're not actually all
running on Windows 10 Google didn't have
a ton of Chromebooks at the show but
we're hoping to see more in the coming
months and what we've seen here so far
is already pretty exciting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
