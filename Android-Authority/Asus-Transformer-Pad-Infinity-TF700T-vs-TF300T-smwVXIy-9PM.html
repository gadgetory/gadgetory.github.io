Youngberg once again coming at you from
Android authority calm your number one
source for all things Android today
we've got a head-to-head Smackdown
between two of a Sosa's top tablets on
the market right now we've got our Asus
Transformer Pad Infinity TF 700 T and
then we have our transformer pad TF 300
T now a few slight differences within
these tablets we've got our price point
on the 700 T the infinity as we'll call
it a 64 gigabyte version coming in at
$599 and then our TF 300 TS coming in at
$400 for a 16 gigabyte version so if
you're looking at from a price
standpoint you're already gonna be
having having one chopped up for the TF
300 T now as you notice these are
definitely constructed using different
materials the 300 T is constructed using
plastic we do have a metal piece for the
little hinge on the mobile keyboard dock
but even the keyboard dock here is
encased in a little bit of plastic now
it does stay cool with the plastic but
the aluminum body of the 700 T is
actually what's going to stay the
coolest under high temperatures and
stuff like that anyways we'll open both
of these up and we'll shut the screen
off just for now as you can see the
keyboard docks are roughly constructed
in the same manner we have our raised
keys coming out of the body of the
actual keyboard dock which is very
classy and elegant and it's also more
durable you can just rip the keys off of
there then we do have different touch
pads on the docks here just like that
and a different bar to click on each of
them now each of the docks do hold a
battery and add about 5 hours of battery
life to each device now they're each a
10.1 inch screen tablet both just about
as thick as the other the 300 T is a
little bit more thick than the Infinity
we have our power buttons located in the
same place on each device up in the top
left and then on the Infinity we have a
Seuss's chosen to put the volume rocker
on the top right as opposed to the left
of the tablet on the 300 T now the 300 T
does feel a little bit lighter and it
also feels a little more flimsy just due
to the plastic construction it kind of
has some give in the back and even the
screen itself
a little bit more give than the 700 T um
the body also can separate from the
screen ever so slightly under uh you
know if you're kind of holding it wrong
or something like that but they're both
great
we'll check out on the back here we are
rocking an eight megapixel camera on
each device but on the Infinity we have
a LED flash as you can see as well as a
small mic right there and our front
facing camera on each device the
Infinity is rocking a 2 megapixel camera
and at 720p with capabilities of HD 720p
and then our 300 that TF 300 T is
reckoned a 1.2 megapixel camera now as
far as software they're both the exact
same software we're running Android
4.0.3 on each they each have the wave
share UI by Asus we do have a much
brighter screen on the TF 700 T due to
its LED backlit super IPS + display now
the 300 T is only the IPS so as you can
see here on our 300 T we just simply
have our volume scroll and our auto
brightness while on the 700 T we
actually have our super IPS + mode that
we can actually view this outside and
just have great viewing angles and stuff
like that now the apps that come on each
of these are basically the same we just
have our stock ace u s-- apps here on
the Left we have the Asus vibe the app
backup app Locker the same here on the
TF 700 T and in my opinion the 700 T
displays things just a bit better the
300 T is a little more reflective it
seems as though there's actually more
space between the top of the screen and
the actual LCD screen within now there
is Corning Gorilla Glass 2 on the 700 T
which is going to protect against
scratches and it's just all around a
little bit better display on much better
in terms of resolution now our
resolution on the 300 T is at 1280 by
800 resolution and then on the TF 700 T
V infinity we've got 1920 by 1200
resolution so it says much better we
have really good pixel density on each
so they both look great anyways we'll go
ahead and check out our status bar and
go into the settings scroll all the way
down on each
you can see that under the about tablet
for the TF 300 T we rock and Android
4.0.3 that is the same on the 700 T I
wouldn't be surprised if these devices
do get jellybean in the future so we'll
just hold out for that anyways I do
notice that the colors are a little bit
more rich on the 700 T so we'll go ahead
and go to YouTube and we'll just view a
similar video on e so as you can see
here we are running the same exact video
on each tablet the 700 T does have a
little bit more striking colors than the
300 T and it looks like our refresh rate
on the 300 T is a little bit lower we're
getting some cycling on the screen and
stuff but both of them are displaying
the video extremely nicely so yeah our
colors are a little more rich on the 702
into the super IPS plus display but it's
not that big of a deal they both run at
a very very high rate and they're both
great for viewing videos HD gaming and
stuff like that now the Tegra 3 is
awesome for gaming we have our different
apps like globe all pre-installed so we
can actually game hard so we've killed
all the apps on each tablet we're gonna
go ahead and run a quadrant test on each
of them see which one comes out faster
according to the quadrant scores we have
the results of our benchmark tests the
Infinity came in at a score of 4000 and
then the TF 300 T came in at 3900 91 so
we're cutting extremely close both of
these are crazy fast tablets now our CPU
scored 10,000 245 on the TF 300 T and we
got 8000 637 on the 700 T which is a
little bit strange considering the 700 T
is in fact clocked higher but we got
let's see 3900 for memory and 2800 for
memory on the 700 T that is so we're
basically just across the board even now
both of these devices have a few
differences on the actual body we'll
just go ahead and hold those up
side-by-side we do have the micro HDMI
on each of these as well as the mini SD
on our headphone jack is located and if
occasion on the 700 t than this on the
300 T which is right here but both of
these have a nice slim profile they look
great in their keyboard adapters we'll
go ahead and put those together show you
the different thicknesses of each so as
you can see there are differences in a
thickness between each of these devices
when they're in their mobile dock the
700 T is just a little bit thinner and
it's actually you know a little bit
heavier just very slightly but we do
have our 16 pin connector on each and
then we have on the other side full SD
card readers and USB 2.0 on each so
either way you guys these are both great
devices if you want to spend the extra
money for a little bit higher clock
speed on the Tegra 3 a little bit extra
storage and then a nice aluminum
construction I'd say go for the 700 T
but if you just need the basic internals
of the 700 T with a smaller price point
and still a really durable device with a
great multitasking keyboard dock I would
suggest going for the 300 T but what are
your guys opinions go ahead and drop us
a line in the comments visit our website
we'll have a written review up for these
and just go ahead and tell us what you
think but anyways guys thanks for
watching we always appreciate it and
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
