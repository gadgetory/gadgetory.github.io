name is Kevin the tech ninja and today
I'm reviewing the Moga pro controllers
once upon a time far far away in October
2013
I reviewed the Moga pro gaming
controller I spoke highly of it and it's
still one of the best accessories that
I've kept in my bag wherever I go I even
said of provided counsel like gaming
control on your Android device well this
holiday Moga has geared up and brought
us something new two unique controllers
does it continue its reign as the best
Android accessory let's find out first
control I'm going to talk about is the
Moga hero pro controller this is
designed to be slim and portable
something that could be easily slipped
into a bag or even your pockets on the
surface the controller has dual
clickable analog sticks a d-pad a B X&amp;amp;Y
buttons l1 l2 r1 r2 buttons as well so I
know what you're thinking ok Kevin this
sounds really great but what's the big
deal well thank you viewer let me tell
you the big deal
built into the controller it has a
rechargeable 1800 mAh battery you can
charge your device as you play also this
controller includes the led battery life
indicator so you can see how much juice
is actually left the Big Brother to the
hero controller is the Moga pro power
controller which is the newer version of
the controller previously reviewed this
2 has the d-pad ABXY buttons shoulders
and triggers and also it has a
rechargeable battery this one comes in a
whopping 2300 mAh Moga pro power
controller is not as portable as this
little brother but yet again it provides
counsel like control this controller
really feels like an Xbox controller it
requires little to no adjustment period
due to the battery and the size of the
controller is heavier than last year's
model weighing in at 251 grams versus
190 grams from last year both
controllers are great in their own right
the hero is shockingly small but really
feels good in the hands the controller
is made out of plastic and the analogs
are covered in rubber the rubber on the
analog sometimes becomes slippery and
tough to grip
the buttons really remind me of Marvel's
and that's the only way I can really
describe the texture of them the press
depth may not be as pronounced as you'd
expect on a keyboard or a console
controller but it's enough feedback to
let you know you press the button the
shoulder buttons are bit stiff and since
the controller is so thin it probably
doesn't have enough depth for the buds
to go down so far and that's just me
nitpicking here overall this controller
feels great in being able to dock your
phone on top of it toss it back in your
pocket and engage any kind that I just
mentioned I will go on record to say
that the Moga pro power controller is
the best controller I've used for a
mobile device not only does it feel like
an Xbox controller it controls like one
as well there is no lag when making
precise movements and adjustments on the
controller the plastic molded handles
really contours to your hands the
analogs are covered in rubber and they
also have a lift around the edge and
this really allows your fingers to get a
good grip the plastic buttons have great
depth when you push them in and this
prevents accidental presses the shorter
button spills as expected and the
triggers really allow me to push pretty
far speaking of triggers they remind me
of the new PlayStation 4 controller
they're flat and wide it makes them easy
to find both controllers provide an LED
from battery light and arm to hold your
devices and also an a/b switch more on
this later the arm on this line of
mobile controllers are 3.7 inches long
which can hold my Galaxy Note 3 with no
issues last year's model had a three
point four inches arm and although it
did hold a Galaxy Note 3 it became
unstable and very wobbly for some reason
if you don't want to have your phone
connected to your controller or you have
a tablet there is an optional stand that
it comes with it's a pretty basic
plastic stand that flips out there's
nothing else I can really say about it
when it comes to charging your device
both of these controllers come with our
own internal battery pack this feature
is called the Moga boost and it only
works if your controller has 25% of
battery life for more also the battery
is shared so this battery that charges
your device is the same battery that
keeps the controller working in the
first place the controllers will
continue to work below 25% but are no
longer charges your device to conserve
battery on the Moghuls you can simply
unplug it from the device
it's really tough to calculate the
real-world usage that you would expect
with this controller it depends on too
many factors screen brightness Wi-Fi on
or off how much power the game uses what
type of signal you have and so on and so
forth but in my experiences my note 3
with the pro power charge my phone for
about two and a half hours and around an
hour and a half on the hero controller
and that's a huge your mileage may vary
situation regardless if you get one hour
or if you get two hours knowing that you
can charge your device while playing on
the go in a slim portable compact device
is a bonus feature just like before it's
a pair your controllers you launch the
pivot application which is found in the
Play Store it has a few things that ask
you to do like turn on Bluetooth and
assure the controller is on and within a
few moments its pair this pivot
application acts like a mogul controller
compatible Play Store it shows you a
large amount of games that your
controller is compatible with but I urge
you to go out to the Play Store and see
which games our controller compatible
independently because the pivot store
does not have all the games on there
that our controller compatible only
games that they've tested and I have no
idea how often the pivots or even
updates this list in the first place on
the controller you'll notice that it has
an AMD switch as your primary mode of
gaming and B is hid compatible so this
tries to find a way to make the
controller work on non controller games
it's really hit or miss but it's still a
nice feature to have overall I'm excited
about the new line of mobile controllers
the hero Edition may not have the best
control but it's very portable something
you can toss in your pocket and also
charge your device on-the-go which is a
really big deal the pro edition is a bit
bulkier but it's really made for
hardcore gamers if you really want to
play a dead trigger or any game that
requires great control on your device
then the pro controller is the best
option you have in the market right now
and I can see it being a huge gift this
holiday season as you heard from the
review both controllers has their pros
and cons which is good so you have a lot
of options if you're looking to get
something like this as always guys my
