today I'm reviewing mecha words mega
words is a turn-based game that we found
on the Android app market and here's a
little I'll start with a notification um
each time you get a turn it brings up a
notification in the menu there and you
just select it you can actually turn on
and off the sound notification for when
you get those notifications it's up to
you
so here's people playing against me and
there we go and let's see it's very
simple to play you just take choose a
word is and if it's already played it'll
come up in red and you won't be able
play the word again and you hit play
word at the bottom to clear this word if
you want to play is hit the white bar
below there and I'll clear the word and
I can choose something else or whatever
else both is play word this game is ad
base so every so often ads will pop up
between turns and they do plan on
releasing non-it ad based version of
this game down the road let's go into
options set our settings here you can do
sauna notifications as I mentioned
earlier and hide your saved games and I
will turn its own her show finish games
off save settings to start a new game
you just hit the plus menu at the top
right hand corner and you'll bring up
these some options you can choose with
the game board size six by six currently
I have only English dictionary available
random player friend search player
friends from contact which is nice so I
can choose some friends to play against
if I want to or you can search for
players that you already know people who
are playing so I'm just gonna random
player and this is just going to send
out an invite to that name below whether
they are looking for a game or not they
look at the invite if they don't want to
play it you can just do climb it and
there we go all right and then I also
want to show you the registration I
heard a logout here we go so here's the
first clean you come to when you start
the game you can either register a new
account with that username email which
is optional and your password and then
if you want to log in you just hit login
and you just type in your username there
and your password it's all pretty simple
in them theirs forgot your password
below and that is Meg words I really
enjoyed the game I would highly suggest
this to anyone who is a fan of word
games or if you're new to word games
this is a great one to start and thanks
for taking the time to check out my
review of Meg words on android authority
