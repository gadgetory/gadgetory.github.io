brings a similar ultra-thin design but
this time with 4G LTE and 2 gigabytes of
RAM so what's it like to use a phone
with nearly half the weight and half the
thickness of competing options this is
Bailey Stein with Android authority and
this is my for review of the blue vivo
air LTE when I first picked up the vivo
air LTE I was expecting to have to
insert a battery because of how light
the phone felt in the hand making a
mistake this phone is very light and 98
grams it's also the thinnest smartphone
that you can purchase with in the u.s.
at 5.1 millimeters the vivo air LTE is
so petite that it doesn't feel much like
a traditional smartphone it's unlikely
to feel heavy after holding it for even
extended periods of time and you may
even forget whether or not it's in your
pocket of course there's more to the
design than just the small form factor
the vivo air LTE is made of two glass
panels housed together with an aluminum
band both of these panels are coated in
Corning Gorilla Glass 3 but I did notice
that the back of my unit scratched
pretty easily with normal use it also
has the unfortunate tendency to collect
fingerprints which may annoy some users
these are really just drawbacks of using
glass but I would still recommend using
the included case if you want to avoid
these issues as expected the glass
construction does make the back fairly
slippery in some use cases I found it
difficult to rest the phone on my knee
for example or set it next to myself
while driving I consider these issues
fairly minor and what's really important
is that the phone doesn't feel slippery
in the hand thanks to the smaller size I
never had issues holding the phone with
a single hand and never felt that I was
going to drop the phone the aluminum
band wrapping around the edges of the
vivo air LTE is certainly a nice touch
especially at this price point as it
contributes to a very solid feeling
phone overall applying light pressure
does cause the phone to flex just a bit
but I wouldn't worry about it bending in
your pocket the power and volume buttons
provide a decent amount of tactile
feedback and
as minor as it seems I really
appreciated having both the headphone
jack and micro USB port on the bottom of
the device coming to the front of the
phone you'll find a 5 megapixel front
facing camera as well as a notification
LED to the left although the amount of
bezel may lead you to believe otherwise
the vivo air LTE includes on-screen
buttons it seems a bit disappointing
that blue didn't use the extra space for
capacitive keys or better yet reduce the
bezel size the vivo air LTE s four point
eight inch 720p Super AMOLED display
looks excellent with great contrast deep
blacks and very saturated colors
although it does have a relatively lower
resolution it still maintains a
respectable PPI of 306 the smaller size
is a major change from larger devices
that I've recently been using but I do
appreciate the smaller form factor for
better one-handed use performance on the
vivo air LTE has been mostly good thanks
to the 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 410
this is a pretty substantial step up
from the mediatek mt6752 gigabytes of
ram which seems to have improved
multitasking performance quite a bit if
you're into gaming you'll find that the
vivo air LTE is able to play most games
without any major issues the adrenal 306
is on the lower end and that's reflected
in some games where frame drops and
slower load times are not uncommon just
as you'd expect the vivo air LTE is
carrying support for 802 11 and Wi-Fi
GPS and Bluetooth 4.0 there's also
support for some us 4G LTE networks with
FDD LTE bands 2 4 and 7 unfortunately
it's missing bands 5 and 17 480 and 12
for t-mobile meaning that you'll only
receive 4G LTE speeds in certain areas
during my testing for example I was
unable to receive 4G LTE on the AT&amp;amp;T US
network in my home coverage area perhaps
surprisingly the rear-facing speaker on
the vivo air LTE is very loud it does
sound distorted and tinny however and I
wish blue would
I stood on the front of the device
battery life was one of my major
concerns before I started using the vivo
air LTE in order to keep the device thin
blue went with a 2050 milliamp hour
internal battery which is a relatively
low capacity during my battery life
tests I found that the phone could last
an average of about 16 hours with about
three and a half hours of screen on time
that's a relatively decent amount of
time but I noticed that the test results
varied quite a bit from day to day for
example one day I got the phone to last
for 14 and a half hours with 4 hours of
screen on time only to be followed the
next by 12 hours and two hours of screen
on time all of these tests were
conducted with Wi-Fi off for the
majority of the day and screen
brightness set to about 40% the 8
megapixel Sony IMAX 219 rear camera on
the vivo air LTE performed well for the
price color reproduction seems to be
accurate and all of the images I took
were considerably sharp and the right
lighting conditions you can get some
pretty high-quality photos I did notice
some issues with automatic white balance
however where the phone couldn't decide
which color setting to use this was
mainly an issue in brighter environments
and setting white balance manually
helped prevent producing incorrectly
coloured images
the default camera app provides basic
control and is overall pretty easy to
use the vivo air LTE runs a mostly stock
build of Android 5.0 point to lollipop
out of the box the changes I noticed
include clear buttons in the
multitasking menu a lock screen time
widgets with an appended AM or PM and a
lighter font for the time in the
notification panel in addition to those
changes Blue has also included the touch
pal 2015 keyboard but I downloaded the
Google keyboard shortly after setting up
the device there's also a few power
saving modes included out of the box
should you choose to use them
unfortunately it's unlikely that we'll
see any updates for this device it's
blue is notorious for their poor
after-sales support although they are
promising an Android 6.0 marshmallow
update I have my reservations whether it
will actually happen back in June they
promised that they'd have Android 5.0
lollipop updates for the life--one and
life 8 XL ready in july but blue has yet
to deliver those updates nor provide an
updated timeline whether they are still
working on those updates is unclear but
it does raise concerns on whether this
device will ever see anything more than
Android 5.0 point 2 for 199 the blue
vivo air LTE is a competitive action
available in either black or white
starting on September 22nd well there is
16 gigabytes of on-board storage the
vivo air LTE offers no expansion options
this may be a problem for some users
depending on where you store your files
the blue vivo air LTE is one of Blues
most compelling offerings yet and it's
one of the better phones for under $200
it has an amazingly thin and light
design great display and a very good
camera
however the 4G LTE support is limited
the battery life can be inconsistent and
it's unlikely that we'll see the device
being supported with Android updates
although I'd recommend a comparable
device like the Moto G 2015 or even Asus
zenfone 2 for the better 4G LTE support
and software support you likely won't be
disappointed by going with a vivo air
LTE if you can deal with its quirks the
Blu vivo air LTE is a good
for under $200 thank you for watching
