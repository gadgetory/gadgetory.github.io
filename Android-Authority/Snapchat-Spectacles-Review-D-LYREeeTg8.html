the past wearable cameras and they've
been met with mostly mixed results
they tend to be unfashionable and too
obvious while putting the issue of
privacy into question
however creators of the greatly popular
app snapchat are tackling it with their
own product that puts a camera in a pair
of sunglasses and you have to be
extremely lucky to get one do these
fashion forward camera enabled glasses
show us a glimpse into a future for not
just snapchatters but also for
storytelling itself we're here to find
out because it's Joshua Garr from
Android authority what's going on
everybody and these are the snapchat
spectacles I'm not a crazy snapchat user
for general social media but the same
sometimes silly aspects that play into
social media are actually wonderful to
use for messaging chatting with friends
and family is easy often fun and
snapchat puts every tool at the users
disposal whether it be through text
graphic audio or video as far as
sunglasses go the spectacles are of
decent quality and they make it pretty
clear that the $129 you would pay for
them is more for the electronics than
the fashion I have a couple of worries
that the spectacles will survive not
much more than the typical wear and tear
but these are a pair of glasses that
you'd probably want to coddle a little
bit anyway they fit a little snug on my
head not to the point is pinching but it
did take a little bit of time to get
used to so the price is justified by the
bits and pieces in the two temples on
the left when wearing the glasses it's a
shorter button that starts the
ten-second snaps and there's a white LED
indicator that shows battery life and
alerts others to the fact that you are
recording behind that temple are the
connector pins for charging which can be
done either with the included cable or
with a case that holds the battery big
enough for four full charges
speaking of battery life the spectacles
are claimed to get up to 100 snaps
before needing to be charged but I've
really only gotten closer to 60 this
indicator on the left is actually really
elegant and when you compare it to
something like a red light it's much
easier on the eyes a red recording light
is often distracting and definitely
alarming to some people instead you get
this rotating white light here that is
like I said easy on the eyes but also
kind of inviting I can't even begin to
tell you how many people came up to me
asking me what is going on with my
sunglasses and then of course I would
get
into conversations with them and explain
to them what these are explanations as
to what these spectacles are we're
mostly received with awe and I was never
asked to stop recording or delete
footage after all they are only 10
seconds Maps and I don't record
incessantly and also I'm smart enough to
know when a situation doesn't lend
itself to documentation it pretty much
comes down to this don't be a jerk you
should be smart enough and nice enough
to know when to record and when not to
record and if somebody comes up to you
and tells you to stop recording or to
delete footage you would do so right
because you're a nice person got it good
the videos are recorded at a pretty low
resolution just over 720p but the camera
is about as wide as a GoPro and its
location is really the crux of the
experience sound is actually pretty good
though and anyone wearing them will have
to be a little bit aware of that and of
what they're doing viewing the videos on
the snapchat app is actually really fun
but it takes a while to get going if
you're extracting a ton of snaps from
the spectacles basically go to the
memories area and find the specs area
all recorded footage is grouped by day
and they are not posted anywhere until
you tell the app to because the specs
record circular video to accommodate its
wide angle the app can rotate to
encompass certain portions of the frame
think of it this way a rectangle in a
circle the rectangle is your effective
field of view which you can then use to
reveal the possibilities that are found
within the circle it's really quite
slick actually extracting the videos is
a different story I mentioned in my
first impressions video that I wished
full video could be taken from the app
what I meant was sixteen by nine video
as played back in the snapchat app
because the videos when you extract them
raw or well like this 800 by 800
resolution in a square which is
distracting when the rest of a vlog
video for example is in widescreen the
main remedy for this has been to zoom
and scale into the circle which makes
the low resolution much more obvious but
for this first iteration of the snapchat
spectacles quality isn't necessarily the
point
what matters is perspective what you see
and what your friends and followers will
see if you let them we've learned in
this age of vlogging and sharing that
sharing one's own experiences is in
demand
and what Snap Inc has done is provide a
low barrier of entry into a unique way
of doing just that and it's still a
little too easy to get addicted to just
press the button and continue your
experience without worry because the
wide-angle lens will capture it plenty
of people that I've allowed to wear the
spectacles have gone nuts and really hit
that shutter for a lot of snaps users
can also cater their stories and
messages to context accordingly
cultivating the storyteller in each
person and you know what that's why I
enjoy somewhat begrudgingly wearing them
because there are no other products yet
that do quite the same thing I don't
actually praise the spectacles
themselves they're a gaudy looking low
resolution recording attention-seeking
means to an end for a videographer and
storyteller like myself but to the
storyteller in me the snapchat
spectacles are the first kind of
well-executed attempt at giving people
the ability to share a unique
perspective literally their own if
there's one thing that the spectacles
make clear to me it's that I'm excited
to see more products like this in the
future so fast-forwarding a little bit a
lot of what you just saw in this review
was actually filmed and done before the
turn of the new year and what you're
seeing right now is the little bit of
footage that we were able to get at CES
2017
however in using the two pairs of
spectacles that we had at the Consumer
Electronics Show we did find the couple
of problems to rear their ugly head once
again mainly the fact that extracting
the footage from the snapchat spectacles
on to snapchat was a bit of a chore and
even then once we got the footage into
the snapchat app getting them back down
from the app and into an actual video
editor proved to be more of a chore than
we were really willing to do in the
fast-paced environment of CES however
that also poses yet another question
that we want to ask all of you while the
snapchat spectacles fad was going really
strong at the turn of the new year and
everybody wanted a pair even at CES many
of the hotels had snap BOTS that
appeared each day of the conference we
wonder if the fad has already passed or
if the snapchat spectacles will continue
to be a must-have item in 2017 we want
to know what you think about these
glasses and how you feel about snapchats
move into the wearable space so let us
know in the comments below as you can
stay tuned to android authority for even
more
the snapchat spectacles and even more
beyond the world of Android at our other
properties that include VR source tab
times sound guys and charged I oh and
then once you're done with all of that
head on over to Android Authority calm
for even more because we are your source
for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
