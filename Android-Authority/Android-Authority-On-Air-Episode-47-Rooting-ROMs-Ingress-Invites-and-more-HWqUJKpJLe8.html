original android hangout show on google+
I'm dare cross and I am Scott Anderson
this week we're joined with Christopher
walk AKA wookie a fellow team member
from android authority and we're also
joined with returning guest Johnathan
Franklin welcome guys what's up man
how's it going not wiki I'm sorry I'm
gonna call you wookie the whole shell
that's absolutely fine that's where else
knows ah it's good to have you here man
wookie a wookie is now a close personal
friend of mine we we met we bonded at
CES we were roommates we we drank beer
together we we walked around in we
walked around and filmed all sorts of
cool android stuff together um he's the
guy that tried to make my bad interview
skills look good so I still think they
were good interview skills you know what
is YouTube comments are harsh I know I'm
not an interviewer in person I know how
to do this and hangouts an interview but
when I'm put on the spot saying hey
what's this device and tell me all about
it and I don't know about it you know I
I had a hard time my stuff to do I don't
think I don't think a lot of people
would have done any better in that
situation to be fair you tube can be
harsh on some of the most impressive
videos you've ever seen in your life oh
come on YouTube comments yeah they're
always 0 very insightful click read it
yeah I mean half the battle was the fact
that you have to deal with all those
media people too and some of them knew
what they're talking about some of them
didn't oh yeah so all right let's get
started so what do we have on a plate
this week here um well we have a little
bit of Android ecosystem news as always
Larry Page said some funny stuff oh yeah
we'll talk about that a little bit we
have all sorts of app updates as usual
you know the usual google updated
handful apps and a handful of other
useful apps that will talk about
were released this week and updated this
week as well a little bit of carrier
news and then we're going to spend the
bulk of the show talking about routing
and ramen we had one of our viewers this
past week asked us you know what are
some benefits of rooting and we've moved
gone over this in the show before but he
wanted to know more about you so once
you root and you put on a custom rom
let's say is that is that the only
reason that is that the only reason that
you root it or you know so what are some
of the must have root apps or why do
these apps and require root and some
apps don't you know what is the benefit
of using a root app so what will be s
about that and try to answer any
questions any you guys have as well as
answer his questions so what you can do
is you can go ahead and queue up some
questions on our comments on this post
or I'm going to announce it every week i
say i'm going to now let's forget you
can join in on the IRC channel that
we've had for eons and we've never used
so we're gonna we're going to start
trying to use that just because why the
hell not so I put the web chat link in
the comments it's also it's just
freenode kirk IRC and channel android
authority we have a handful of people
already there and ready so I'll all
right so let's get started Scott's
ensure the the app guy you want to talk
about some some apps that were updated
this week and then we'll hit Larry Page
here in a minute right yeah i'll start
off with chrome beta for android
basically has gotten three updates in
the past week so it was launched on the
10th then got another update and today
it just got another update it is
improving speed and less bugs that's
basically what I get out of it I mean it
is increasingly becoming quicker and
more usable than the stable built in my
opinion which typically you know with
the desktop dev channel is typically
faster a little more bugs I don't see
many bugs in the in the beta but they're
getting rid of them so that's awesome he
has he starting to use a chrome beta and
all yeah I've been using it since uh
since it did dropped and I've gotten the
two or three updates however many has
had so far and
you know idiot keeps getting better and
better personally I haven't seen any
issues but some people they have it it
works great i love it it's faster it's
noticeably faster you know it then the
current version of of android I've
actually replaced it as my and I said
Android current version of chrome mom
I've actually replaced it as my main
browser I actually uninstalled the
standard chrome today and said you know
what I'm done it works good enough for
me so I only have chrome beta on my
phone right now and on my Nexus ever
came here I do that I'll install today
they'll stay alive in the mango I'm
sorry do it I've got to admit on lame
I've been using the standard version but
after hearing you guys talk about it i
think i might switch over to the beta
and see what's up there yeah i mean it
will you know we're used to running
things in beta you know that's just uh
it's stable enough for for government
work you know yeah that's that's why i
feel kind of silly about it but uh I
just it's it's worked well enough I
haven't noticed anything I don't like
but uh on the other hand on use to
running cutting-edge rom so I probably
should switch over to something a bit
more on the edge just because what I'm
used to yeah exactly you know you know
and we'll talk about those cutting-edge
rom things in a little bit yeah so I
google currents got an update as well
bug fixes as usual reduced data usage
and also edit an unsubscribe to the over
overflow menu which is nice and you can
really do that easily before so what
those are you than a rock and ingress
we're going to actually give away some
some anchors invites here in a little
bit Dominic to we have to to give away
so you know and we're going am I going
to give up the codes and butcher it or
are we gonna have somebody else came up
the codes yeah I think we learned a
couple months ago you're not allowed to
give anything away nope so I still think
of something I think you do one of two
things I haven't decided yet it's either
going to go to the first person person
that answers a question correctly or
just going to have an all-out war and
I'm going
paste him in the comments the first
person that gets it gets it wars are fun
questions are cool too i haven't decided
what I'm going to do but so anyways so
ingress was updated this week bug fixes
yada yada but some neat things that
improve memory usage in it the app
actually runs a lot better on some
various devices such as devices with
Adreno GPUs so it's going to run better
gonna run a little faster better
graphics and XMP explosion animation is
actually kind of cool now but it they
nerfed bursters uh they don't do as much
damage anymore so that kind of stinks if
you're you know you're trying to take
over something the damn enlightened you
know I gotta gotta resist got gonna take
over your your fields anyways up derek
is obsessed you know hyper but you know
when I've got a busy week I would
actually play ingress in a week Scott so
uh oh you're gonna hear me last week
when I was out at CES I when I first got
there I met when I first got there but a
few hours after I go out there I pulled
out my phone I was looking for portals
and I'd send a message was like don't
worry uh you know Las Vegas you know I'm
here to save the day or something like
that you know i mean and i didn't i
didn't even get at I was too busy
geeking out and party and actually
playing Grissom they all think I don't
think it plays like CES you wouldn't
even have a chance of having an impact I
know I know how many people there were
probably doing the same thing right good
many I'm sure there's me a lot of people
here was just reaping havoc yeah so
airdroid popular remote control Android
app I I don't actually use it but it was
updated this weekend are you guys
actually using a AirDroid we'll talk
about it yeah android i used the
original non beta version basically what
it is it's a application that you if
you're on the same Wi-Fi network you can
go to your browser go to a predetermined
website and login with your phone and
basically it mirrors everything so you
can access your messages your contacts
your photos your videos
to them to your PC very easily and
basically what this version came out
with was you can see your camera kind of
a remote control camera so you can hook
up your phone to it and in your browser
you can see like a video camera from
your camera which is kind of cool if
you're like doing surveillance or
something kind of cool a lot of cool
features added and I don't use it all
the time but it is nice for file
transferring on large files and certain
things oh yeah it's pretty cool so what
all the weather apps we have updated
this week Scott since you're here app
guy I'm going to give this one to two
Franklin press to google reader
application get update it's pretty
significant this is an app that launched
in december um they basically answer the
majority of the quest all the requests
that all the users head off the initial
version you get quick autumn article
navigation to go to next and previous
articles you can set background on
automatic syncing based on time interval
and you can limit it done either Wi-Fi
only or sell better you can sync on app
launch now you get sinking notifications
text alignment options and just a lot of
other various low performance and
abscess and bug fixes are typical with
an update but it's it's turning into a
really nice full feature now I used to
find it looks it's beautiful out I used
to use google reader until um I got my
nexus 7 master users on the web but in
terms of an Android app I don't use it
anymore once i got my nexus 7 i tried to
move over to Curren and I like currents
now i use currents every day I kinda had
to force myself to like it and now I
actually do but I miss sometimes the
simplicity of reader so I might have to
check out press I've heard about it but
some people were saying they wanted some
extra features and now it sounds like
and the developer team is pretty active
and there they've been very responsive
and very you know they've approached it
with a good attitude so you know it's me
up a doubt but I'd say it's totally
worth it no how much how much is in the
Play Store um I think it's two dollars
dollar my lady then okay that's not too
bad that's not bad especially not for
not for what you're getting out of it I
socrate out yeah just going to ask you
guys as somebody who does use google
reader would you recommend checking out
press because I'm willing to spend the
two bucks on it seems interesting I'm
not a fan occurrence I kind of prefer
the more I would say if you're the type
of user to burn through a lot of RSS
feeds press probably isn't the one
you're going to you know if you want
really compress list of taking a lot of
content at the same time I wouldn't say
presses your app I'd say goes more like
greader or you know dear read or some of
the newer ones like they're just minimal
readers good to press is good if you're
following fairly condensed not extremely
overloaded you know with a ton of
articles to have to go through it's it's
a great ass yeah I probably read about
300 articles a day so I want to say
press would be your favorite reader if
those if you're burning through that
much news it's not the quickest way to
do anymore yeah well let's get that's
good to know all right so apparently a
very popular banking app was launched on
Android and John you were talking a
little bit about this pre show it's
called simple and they what they work
with with banks to bring online
Mangareva um I forget the exact way that
they split it split the interest with
the partner banks to in order to
actually make their money the
applications built iOS for about eight
months and they just now came out with
an android version it's working
that the service itself is still invite
only you're gonna have to put your name
on the list or be a customer already but
the Android app is this is not a port
it's written from scratch specifically
for Android you say it's a beautiful
application is it a hollow app very much
so oh you know I mean not 150 know they
get there did their own customizations
but not ugly or gaudy ways so do we out
do we have you know Android share but I
guess you if I don't have a share button
in a bank it has everything you expect
on holo just aghast of the bad we had
the menu off the top right corner we
don't have those more customer not just
straight up like all the light or
whatever yeah that's fine that's fine
all right you know a lot of apps I was
talk I always talk about turntable you
know and uh in Flipboard whenever it was
in beta when those two apps came over
from iOS they were just straight up you
know iOS ports you know they looked
exactly like in iOS they didn't look
like that you were on Android and since
then they've completely redone those
apps and now they look a lot more
Android II enjoyed esque you're not
going to get any feel of iOS to this
application that just has like it's all
little gradients all right there so who
doesn't like cloud storage I live in the
cloud I store all my docs all my music
and with google music you know
everything in the cloud mediafire a
popular file sharing file hosting i
guess and then sharing application uh
released their android app and it's not
bad it's not horrible for their first
dog first run actually i think they had
an update already but it's not bad for
their initial release you know it has
everything that you would normally want
in an appt minus I'd say two key
features one it's not a hollow app ah
and two if you want to sink a whole
bunch of files you can't multi select
you have to manually select so that's
kind of stinks but it's a nice app and
the coolest thing about its 50 gig so
that's a lot of space you know I mean if
you need space 50 gigs impede
it's free yeah and they do have paid
plans if you want more and so forth 50
gigs got box to get a lot of users that
otherwise would have been on dropbox
yeah also a kind of a lesser service but
minus it's a good service that I use as
well i got fifty gigs online as well oh
yeah everybody gives you this you know
the free fifteen yeah you know you got
mine is she got sugarsync you know yeah
there's everything has so much personal
personal cloud storage available now we
just need to get some really nice apps
that throw everything together into one
like massive drive so you can you know
you don't have to say you know we're
more like sharing that file then I'm
Dropbox or is that on- you know it just
puts everything together in onedrive and
have a napper i know i know there's apps
available but they're not I'd like to
have a remote control out so the server
would download it you are held at I
point to it instead of having a door
load up my computer and then upload to
it just shoot it directly over yeah
that'd be nice alright so so let's uh
let's take a break from talking about
boring apps here and go back to talk
about the Android ecosystem here and uh
so Larry Page recently was interviewed
and during the interview you know they
said so how how do you think apples
thermal nuclear war is going on Android
and yeah he basically said whoa so how
does it look like it's going we tell me
you know when seventy percent some
insert massive insanely high number here
of the mobile market is running on
Android how do you think they're their
nuclear war is going you know I mean it
was it was pretty aggressive on the
whole and well I'm not really aggressive
but uh very confident in that entire
view now i like i like seeing that out
of oh yeah yeah it directly said that
facebook is doing a bad job on their
products and for the reason he's right
yeah basically what he did for for me is
kind of just getting me excited about
you know what's coming next and you know
how they come bad other thing he did
mention that a lot of other platforms
were copying or using the same features
that are used in Google Plus which was
very interesting and very true but it's
good to be noted that he or them as a
company are bringing up the other
platforms and giving users you know more
competition and more features which all
in all great for users no matter what
platform you're on so you know this week
it must be a slow week when I haven't a
whole lot of interaction in the comments
so I think we need to do something to to
give away in engrish code and get those
comments flowing so so let's uh let's
let's think of a question here let's
think of a question surrounding ingress
since it is an ingress code giveaway I'd
Scott why I get a question here won't
you talk about Oh a little bit about
carbon not not the routan and ramen
carbon or not the backup carbon the
other carbon orgy on Johnny yeah so the
on you know rumored continually rumored
Twitter application and this is an
application existed on web OS and
windows for short windows phone for a
short time and he randomly you know
posted on his twitter said we're back
we're listening in this application has
been promised for over a year and it's
been over six months since the first
release window came and went so you know
take it with a grain of salt and he said
you know he says it's coming he said
it's coming before just keep your eyes
open I obviously think with a it seems
like Falcon pro for most of the people
that are heavily using Twitter seems to
be
extremely popular every user that uses
it seems extremely happy with it it's
going to be hard to present anything
that's you know the this of all the good
Twitter apps Falcon pro just doesn't
really seem to do a whole lot wrong into
users eyes so and Falcon colony of the
12 it didn't take really that long from
it to go from the ADA that you know it
started off as a widget and nobody
really cared about it when I was a
widget and then it had its beta app and
then all of a sudden it's one of the
biggest Twitter apps on Android in this
the same have been not even two months
yes the same developer that did a
minimal reader the exact same way it
started off as a widget and people liked
it so much that they just decided to
take it to a full bowl and app it's a
great app by both of great apps yeah
it's the only Twitter client I I use now
I spent a long time going through a lot
of them and actually I don't use twitter
that much but still when i do i use a
falcon bro its top not really so Derek
you want to elaborate on pushes version
of course so so there's another carbon
available up maybe a week ago two weeks
ago on the show we talked about kousha
you know from clockworkmod was coming up
with a way to sync android app data and
then and backup data to your to the
cloud to cloud storage locations as well
as well you can download locally on your
your computer on your local network so
he came he really
you
big then it comes and kind of like oh
wait that's that's it yeah so it's a fun
yeah they're coming out with another
iteration I believe in a 24 of January
so we are back now we have a technical
difficulty we're back yeah so well let's
let's make sure that we are actually
viewable again and technical difficulty
is over hey all right we're back so okay
so we'll give you a few seconds here
then we're gonna give away in ingress
makers code I decided that because I had
the technical difficulty people might
not be synced up right now so I don't
want to say a question in and the hang
out here on the show because someone
might not be watching it but people are
watching comments you know look at the
notification so what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to create all sorts of
havoc here so what you want to do is you
want to open your ingress app right
about now and you want to go to the
original android authority post sharing
this on google+ not a reshare not on
youtube and you want to find that post
it says I android authority on air
episode 47 coming up on one year and you
want to look for the code that is now in
chat and good luck that's gets code
number one the end of the scale will
think something more exciting I promise
all right so let's let's move on to some
meat here let's talk about some carrier
news is that me all right so carriers
are continuing to LTE all the things we
know this you know that that's that's
pretty much what they're in the that's
what they're doing right now and sprint
announced that 28 new LTE markets are
going to be going live in the next few
months seeing as they are one of the
smaller LTE deployments that's cool and
the smallest LTE deployment here in the
US t-mobile you know because they don't
have any but
they may announced that sort of bad when
you're behind metropcs yeah but their
hspa+ network extremely fast you know so
they don't really need LTE but but but
they're not a student that they really
do not need LTE well maybe for better
ping times and faster uploads that's
really about it lte-advanced basically
so their roadmap is there for their LTE
rollout it's kind of similar to their
hspa+ rollout they're gonna hit large
metropolitan areas first and the first
places they're looking at our Las Vegas
in Kansas City and that should be coming
in a few days and the rollout is kind of
mirrored to their hspa+ and what they
did with that yeah so they're going to
be blanketing the markets that they
currently have fast hspa+ all right so
let's get to the to the routan in ramen
section the show like I said earlier if
you didn't catch it we had a user
contact us this past week you wanted to
know you know what are some of the tools
some of the reasons for for routing and
once you root then what you know what
apps can you use what are some of the
available apps what are some of the apps
that we use is people that you have
rooted devices do root devices there is
a go to root app or do we just route
just to run custom rom and maybe or just
to remove carrier in OEM crap and and
that's it you know what what do we do
once we root so we've talked about
similar stuff like this on the show um
you know why or why not and that's
really up to you so what I want you do
let us know in the comments why you root
and what apps you use and then we'll
we'll compare that to our list here in a
minute so if you're watching let us know
why you root you know what reason not
just to you know cuz I can it has to be
an underlying reason and then let us
know what what apps you use but what are
your favorite root apps apps that
require root access so as we asked our
viewers that in the comments let's let's
ask those guys Johnathan Franklin that
and uh so John
let's say you say you have a TV
installed you have fastboot installer or
you have the unlocker toolkit or you
know insert application name here to
root your phone whatever it may be I
know your your note 2 was a little
harder than the most as well as of the
HTC your DNA exploit required for the
variety yeah yeah so some phones are
easier the root another some tablets are
easier to route than others if it's a
Nexus device you look at it and it
routes itself almost um the majority of
Samsung devices are pretty easy yeah
with with Odin I guess oh yeah so that
some devices are you know will say scale
one to ten one being the hardest 10
being easiest somewhere you know I guess
that's kind of backwards man in there so
so morally like like a one to ten scale
10 being the easiest there are 10 and
those are your Nexus devices then you
have you know Sony devices with unlocked
bootloaders and Samsung devices what
locked bootloaders they may take a few
extra steps will say that maybe like a
seven or an eight then you have you know
some mid-range devices on carriers that
they don't want you to unlock the
bootloader but there's an easy exploit
for it you know maybe that's like a you
know four or five and then you have
things that are locked down tighter than
anything you've ever seen before they're
eventually going to get unlocked but you
have they're not for the the the
everyday average day you know user you
know you it's something that if you do a
step wrong you could brick your phone
and those are the ones that you might
want to stay away from if you're not
experienced you know if it's a five or
lower will say there's a general there's
a very that you can't you know you can't
hurt your device in that case I mean
it's so easy and especially if the Nexus
device you can't break those I mean
there's you really can't you have to try
your damnedest you have to really true
say huh owner brick this thing today
like you know and you maybe you try to
install in it t you want or something I
don't know what you do it but but it a
Nexus device is really hard to brick but
anyway so like you know the HTC DNA is
pretty hard to root compared to other
device
is the the DNA I just said that the what
do you have John the note 2 yeah you
know on verizon you know that that's a
little harder than normal so anyways so
you spend all those laws tend to be very
careful yes a zit on xmas phone droid
droid droid x was easy ran z4root a
peacock when it got the gingerbread oh I
got the gingerbread oh yeah when I got
the gingerbread update you had to use
Pete's something was horrible know what
I remember here so many people that
break that phone I know you know you
could always SPF that thing back to stop
that thing I was almost unbreakable all
right so anyways right so unworkable for
referred some people anyways so John you
spend all this time your risk ruining
advice what's the first thing you do
when ever you whenever you read it what
did you do um usually the first thing
I'd do if I'm on it depends on what oh
it way depends on the phone it depends
on cuz uh back when I had my Nexus I
just I just unlocked the bootloader and
rooted it stock and there really wasn't
a lot that I want to do to it at first I
just wanted to have I did install a
custom recovery and pretty much left it
like that with the note 2 usually and it
also apply adela other you know other
carrier falls i had titanium backup
she's the first thing i do to freeze
applications and there's not a it
depends on the phone as to what
applications i really want whether i
wanna Colonel do i want to flash a
custom kernel I've been pretty happy
with the stock kernel on the note 2
because the battery life on it's just
you know really really good all right
well was worth two apps let's just kind
of go through the apps yeah there's
plenty apps you know them yeah I mean
there's a GM d gesture control so what
is it what does that do ah basically it
allows you to create your own custom
gestures whether it be one finger to
finger three finger for finger
or if you want to do like a two finger
tap one finger tab basically touch
interface customize it to the nth degree
and its really really nice there's a
lite version so you can try it out if
you want the only thing about the lite
version is the fact that it has a non
killable status bar notification so if
you want to buy it that goes away but
it's really nice you can do a lot of
different things but it's fun to play
around with two gu manager there's
another app that i install download
manager has multiple functions for those
of you that don't know it's a good
manager raw manager you know that they
install custom recoveries such as twerp
and clockworkmod depending on which app
you're using and they also provide rom
updates for supported roms and that they
let you in install Iran through
automated automated steps so if you're
not I think everybody that you know is
it should be familiar with it in the
beginning and then you can get lazy and
use automation but it I think it's nice
to to do it manually in the beginning so
you're learning as you go in case you
ever encounter a problem you're not
relying on something so anyways it Scott
was saying ague manager and then rom
manager they they allow you to you know
install your apps you can you can pick
your I'm sorry you're wrong though
install it for you basically you know
you can automate it is now another
benefit to rooting and ramen is uh
kernels he can flash your own kernel you
can check out kernels on forums and
flash away don't those either don't know
what kernels are because a lot of people
don't uh Colonel is think of it as the
piece of the software the piece of the
rom the piece of Android that's actually
the Linux piece that communicates with
the hardware it's a it sits between the
hardware and in Android and it infinite
basically so why would you want to
install a custom kernel
the main thing is battery life and
performance what people will do is go
undervolt something those steel juice
basically from something whether that be
you know the you know Wi-Fi Bluetooth
you know audio you know what are the
actual processor itself now though
humble undervolt something hardware to
use less battery power under voting not
giving it as much juice means if you
have a longer lasting battery and a lot
of times it's like it's a gamble you
know because not every phone can be
under voted the same way no obviously
they're all stamped out in the same
factory but you might be a you might be
over under vote your DNA Wookiee more
than I can undergo Mont and vice versa
that's just how it is so you got it
under voting really requires you know a
lot of playing around but you can get a
lot of battery life out of it you can
and as well as overclocking to increase
you know graphic performance increase
which increase overall phone performance
as well so some people will have a
kernel that's overclocked and under fold
that people will say oh SI and UV like
in the in and the colonel notes and you
can also have additional you know
functions at it as well you can change
like the read/write speeds priority for
certain things yeah you can also run
like more power if you are on a poor
Wi-Fi connection it'll get push more
power to the Wi-Fi and allow a better
connection also fast USB charge that's
it ya think of it I mean just extra
tweaks um yeah so but you don't you
don't have to run a custom kernel or you
can all the custom kernel and then not
touch any of that stuff you just use the
written you know the recommended
settings will say yeah some popular
cuddles franco.kernel lean Colonel Tim
it which you know you know what about
kernels where in the hell is Dan
Charlton he is our Colonel dev and uh oh
yeah he he would be mrs. the one hang
out that he could really elaborate on
yeah here we go damn it i go 467 HTC
devices you know and
and the next is for all right so what
other root apps are out there Scott
Wi-Fi tether for root users I use that
one personally it allows you to let's
say you're going to start your Wi-Fi
tether limited by amount of time so how
long it's been running you can turn it
off after a predestinated amount of time
or you can turn it off after a
pre-designated amount of data so let's
say you're opening a Wi-Fi tether let's
say you gotta a limit on your data plan
or you only want to give out so much
data you can allow it to give out to the
public and limit it by how much data you
want to give it's kind of cool also you
can just you know state your passwords
and stuff like that pretty cool stuff
widgets everything um titanium backup I
would say that's probably one of the
number one reasons that people route now
there are alternatives to that such as
simple a DB backup which I shared a post
about that earlier than carbon kousha
zap that we were talking about soon will
allow backups without root so it's
becoming us not as so much as a priority
is you know I would say you know back in
the day you know you somebody would say
yeah i rooted my XYZ device so i could
use titanium backup to backup my game
data or my acne you know insert app here
might this app data and so titanium
backup was a very popular reason for
people to root it's becoming less top of
a paid apps list yeah yeah it's becoming
less uh-oh as soon i would say it'll
become you know less of a requirement
almost this is something that Google
show done long ago is create some kind
of desktop software well you know I hate
to say it but this is one thing where
iOS actually has android beat this iOS
you know with IPA yeah you have to
install itunes but you know what I don't
have a android software named to install
that I can sync all my stuff too so I OS
does have us beat there and then that's
nice have I ever used it no I'd have
never used an iOS device but I know it's
available so I
that you know it maybe we'll see that
someday who knows um another appt at
away uh basically if he got root
privileges you can write host files to
reject that IP or that host and so what
that does is it a little technical but
you know nerd info here so what it does
is in your hosts file it writes let's
say a website a company a domain that is
known to serve advertisements it changes
the IP address in locally to be resolved
to a local address so if the IP
addresses for example you know one but
two three four if that's the I IP
address of big at company com so in your
hosts file you'll put big ad company com
and have it resolved to localhost a lot
of time and local host is you know is
127 dot 0 dot 0 dot one so it just makes
the these being resolved locally and
obviously you're not running an ad
server on your phone and they don't work
the same practice has been used for
years and years on desktop computers you
know when you install i don't know like
Spybot Search and Destroy user area I
used to do that years ago so I know if
you guys are familiar with that SMD the
another probably another application
this is available on non rooted devices
but gains functionality when rooted or
applications like Tasker a locale
because after gingerbread came up you
had to have root access to be able to
control the GPS module and do other
things so it really kind of expands your
ability to take full control over your
device and create certain actions and
certain circumstances that will create a
trigger to pretty much automate your
entire device and route really is a
requirement to get one hundred percent
functionality out of an application like
that another one is Wi-Fi kill this
one's a
kind of a gray area well yeah so the
next couple apps I want to talk about
our this Scott said gray area apps you
can use them for for evil or you can use
them for for good I'm all that can be
used for good I know exactly how they
can be used for good so let's say a
Wi-Fi kill how can that be used for you
life I kill let's say I'm I'm I'm I'm a
day I am a dad let's say I'm an older
dad that hasn't us a son that's a
teenager and he's all why we were going
with this and I don't want him to be
using Wi-Fi anymore cuz he's grounded he
was he's being bad so I'm going to be
and I'm going to be a tech mean dad and
I'm gonna open up Wi-Fi kill and i'm
gonna nothing to use it to drop his
network connection on his device so it
does have a good use it does I mean is
there any other good uses you know who
knows or you could use it to wreak havoc
too i'm not suggesting you do but you
know that workplaces those are you know
that obviously you know you don't have
to to do bad things so that it can be
used for good as well maybe you have a
connection a dead connection on your
home network and you don't know what it
is you know it you know you want to kill
it to make sure you know you don't have
a neighbor or something using your
network which you should lock those down
anyway so that should never happen um
droid a sheep yeah and face sniff those
those applications are rude only
applications and to be honest with you
I'm having a tough time thinking of why
those apps can be used for good right
now um penetration tests I guess they
can be used to as a proof of concept in
your for your company's website that ah
that they're not using proper ssl
encryption there you go there there's
the so what do they do man I didn't use
those apps and like two years oh it does
is on the unknown your Wi-Fi network if
it's not as SSL encrypted let's say
somebody logs into facebook you mean in
the middle attacks is what they do this
is mostly gonna happen if you're in a
place like starbucks or something that
will open at work it's the only place of
our choosing network
as well I'm trying to think of the
actual term for that I mean how I
actually wrote an article a year ago on
Google+ talking all about them and how
they worked what they did I don't
remember the actual I mean yeah what
they actually do how they actually work
that's pretty bad alright so so there
you go in the comments let me know what
they're actually doing for how they're
actually hijacking the ssl session I
don't remember exactly what they're not
doing router spoofing there or maybe
they are there's they're spoofing mac
address spoofing or that's a tarp
records they're doing ARP ARP spoofing
okay there we go sorry I can't give away
the ingress code for that I will pick us
up okay um which if you block router
broadcasting all you networking mins out
there if you block router broadcasting
and router acknowledgement requests
these applications actually won't work
on your network so just a little hint
you can turn this off that's my that's
my day job coming out there um now
there's another app that it has a gray
area to this really app that that I like
I've actually used before it's a
penetration testing app by a company
called simpie reham out of Israel the
the application is called anti anti I at
stand it used to stand for I think they
changed their name they'll used to stand
for the Android network toolkit and it's
awesome it me yeah it can be used for
bad but it's not intended to do that
they actually debuted mmm maybe two
years ago at Def Con and you know
actually I worked on the beta on that
the private beta and a whole bunch of us
from me you I the US worked on it and we
all got private beta access and was it
was testing and I was being developed
and it was a lot of fun um but the
applications are used for penetration
testing or or for bad but the is
depending only on how you use it but
they do man-in-the-middle attacks they
do they'll scan your whole network and
show you on your whole network where a
vulnerability is so for unit unit
network mins or even home computers you
have a bunch of computers you want to
test out to see which windows machines
aren't patched it scans for known you
know
vulnerabilities and so forth and it'll
pop up on little icon showing you hey
machine 1 2 3 is vulnerable and then you
can see which attacks it's susceptible
to and then you can go patch it or not
location like that i know linux
discharge you do but uh you have to have
a custom kernel passed up for injecting
for being able to eject packets into it
no it uses a man I'm having a brain fart
tonight what is that network application
that I used to use all the time for for
doing since cans um oh man okay I'll
thank you there you go there's your
ingress I think except fight okay I'm
not going to think of this with what
ingress invite it's a network tool what
am I thinking of you you could God you
can go their website and download the
application ever for windows to but um
in Linux the application said most
people actually use this in Linux and an
anti actually had it embedded in their
application it and that's how they were
able to do the the scans what is that
call okay so there you go what is that
what am I talking about what am i
babbling in here I think I know you're
talking about but I don't want to say it
now because it's part of it i will keep
typing in chat see if i'm right or see
if you're right what is that called nmap
matt flynn inflaming got it and then go
yep and what wire sharks are good on too
i use wireshark now I don't use n map
anymore but uh you know nmap you're a
hundred percent right all right so i
will message you Matt you're I can't
believe couldn't think of that and that
yeah I will uh yes so anti installs uh
or your users and map scanning to uh
well this used to get happy of seeing a
WP encrypted network and just going
going at it with air crack no we're not
oh man tonight's a brain fart she'll
tell you that right now it's all that
partying wiki that we did their week and
a half ago you know it's probably it's
still taking a toll on me so all right
Matt I will get you your code here
messaging T now where we might have it
down the second
what was already made on the 24-minute
and his was posted 38 seconds but in IRC
we have somebody posted 24 but we don't
know the seconds I we're not watching
IRC for that pirate ghost did say in
that be aware we're watching the
carpenter coast sorry Paris fire see
only had a second counter sorry dude you
can probably find with a time stamp but
for all good reasons rope for ad yeah
now we're with sorry we said in the
beginning the show we were only doing it
for the the comments on the Hangout so
we could you know watch all watch that
oh no that's mad flash oh he's on IRC as
well oh ok well there you go mad i just
also just sent you the code there happy
ingre singh if that's a word alright so
so less brain farts so back to you know
all this stuff i used to do and i just
don't do anymore alright so per app DPI
of it mods you know custom roms and so
forth john will talk a little bit about
you know what / at BP is what does that
mean dual all the custom rom that really
started doing this was called paranoid
android and this is something that
really became doable after android for
because android for urging the phone and
tablet code and it does really similar
to a web page where you have a custom
layout based upon the DPI of a device
you know income you know it's all kind
of controlled by the manifests of the
application itself in a communications
the build.prop and other properties so
anyway perhaps is basically a framework
that doesn't break applications that
allows you to trick an application into
thinking that your phone may be a 7-inch
tablet or the layout of a 10x example
and some of the modules and roms
themselves give you pretty
significant control over just how much
you can get the layout set up as well as
the size of the text in my case i have a
galaxy note 2 and a lot of applications
such as Gmail if you give it a layouts
very similar to what like a nexus 7
would have you really get a lot more
content and really don't have to you
know be in certain parts of the
application about yes you can break the
application under fragments and have
your inbox on all those listed and the
actual mail record silence down to go in
a portion of it happen back out and then
go to another one so there are a lot of
again applications that really benefit
from a tablet layout if you have a phone
with a screen real estate to take
advantage of it and it can be a pretty
cool thing to play around with and
that's all programmable with the DPI per
app in the rom settings uh yeah well
paranoid Android's is a proprietary APK
but there's a really the most polished
okay ethic and you control it the
application is very very simple you can
actually go into interface and send it
across system-wide to say a phablet you
I tablet UI that you know gives the
whole system properties like the whole
user interface on your launcher your
applications or you can go in and edit
apps individually which is what I would
recommend because honestly tablet layout
on our phones really sucks as far as the
small assets and but from there just
have fun with it because there are a lot
of apps can benefit from it I needed to
stop turn on Android I haven't tested
that out yet I haven't ran in a while I
can't you know what wookie whenever that
is the wrong I'm going to run on our
phone whenever we get AOSP support or
AOSP a is they're calling it um i
paranoid android looks awesome the new
version i haven't written in a while but
i'm going to put it on my nexus 7
probably this weekend just to play with
that pie they're extinct expanded
desktop and the pie radio
menu it looks pretty awesome I'm excited
to try that out and then hey maybe next
week I'll give a you know what Scott's
and sheer rock in the nexus 4 o YN x 7
tube why don't you put it on your Nexus
4 and I'll put it on my Nexus 7 maybe
we'll do a little mini review on air
next week about it it sounds good yeah
so while speaking of devices let's stop
talking about routing and rami apps here
um we had a question from one of our one
of our longtime viewers I like saying
that he wanted to know what we thought
about Sony saying they only want to
they're only going to make high-end
phones now they're only going to focus
on the high end of the market um so
let's just we haven't heard from walking
a while so wiki Sony said you know we're
only gonna be baller we're gonna we're
only gonna work on ballerstatus phone so
what do you think of that um I think
it's a good thing really uh that said
because you know I've seen some of the
lower end Sony phones a couple years
back and they're really nothing to write
home about and on the other hand I think
we could really use a company that's
just focused on providing really
high-end hardware and nothing but and
having seen some of that Sony stuff at
CES it seemed like they're pretty well
poised to be doing high-end phones um we
haven't seen them really in the real
world yet but some of the verses and
just some of the hands-on we got to do
it seemed like some pretty impressive
hardware and if that's where they're
starting I'm kind of looking forward to
seeing where they're going to go after
that the Z and ZL look amazing yeah they
do yeah I i would i would understand
that I wasn't there we offer yesterday
actually old one because I would run 1
John I you know there's a information
came out today about I'm going to be
wrong when what country so i'll just say
somewhere in europe and help an LTE
version of the Xperia Z or Z L one of
the two
it showed up somewhere with an LTE radio
so that made me you know twitch four
seconds and wait a second LTE hmm I
wonder uh you know I wonder if we would
see you know a verizon cdma LTE Sony
then I thought no we've never seen one
never my period the Xperia Play was a
disaster yeah I i would i would use that
phone i will get rid of my DNA and i
would i get the xperia z it looks for
exactly i was just about to say that as
a DNA owner I love my DNA but if I had
my chance to get the hands on the z2 if
I had the chance to get my hands on the
Z I would do it in a second it really
looks that good and you know what we we
need somebody out there that's only
focusing on high-end devices and to be
known for the high-end devices because
right now every manufacturer makes I
observed all tears but yeah they making
a low-end crap phones that they come
with a year and a half old operating
system on then they'll never get updated
beyond you know a six month you know
patch then then they have mid-range
phones that come with a year old
operating system that will get updated
you know once in the next year then you
have a high-end device that if you're
lucky you know it'll get to updates and
and and and that's really it and you
know we really Samsung's really about
the Holy manufacturer that can make any
profit doing that because they control
their entire supply chain well yeah I
mean that's say why do you think Samsung
has every size imaginable of tablet and
phone because it's Brandi they can so
Samsung you know they make high-end
devices mid-range devices mid high range
devices low high range I mean that you
know they don't care they're just they
make everything and I think it would be
nice to have a company that you say you
know what yeah you want the best of the
best well right now you people you look
towards uh maybe like the s4 as a
benchmarking
or the book at a nexus phone to be a
benchmark or something like that or the
look at I the latest iPhone to be a
benchmark it would be nice to say here's
androids benchmark you know it's the
it's the selling line the sony doesn't
really have any kind of negative
reputation to have to overcome they're
gonna think Brandon to consumers I think
they're they're in a position to do it
as much as anybody the mic Mike's
jealous of all of our Nexus 7 so I got a
nexus 7 scott has one John actually got
one at the big Android BBQ wookie give a
nexus 7 i'm even own a tablet you don't
want a tablet you know what I I when I
had to my old acer iconia tablet I kind
of had to force myself into using it you
know is one of those things where I was
like you know I paid 30 bucks for this
thing you know I bought it because it
was cheap is my first tablet I kind of
bought a low-end model but you know I
forced myself to use it but now you know
I love my Nexus 7 I use it almost every
day I you know it I love it I don't have
to force myself to use it it's part of
my normal routine now I came here I
think about buying a nexus 7 all the
time the only reason I keep holding off
now is because I think we might see
something better soon oh yeah the nexus
7 7 months or six months old so but the
thing is it's cheap and it's just
something that you can throw around and
it's fast and I mean it's really just
kind of a pick it up and go typed a look
at this way in five months is il and
that movie and then the nexus 7 will be
a year old so we'll see you know I'm
sure we'll have a something exciting to
tell don't want to buy next yeah I
wonder if they'll keep on pushing down
the you know the low spec low-cost what
I wouldn't see why not they they're
selling a million of them a month yeah
I'm curious to see what they come out
with I'll but I'll buy a new version of
nexus 7 to where we here or whatever
we're gonna wear like that latest rumor
that we didn't even talk about because I
don't believe it I on exes 7.7 and
that's that stupid we're not going to
seeing it yet
that that seems dumb I don't know what
and what I do with my current 1i just
give it away to somebody that I mean
it's poor here's a thought what if we do
see an X is 7.7 it just gets rid of that
massive bezel that's on the current
nexus 7 need the bezel you think yeah
it's just so much like you need the
bezel or you need a better way of
eliminating false touches kind of like
what wha that because people hold
tablets differently than you oh yeah and
what Windows is trying to do with their
cancellation or whatever um not really
working amazingly but uh yeah the bevels
nice as much as it looks like a low-end
device with the bevel um you need the
bevel I totally agree because the ipad
mini a barely any bevel yes and this one
reason why the but the note 2 and the
phones and all that oh my god this is so
big is because you're expected to hold
it like a full yeah you're expected to
wrap your hand around it actually use
your finger to you know where the Nexus
7 is up designed to be two-handed device
alright well I think I think about ready
to call it an evening we we've extended
our welcome to say if you guys have any
other questions comments anything he
wants to to hit on real quick let us
know if not without further ado wiki it

in the following weeks you know let us
know how you make it will get you in
here and we have some good talking point
set up for you to hit on and and you're
gonna you're gonna be doing a lot of
reviews for us here to android authority
right you're doing a lot of video
reviews and written reviews right oh
yeah I've got a lot of stuff queued up
already yeah so would be I think it'd be
nice to have you on the show to give a
little teaser about some things you're
planning on reviewing have reviewed you
did a versus on you know
just a I think that'd be good and then
for more information they can hit your
review and read it or watch it you know
and I think I'd be good for be good for
everybody I know I'd liked it it was
aight i agree totally now we just need
to do we have another guy did josh uh
vergara that was on last week he
couldn't make it tonight he plans on
coming on the show more regularly so
we're gonna get some more guys from the
android authority team on here to make
this show even better and so you know
what we're we haven't had any guests on
a new guests on in a while and it's
always good for new blood and you guys
don't want to hear me talk all the time
