a few new exciting products hey it's
Josh regard from Android 30 what's going
on everybody
and here is the HTC One in vivid blue
along with a couple of accessories first
we'll look at the HTC fetch it's a very
simple device and duster isn't a whole
lot to say as it's basically a dongle
you put on your key ring that allows you
to easily locate your keys if you lost
them or your phone if it is misplaced it
pairs with your phone and if you need to
find your keys it will beep when
prompted by your phone the other way
actually works as well now this is a
very interesting peripheral called the
mini plus it's a throwback to what our
phones are going to look like if the
smart phone was never created really it
connects to your phone via bluetooth and
broadcasts a number of functions like
notifications texts and calls you'll be
able to field calls from your phone
using this device and the gentleman that
presented these products told us that it
helps him get better reception for calls
when he positions the HTC One in a good
place and just takes the call on the
mini plus anywhere else a clever way to
use it
it comes with a IR blaster for your TV
as well further making it an HTC One
companion that you can use often on its
own and so here is the HTC One in its
newest color we already have the classic
silver the stealth black which I love
and even saw a red version but here is
the vivid blue as you can see it's not
just a blue hue to the silver it's been
given an almost neon motif and
definitely calls out to you who when you
see it it's incredibly shiny and
definitely unique a color choice that
will make you stand out the accents get
a black lining and when it comes to the
screen you still have a black bezel
around it to accentuate its bright
screen goodness the blue actually
doesn't detract from the display quality
at all and using the screen is still as
easy on the eyes as ever for all of you
out there that love the HTC One this is
still the same aluminum clad phone that
made waves in its new design just now in
this very vivid blue if blue is your
color this is a hell of a way of showing
that as always thanks for watching and
we are live from Aoife in Berlin
bringing you all of the action so stay
tuned to android authority your source
