the company's ever built but does the
HTC One have what it takes to stand up
to competitors like Samsung's Galaxy s4
find out in our review hey everybody I'm
Chris look HTC seems to be using a lot
of new terms and buzzwords to describe
the one blinkfeed Zoe ultrapixels boom
sound that's a lot of fancy words but
are the features actually you know good
well let's find out starting with the
specs the HTC One runs a 1.7 gigahertz
quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 600
processor and has a 4.7 inch 1080p
display with a pixel density of 468
pixels per inch it has 2 gigs of RAM and
32 gigs of internal storage the rear
facing camera is 4 megapixels more on
that later and the front-facing camera
is 2.1 megapixel powering it all is a
2,300 milliamp hour battery for some
time now HTC devices have generally been
known for excellent build quality and
that is certainly the case here the
aluminum body and gorilla glass screen
lend the one a solid feel and the phone
feels rugged in general though time will
tell on that one while it all boils down
to taste the design seems to be a
culmination of what HTC has been working
towards over the course of various
phones combining elements from earlier
one branded phones and the Droid DNA
it's hard to communicate in video form
but the HTC One just has a great feel
aside from the somewhat awkward
placement of the power button I was
initially skeptical about HTC's hyped
boom sound but the HTC One has the best
speakers I've ever heard on a phone and
putting them on the front does make a
difference again it's basically
impossible to tell unless you see the
phone for yourself but it's really
impressive how big this phone can sound
simply put the HTC One S display is
gorgeous and the HD resolution and super
high pixel density are
just the start the colors are incredibly
vivid and black levels have excellent
depth it's difficult to find a bad angle
to view the screen from now that isn't
to say that the screen is notably better
than some screens from the competition
or other HTC devices but it's hard to
imagine a screen looking much better and
the high res and 4.7 inch screen size
leave it looking razor sharp simply from
the specs alone I was expecting great
performance from the HTC One and I
wasn't disappointed
starting with benchmarks I ran and 2 to
3 times and averaged the score ending up
with a very nice final score of 20 4258
next up was Epic Citadel the Snapdragon
600 and Adreno 320 GPU were put to work
here and we ended up with an average
frame rate of 56 point 7 frames per
second in high quality mode and 57.9
frames per second and high performance
mode this is pretty impressive
considering the 1080p resolution moving
into real world use I tried out Real
Racing 3 which consistently performed
very smoothly without a single hiccup as
you might expect standard apps launched
and ran very quickly the HTC One runs
Android 4.1.2 jelly bean and the new HTC
Sense 5 in the past sense has had both
its fans and its foes and though it's
more minimalist in design this time
around sense 5 will probably be even
more divisive mostly due to some of its
new features like blink V if you haven't
heard blink feed is HTC's new
replacement for the standard homescreen
which pulls in news and information from
a variety of sources while tying in to
your various social media accounts if
you wish pick the categories you're
interested in sign into your accounts
and blinkfeed does the rest is this
useful well that depends on you I don't
see myself using blink feed often but
with the popularity of apps like
Flipboard I can
see this feature being very popular with
some people HTC Sense has generally been
toned down a little which should be less
controversial and a few other small
touches like supporting folders right
within the app drawer are incredibly
useful for being such relatively minor
changes a few utilities and tools are
included with little in the way of
bloatware
but that's on a review unit with a unit
that carriers have gotten their hands on
you can probably expect that to change
you might notice I left out another big
sense 5 feature HTC Zoe we'll get to
that but first let's talk about the
camera ultra pixels first let's start
with the bat the initial batch of test
devices the HTC sent out had a problem
that caused subpar results with the ones
much hike new camera I received an
over-the-air update before I began
testing so my results weren't affected
by this problem one of HTC's main points
about its new camera is that these ultra
pixels can take in more light and they
are right about that low-light
performance is among the best I've seen
in a smartphone camera most of the rest
of the time while the camera is good the
results aren't really anything amazing
it can take a good photo don't get me
wrong but it's not mine blowing lis
awesome 1080p video capture is
definitely sharp and clean looking
though it's in the same boat again it's
not mind-blowing HTC has packed in a ton
of features though like HDR and
panoramic sweep for still photos and HDR
video and variable speed capture and
playback then of course we have Zoe Zoe
does a few things but its main feature
is that when you use the camera and Zoe
mode it takes short videos and multiple
photos all at the same time even better
it constantly runs a buffer so that
actually captures a full second before
you hit the shutter button which is
great for capturing moments you might
otherwise have missed after you shot
your photos videos or Zoe's you can take
advantage of a new feature that puts
together
short highlight videos which uses
location and date information to figure
out which clips and images to use I
can't tell you if you're going to be
using this all the time but it was
actually kind of fun to play around with
at the very least
the 2300 milliamp hour battery in the
HTC one could be bigger and we've
definitely seen phones with better
battery life while this isn't the
strongest aspect of the one considering
everything it's powering the battery
life wasn't bad we ran a battery test in
antutu tester got a score of 472 with
capacity down to 18% after just around 6
hours
heavy testing saw charge last just over
5 hours actual use though fared much
better with the phone easily lasting the
full day without needing a charge
long story short the HTC one is the best
device the company's released in a long
time
now you may not love everything about it
blinkfeed in particular is somewhat
polarizing but in general there's little
to hate the build quality and feel are
solid performance is blazing fast and
since five is the best iteration of
sense to date not only does the HTC One
stand a decent chance of turning the
company around but it's our last best
hope for peace
oh wait that was Babylon 5 anyway if you
