over at android authority dot-com today
i'm bringing you a head-to-head
comparison of the Samsung Galaxy s3
versus the HTC EVO 4G LTE now before we
get into any comparison just want to say
that this HTC EVO 4G LTE of course is
the predecessor to Sprint's original HTC
EVO 4G this one has the long term
evolution but it's a huge step up from
the original Sprint version this is the
version by the way with all of our
hardware or kickstand and you can see
that they've made it bigger they've
built it better so it's got the same
scheme though and it's a really nice
phone ok so getting down to these two
phones our Samsung Galaxy s3 is the GTI
9300 now that's the International
unlocked version the GSM and our HTC evo
4G LTE is running on Sprint's 4G LTE
network
as you can see Sprint logo meaning it
will have some bloatware okay so the HTC
EVO 4G LTE has a 4.7 inch HD Super LCD
screen with Corning's Gorilla Glass 1
then our Samsung Galaxy s3 has a four
point eight inch Super AMOLED display
and both of these have 1280 by 720 p
resolution the HTC EVO 4G LTE has 312
pixels per inch where the Samsung Galaxy
s3 has 306 PPI but up being a tiny bit
bigger display of course we're probably
going to see the smaller pixel density
on the galaxy s3 now looking over the
actual build of both of these phones you
can see we have the white version of our
samsung galaxy s3 and we have the black
and red scheme version only available
color for the Evo 4G LTE now anyways
just shut these two off so we can go
over that the thickness of these phones
are just about the exact same they weigh
you know just about the exact same in
the palm of my hand they both feel
really solid and heavy they're both
built very nice now of course on the
back of the HTC EVO 4G we have some
actual
metal accents going around the edges and
of course our kickstand to use for
watching media and whatnot but the
accents on the samsung galaxy 3 s3
excuse me are not actual metal though
anyways popping off anything removable
from these two phones we've got our top
that pops off of our Evo 4G LTE and
nothing else is removable but we do have
our microSD expansion slot right here on
the Evo 4G pop our Tector back on here
we'll just have to do it from the bottom
excuse me and then on the back of the
samsung galaxy s3 of course you peel it
off and we've got our microSD slot and
our SIM card slot
both of these are enabled with NFC with
the stock batteries ok so on the front
of these two devices you see we have our
three haptic buttons down here we have
our recent window our home and our back
button whereas on the samsung galaxy s3
we have our back our home and our menu
button so looking at the two devices
lock screens we can see that we can
easily access apps without unlocking the
phone on the HTC EVO 4G we can access
our phone mail messages in camera and on
the galaxy s3 we can access our phone
our chat on our web browser and our
camera on the HTC EVO 4G you're going to
want to grab a nap and we can move it
into the circle you can see the
silhouette of it to open it and on the
samsung galaxy s3 we grab a app and
swipe up in any ways to unlock each of
these phones you just grab the circle on
the Evo 4G LTE bring it up anywhere and
it unlocks and on the galaxy s3 we swipe
to unlock go home so you can see both of
the home screens are very different or
running different native widgets being
that we have the sense 4.0 overlay on
the HTC EVO 4G LTE and we have the
TouchWiz 4 on the Samsung Galaxy s3 now
both of these are skins or manufacturer
overlays as you may call them that run
on top of the Android 4.0 Ice Cream
Sandwich operating system that each of
these phones also possesses now anyways
we can go right into our app drawer
let's see it's definitely set out a
little differently it's laid out
um anyways on the galaxy s3 we can
scroll through our apps we do have the
infinite scrolling with only two tabs
being the apps and the widgets now in
HTC Sense that's a little different we
can scroll but it's not infinite and we
are categorized with our all our
frequently used apps and our downloaded
apps now right from each of the docs and
the app drawers here we can access our
settings by pressing the menu here and
we will press our menu here on the
galaxy s3 that's where we have the
option to sort share manage apps edit
tabs here we can access the Play Store
we can edit you can uninstall we can go
to our downloaded applications like that
and we can go home on each anyways if
you notice the native widget for weather
on the galaxy s3 we have right here
we've got our time and our weather and
then of course we have HCC's classic
flip clock here pulling down the status
bar on each phone you can see we have
some toggles on the galaxy s3 that
aren't available on the HTC EVO 4G can
go through and select our Wi-Fi our GPS
screen rotation stuff like that and of
course we have our notifications we can
access our settings easily from each of
the status bars where they have all of
the same settings basically but their
skins differently of course due to the
sense
TouchWiz differences now we can access
our airplane mode Wi-Fi Bluetooth they
each have the data usage under more
settings for each of these phones we can
enable our NFC and our Android Beam as
well as the S beam on the galaxy s3 we
have our personalization options on the
HTC EVO 4G LTE now under that settings
menu we can change the scene where we
have our sprint options HTC social work
play and travel that is kept it on the
sprint we have our skin or wallpaper of
default lockscreen style now this isn't
the only way you can access these
options but this is just a nice way of
doing so right from the settings menu go
back we have our sound options or
display options the one thing I dislike
about the Galaxy s3 is that the display
option when you go to the brightness it
is not a master brightness as it is on
the HTC EVO 4G
you have to choose basically in app
brightness on the galaxy s3 Benes we've
got our our wallpaper LED indicator
we've got our power saving feature on
each of these of course we have our
developer options being that they're
both Ice Cream Sandwich devices language
and keyboard storage app managers we
each have gestures on here we can go to
our gestures there it's under the
emotion settings on the galaxy s3 we
have our shake to update we can palm
swipe to screencap here's our brightness
options for our evo 4G LTE we have our
HTC gestures naval three finger output 2
with more gestures with more fingers
because we have our sound options the
HTC EVO 4G does come with Beats Audio
those can be experienced by plugging in
a set of headphones or some speakers
they don't work through the actual
external speaker the hardware of the
phone we can go to the about device on
each that's a little more difficult to
navigate to the things we want on the
HTC but that's us because of the sense
we will want to go to our firmware
information software information that is
see we're running android 4.0.3 with our
HTC Sense version 4.0 now on the galaxy
s3 we have 4.0.4 and we have the
TouchWiz version 4.0 now the speed of
these phones is going to be around the
exact same but we have our international
version of the galaxy s3 which features
a 1.4 quad-core processor the Exiles
chipset and then our evo 4G LTE which is
running the Snapdragon s4 now the
performance is going to be very similar
because a lot of the US variants in fact
all of them for the Samsung Galaxy s3
are going to be running the same
Snapdragon s4 processor so we're gonna
see power bands about the exact same but
as far as the two phones as they are
being the international version against
the HTC we will just do a quadrant test
now before I do the quadrant test I'm
just gonna kill all of our recent apps
we press the recent apps button on HTC
we have a nice Sense interface and then
we hold the home button on the galaxy s3
where we can swipe to remove or we can
easily just remove all
now we'll just have to shoot them up on
the Evo 4G LTE here which is sort of a
tedious process I'd give that hands down
to the galaxy s3 anyways we'll just run
our quadrant tests it looks like I'd
already done one on there I'll just put
them head-to-head run a full benchmark
set them here see which one will
actually finish faster as we see in our
benchmark scores there's not that much
of a difference we got fifty-five
hundred and sixty-one on the galaxy s3
and we got five thousand 58 on the HTC
EVO 4G LTE that's not a huge difference
for two extra cores in the samsung
galaxy s3 and the 1.5 gigahertz
Snapdragon did really well in the HTC
EVO now mind you the u.s. variant and of
the u.s. very end of the galaxy s3 will
have the same processor but it will also
have two gigabytes of RAM as opposed to
the one gigabyte included in the HTC EVO
4G anyways let's test out some of the
other hardware we've got great cameras
on each of these let's test out our
eight megapixel rear camera on each we
had our little motion and gestures just
gleamer right there on the samsung
galaxy s3 but right away you can see
that we just are tracking our whiteboard
here the settings for each camera are
located up in the top left on the galaxy
s3 just there on the top for the Evo 4G
LTE now on the Evo 4G LTE this is where
we're going to choose whether or not we
want to use our main camera or our front
camera you can choose our self timer our
image resolution we've got on the
highest set there for the 8 megapixel
and choose full HD video quality review
duration got our white balance we've got
a continuous shooting mode here's our
camera options and we have our video
options the resolution there by sixteen
by nine days we've got our touch to
focus here on the galaxy s3 we have our
Edit shortcuts choose our self portrait
our flash and choose our shooting mode
where we have the single shot the burst
shot HDR panorama
stuff like that got our scene mode or
timer a resolution on here as well our
white balance the outdoor visibility
anti-shake Auto contrast reset now
what's cool about the HTC EVO 4G LTE is
that you can either right off the bat
choose to record a video or take a
picture you took a picture there boom
boom boom but on the galaxy s3 we'll
have to go left and it will take a
second to actually go into the recording
mode but I'm recording a video on each
is fairly easy of course we can just tap
the screen to focus when recording a
video mom each do have our auto focus
enabled go back we save the video we can
access our gallery just in the bottom
left of each of these our front-facing
camera on the HTC EVO 4G LTE is a 1.3
megapixel and our front-facing camera on
the samsung galaxy s3 is a 1.9 megapixel
front-facing camera they both work very
well ok so we're on the Google homepage
here to compare the browser's on each of
these phones now anyways the HTC and the
galaxy s3 aren't going to have that much
difference it's got the same Android 4.0
Browser framework we just have a
different skin over it and as we access
our menu here on the HTC we can request
a desktop site enable Flash Player all
that good stuff have our downloads tab
our history tab do the same by pressing
the menu here add a new window we can
add bookmark we can use our desktop view
we have to change our brightness and
colors here because there is no master
brightness we'll go into the settings of
each of the web browsers where we have
the bandwidth management advanced
accessibility all the same stuff
browsers don't tend to very much you can
go to our labs we have our quick
controls on each go back now in Google
we can bring your fingers in from the
left access our quick controls of course
we have our ad at a bar tab manager at a
new webpage bookmarks and then our
settings once again I like to turn labs
off it's not a functionality I use often
but anyways you know the similarities
between these two phones are actually
pretty close you know especially with
the u.s. variant of the Samsung Galaxy
s3 it's going to come down to whether or
not you actually want the quad-core the
dual-core version with the two gigabytes
of RAM either phone will stand up to the
HTC EVO 4G LTE these phones knock heads
pretty well just comes down to if you
rather want a Samsung device or an HTC
device both built very well remember you
gonna be able to root the HTC get some
of that bloatware off there and of
course you can do the same for this
galaxy s3 you'll run a different
launcher if you don't like the TouchWiz
or the Sense UI but basically these are
two really good phones and they compare
really well so I suggest checking them
out if you're in the market for a
higher-end smartphone that's modern and
that will suit your needs
anyways guys I want you to stay tuned to
Android authority comm we've got a heck
of a lot more where this is coming from</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
