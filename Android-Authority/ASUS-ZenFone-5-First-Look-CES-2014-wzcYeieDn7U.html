by Toyota hey it's Josh regard from
Android 30 what's going on everybody and
we're moving right along to now the
zenfone that might seem a little bit
more familiar to you because of its size
because it's this n phone 5 alright and
like I mentioned in the intro this is a
little bit more of an accessible a more
familiar size of phone rather while this
n phone 4 is definitely has the lower
price point that comes with the size
that it has we have a 5 inch screen here
that comes in at 720p resolution as a
TFT IPS screen that brings some pretty
nice brightness and is more in line with
a lot of the phones that we might have
these days underneath we do have an
Intel Atom processor that this time goes
at 2 gigahertz and the storage
underneath can come in at 4 8 or 16
gigabytes now like we showed you on this
in phone for this is the Zen UI that you
see here as the user interface and while
just go ahead and show you a little bit
more of that interface it is a very
nice-looking experience here very
colorful and also the elements are
typically all circles as you can see
here but it's just a very very nice look
flat colors that makes it very very
attractive and more features are going
to come in in the coming days as this is
an early build of the same UI as far as
the body goes this is a fully plastic
body but this is not a glossy plastic on
the back it's almost soft touch not not
quite yet but it does alleviate some of
the finger printing that you might have
with other phones with different
material choices and also the screen
does come with a BNE touch technology
that soos has put in or in which you can
use regular pins as styluses and also be
able to navigate around the UI using
gloves so even if you have gloves on you
it will be able to do these presses
right here after that the 8 megapixel
camera on the back comes with their new
proprietary camera software called the
pixel master that provides up to 400
times or 400 percent rather brighter
photos under low lights and that
includes videos as well so some
stabilization in there along with some
optimizations allow for some great
low-light photography and general
photography as well
and just like the zenfone 4 this will
come with a build of the Zen UI based on
Android 4.3 with an update to 4.4 KitKat
coming along the line after the release
and in the end what we also have here is
a 20 mm 50 milli amp our units that will
power this their zenfone 5 for a good
time and allow you to have a good
experience on it for as much time as you
probably need so that is the zenfone 5
here at the Trump Towers at a soos we're
hanging out with them and take a look at
all of their releases so stay tuned for
more videos from here CES 2014 and once
again thank you to Toyota for sponsoring
our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
