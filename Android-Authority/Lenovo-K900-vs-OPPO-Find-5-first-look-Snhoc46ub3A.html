the ground with android authority at
Mobile World Congress were here at
showstoppers we had to stop by the
Lenovo booth now this is a device that
we saw before this is the lenovo k900
now it is a remarkably thin device at
only six point nine millimeters thin
making insanely thin it packs the
twenty-five hundred million battery
which might not be big enough for some
consider he has a 5.5 inch display it
also includes an Intel 2 gigahertz
clover trail processor which from the
benchmarks we've seen is insane we will
be testing a little bit later they say
that it's going to be released
internationally on the market sometime
in March we don't know the price point
but from what we saw initially some blog
some benchmarks leaked on the web
showing that it potentially has the
performance envelope to be on par with
the latest Snapdragon 600 now we're
complaining next to the Oppo find 5
which is a device that's earned a lot of
fanfare and for good reason a really
experienced buyer design a little bit
thicker but a large 2,400 milliamp
battery making it really really nice and
juicy both have 13 megapixel cameras now
this does feature an aperture of only
one point eight which is reputed to
offer much better photography for
low-light conditions but it's just so
thing checking out the difference
between the Oppo find 5 I don't know
about you guys but we're seeing a lot
more 5.5 inch phones we took a look at
the optimus g pro which was really
really impressed with this thin bezel
the design is very industrial illness as
you can see really angular it's a
brushed aluminum type experience etched
in the back it feels really kind of
jagged in the hand almost like it came
from a factory from communist Russia but
that's okay if for anyone that likes big
displays they're probably going to think
that this is the treat now I have to say
that their interface is a little bit
sluggish but we are looking at a
prototype build here
and obviously on the upper find 5 this
is the Qualcomm s4 pro so it's a
completely different instructions that
completely different completely
different processor it does appear that
the upper 55 has a much brighter display
so no we're done pricing yet we know
we're going to get one they told us in
March we're going to go in for review
for you guys maybe we'll squeeze a
review unit out of them but just want it
all for you a quick rundown of the
lenovo k900 the world's first with the
clover trail 2 gigahertz and the upper
find 5 also an equally beautiful device
that's already on sale right now my name
is Darcy laku babe we're here with
android authority reporting live from
Mobile World Congress in Barcelona 2013
