authority and this is LG's latest
flagship and in a nutshell it's LG
safest bet yet but is it one that's
worth putting your money on this is the
LG G six so this year LG has gone back
to basics there's no more tricks
no more experiments and most importantly
no more modularity instead the g6
focuses on just being a simple solid and
reliable smartphone it's got a pretty
straightforward design formula with a
sturdy metal frame and features a couple
of different kinds of Gorilla Glass
you've got your own Glass 3 on the front
guru Glass 3 over the camera lens and
Gorilla Glass 5 for the back and yes
because it's covered in a lot of glass
it is very prone to fingerprints and
smudges but they're a lot less
noticeable if you have the platinum
colored version this new sealed in
design doesn't mean you no longer get
access to the battery but that's a
really small price to pay for what you
get in return which is ip68 dust and
water resistance the g6 is surprisingly
very easy and comfortable using one hand
and that's due to a number of reasons
it's got these super tight bezels on the
sides and top and bottom and a new
aspect ratio for the screen that makes
the screen taller and less wide and
allows LG to fit a bigger screen but
still keep the overall footprint down
and the phone is significantly smaller
than Google's pixel XL or Apple's iPhone
7 plus both of which have smaller
screens it's a feat of engineering
that's much easier to appreciate when
you actually hold and use the phone
although it's a new design you still
have LG signature power button on the
back that doubles as a fingerprint
sensor and it works extremely well it's
very fast and accurate so unlock and
just likely last couple of LG flagships
you don't have to physically press the
button down and order for it to start
unlocking it does have a headphone jack
which is up top and the other standard
buttons and ports like the volume
buttons are on the left side the SIM
card slot is on the right and along the
bottom is the USB type-c port and the
single speaker the speaker itself is
surprisingly loud for just one speaker
but it does suffer from the same
issues as every other bottom firing
speaker which is it can easily be
blocked by your hand when you have a
phone in landscape the real star of the
show here though is the 5.7 inch display
it's an LCD instead of OLED but it's
actually a very good-looking LCD panel
it has the perfect amount of color and
contrast so that it doesn't appear
washed out or overly saturated and it's
bright enough to easily see in direct
sunlight
it's quad HD but it has a new aspect
ratio of 18 by 9
also known as 2 by 1 so you're getting
some extra pixels on the long side of
the display and if you split the screen
in half you essentially get two
perfectly symmetrical squares stacked on
top of one another or side by side
because of the taller or wider screen if
you're in landscape this makes things
like split-screen multitasking a little
bit easier because you're able to see
more of each individual app also new to
the screen is the corners are rounded
and the display itself is actually
rounded it's not just an overlay sitting
on top of the square screen and LG says
this helps make the screen more durable
against corner impacts over a
traditional screen with regular
90-degree corners the rounded corners
also add a nice aesthetic touch but
they're not perfectly rounded and you
can still see some sharpness to these
corners it's not a huge deal and doesn't
really take away from how good the
screen looks but it is one of those
things it's hard to unsee after you
notice it for the first time the screen
also has HDR support for both dolby
vision and HDR 10 which will give you a
much brighter and more vibrant image and
it's not something you can fully take
advantage of right now but you will be
able to eventually want streaming
services like Netflix and Amazon Prime
video roll out there HDR support for
smartphones
now if 18 by 9 does become the new
standard for smartphone screens there
will be some growing pains when you're
consuming content that's natively in 18
by 9 it's absolutely incredible but when
you're watching 16 by 9 content or using
an app that doesn't scale to the new
aspect ratio you will deal with some
awkward black bars
LG's built in an app scaling feature
that lets you force apps to rescale to
18 by 9 but you'll want to use this with
caution because it can cause the
contents of the app to be cut off and it
is something that LG does warn you about
if you aren't sick of hearing about 18
by 9 already
LG's even updated their
off where to show off this new aspect
ratio you'll notice that many of LG's
default apps wallpapers and even the
lockscreen have the split to square
design or at the very least are
following the proportions and guidelines
created by this aspect ratio and it's a
very clean and refreshing new look at
the same time Falls really well in line
with Google's material design at the
core of the OS you have Android nougat
running the show with LG's GUI and just
like they do every year they've updated
it for the g6 it still has all the same
features so it's essentially just a new
coat of paint with more natural colors
that's much easier on your eyes what you
can see throughout many of LG's apps and
wallpapers the app icons have been
updated to these square icons with
rounded corners for a much more uniform
look and pop-up menus within
applications also have rounded corners
it's meant to complement the rounded
corners of the display and personally I
like the look of the new icons because
it makes them all the same size but LG
does give you the option to revert back
to the original icons if you'd rather
use those there is Google assistant
onboard which makes the g60 first non
pixel phones have dual assistant and
this would have been a pretty huge
selling point for the g6 if Google
didn't release Google assistant for
other devices running nougat or
marshmallow it's still a really awesome
feature regardless and the more devices
running Google assistant the better
inside it's being powered by a
Snapdragon 820 one chip which is not the
latest like Qualcomm has to offer this
year and some people may be disappointed
by that but it's still a really powerful
processor there's also four gigs of RAM
on board and I've really had no issues
with the performance on the g6 at all I
guess you could say it flies like a g6
terrible I know but in all seriousness
is a very fast phone launching apps
multitasking and playing graphically
intensive games it handles it all
extremely well without any noticeable
stutters or drop frames this is also an
unlocked version of the g6 the phone
isn't being bogged down by unnecessary
bloatware so performance could be
slightly affected on carrier versions
but generally speaking if you had any
concerns about the phone performance
there's
nothing to worry about here now for most
regions the phone only comes in a 32
gigabyte version and in 2017 that isn't
a whole lot of storage but as you
usually would expect from an lg phone
there is a micro SD card slot that
supports up to 2 terabytes if you need
the extra space battery life on the g6
has also been extremely solid it's got a
3300 milliamp hour battery which isn't
the largest battery we've ever seen in a
smartphone but it's still a fairly
decent size and has been more than good
enough to comfortably get me through a
full day on a consistent basis even on a
heavy usage day where I might use the
camera a lot and do a few hours of
gaming I still get through a full day
just fine with anywhere between 20 to 25
percent battery life left at the end of
the night I get to charge the phone
during the middle of the day but if you
do need to top it off it's got your
standard quick charge 3.0 and the US
version exclusively has wireless
charging so that's another option that
you have available if you want to take
advantage of that LG's camera got a
little bit of an upgrade this year but
it's in a way that you probably wouldn't
have expected for the g6 LG has gone
from 16 down to 13 megapixels in favor
of getting rid of the camera bump but
this time both the standard angle and
wide angle lens share the same 13
megapixels so there's no loss and
resolution when switching between
cameras and switching between cameras is
now a much smoother transition than it
was before they are however two very
different lenses the standard angle is F
1.8 with optical image stabilization
while the wide angle is F 2.4 and lacks
both oh is and autofocus LG has also
swapped out their laser autofocus system
in favor of phase detection which works
just as good if not better the camera
app is mostly the same as previous LG
phones but because of this 18 by 9
screen you now have this carousel of
previews on the side that lets you see
literally every single photo you've
taken versus just the one that most
smartphone cameras will typically show
you this is easily one of the best and
most clever uses of the wider screen
there's a new square camera but perfect
for applicants program and it has a few
different modes built inside of it you
can snap a photo and immediately see a
preview of it on the bottom half of the
screen or take multiple photos or short
clips that the camera will auto stitch
together
they're all really different and useful
in their own ways but my personal
favorite has to be the guide shot which
allows you to use a premade template or
a previous photo that you take in at the
guide for taking another photo with the
same framing or composition new to the
g6s camera but not new to LG is full-on
manual video recording which previously
was exclusive just the B series but it
looks like LG has finally caved in and
given users what they've wanted so you
no longer have to wait for the B series
if you want manual video and it has all
the same features like focus peaking
hi-fi audio recording and in wind noise
filter the camera is a lot of fun to use
especially because of that wide angle
which can take some really breathtaking
landscape shots and it's amazing how
much more you can fit into the frame
over the standard telephoto lens the
quality of the photos themselves are
also very impressive it has excellent
detail vibrant colors great contrast and
overall pretty good dynamic range it
doesn't have any major issues with
overexposing highlights or crushing
shadows which is something that has
always been a little problematic with
previous LG cameras so it's nice to see
LG's made some improvements with that on
the g6 now it's fun as the wide-angle
lens is it's not that great in low-light
and you're better off using the main
sensor this is all too surprising
considering you have a wider aperture
and optical image stabilization to help
but with a standard angle lens you'll
get a much sharper more colourful and
much cleaner image over the noisier
muted and more overexposed shots of the
wide-angle the five megapixel front
camera is also a wide-angle lens with a
hundred degree field of view which is
great for group shots but just don't
expect it to be of the highest quality
especially in low light where it
completely falls apart
LG wanted to get back to the things that
matter and create a good solid
all-around smartphone and they nailed
that with the g6
it performs well it has an excellent
camera good battery life and offers
features that people actually want in a
part phones like wireless charging and
water-resistant it's even pushing a few
boundaries with the 18 by 9 screen and
super thin bezels and it's set in the
bar for what looks to be the future of
smartphones LG is squarely back in the
flagship conversation and for
reason and a g6 is shaping up to be a
part of that conversation for the rest
of 2017 and that's really exciting as
