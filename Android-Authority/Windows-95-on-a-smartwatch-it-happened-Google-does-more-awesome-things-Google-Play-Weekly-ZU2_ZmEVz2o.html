handy the Android 30 app guy and welcome
back to Google Play weekly this week
we're gonna talk about the death of a
couple of Star Wars games some new
Google stuff and Windows 95
yep Windows 95 so let's get started
first up this week Google Play games has
been updated with better cross-platform
support and material design by far the
more interesting part of the update is
the new cross-platform support google
has updated their C++ SDK to allow for
real-time multiplayer this means that
developers can now code multiplayer on
their iOS and Android games just one
time instead of having to do it in
Objective C for iOS and Java for Android
oh and material design is now a part of
Google Play games which is quite nice
next up the Google Play Store now allows
you to pre-order movies the feature is
us-only which is probably going to make
people mad and that's understandable
furthermore most people don't understand
why this is the thing that happens since
it is a digital medium and digital
mediums don't typically run out of stock
I think it would have been cool if they
gave you like a dollar off or something
like that for ordering it early you know
rewards for being the earlybird
nevertheless this is a thing that
happened and now you can currently
pre-order 15 movies in the Google Play
Store today we mourn the passing of two
Star Wars games that were made by Disney
and that is tiny Death Star and assault
team Disney reportedly shut down these
projects without telling damn near
anyone and that includes the public and
even one of the developers the popular
opinion is that they're narrowing their
star wars options down to better focus
on Star Wars commander which was
released a couple of weeks ago if you
have these games installed you can still
play them for the time being but you
can't get them in the Play Store anymore
so enjoy them while you can
a new poll that's been making headlines
suggests that 49 percent of people would
pay for a subscription service now this
may seem ridiculous but there are
variables that should be taken into
consideration Netflix Google Play
all-access and things like antivirus
applications are very popular apps that
require subscriptions in order to
function since most people would buy a
subscription to one of those things that
makes the 49% thing kind of makes sense
I do know that a lot of people in the
51% are angry about this and I don't
really know why it is just a poll so
it's not particularly scientific but
like I said earlier it does make a
little bit of sense
in our last bit of news this week
someone got windows 95 running on an
Android wear SmartWatch you may be
wondering why this is a thing and it's
because reasons there is no point to
this nor will it get much if any support
these sorts of mods are done just to
show that they can be done Windows has
made appearances on plenty of other
Android devices including the Evo 3d so
it's not the first time we've seen
something like this for those who are
wondering
windows 95 doesn't run very well on
smartwatches at all but it does run so
who wants to see some trending
applications as usual if you want to
check any of these applications out you
can find the links in the written
companion which is in the video
description below I know we're a bit
late on this but fruit ninja got a huge
update last week and we're talking huge
the team at Halfbrick Studios rebuilt
the game from the ground up to include
more gameplay features more characters
and more content it keeps the same
pricing structure as before and the core
mechanics are pretty much the same but
there's a lot of new stuff there so if
you haven't played in a while you should
definitely check this out
obscure is a hybrid photo editing and
messaging application that allows you to
add a number of very unique filters some
of the options include things like fire
a zipper and blur on the messaging side
of things can incorporates things like
text scrambling and the ability to
delete messages you've already sent so
if you're in a security this is a pretty
decent messaging service to check out
it's currently free with no in-app
purchases to do is receive an update
this last week that improves the Android
part of their platform the whole update
is pretty much dedicated to integrating
the new karma system throughout the
application if you used to do is - you
should already have the update and if
you're looking for a fun to-do list
application you should try this one out
it's pretty good Google Play newsstand
was updated this last week and it has a
little more material design goodness
than it used to have it also received
some feature updates for magazine
reading as well as improved topics it's
totally free and it's a fairly decent
news reader if you're looking for one
where HQ for Android wear as an
application aggregates pretty much
everything you need if you have an
Android wear device this includes
accessories news apps and watch faces
it'll also notify you when new wear apps
have been found if you own an Android
wear device you should at least try this
one out if you want to see the latest
and greatest in Android app news and
review simply head on over to android
