two of our keynote recap video mostly
because this microphone actually didn't
work in the last one and one of the
cameras stopped working in the middle of
it we didn't realize it so it's okay
we'll just call that the lost interview
but keynote happened this morning oh I
actually it's a job supercar from
android authority what's going on
everybody and I'm here with nate swanner
who's one of our editors at the website
and we're both here at Google i/o 2013
it's probably good that we're doing this
second take because this morning keynote
happened but all most of not all of them
most of the updates that they were
talking about have been released by now
and we've got we've gotten a little bit
of time with those applications to sort
of see what we thought about them but
when we just kind of recap a little bit
of what keynote was all about we're
gonna be passing this mic back and forth
so all right here we go name to start
with we have android android had some
very interesting new things come out the
galaxy s4 i guess we can call it a
google edition it's a s4 pure android
which is a 5-inch pure android device
that's pretty cool one thing that Josh
and I talked about earlier was is it
going to be able to take care take
advantage of all of the s4's kind of
features like like the sensors and you
know the the retina recognition thing
the other thing that came was google
play music google play music got a big
big upgrade and there's also a streaming
service as well as google play games
which is a online multiplayer thing and
it is so far amazing one of the cool
things about play music is that
subscription service we were talking
about this earlier in the previous the
lost interview about how we weren't sure
if a subscription service done by Google
would have the same kind of library
thats a Spotify does i like what google
play music is doing with the design now
it looks really awesome having uh the
immediate radio stations is really nice
and the fact that there are unlimited
skips and you can see
sort of swipe over and see what the next
song is is a nice way of kind of looking
through also you can even see all the
songs that are coming up in your radio
for the next however say 20 tracks or
something like that overall google play
music is I think a nice upgrade but I
wasn't we weren't sure rather why they
downplayed the subscription so much it's
kind of a big deal that they have a
subscription service which would
potentially mean that Google is going to
try to get the biggest possible library
they were already saying they have
millions of songs so we'll see where
that goes gaming yes you were talking
about gaming multiplayer gaming is going
to be even better there's a nice
multiplayer game that we're probably
gonna try playing out a little bit maybe
tomorrow but achievements having saved
games across all devices that's really
great what also came up as far as the
apps go are was the hangouts application
which replaced the talk application and
essentially what it is is the the best
iteration of google talk that you've
ever seen best integrated with google
plus and whatnot you had a little bit
more time with it mostly because i
couldn't get it to work on my device so
once you tell us a little bit about
hangouts hangouts is really kind of a
Google Talk upgrade like John said it's
really pretty it looks really great on
mobile as well as in google plus I did
notice in gmail it didn't look any
different so I don't know if gmail has
actually got the integration yet
obviously Google+ does and it looks
fantastic it works really well it's a
lot easier to do things than then the
way it was so it's a welcome upgrade and
very very impressive google+ google+ got
a big upgrade in terms of all the Google
services google plus probably had the
biggest upgrade your entire stream as
you probably know if you're on google+
looks very different what it did was
rather than a scrolling feet you know we
were used to scrolling through our
stream and catching information that way
google+ now auto hashtags things for you
so if you were looking up a baseball
player it would hatch tag that baseball
player you can click on that hashtag and
the card that the post is on will
actually kind of flip over and what that
does is that gives you more information
on that hashtag that you were just
looking for so what to do instead of
scrolling
it's almost like it kind of reminds me
Joshua when I was a kid and I played
memory and you have to flip the cards
over it was kind of like that to me and
it's it's amazing pictures look richer
poster bigger it's just it's an overall
much prettier upgrade to me it kind of
looks like Flipboard so let's move right
on to search this will be really quick
just search has been given some new
information inside of the was it called
the graph and the knowledge graph there
you go a little bit more information in
there so you get a lot more info from
just one search on the side but the big
one is the integrated search voice
search that is for desktop computers or
laptops that is and then finally we have
maps maps got it well did not God that's
the wrong word because maps upgrade is
not going to happen until maybe summer
we not too sure exactly when but you can
preview the new maps application if you
follow the link that they gave them the
keynote Maps was given a big overhaul
now it looks even cleaner and it's more
made for the user based upon not just
where if they've gone before but where
they're friends of God now maps is full
screen the search bar is kind of a
floating on the top left and when you
type something in you get kind of drop
down cards like we're used to with
Google now that's where it becomes
really really kind of cool because when
you type something in like we were
playing with it i typed in tacos why not
i typed in tacos and it gave me a whole
list of taco places here the coolest
part obviously if you can see in the
keynote video that I'm showing right now
was that when you zoom all the way out
all the way out you can't just keep
zooming you do have to click earth well
at least that's what we had to do but
once you click on earth and you go all
the way out it gives you a real-time
look at earth right now maybe not it
necessarily the way earth like it's not
going to be to a tee but we were told
the clouds are in sync their real time
different weather patterns stuff like
that you can actually see that zoom back
far enough you actually get to see
constellations in the sky you get to see
the Sun the earth is illuminated via the
point of the Sun and it's incredible
it's a great look Google made a really
good point some people may not ever get
to see I say the bottom of the ocean or
the archipelago's
or all these crazy places all around the
world that's what google earth is here
for if they're not able to see those
places they can at least get a glimpse
of taste of it some people would say oh
so you can zoom in on the Vatican and
Google Earth and mo's does not ruin the
majesty of it no you get a preview of it
you say wow that is really cool I want
to go there and then you go there and
your experience is enhanced because you
already had a taste of it now you can
fully appreciate it it's like coming to
San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge you do
the street view through the Golden Gate
Bridge but it's not the same as actually
doing it sonate I'll throw it back to
you for our sign off here a favorite
part of the keynote and why I think my
favorite part of the keynote was the end
when Larry came out totally unexpected
Larry for a guy who heads up Google I
thought what he did in taking questions
from the audience totally unfiltered on
on the spot was I found that really kind
of endearing and I found it a very cool
thing for a guy who's in charge of
arguably the biggest tech company on
earth to stand in front of developers
who can notoriously be kind of picky and
kind of curmudgeon e as Larry himself
says he is to stand up there and let
them ask him whatever they wanted to ask
him I just thought that was incredible
