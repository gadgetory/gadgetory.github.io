authority we reporting live from mobile
world congress 2013 here in barcelona
and we are taking a look at to heavy
weight of a device's here both are of
the 5.5 inch display form factor you'll
see that this is the LG optimus g pro
it's the latest device from LG and it
contains all the ladies generation
hardware some wonderful things included
1080p 5.5 inch display with a 401 ppi
where's the galaxy note 2 is AMOLED base
1280 by 720 giving you only 267 p I so
we're looking at a high resolution with
the optimus g pro additionally it also
has a bigger battery in the option
street bro only 40 milliamps hours
bigger but still bigger nonetheless it's
also a little bit thin or too and
contains a 13-megapixel camera versus
the Galaxy Note 2's 8 megapixel other
than that it also has a Snapdragon 600
which is the Monster House of a
processor on the market right now it's
going to be substantially more powerful
than the XC knows quad-core that's
contained in the galaxy note 2 now it's
really interesting to see but it looks
like they've been able to actually
miniaturize the size of the bezel on the
side some cool things coming they've
told us in the second and third quarters
to 2013 in that department we can't
really reveal more about that but the
fact that it has a much higher
resolution display a much more powerful
processor and a higher megapixel camera
and a larger battery and all the good
stuff like eight expandable memory
really make it a winner in my book now I
really love the large form factors you
guys might know but all these things
combined plus the fact that's a little
bit thinner really make it a winner for
me obviously LG has taken their own time
they do claim that it has dual recording
meaning that i can record from the rear
and from the front cameras
simultaneously which is kind of a neat
feature it feels thinner it's actually a
little bit lighter than the Galaxy Note
2 which is something i like it does have
the sort of typical LG black border that
we saw in the optimus 4x HD and in the
Optimus G but it's still a really
attractive device very plastic you
fleeing but quite rigid and strong no
word yet on pricing but compared to the
Galaxy Note 2 I have to say that it's a
very very healthy competitor and I might
actually be changing up the Galaxy Note
2 for one of these as soon as it hits
the market
anyway guys so this is a first look and
a review and a versus of the optimus g
pro force the galaxy note 2 we're live
on the ground here with Mobile World
Congress is android authority guys your
