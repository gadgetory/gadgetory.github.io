you're probably wondering if the brand
new Galaxy Note 9 is worth the upgrade
if you couldn't already tell the note 9
is an incremental update but there's
still some significant changes over the
note eight that are worth talking about
all of the changes that Samsung has made
to the note 9 are aimed at refinement
but most of them are pretty minor the
overall design looks almost identical
but there are some small details that
make the note nice design feel a little
bit better the sides are much flatter
now and there's a chamfered edge that
runs around the entire body making the
phone feel a lot less slippery the other
big change to the design is the
fingerprint sensor isn't a much more
convenient and comfortable location
under the camera instead of that awkward
side placement of the note 8 you get a
slightly bigger six point four inch
screen with slightly smaller bezels on
the note 9 but otherwise the displays
are completely identical with the same
qhd+ resolution and Super AMOLED
technology the S Pen is still the same S
Pen that it was on the note 8 with all
the same features and functionality but
is bluetooth capable now which lets you
do things like remotely control the
cameras shutter button the internal
hardware is where you'll find the most
significant upgrades you've got a faster
snapdragon 845 processor on the note 9
and the base model starts at a hundred
and twenty eight gigs of storage and six
gigs of ram the fully maxed out Note
nine will bump you up to eight gigs of
RAM and four times e storage at 512
gigabytes in comparison the note 8 has
last year's 835 six gigs of ram and tops
out at 256 gigs of storage the biggest
upgrade is the four thousand milliamp
hour battery which is a pretty big deal
considering last year's Note 8 played it
pretty safe with a 3300 milliamp hour
battery with the note 9 Samsung has also
added the dual aperture mode from the s9
and the camera now has built-in scene
recognition although this is probably a
feature that could come to the Note 8 in
a future update with the exception that
the note 9 has a more recent version of
Oreo with Android 8.1 instead of 8.0 on
the note 8 the software experiences are
virtually identical most of these
changes probably aren't enough to
warrant an upgrade if you already
a note 8 but if you're coming from
something much older it could be worth
it if you're willing to shell out 8,000
dollars or more to get one that's it for
