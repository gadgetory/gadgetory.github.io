smartphones in the market today however
how does it really fare against one of
the top dogs in the game age Josh regard
from Android 30 what's going on
everybody and this is a look at the
Nexus 5 versus the Samsung Galaxy s4 as
we start off with design you can pretty
much guess where the beginning of this
battle will go yes it is a battle of
material choices the Samsung Galaxy s4
actually sits in what can be considered
a bygone era it was back in a time when
glossy plastic was pretty much what we
expected from Samsung no matter what
device they put out however the material
does make the phone very fingerprint
prone and it could slip about pretty
easily in your hand as the s4 did come
out within the craze of the 5-inch
screen it is nice to see that it was one
of the easiest to handle especially at
the time of its release
fast-forward some time and we get the
Nexus 5 sporting a four point nine five
inch screen this phone is just about as
big as the footprint of the s4 however
it is actually just as light despite
having a different material choice in
the black version of the Nexus 5 it
employs soft touch plastic which gives
it a very nice feel and a little bit
more grip when you use in your hand the
Nexus 5 takes some cues from the Nexus 7
tablet of 2013 making some pretty
minimalistic design choices on its back
once you get the phone's in your hand
you find that the handling is pretty
much the same either way as far as looks
go it is a very subjective matter
however I will say this I don't find
that many people who argue for glossy
plastic these days anymore the Samsung
Galaxy s4 comes with a 5-inch screen at
1080p resolution and 441 pixels per inch
now being a Super AMOLED display it is
pretty much expected that the colors
will be pretty highly saturated but the
good thing about the Galaxy s4 is that
you can customize the color motif so you
can tone that down if you really need to
it was one of the best 5 inch screens
available in the beginning and until now
it is still one of the better performing
however LG is no stranger when it comes
to good display quality especially after
the great display found in the LG g2
this four point nine five inch screen is
also capable of 1080p
resolution and comes in at 445 pixels
per inch now it is an IPS screen which
means it does get pretty typically high
brightness the Nexus 5 screen however we
will say is a little bit less in terms
of its performance when compared to the
LG g2 which is the phone supposedly it
is based off of it is still really great
and definitely holds up against the
galaxy s4 pretty much you can have your
pic here as either display will give you
great performance especially if you
enjoy the higher saturation of Super
AMOLED and that's great the Nexus 5 on
the other hand will give you reliable
performance no matter what you throw on
that screen the Samsung Galaxy s4 is the
older device so as is pretty typical it
does lose the edge in the performance
aspect however the s4 comes with the
Snapdragon 600 which at the time of its
release was one of the fastest
processors available it is clocked in at
1.9 gigahertz and is backed by the e3 no
320 now this is not a bad performance
package by any means and is still
actually one of the most reliable you
can get on a smartphone today I still
found very minimal lag in the TouchWiz
of the Samsung Galaxy s4 and to be fair
even if that lag was there it didn't
hinder from my overall experience
nonetheless the Samsung Galaxy s4
even all the way to today is still a
pretty reliable phone and provides a
good experience of course with the newer
Nexus 5 we get the updated Snapdragon
800 clocked in at 2.3 gigahertz and
backed by the aged arena 330 now this is
the fastest processing package available
on a smartphone today and it definitely
powers the minimalistic Android 4.4
KitKat beautifully yes Android KitKat
will blaze through all of its elements
and there's no doubt that the Nexus 5 is
one of the fastest and smoothest
experiences available on a smartphone
currently while empirically the Nexus 5
will be faster because of its higher
processing power I will say that the
Samsung Galaxy s4 still remains a very
reliable competitor and with that in
mind despite the Nexus 5's Android 4.4
KitKat providing a very seamless Android
experience that doesn't mean that you
won't be able to get the same tasks done
in a good time with the s4
it is in the hardware department that we
might start to see some disparity the
Nexus line is not necessarily known for
having a lot of bells and whistles in
its smartphones and it's tablets and the
Nexus 5 is pretty much no different the
16 or 32 gigabytes of on-board storage
is not expandable for example and after
that we have the usual bevy of
connections however what the Nexus 5
does boast at least compared to which
predecessor is full LTE support also
there is qi wireless charging available
on the Nexus 5 out of the box which is a
really nice feature to have however when
it comes to the battery it is a 2,300
milliamp hour unit that was supposed to
power a minimalistic Android 4.4 KitKat
unfortunately the battery life is
probably the weakest point when it comes
to the Nexus 5 anything more than
average usage will get you results that
you probably won't be very happy with
compare that to the Galaxy s4 which does
come with a larger 2600 milliamp hour
unit but has one very important trait
the fact that it is removable yes you
can have spare batteries so that power
is never far away when you need it
however when you go deeper into the
galaxy s4 we find even more that it is
capable of that's because a myriad of
sensors provides the galaxy s4 with a
bunch of extra functions aside from the
general smartphone experience that
includes air views air gestures smart
scroll even an IR blaster for
controlling your TV it's just a matter
of whether or not those extras are for
you if you don't need all of that other
stuff perhaps the Nexus 5 is a much
better value because it gets back to the
essentials and it does them all very
well and in the camera Department will
probably see even more disparity pretty
simply put the Nexus line has quite a
ways to go when it comes to its camera
optics this a megapixel shooter does
come with optical image stabilization
which allows it to flood even more light
in for low-light shots however when it
comes to most other shots we see that
the colour production does leave quite a
bit to be desired this can be remedied
by having hdr+ on and a lot of users
might just end up having hdr+ on all the
time to compensate for this its pictures
are just vastly better when it comes to
OIS however it does provide a very good
performing low-light
shooter it will allow you to get a shot
even in pretty dark conditions however
the picture that comes out the other
side may still lack some of the quality
like we were saying before it's no
secret that Samsung threw in so many new
options in their camera for the s4 that
you pretty much have nothing but choices
when it comes to your smartphone
photography it is in the picture quality
that the s4 truly does excel as it does
provide very good color production in
plenty of its pictures without the OIS
however it's low-light performance does
leave a little bit to be desired so
that's where the Nexus 5 can definitely
have a point in its column it's pretty
hard not to give the s4 the edge here
but it does make us think what would a
camera with the s4 performance look like
with optical image stabilization perhaps
no word was used more for the Samsung
Galaxy s4 UI then practicality yes
practicality is the question when it
comes to this version of TouchWiz which
provides a lot of new navigation
features in its general UI however it is
pretty much agreed that TouchWiz is in
need of a pretty big refresh not only
has the pretty bloated UI been used in a
bunch of different devices it could use
a pretty different look at this point
however Samsung focused on functionality
when it came to its newer versions of
its operating system and in that regard
it does somewhat succeed however is it
all useful that's the question that we
still sort of asked even to today when
it comes to the Nexus Google frequently
goes back to its roots and that's search
when it comes to its newest iterations
of Android and for Google now it took
center stage when it came to Android 4.4
KitKat the highly contextual and also
very good performing Google now has been
given much more integration in the
newest version of Android 4.4 KitKat and
in this case it means it is a second
homescreen found now all the way on the
left and with all of the other
optimizations put into Android 4.4
KitKat the performance and experience of
Android has been taken to 11 all in all
the Samsung Galaxy s4 packs a lot more
features on top of an already pretty
good smartphone experience however when
it comes to those features it may not be
a master of any one of those things
meanwhile the stock Android experience
continues
to get better and Google focuses on
particular and specific skill sets when
it comes to its Nexus smartphone line
and in that regard it arguably does so a
great success the Samsung Galaxy s4
after some time has a price that has
come down to around $500 or more which
is actually not a bad price considering
all that it is capable of and that it is
still a pretty reliable smartphone to
have on the other hand the Nexus 4 comes
in at the base price of 349 dollars and
considering everything that it is
capable of I do think that that is quite
this deal however in this comparison we
might see that it is another situation
of you pay for what you get and in the
case of the Samsung Galaxy s4 it does
provide some features that the Nexus 5
simply cannot that includes a removable
battery that also lasts longer a much
better camera and expandable storage but
it pretty much comes down to this
whether or not all of those extras in
the galaxy s4 whether useful or not are
enough to sway you from what could be
one of the best Android experiences
available today in the end that's a call
that you will have to make as always
