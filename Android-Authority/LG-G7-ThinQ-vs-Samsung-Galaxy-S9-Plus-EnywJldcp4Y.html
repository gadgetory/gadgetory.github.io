the mobile industry for a pretty long
time but despite producing some really
great devices LG unfortunately hasn't
had the same level of success as Samsung
LG continues to live in the shadows of
Samsung and the LG G seven probably
won't do a whole lot to change that but
it's always fun to compare LG's flagship
against Samsung's so let's take a look
at the LG G seven and see how well it
stacks up to the Galaxy S nine plus as a
disclaimer we're using the Galaxy S nine
plus because it's better SPECT and also
has dual cameras so the comparison is a
little more fair but there are certain
aspects in this comparison where the
galaxy s 9 and s 9 plus are
interchangeable now because these two
phones have a lot in common
I figured the easiest way to break this
down is by similarities and differences
so let's start with what these phones
have that are more or less the same the
LG G 7 and s 9 plus have pretty much
identical specs you have the snapdragon
845 processor with 4 or 6 gigabytes of
RAM on the g7 and 6 gigabytes of RAM on
the s9 plus but if you opt for the
regular s9 you will have 4 gigabytes of
RAM instead with plenty of RAM and the
top-of-the-line Snapdragon processor
performance is not a problem on either
phone they're both plenty fast and
responsive they're quick to launch
applications quick to multitask and play
all the graphically demanding game
titles on the Google Play Store with
smooth frame rates they both also have a
microSD card slot for extra storage ip68
certification against water and dust
rear-facing fingerprint sensors and they
both come with a headphone jack
the most notable similarity is they both
have a dedicated AI key but the
difference here is Samsung uses their
own AI called Bixby while LG chose to go
with Google assistant which to me is
much more useful neither one is
remappable but LG has said that this
could change in the future if people
really want it on the inside the LG G 7
has a 3000 milliamp hour battery and the
s9 plus has a slightly larger 3500
milliamp hour battery both
devices are capable of getting through a
full day but the s9 plus definitely last
longer with more screen on time the LG G
7 only gets me four hours or so of
screen on time which is decent but it's
fairly average when you compare it to
smart phones that can get up to five or
six hours the designs of the LG G 7 and
Samsung Galaxy S nine are pretty similar
they're both made of glass on the front
and back with a metal frame wrapping
around the sides and this is starting to
become a pretty common design formula
across a lot of manufacturers the glass
does make these phones fingerprint
magnets but overall I like them they're
very sleek stylish they feel comfortable
in the hand and the glass back allows
for the g7 and s9 to have wireless
charging the s9 plus is the bigger phone
of the two obviously but if you want a
phone that's easier to use in one hand
or more closer in size to the g7 that's
where the regular s9 comes into play on
the front they both have
gorgeous-looking displays with thin
bezels but they're using different
screen technologies and the LG G 7 has a
notch the g7 display is a quad HD IPS
LCD and even though I preferred the
AMOLED of the s9 plus for its deeper
blacks and higher contrast the g7 has
one of the best IPS panels that I've
ever seen on any smartphone it's vibrant
colorful and LG calls it a super bright
display because it's able to go up to a
thousand nits of brightness which makes
it extremely easy to see in direct
sunlight the s9 pluses display is also
capable of hitting a thousand nits of
brightness so it's pretty easy to see
outdoors as well and if you really hate
notches you'll probably like this
display better I don't really mind the
notch of the g7 display though it
doesn't really bother me all that much
it doesn't change the way apps or videos
appear on this phone and LG also gives
you the option to hide it if you want
the audio experience has become a pretty
big deal with LG phones over the last
couple of years with the LG G 7 you
still get the same great quad DAC that
produces incredible audio but now LG has
added support for DTS X virtual surround
sound and the single bottom firing
speaker is impressively loud due to its
clever use of the phone's internal space
as a resonance chamber Samsung up the
audio
experience on a smartphone this year as
well with the addition of Dolby Atmos
and a dual speaker setup but if you ask
me LG is still king here when it comes
to smartphone audio as far as the
software is concerned the LG G 7 and s 9
are running android 8.0 Oreo with their
own respective software skins and I
would say for the most part that LG and
Samsung Qi are pretty interchangeable if
you are familiar with Samsung's
interface you'll have no problems
finding your way around LG's and vice
versa
they have a pretty similar look and feel
and offer a lot of the same features
like always on displays face unlock
custom theme engines a gaming mode and
edge based software for quickly
accessing apps music controls contacts
and other system functions I still
prefer stock Android over either of
these experiences but LG and Samsung
have done a nice job of tidying up their
software within the last couple of years
that I don't really mind using them last
but not least let's talk about the
cameras the LG G 7 and s 9 plus have
dual cameras on the back but LG uses a
wide-angle secondary sensor whereas
Samsung uses a telephoto lens instead
that gives you 2 X optical zoom LG uses
2 16 megapixel sensors with optical
image stabilization on the main lens and
Samsung uses 2 12 megapixel sensors but
both of them have oh is what makes
Samsung's camera a little bit more
unique this year is the mechanical
aperture this is a hardware based
aperture that lets you switch between F
1.5 and F 2.4 to change how much light
comes in to the sensor and also the
depth of field it's a pretty cool
feature and definitely something I hope
we're going to see more of and other
smartphones because having a real
physical changing aperture is a lot
better than one that is software based
now we can sit here and nitpick the
differences with the photos from the g7
and s9 all day but the bottom line here
is they both take fantastic photos that
the majority of consumers will be more
than happy with what it's really going
to come down to is whether you want a
wide-angle lens or a telephoto zoom lens
for me I like LG's wide-angle setup
better it's really great for landscapes
and group photos and I feel like there
are more situations where I would rather
have a wider go lens than
zoom lens I'm not saying that the zoom
lens doesn't have its use cases but very
rarely do I ever feel compelled to use
that 2 X optical zoom so with that being
said my pick for the winner in this
versus battle has to go to the LG G 7
typically I've always preferred
Samsung's flagship over LG's but the g7
has a few things that I like better the
audio experience especially what that
quad DAC is still top notch
I like the wide-angle lens over
Samsung's telephoto lens and I like LG's
implementation of Google Assistant over
Samsung's Bixby also LG has always been
the underdog when compared to Samsung
and sometimes it's just kind of fun to
root for the underdog but that's pretty
much it for this comparison hopefully
