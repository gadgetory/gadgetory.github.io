design that is pretty much as much of a
watch as we're going to get hey it's
Josh regard from Android Authority
what's going on everybody and this is a
look at the LG G watch R now obviously
the first thing you'll notice is that P
o LED screen on the front that will
allow it to have turned off pixels for a
better power consumption at least that's
what LG has been telling us but then
you'll also notice that cronograph all
the way around the actual unit itself
now it's an interesting design choice
that does get used quite a bit when it
comes to the watch faces that LG builds
into these actual devices and you will
probably have the analog look all
throughout coming around the back we do
have the charging pins but also a heart
rate monitor that will be used for
various fitness tracking ability is that
we weren't able to look at in this
retail version of Android where you're
looking at how thick this body is it is
pretty thick there are quite a few
things happening underneath way there's
also for weather proofing and as far as
the band goes we do get a leather band
that can be replaced because the G watch
our uses the standard 22 millimeter size
in order for you to change it with
whatever watch bands you may already
have here you're getting a look at the
charging dock now it's a lot like the
original one from the LG G watch where
the charging pans will just line up and
then you charge the dock via microUSB so
it's pretty easy way of charging this
actual device as far as the look of the
actual watch goes the leather band is
quite nice and you can change the look
of it by changing the band and the watch
faces and congruence in order to really
get a different look but we will say
that the actual design of the unit
itself is pretty fashionable but it
might not be as accessible for a lot of
people out there after all it does have
a very sporty and real a high fashion
sense to it that not everybody might
really gravitate to but here is a
comparison between it and the original G
watch now the G watch obviously wasn't
more was more of a reference point in
terms of Android wear and thus had a
much more simplistic design now they've
really stepped it up LG has in the G
watch are by really making it look as
much like a watch as possible especially
with that cronograph around even a
button on the side that's not
necessarily used for too many functions
you can use it to hit the power button
and actually you can turn it up and down
and it will scroll through all of the
elements but that's something we could
not test in this retail version of
Android wear once again the size of the
actual unit is
a bit more than that of the G watch they
both are still a little bit taller for
plenty of people out there so it might
not always be the easiest thing to have
on your wrist but nonetheless we have
these two watches from LG that bring
Android wear to the masses you do have
the reference point LG G watch but we do
like what we see from the G watch R so
keep it in 200 authority for our future
review of the LG G watch our this round
version of the G watch and remember to
keep it tuned to Android authority as we
are your source for all things Eva 2014
