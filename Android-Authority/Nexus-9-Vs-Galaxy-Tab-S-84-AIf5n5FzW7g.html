Android Authority and earlier this year
Samsung released two of the first
Android tablets ever to feature super
high resolution Super AMOLED displays
one of them being in 8.4 inch model more
recently Google released the Nexus 9 one
of the first Android devices to run
Android 5.0 lollipop which one has the
bigger selling point and which one
should you buy well that's what we're
here to find out with the Google Nexus 9
versus the Samsung Galaxy Tab s 8.4 so
we're going to kick this comparison off
with the design of these two tablets
starting with the Nexus 9 the Nexus 9 is
built by HTC and when people first found
out about this they had really high
hopes about the design and build quality
the build quality is pretty good if you
can manage to snag a unit that doesn't
have any defects like non tactile
buttons or a give on the center of the
back and I was lucky enough to not have
either one of these problems the design
however is more Google with just a
little bit of HTC sprinkled in the back
is made of soft touch plastic and
there's a metal band that wraps around
the entire frame adding to the overall
rigidity but otherwise it's a pretty
minimalist design that falls in line
with previous Nexus devices with the
Galaxy Tab s 8.4 you get a design that's
very familiar of the old Samsung so
there's no metal here it's just all
plastic and the back features the same
dimple pattern as the galaxy s5 you
would think that would be Nexus 9 being
made by HTC and the inclusion of a metal
band that the build quality would
completely Trump the Tab s 8.4 but that
really isn't the case even though the
Tab s 8.4 is entirely made of plastic it
feels pretty sturdy in the hand and is
extremely lightweight the biggest
difference between these two tablets is
the size the Tab s 8.4 is smaller than
the Nexus 9 in practically every
dimension some of that is due to the
smaller display but the thinner vessels
and the 16 by 9 aspect ratio on the 8.4
has a lot to do with it too
the 8.4 is shorter less wide and much
thinner than the Nexus 9 it's actually
one of the thinnest tablets on the
market it might not seem like a huge
but the 8.4 can easily be held in one
hand allowing you to have the other hand
free for interacting with the display
the Nexus 9 can be held in one hand but
it feels a little bit like palming a
basketball it's possible but you're not
going to want to do it for a long period
of time also as a side note the Tab s
8.4 features micro SD card expansion
which you don't get on the Nexus 9 and
this is nothing new when it comes to
Nexus devices so if microSD expansion is
a must-have feature for you then Nexus
is never really an option but if you
prefer Samsung anyways then you are in
luck if there's one thing that the Nexus
9 and the Tab s 8.4 have in common it's
the speakers they both feature dual
speakers but the Nexus 9 has the edge
because they're located on the front and
sound a lot better overall whereas the
8.4 s are located on the sides with the
side mounted speakers not only do you
get sideways firing audio but they're
also fairly easy to cover up when
holding the tablet and landscape
Google and Samsung also like to name
their tablets after their display sizes
so with the Nexus 9 you're looking at a
nine inch LCD display
it's 8.9 inches to be exact with a
resolution of 2048x1536 with the Galaxy
Tab s 8.4 you get an 8.4 inch Super
AMOLED display with a very high
resolution of 2560 by 1600 putting it
slightly above quad HD both of these
displays look fantastic with solid
viewing angles and sharpness but if you
want a more natural and color accurate
display then you're better off with the
nexus 9
the only flaw with the screen of the
nexus 9 is the slight amount of light
bleed but in normal day-to-day use it's
not all that noticeable if you prefer
punch your colors deeper blacks and
you've been anxiously awaiting a
high-resolution AMOLED display on a
tablet that Samsung has you covered it's
one of the brightest and most beautiful
AMOLED displays that Samsung has ever
made at 359 PPI it's also one of the
most pixel dense displays you can find
on a tablet taking a look at the specs
the Nexus 9 features the very powerful
and video Tegra k1 processor 192 kepler
GPU and 2 gigs of ram the Tab s 8.4 on
the other hand features Samsung's own
Exynos 5 octa core chip a Mallee GPU and
3 gigs of ram the nexus 9 s processor
has 64-bit capabilities so it's able to
take full advantage of Android 5.0
lollipop and in day-to-day use the Nexus
9 is very fast smooth and responsive it
also handles gaming like a champ just as
you would expect from a Nvidia made
processor
so if gaming on a tablet is a very
important aspect for you then the Nexus
9 isn't going to disappoint the Tab s
8.4 is also pretty fast and can handle
gaming quite well but in day-to-day
usage it feels just a half a step slower
than the Nexus 9 even with that extra
gig of ram if you only have one of these
tablets you won't really notice the
difference but when it comes to swiping
and scrolling through social media feeds
or web browsing in chrome the Tab s 8.4
is just a little bit choppy in
comparison to the Nexus 9 and the
benchmark scores definitely line up with
the real-world performance
moving on to the cameras the Nexus 9 and
the Galaxy Tab s 8.4 both feature eight
megapixel sensors but the megapixel
count is where these similarities end if
you want a more simplistic camera
interface then that's what you're going
to get with the Nexus 9 as it runs the
stock Google camera right out of the box
it comes with the usual features that
you would expect like panorama
photosphere and lens blur but you don't
have very many controls outside of that
Samsung's camera interface however
couldn't be further from the word
simplistic and depending on how you look
at it you might think of it as cluttered
or very feature-rich either way Samsung
does offer a plethora in terms of manual
controls and shooting modes you don't
have to use them all but they are there
if you want to have more granular
controls over your photos the picture
quality on the nexus 9 and Tab s 8.4
isn't going to blow you away but if I
have to give an edge it would be to the
Tab s 8.4 pictures appear just a tad
sharper with more accurate looking
colors but in low-light neither one of
them are any good especially with a
shutter speed on the 8.4 coming to a
slow crawl at the end of the day the
cameras aren't going to be a compelling
reason to rush out and buy either one of
these two tablets now with the battery
you're looking at a 6700 milliamp power
battery on the nexus 9 and a 4900
milliamp hour battery on the Tab s 8.4
and with heavy usage like gaming and
watching a lot of YouTube I can get a
day out of them both but the battery
life definitely is better on the nexus 9
I can get between four and a half to
five and a half hours of screen on time
on the Nexus 9 whereas with the Tab s
8.4 I can only get about four hours of
screen on time but if we're being
completely honest here the battery life
isn't spectacular on either tablet so
with heavy usage I would expect to
charge them almost every day and with
lighter usage I would expect no more
than two to three days tops both of
these tablets do feature battery saving
modes though and this is something that
Samsung has been going for a while now
on a lot of their devices but this is a
relatively new feature to stock Android
and it can really come in handy
especially when you're down to your last
10 to 15% it's no secret that the
biggest advantage of owning a Nexus
is in the software so with the next nine
you're getting Android 5.0 lollipop and
when Google releases more updates the
Nexus 9 will be one of the first on the
list to get it with lollipop you're
getting material design 64-bit support
smoother animations and a ton of new and
awesome features like screen pinning and
multi-user support if software is your
main concern and you need that pure
Android experience with guaranteed
updates then you can never go wrong with
a nexus with the Tab s 8.4 you're not
getting the latest version of Android
nor are you guaranteed any updates
instead the 8.4 is running on 4.4 KitKat
with Samsung's TouchWiz skin and as far
as I can tell Samsung has not released a
major update for it since its release
but hopefully they keep it updated
because it'd be a shame to see a great
piece of hardware go to waste
TouchWiz does sort of make up for it by
bringing a ton of features that you
can't get on stock Android like magazine
UX multi window for running multiple
apps at once smart stay smart pause and
a built-in fingerprint scanner just to
name a few
some of these features are very useful
especially on a larger display and some
are arguably gimmicky but if you're a
longtime TouchWiz user you're probably
used to that by now
both the Nexus 9 and the Galaxy Tab s
8.4 are available now with the Nexus 9
coming in at a starting price of 399 for
the 16 gigabyte Wi-Fi only model and it
goes up from there depending on storage
and connectivity if you're concerned
about the colors the Nexus 9 comes in
black white and sand the Galaxy Tab s
8.4 also starts at $400 for the 16
gigabyte model but as of this video it
is currently on sale through Amazon for
less than 350 bucks if you want to save
a little bit of money the Tab s 8.4 also
comes in a titanium bronze color if the
white version doesn't suit your style
but that is going to do it for the
Google Nexus 9 versus the Samsung Galaxy
Tab s 8.4 this is really a battle of
software versus hardware and if you want
that pure stock Android experience and
you want fast updates and you love the
Nexus brand then go with the Nexus 9
conversely if you've been waiting for a
tablet with a high resolution Super
AMOLED display and you don't mind
TouchWiz or the possible lack of
software updates then go with the Tab s
8.4 both of these tablets have their own
selling points but ultimately what it's
going to come down to is what you think
is more important because neither one of
these tablets do everything perfectly
