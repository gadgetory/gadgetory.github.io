Android authority and huawei's p-series
has always been about redefining style
beauty and technology and with their
latest flagship they're looking to take
that to the next level with that being
said let's go ahead and take a closer
look at the Huawei p8 Oh always been
known to deliver some very well crafted
handsets in years past and the PA is
certainly no exception if anything this
might be one of huawei's most
well-designed phones yet because it is
quite the looker the p8 sports a unibody
construction made of steel and just like
many other phones that feature the use
of metal the p8 feels extremely solid
it's a very angular and flat design with
chamfered edges but the corners and
sides have been slightly rounded to make
the phone feel more comfortable in the
hand the metal body has been treated
with what Huawei calls diamond-shaped
blasting that enhances the texture of
the metal while also providing the phone
with some extra grip in the process to
top it all off the PA is super thin at
six point four millimeters for an
overall very sleek and stylish
appearance it's also fairly easy to use
in one hand thanks to the slim profile
and thin side bezels even if they're not
nearly as thin as some of the press
renders might have shown going around
the p8 the left side of the device is
completely clean of any buttons or ports
leaving the entire right side to house
the power button and volume rocker along
with the sim and micro SD card slot the
power and volume keys are both very
clicky tactile and easy to press but the
volume rocker does exhibit a slight
amount of wiggle but in everyday use
it's not very noticeable on top is the
usual 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and
the microUSB port can be found on the
bottom flanked by what appears to be
dual speakers but in actuality on the
left one is a speaker and the right one
is simply just a microphone for
notification LED lovers a multicolored
one is located up front next to the
front-facing camera earpiece and typical
sensors the display on the PA is also no
slouch it's an IPS panel that measures
in at 5.2 inches with 1080p resolution
and it's plenty sharp at 400
for PPI the 5.2 inch screen will be a
pretty good size for most people
especially if you're looking for a more
normal size Android smartphone and
considering how much more battery
friendly a 1080p panel is I don't think
there will be very many complaints on
its resolution the screen is bright
vivid saturated and offers some really
great contrast and viewing angles and
outdoor visibility are also quite good
if the color temperature of the display
doesn't quite suit your taste and you
want something a little bit warmer or
cooler you can change that in the
settings although I thought the default
out of the box settings were good enough
as is all in all it's a very gorgeous
looking panel for pretty much anything
you love to do on your smartphone and
the thin bezels allow the screen to
really stand out like previous Huawei
handsets the p8 utilizes Huawei's own
in-house chipset and considering how
well they performed in the past there's
no reason for why way to make any
changes here in the p8 the standard
version of the p8 will be powered by a
high silicon Kieron 930 while the more
premium version will feature the kieran
935 both however feature the same malli
GPU and three gigs of ram our review
unit is the cure on nine-thirty model
but functionally these processors are
mostly identical outside of the 200
megahertz speed bump on the 935 just as
you might expect with killer specs like
these the PA absolutely delivers in
performance it's very fast and
responsive in daily use the UI
animations are nice and clean apps open
and close quickly multitasking back and
forth between applications is snappy
especially with three gigs of RAM and it
handles all sorts of games like a champ
without showing any signs of slowdown
there really aren't many surprises here
with the p8 s performance and it can
definitely hold its own among other 2015
powerhouses the remaining hardware is
pretty standard you've got the usual
Wi-Fi GPS Bluetooth NFC and the p8
supports a wide variety of LTE bands and
I've had no problems using it on
t-mobile here in the States the PA also
has support for LTE cat6 for faster data
speeds if you live in an area that can
take advantage of it storage options
includes 16 gigabytes for the base model
and jumps up to 64 gigabytes for the
more premium version
with the microSD card allowing for up to
an additional 128 gigabytes which you'll
most likely need on the 16 gigabyte
version the bottom mounted speaker
surprisingly provides for some great
audio it's very loud and maintains a
very crisp and clean sound without any
signs of distortion at higher volumes
it's certainly no front-facing speakers
but it's still better than any phone
with a rear mounted speaker although
being mounted on the bottom does make it
fairly easy to muffle with the palm of
your hand watch I happen to do quite a
bit when trying to game or watch a video
in landscape
on the rear of the p8 Huawei managed to
pack in a 13 megapixel camera with oh is
in a 6.4 millimeter thin chassis without
creating a camera bulge something you
can't say about some of the more recent
flag ships out there while we also
claims that this is the world's first 4
color RGB W sin sir which is supposed to
provide for better brightness and
high-contrast scenes and increased
low-light performance the camera
application is no different from some of
huawei's previous handsets it's very
similar to Apple's own camera app with a
large circle shutter button and the
various shooting modes can be quickly
toggled by swiping on the display in
either direction
among the more standard modes like HDR
and panorama you have a few others like
super Knight for better nighttime shots
best photo watermark and all focus for
adjusting the focus of an image after
the fact there's also a series of live
filters available if you want to get a
little fancy with your picture taking
many of these features have been
available for a while but one new
addition to the camera experience is
called light painting this lets you
capture light trails created by things
like moving cars stars in the sky or a
simple LED bulb the effect can be really
cool but if you don't have a tripod or a
super steady hand the picture might not
come out exactly the way that you want
in the shutter speed is reasonably quick
and you can also launch directly into
the camera and take a photo in roughly a
seconds time by double tapping volume
down when the phone is asleep general
image quality on the p8 has been pretty
impressive photos are taxed sharp with
plenty of detail even when zoomed in and
colors are very vibrant and saturated
with a really Pleasant amount of
contrast to make the images pop however
it does struggle bit when shooting a
subject against a brightly lit
background like the sky or an artificial
light source which causes a lot of the
detail in the foreground to be lost but
HDR usually does a really nice job of
properly balancing out the shot indoor
shots are pretty good too and they still
exhibit the same level of color and
contrast as outdoor shots although it
doesn't seem to handle white bounce
quite as well as it does indoors with
optical image stabilization onboard
low-light photos aren't bad either
saturation does get lost fairly quickly
and there is an increase in noise levels
as you would expect but the image
processing seems to do a good job of
cleaning most of it up the built-in
super night mode is also capable of
taking brighter photos in low light but
depending on the lighting situation
exposure times can get extremely long
and if you don't have a tripod or these
studies of hands the photo will just
turn into a blurry mess the 8 megapixel
front camera is also pretty solid and
should make selfie lovers happy you've
got these standards beautification mode
but Huawei has taken it to the next
level with a mode called perfect selfie
this allows you to dial in a number of
beauty presets that automatically get
applied each and every time you take a
selfie for a consistent look across all
of your photos thus creating the
quote-unquote perfect selfie with a
unibody construction and a slim design
the p8 doesn't have the largest battery
that we've seen in a smartphone at 26 80
milliamp hours and it's also non
removable so there won't be any battery
swapping happening here and the battery
capacity alone will make very many
people sceptical of the battery life and
rightfully so the p8 continues the trend
of a smaller battery in favor of a
thinner smartphone and battery life is
merely just average with brightness set
to auto and mostly basic use like
texting and social media battery life
for me would range anywhere between 14
to 16 hours off the charger with
three-and-a-half to a little over 4
hours of screen on time for light users
this will definitely be more than enough
to get through a full day but if you're
the type to hammer away at your phone
with a lot of gaming and video watching
you can expect these numbers to drop
fairly quickly on the bright side the p8
does come with fast charging a feature
that's becoming more and more prevalent
in smart phones to help you easily fill
up or top off your smartphone in a short
amount of time in software the PA is
running Android 5.0 lollipop out of the
box but you'd be hard-pressed to notice
without going into the settings because
Huawei's emotion UI doesn't adopt much
of the material design aesthetics of
lollipop if any it is running the latest
emotion UI 3.1 but for the most part is
practically the same as previous
versions if you've used a motion UI in
the past
we'll all be very familiar terra-tory
the icons are colorful rounded off
squares and there's still no app drawer
so your home screens will get filled up
with apps quickly unless you resort to
folders or download a third-party
launcher many of these staple features
of emotion UI make a return here like
motion gestures to answer phone calls by
raising the phone to your ear or shaking
the phone to rearrange icons on the home
screens and a one-handed mode that can
be activated by simply swiping across
these soft keys in either direction to
shrink the screen for easier one-handed
navigation the theme engine is also
still present here to allow you to
quickly change the look and feel of the
UI to something better that suits your
taste if the default look doesn't appeal
to you the options are pretty limited
but hopefully we'll see some more as
time goes on one of the newest features
is called speech awareness and it's kind
of like motive voice for the Moto X
except you can only use it to locate
your phone and to make a phone call and
the default key phrase is okay Emmy but
you can pretty much change it to be
whatever you want it to be so for
example if I wanted to locate my phone
all I have to do is say okay Emmy where
are you
and as you can see it'll start to ring
and the flash will also go off just in
case you happen to be in a dark
environment and you can't see your phone
so that's really all there is to it the
most unique feature in this version of
emotion UI is what Huawei is calling
knuckle sense the display is capable of
sensing when you use your knuckles and
this allows you to crop out specific
areas of the screen to easily share or
take a screenshot by double tapping the
feature does work but on many occasions
that seem to have trouble
differentiating between my finger and
knuckle and would randomly turn itself
on this happened most often when waiting
through comments on a YouTube app and
while gaming which was frustrating to
say the least and unfortunately there's
no way to disable it that I could find
the standard 16 gigabyte version of the
Huawei PA is expected to cost 499 euros
which is roughly five hundred thirty
dollars u.s. and will come in titanium
grey and mystic champagne the more
premium 64 gigabyte version will bump
the price up to 599 euros or $650 u.s.
with carbon black and prestige gold as
the colour options it will be launching
in 35 countries later this month with
the UK being one of the first countries
and we're expecting to see a US launch
in the coming months although this is
not confirmed as of right now but
hopefully it will happen sooner than
later
for the most part Huawei has really hit
it out of the ballpark with the p8
despite some very minor software bugs
the design is elegant and well crafted
the camera delivers some very
high-quality images and it has all of
the right internal to go head-to-head
with the flagship phones of 2015 at a
very reasonable price while we may have
ditched the Ascend branding this year
but the PA is certainly one capable
smartphone that can rise up against the
competition as always guys thank you so
