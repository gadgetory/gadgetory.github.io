Authority and there's a lot of really
great affordable smartphones on the
market right now and it's pretty amazing
what you can get for just a couple
hundred bucks and right here in front of
me are probably three of the best
budget-friendly smartphones that you can
get on the market right now but how do
they compare to one another let's find
out with the honor 5x the Nexus 5x and
the oneplus X so we're going to kick
this off starting with the honor 5x
which was just announced and released a
few weeks ago at CES 2016 and this phone
comes in at a price of just $200 but if
you were to look at this phone without
knowing anything about it it doesn't
necessarily strike you as a $200 smart
phone it's got an all metal unibody
design which gives it a very high-end
and solid feel in the hand and the
aluminum backside features a brushed
hairline finish which really tops off
the overall looks of this device the
back is slightly curved with sides that
are flat make the phone very comfortable
to hold and for a phone that is made
almost entirely of metal it's
surprisingly light in the hand and
doesn't feel all that slippery something
that you don't really see too often on a
device this inexpensive is the inclusion
of a fingerprint scanner but Huawei was
able to squeeze in this feature into the
honor 5x and it works surprisingly well
it's not the fastest finger print
scanner Huawei has put on a smart phone
but it's plenty fast and accurate enough
that you're not going to have any
problems with it the Nexus 5x is a
complete polar opposite in terms of
build materials and how it feels in the
hand b5x continues where the original
Nexus 5 left off with an all plastic
design and a smooth matte finish all
around it definitely doesn't compare to
the look and feel of a phone made of
glass or metal but the plastic build is
actually quite sturdy the matte finish
has a soft feel to it making it very
comfortable to hold and due to the
overall size of the device the 5x is
really easy to operate in one hand just
like the honor 5x the Nexus 5x also has
a fingerprint scanner on the back and
it's one of two Nexus devices currently
to include this feature Google really
nailed it with Nexus imprint B setup
process only takes a few taps to
register a fingerprint before you're up
and running and the fingerprint scanner
itself is extremely fast it's very
reliable and accurate and you can pretty
much have your device unlocked before
you even completely pull it out of your
get your also getting USB type-c with
the Nexus 5x which is slowly but surely
becoming the new standard whereas the
honor 5x and 1 plus X are still
utilizing the older micro USB 1 plus is
flagship the oneplus 2 is already a very
affordable smartphone but they have an
even more affordable phone with the
oneplus X despite its an expensive price
tag 1 plus s manages to deliver a very
high quality experience with the oneplus
X it's smaller than the Nexus 5x so it's
even easier using one hand and it's
constructed with some really nice
materials it's a sandwich design with
glass on the front and back and a metal
frame in between to hold it all together
the glass is very prone to fingerprints
but if you have the white version it's
not quite as noticeable usually phones
with a lot of glass tend to be very
slippery but the metal frame has a
series of micro cuts built-in that
allows you to grip onto the phone
without it sliding out of your hands
unlike the honor 5x and the Nexus 5x the
oneplus X doesn't have a fingerprint
scanner but one feature that it does
have is the physical alert slider which
is carried over from the oneplus 2 you
can allow all notifications priority
notifications or completely silence the
device at a flip of a switch it's not a
feature you see on very many Android
devices but considering how useful it is
it definitely should be all three of
these devices are rocking 1080p
resolution displays but the screen sizes
and display technology is going to vary
depending on which device you're looking
at with the honor 5x you've got a 5.5
inch IPS LCD display which is the
biggest display out of the bunch so if
you like large screen sizes the honor 5x
may be the way to go it's got really
nice vibrant colors and very accurate
looking white you're not going to get
very deep blacks with this display but
it gets the job done in most aspects and
is a pretty enjoyable display for your
multimedia experience the Nexus 5x the
screen is a tad smaller at 5.2 inches
and it's an LCD display just like the
honor 5x but the colors aren't quite as
vibrant it's definitely not as bright of
a screen and the whites are a little
pink in comparison it's still a decent
looking panel and if it's the only
screen you're looking at you won't have
too much of a problem with it but just
know that it's not the best 1080p panel
on the market the oneplus X has an
AMOLED display and it's personally my
favorite out of the bunch because you're
getting those really vibrant colors that
pop out at you solid viewing angles and
those deep inky blacks that you can't
get from an LCD it is a much smaller
screen at 5
inches which may be too small for some
but if you prefer smaller displays for
things like better one-handed usability
the 1 plus X's display should suit your
taste just fine
inside you're going to find a Snapdragon
processor powering all these devices the
honor 5x is running on a Snapdragon 615
with 2 gigs of RAM the Nexus 5x has a
Snapdragon 808 also with 2 gigs of ram
and then you have the oneplus X which
packs 3 gigs of ram it is however
running on a much older more dated
processor with the Snapdragon 801 but
the 801 is still proving itself to be a
very capable processor which is why
oneplus decided to go with it
when it comes to performance none of
these devices are really going to blow
you away in terms of their RAW
processing power or benchmarks but
they're not really meant to these are
budget devices after all so that's
something you always have to take into
consideration but all these phones
perform perfectly fine in regular
everyday use you will notice some
stutter or slowdown if you try to push
any of these devices too hard with
intense multitasking but most games
including the more graphically demanding
ones run pretty well for the most part
and overall I haven't noticed too much
of a real-world performance difference
between these three devices if you're
concerned about NFC well the Nexus 5x is
the only one that carries it but if
you're more concerned about storage they
may honor 5x and the oneplus X are the
better options as both of these devices
have expandable storage whereas the
Nexus 5x does not that shouldn't however
come as much of a surprise though
because it's been this way with Nexus
devices for several years now something
that's also missing from the honor 5x
and the oneplus X is full u.s. LTE band
support more so in the oneplus X is case
which is missing both band 12 and band
17 on a hardware level now this doesn't
mean that you won't get us LTE data
speeds but without band 12 or band 17 it
may not be as reliable or as consistent
as you may like now as far as battery
life goes I wouldn't expect anything
more than a full day's worth of battery
out of any of these devices but the way
they go about achieving that are all
very different the honor 5x relies on a
large 3000 milliamp hour battery to give
itself enough juice to get you through
the day there are however Huawei
standard power saving features built-in
that adjusts CPU and network usage for
longer battery life including an ultra
power saving mode that disables most
things except for basic functions like
calls and message
this of course can be really useful in
those times when you just can't get to a
charger and you just need to stretch out
those last few percentages for as long
as possible with the Nexus 5x you're
getting a slightly smaller 2700 milliamp
hour battery and battery life during
normal usage is pretty good but where
the 5x really shines is in standby this
is due to doze one of the news features
of android marshmallow which puts the
phone in a deep sleep and limits
unnecessary app activity anytime the
phone is idle for a long time it makes a
huge difference and can really see how
little power is being consumed when
looking at the battery life statistics
something else that the Nexus 5x has is
fast charging technology which neither
the honor 5x or the oneplus X have and
this can be problematic if you've grown
accustomed to fast charging but you
can't expect to win them all when you're
dealing with sub $300 smartphones the
oneplus X has the smallest battery out
of the bunch at 25 25 milliamp hours but
the smaller 5 inch AMOLED panel is much
more battery friendly compared to an LCD
and the oneplus X comes with a
system-wide dark mode enabled by default
to help you get the most out of your
battery life on paper these cameras
sound pretty close to one another when
looking at the raw numbers you've got a
13 megapixel camera on the honor 5x 12
megapixels on the Nexus 5x and 13 on the
oneplus X but we all know that
megapixels aren't everything and things
like the actual quality of the sensor
pixel size and image processing make all
the difference in the world when
comparing the quality of the images
side-by-side it's really not much of a
competition here the Nexus 5x easily
beats out the honor 5x and the oneplus X
which probably won't be too surprising
to many people considering it's the same
exact sensor and image processing as the
Nexus 6p in normally good lighting
conditions the 5x produces consistently
sharper images with better dynamic range
and color accuracy the oneplus X is sort
of in the middle the colors are decent
and there's a good amount of detail
dynamic range is still lacking but it's
nowhere near as bad as the honor 5x
which is in a very distant third you're
getting a lot of overexposed highlights
and crushed shadows and many of the
images on the honor 5x have a noticeably
warm cast in low-light the story is
pretty much the same the Nexus 5x does
really well in low light the images are
well detailed there is very little noise
and the highlights
are overexposed like what you would get
on the oneplus X or honor 5x the honor
5x is also quite slow in low light and
images can come out slightly blurry if
you don't have a perfectly steady hand
the camera tries to add some extra
sharpening to the images in post to
bring out more detail but the photos are
very muddy and soft as is that it
doesn't make much of a difference these
are all Android devices obviously but
like many other Android devices out
there the software experience is going
to vary depending on which one you pick
the honor 5x is running on android
lollipop currently with Wobblies emotion
UI which is far from the best android
skin out there and if you think it looks
a lot like iOS you're not the only one
it's built with a lot of very colorful
icons wallpapers and transparency
effects and the interface also lacks an
app drawer thankfully this is Android so
you can get a more standard Android
experience by installing a third-party
launcher emotion UI does sprinkle in a
few nice software tweaks here and there
but for the most part it feels like it's
just interfering with the core Android
experience more than it adds to it if
you want the peers of the pier Nexus has
always been the best way to go with the
Nexus 5x not only getting the latest
Android marshmallow and all the great
features that come with it like doze now
on tap and user defined app permissions
stuff that we talked about in length in
other videos but you're also always
going to be the first in line for
updates stock Android is generally much
faster and more responsive over their
skin counterparts as well so if you care
about a smooth streamlined and clean
user interface stock Android is going to
be your best bet if you're a fan of the
stock look and feel but prefer just a
little bit more options and
customization then the oneplus X offers
exactly that the oneplus X runs on what
oneplus calls oxygen OS which is pretty
heavily based on stock Android but you
notice that there's a lot more features
built in that you simply just can't get
with stock along with the system-wide
dark mode that I mentioned earlier you
also have custom UI accent colors
various gesture controls like double tap
to wake drawing an o to open up the
camera or a V to toggle on the flash and
you even have custom app permissions
despite the oneplus X being on lollipop
one of the biggest features of oxygen OS
is called shelf which is a pain that
lives on the left of your main home
screen that stores your frequently used
apps contacts and any widgets of your
choice to make it easier to stay
organized and keep your home screens a
little bit less cluttered the biggest
downside of this not being
pure stock Android is the amount of
bloatware that comes pre-installed on
the oneplus X you've got everything from
speed boosters junk file cleaners and a
plethora of other applications that
produce notifications that can't easily
be swiped away when it comes to deciding
which one is best for you you'll have to
ask yourself what aspects of a
smartphone are really important is it
the build quality the camera a
fingerprint sensor etc if you want to
metal build with a large 5.5 inch screen
and a fingerprint sensor go with the
honor 5x if you want a fantastic camera
stock Android and a fingerprint sensor
the Nexus 5x is easily the best option
for those of you who want a sleek metal
and glass design with a software
experience that offers a little more
than what you can get with stock Android
the oneplus X is a solid smartphone from
oneplus what sub $300 price points you
can't expect these phones to do
everything perfectly
so shortcomings are to be expected but
if you can live with those you'll be
perfectly happy with your purchase which
every device you decide to go with as
