youngberg from android authority calm
today I'm coming at you with a case
review for the samsung galaxy s3 you've
actually got two superleggera pro cases
from the a case corporation these are
both dual layer protection for the
samsung galaxy s3 I do have my GT i 9300
right here the international version
these of course work on all the carrier
variants as well anyways our first one
is the Superleggera pro in the red sort
of matte finish as you can see here a
case how it's how a is done it anyways
on the back you can see we have our
instructions we install the rubber we
snap on the polycarbonate case and then
it's finished so let's go ahead and open
this both of the Superleggera zor out of
their case as you can see here they're
both dual layer and also
anti-fingerprint anti-scratch and they
provide access to all the buttons so
we'll go ahead and pop the first one on
we'll try the red one out so you can see
we just remove the polycarbonate plastic
and we slip it in and then we slip on
the second shell
now with the case on it brings a nice
refined look we've got the red on black
on white with our international version
galaxy s three buttons are in fact easy
to press volume successful as well got
our micro USB in small Mike ports here
on the bottom of the case and then the
headphone jack and small mic on the top
as well so go ahead and pop our other
one on so we've got our black
Superleggera pro on as well as you can
see we do have the access to all of our
ports on this one this is basically the
same as the red it's got a nice feel to
the back add some nice weight to the
phone it's going to protect from a
facedown damaged side damage as well and
damage on the back as i said earlier
fingerprint resistant scratch resistant
and does provide a nice look with all
access to all the functionality that the
galaxy s3 provides anyways guys these
are going to be available in our case
giveaway for the samsung galaxy s3 still
in the making rounding up all the
different cases for you guys and we will
have that posted after we get our galaxy
note 2 international giveaway up and
running and give that phone to one of
our lucky viewers and web page viewers
