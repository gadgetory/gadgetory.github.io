good news and I'm talking 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack kind of news now oneplus
has been known to do some quirky fall on
your face type of marketing in the past
but recently oneplus has put it a video
where they show people looking and
talking about the new one plus six
though they blur out the actual phone
that doesn't mean we don't learn some
important things users describe the
phone at various points in the video as
smooth and elegant the video also shows
a user remarking on the presence of a
headphone jack which lines up with
earlier leaks this would mean that the
oneplus six joins the S 9 as well as a
few other flagships on the market with a
3.5 millimeter port the one plus six is
also confirmed to arrive with the
snapdragon 845 chipset up to 8 gigabytes
of RAM and up to 256 gigabytes of
storage other tipped features include
water resistance of some kind and a dual
camera setup now I know what some of you
are thinking you're thinking Jase I
remember not too long ago when you were
ragging on us to stop bitching a moanin
about the loss of a headphone jack and
that when Apple being so powerful as
they are makes a move like this everyone
else just has to follow the trend well
it looks like I need to eat my words at
least a little bit because there is
enough of a push back that itself will
become a trend at least on the Android
side of things we can hope so why is
that well I think it's probably because
Bluetooth manufacturers and phone
manufacturers themselves have not really
fill in the void with high quality
Bluetooth headphones the sound in most
cases still sucks and the Bluetooth
syncing also is slow and clumsy so I
think that's probably why that is
happening at least in part what do you
think let me know in the comments below
now let's talk the HTC u 12 with new
alleged hands-on photos with HTC priming
the upcoming u 12 to be a beast of a
smartphone alleged hands-on photos of
the upcoming flagship look to have made
their way to HTC Taiwan's news Facebook
profile down to the two selfie cameras
and two rear cam
the photos seemingly line up with
previous rumors even the dual LED flash
unit rear fingerprint sensor and a lack
of a headphone jack line up with what
we've seen and heard of the u12 based on
previous reports the u12 will feature a
snapdragon 845 chipset six gigabytes of
RAM a 30 420 milliamp hour battery and
either 64 or 128 gigabytes of storage
the phone will also leave reportedly
tout a six-inch 18:9 LCD screen along
with edgesense for squeezing the device
in the camera department the selfie
cameras will reportedly be 8 megapixels
each while the rear setup consists of a
16 megapixel and a 12 megapixel pairing
and further rumors suggest that the u12
will be named the you 12 plus to compete
with other plus smart phones and that we
will receive an official announcement of
the phone sometime this month in May and
we also have official images of the
galaxy a 6 and a 6 plus let's start with
the Vennela samsung galaxy a 6
it looks like the a6 is a pretty
bare-bones mid-range device and has a
5.6 inch display with an 1859 aspect
ratio and a resolution of 14 80 by 720
it has a single camera on the back a 16
megapixel and also a 16 megapixel selfie
camera on the front underneath the rear
camera is a fingerprint sensor
it looks like Samsung is entirely done
with the mistake of putting the sensor
on the side of the camera inside the
galaxy a6 is powered by an octa-core 1.6
gigahertz processor the listing doesn't
say explicitly what that processor is
but Sam mobile speculates that it's the
Exynos 7870 we do know that it will have
three gigabytes of RAM 32 gigabytes of
internal storage and be expandable up to
256 gigabytes through a microSD card
slot
everything is powered by a 3000 milliamp
hour battery now Sammy really bumped up
the specs for the a6 plus it's a 6 inch
screen with a bigger and better
resolution of twenty to twenty by ten
eighty the rear camera becomes a dual
camera setup with an additional 5
megapixels and the front camera gets a
boost to a 24 megapixel sensor inside
the processor is an octa-core 1.8
gigahertz a mobile speculates is the
Snapdragon 450
there's a little boost of RAM to four
gigabytes but no boost to internal
storage
however the micro SD card slot can
handle an extra 400 gigabytes so that
should give you a bit more room the
battery gets a slight boost to 3,500
milliamp hours so what do you guys think
of those mid-range specs
I wouldn't augur too much because it is
very likely that many more of you will
have a phone like that then you will
have a super expensive flagship let me
know what you think of those specs in
the comments below or on Twitter
