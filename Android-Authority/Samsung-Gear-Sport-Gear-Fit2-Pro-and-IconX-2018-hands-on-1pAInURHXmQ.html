are still super relevant and while the
Apple watch on the iOS side and the gear
s3 on the Linux kernel side have both
enjoyed notable successes the real
winner in the field has been fitness
bands whether it's e4 lineup of
wearables just announced the Samsung is
updating its fitness band and truly
wireless earbuds while introducing an
all new sports oriented SmartWatch I'm
Chris Colin with Android authority and
this is the Samsung gear sport gear fit
2 pro and icon X 2018 the gear Sport is
a slightly smaller but similar looking
version of the gear s3 it makes a few
key changes though namely adding 5
atmospheres of water resistance and
offering improved durability at 349
dollars the existing gear as 3 will
remain Samsung's flagship wearable
offering with the new gear Sport fitting
in somewhere between that price tag and
the gear fit 2 pros 199 dollar price
point
Samsung says around 50% of its US
customers are after an LTE equipped
wearable with the gear s3 frontier
targeting those folks the gear Sport is
like a fitness inclined variant of the
gear s3 classic as such it lacks LTE and
also drops the MST side of Samsung pay
meaning you'll only be able to pay via
NFC but not that older magnetic stripe
terminals it still has a built in GPS
tracking though the big-ticket feature
of the gear sport though is that it is
certified against salt water and
chlorine and can be submerged up to 50
meters Samsung doesn't recommend you
take it scuba diving but some added
peace of mind is there if you're out and
about at the pool or Beach the gear
sport also extends the military standard
810g rating of the gear s3 for increased
durability the gear sport is compatible
with a wide range of NATO nylon watch
straps and a new hybrid option with
rubber and leather software updates
include an improved caloric counter new
watch face collection bundled apps from
speedo for swim tracking and Under
Armour for everything else and off wine
Spotify playback is now supported
there's room for about 500 songs if you
don't install much else you can also use
the gear support to control the
PowerPoint presentation or use the
rotating dial as a VR controller
baked-in Samsung smartthings support
connects you to the Internet of Things
and Samsung tells us it's evaluating
which of these features will be back
ported to existing gear devices exact
pricing and availability information for
the gear sport will be a noun
if a fitness smart which isn't really
your thing then Samsung also has the
updated gear fit to pro on offer which
comes in a smaller large size and now
fastens with a clasp that offers the
same built-in GPS auto activity
detection five atmospheres of water
resistance and swim tracking via speedo
on the gear fit two Pro lacks LTE and
Samsung pay as you probably guessed but
it's the first off a second-by-second
heart monitoring although the default is
still every 10 minutes the 200 milli amp
hour battery will obviously take a hit
if you choose the continuous monitoring
option especially in tandem with GPS but
the option is nice to have when you need
it
Samsung says that using the default 10
minute and heart monitoring option will
get you about the same 4 day battery
life as the current gear fit - or about
10 hours of GPS usage most of the specs
for the gear fit 2 Pro are the same as
the gear sport barring the 30% lighter
weight a little bit less ram and
different form factor that occupies a
lot less space on your wrist
both the gear sport and gear fit 2 pro
are compatible with Android devices
running Android 4.4 or later Galaxy
devices running Android 4.3 or later and
iPhones running iOS 9 or later
pre-orders for the gear fit - pro start
August 31 for $1.99 with in-store
availability on September 15 the gear
icon next 2018 edition is much the same
as the original gear ikonics but with
improved battery life from one and a
half hours in the original to five hours
of streaming playback in the successor
the gear icon X has full gig of internal
storage for downloaded playlists and
it'll get you about 4 hours of talktime
the judging case now offers an
additional charge and can quick charge
your earbuds in 10 minutes for about an
hour's worth of additional battery life
capacitive controls on the earpieces
offer a range of options to play in
pause skip to the next track or playlist
answer and end calls adjust volume and
call up the default voice assistant on
any paired phone there's no option to
choose your assistant so if you pay your
icon next to a Samsung device you'll be
stuck with bixby add them to a pixel and
you're getting Google assistant and so
on naturally you'll need to have your
phone with you for this to work gear
icon X 2018 pricing will be announced
soon with availability in the fall so
