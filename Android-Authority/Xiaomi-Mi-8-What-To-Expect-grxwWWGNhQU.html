confused why is this phone called the
me8 when it's supposed to be called to
me 7
well according to show me the real
reason for the name change is that this
phone is such an upgrade over its
predecessor that calling it the me 7
would just not do it justice the phone
is that much of an improvement well
we'll see about that
xiaomi has confirmed that the phone will
be officially announced on May 31st
however we don't know when it would be
available commercially Chinese leaker
mokra RQ suggests that the device could
arrive in June putting it two months
behind its predecessor but a report from
digi x claims that the smartphone will
be revealed sometime in the third
quarter between July and September the
report was from last month however which
means the information could be out of
date all right Jase give us some specs
man the latest leak suggests that the me
eight will come with a 6.0 one inch
display and a snapdragon 845 chipset
previous rumors have suggested that it
would be a full HD screen resolution
with an 89 aspect ratio according to the
folks over at xda-developers who dug
through the alleged firmware files of
dhimmi 7 plus what we thought the me 8
would be called the smartphone will
support an OLED panel with an always-on
display feature the firmware files also
hinted a dual camera setup on the back
so you can capture those fancy bokeh
images the camera is said to offer AI
enhanced photography by recognizing
different screens and automatically
adjusting settings for optimal image
capture an AI camera component has been
suggested by more than one rumor and the
founder of Xiaomi confirmed on Weibo
that it will have an in display
fingerprint scanner this all but
confirms and even guarantees an OLED
screen as current in display scanners
require OLED technology an in display
scanner may not be the only way to
unlock your device however a report from
digi time suggest that the me eight will
be the first android smartphone to come
with a 3d facial recognition feature
much like the one found on the iPhone X
rumors also suggest that the phone will
feature Android reo with me UI skin on
top and 64 or 128 gigabytes of storage
with six or eight gigabytes of RAM
options we also hope that the me eight
smartphone will be fully waterproof as
opposed to just being splash resistant
like the me six the headphone jack isn't
likely to be a feature which is a
deal-breaker for many of you and there
probably won't be a microSD card slot on
board either now let's talk design and
we don't expect a lot of surprises
leaked images revealed that the
smartphone may come with an iPhone X
like notch this could be either good or
bad depending on whom you ask our poll
shows that most people are against this
design trend it also hints that the
smartphone could have extremely thin
bezels thinner than the vivo X 21 UD
that sports a screen to bada ratio have
85 percent now the glass back of the
device looks similar to that of the
Xiaomi me mix 2's with its vertically
positioned dual camera set up in the top
left hand corner it also features a
fingerprint scanner which is weird
because of the fact that xiaomi's
founder said that smartphones will sport
an in display scanner the latest leak
comes in the form of an image allegedly
showing the me AIT's retail box it tells
a similar story as the images earlier
which is that the device will sport a
notch and a dual camera setup but it
also reveals that it will come in a
gorgeous blue color option now let's
talk price and it may be good news for
some of you depending on where you live
now it may be that the me eight will be
cheaper than other recent flagships like
the galaxy s 9 and the LG v 30 however
keep in mind that the me 8 Series will
be more expensive to get a hold of in
Europe or the u.s. a leaked photo from
Weibo suggests that the lower version
the six gigabyte and 64 gigabytes of
storage option will come in at around
four hundred and forty dollars u.s. and
that the larger eight gigabyte on 128
gigabyte storage options will come in at
around $500 u.s. no I want to know what
you guys think I also want to know what
you think when we add a whole other
layer of complication the fact that the
NSA CIA and the FBI have all suggested
that Americans do not buy Chinese phones
because they are worried about the
security risk does that affect your
purchase decisions and those of you who
are not in the u.s. are you also
concerned about that let me know in the
comment
below or on Twitter I think that topic
may deserve a whole show in and of
itself IT people know how this works
