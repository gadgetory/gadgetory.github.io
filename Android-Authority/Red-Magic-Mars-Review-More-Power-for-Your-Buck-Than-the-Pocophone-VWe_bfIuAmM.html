why gaming and Android hasn't taken off
in a bigger way while there are lots of
good games on Android the Play Store
caters by far more towards the casual
audience and when I sit down for a
proper gaming session even I find myself
reaching for the Nintendo switch or my
GPD win - it's not the power the
best-selling game on the switch is
fortnight and that runs just fine on
Android as we all know it's not
development making games for Android is
really easy in fact I showed you how to
do that once in just seven minutes using
unity it could be the battery but then
again that doesn't explain why people
don't play more Android in their living
rooms or using a power bank so maybe
it's buttons and if that's the case then
the nubia red magic Mars might just have
the solution but let's rewind for a
moment the nubia red magic Mars is an
Android phone sporting a snapdragon 845
chipset along with 6 gigabytes of RAM at
the base model or all the way up to 10
if you want to go full spec the version
I'm using has got a gigabyte and storage
is also very generous you can get 64
gigabyte X 128 or 256 for those keeping
track that's the same chipset that's
found in the note 9 the azusa rogue
phone the razor - lots of far more
expensive devices this one comes in at
399 dollars for the starting price it
also puts this way ahead of the
similarly priced on a play with its
Kirin 970 processor in terms of price to
specs ratio then the closest competition
comes from the extremely good value
paka phone f1 and in fact this one
performs even better than that when it
comes to benchmark scores you have dual
heat pipe cooling and convection cooling
both of which seem to do a really good
job and when running some rather
demanding apps I didn't notice to get
warm at all so that was very impressive
it is worth noting at this point that
the snapdragon 845 is a 20-18 processor
and we can expect the 850 to find its
way into the likes of the samsung s10
and also lots more gaming phones
presumably in the year ahead that said
there haven't even been any game phones
announced with the 850 on the horizon so
for now this is still the best
performance you're going to get and
especially at this price in terms of
design the red magic Mars is very much a
gaming phone through and through with
lots of random lines all over the place
RGB lighting and Aurora band they call
it
they kind of point on the back which
annoyingly means you can't lie flat on
the table if you're into the gamer
aesthetic then you'll like it if you're
not then it might be a bit much to
swallow this is definitely a case of
form over function also it does have
dual speakers when I say dual speakers
it's jewel in the same sense as the note
9 that means that you're using the
earpiece and a small speaker down the
bottom it's not quite as impressive as
the razor 2 but it's still a big sound
and it's very decent for the price then
there's the 4d Rumble engine but
unfortunately for now that's only
supported by pub key and maybe a handful
of other games and yeah it has shoulder
buttons or at least shoulder touch
capacitive patches and I actually clicky
buttons there just touch sensitive areas
I'll get more into those in a moment
enough jibber-jabber what is this thing
actually like to game with well
performance wise I am very happy to
report that this is up there with the
very best still play anything that the
play still has to offer on the highest
settings with minimal frame drops it
competes with the likes of the razor to
the note 9 far more expensive devices
this is G of course to the impressive
specs the great cooling and if you went
for the 10 gigabytes of RAM model I'm
sure it'd be even better but I was most
impressed of all with the emulation
performance I was able to play Metroid
Prime at a playable framerate without
doing any performance tweaks oh and also
Sonic Heroes this is the best game cube
emulation experience I've had on an
Android phone
I even used the GPU segment of Garry's
speedtest G and putted it against me
razor - and the note 9 these are two
phones I have lying around which is why
I keep comparing it to those and it
actually performs better than those
devices in terms of its frame rate sure
the screen doesn't show off these games
in the very best light it's only 1080p
any an IPS LCD display but most people
aren't going to notice it's comparable
to the poco phone f1 and it's better of
course in the switch which has a 720p
display in fact that slightly lower
resolution should mean that the battery
life lasts a bit longer whilst you're
gaming and something that every gaming
phone needs this device does have a very
impressive battery life thanks to a
3,800 milliamp hour battery as for those
shoulder buttons well yeah they're
definitely a thing so the shoulder
buttons might be a good idea in theory
but in practice they maybe leave a
little bit to be desired as I mentioned
they're not actually
or buttons despite being called miles
triggers their capacitive touch sensors
this means that they sit flush to the
device they're very difficult to find so
you'll find yourself often missing them
when you're trying to press them which
of course means that you get killed in
whatever game you're playing at the same
time there's a big lack of support most
games aren't going to support shoulder
buttons the time they do come in a bit
handy is in emulation I did manage to
map a couple of emulators so that the
shoulder buttons would be the triggers
on the control pad however not even
every emulator is going to support this
because some will force you to choose
between the controller or touchscreen
controls here you can definitely put
these in the gimmick camp and that might
be a bit of a shame but it's a good
thing that the phone performs so well in
terms of pure specs and speed and power
but it doesn't really matter but I found
myself actually liking a bit more is the
switch at the top left you flick that
and then you enter a game launch show
where you can pick your games from a
scroll wheel it can also access all
sorts of game eccentric features like
blocking notifications or overclocking
the CPU to get a bit more performance
out of the device and yeah it just made
me a bit more inclined to get gaming and
with performance this good being out to
play Sonic Heroes and be able to jump
into the games like that I actually
found myself playing more android games
than I have done for a while and really
enjoying it so that's definitely a win
for this device as a gaming phone yeah
the good news is that it's actually also
a really good phone in general even if
you're not into gaming I've already
hinted it actually gives the poker phone
f1 a bit of a run for its money in terms
of value a bit more expensive at $399
but you get some more features like Lee
lighting like the cooling and you get a
more stock vanilla Android experience
and in terms of the camera it's nothing
exciting to write home about
you get one 16 megapixel shooter on the
back with an F 1.8 aperture around the
front you get an 8 megapixel shooter big
surprise service that actually perform
pretty well certainly better than have
any right to they're not amazing don't
get me wrong but there seems to be some
post-processing it add some saturation
to make photos nice and punchy the
dynamic range and the exposure seems to
work really well better than say the do
GS 90 that I reviewed last you can't do
any Bakke effects because there's only
that one lens and doesn't have any a eye
trickery but the aperture is wide enough
that you can get some natural depth
effects anyways in general it's not
gonna blow your way and it's not as good
as the Apocrypha and f1 in this case but
it is a really decent camera considering
every
else getting for that price fear in
conclusion this is not only a great
gaming phone actually one of the best
especially given the price but it's also
a really good value for money phone for
anyone if you love gaming and Android if
you love pub G if you want to try some
emulation in your pocket then you're
gonna really like this phone especially
if you can't afford something like me
razor phone 2 or the rogue phone the
other hand if you're a general user who
wants just good value for money and
great performance then this is a
contender as well
the only question then is whether you'll
be able to live with that somewhat
garish gamer aesthetic so there you go
that's the new begin read magic Mars one
