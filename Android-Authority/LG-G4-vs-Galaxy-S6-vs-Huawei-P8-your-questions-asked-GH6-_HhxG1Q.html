challenge and in the galaxy s6 LG g4 and
the huawei PA we have three handsets
that are arguably all worthy of your
money when making your decision you
often have to look at reviews and vs.
comparisons but sometimes they just
don't answer all the questions that you
might have hey what's up guys is now out
of here for android authority and a
couple of weeks ago we gave you the
chance to have your questions on the
Galaxy s6 LG g4 and the Huawei p8
answered as mentioned that post we asked
you to leave your questions in the
comments and then we decided to pick the
ones I've been the most top voted so
yeah we picked up the six questions
wrong answer let's get started we're
starting with the top loaded question
which comes from Bernard who asked with
optical LP ddr4 chipsets coming out is
it worth getting the LG g4 is the
Samsung s6 the better buy for
performance how long will the Snapdragon
808 last against a competition to answer
this first let's take a look at how each
hansard performs and then I'll give you
my opinion on which has the best
performance in the n2 to benchmark which
tests the CPU RAM and graphics the s2
exposed 67 971 the g4 scores 40 8969 and
the ph scores 47 461 switching to 3d
mark which test the graphical
capabilities of each handset the s6
cause 2175 for the g four scores 1841
for and the PAS was really lowly with
117 39 the last of the tests is geek
bench 3 which tests both a single core
and all of the calls together and in
this test the Essex scores 1253 in the
single core and 42 41 in the multi-core
test the GeForce gets 10 9 8 and 3 3 52
and the pH scores really lowly at 6 8 9
+ 2999 that's the figures on paper and
they reflect the actual performance of
each handset the optimized software on
the galaxy s6 and the powerful external
CPU result in one of the fastest android
performances ever while the g4 is close
behind and the PA is some way off in
third to answer your question Bernard
there will always be near chips on the
market with offering better performance
and sure the g4 isn't as optimized and
fluid as the galaxy s6 but it's not bad
enough to warrant not buying just for
the performance the galaxy s6 is a
little bit better and I'd fully expect
the g4 to get better than it is now with
future updates question 2 comes from mr.
a a cold Johnny who asked which camera
performs better than when it comes to
auto mode simple auto mode just opened
the camera and shoot no manual tweaking
of settings g4 or SX that's also a tough
question but I have to say that overall
the galaxy s6 camera is just a little
bit better than the g4s in daylight
conditions the g-force probably a little
bit more accurate times the color
spectrum center and images from the s6
appearing a little bit over saturated
but the differences are negligible in
low light and videos however the s6 is
definitely the better camera moving on
to question 3 and Bob wanted to know can
we get a child with stats mostly battery
life and camera starts you know frizzy
compare now this is a tough one to
answer in a video so it's a bob and
anyone else who wanted this to see this
chart please take a look at the post on
android authority calm and we'll publish
the chart there along with some my own
findings as well moving on to the fourth
questions and we've got a question here
from Donovan Richards who asked quick
question about audio quality of the
three and a half milk I'm a major music
freak like most people and have my I EMS
in all day every day at work on the
motorcycle and definitely whilst running
due for an upgrade and aiming at the LG
g4 and galaxy s6 using your aids and the
standard headphones i come with the s6
and the g4 how would you describe the
sound of each as it's been said the
Essex has a Wolfson audio chip for
better quality sound not sure about the
g4 which would you say in your terms
sound the clearest and detailed I really
want to answer this question as best as
I could Donovan but the LG g4 sample i
received didn't have headphones in the
box however i can tell you that to my
untrained ears at least when i used a
pair of Beats headphones the g4 audio is
good but the galaxy s6 is a little bit
better
the s6 headphones are also really
comfortable in the ears and work well
when used on a moving train on to the
second last question were answering
which actually came from razor but it's
the question that so many of you asked
which one of these three devices would I
pick here's what I think this is a tough
question but I thank grazer and everyone
else who asked it is very much my
personal opinion which may differ to
yours and I personally really like the
camera and design on the LG g4 and the
excellent design of the wire a PA but
the galaxy s6 takes it for me just
because it has the overall package where
is the g4 in the PA aren't the best when
it comes to the software I never thought
I'd say this but TouchWiz on the Essex
has been optimized so much it really
offers the best performance add in the
quad HD Super AMOLED display which is
simply phenomenal were built in wireless
charging outstanding camera and of
course the Medellin glass design the
galaxy s6 takes more boxes than either
they are g4 or the PA now after the
final question which came from Syed
askari which device has the best
displaying camera which one gives the
premium look now side answering this
question is really three questions in
one so I'm gonna split this up first
i'll talk about the display next the
camera and finally which one is actually
the most premium looking the displays
arguably the best on the galaxy s6 but
the LG g4 is really really close and I
mean really close there's almost nothing
in it Samsung is known for having
excellent displays and since the g3 LG
have come really really close as well
with the g4 it's their best smartphone
display ever and while I slightly prefer
the oversaturate and more vibrancy of
the Super AMOLED display on the Galaxy
s6 you may actually find the g4 display
slightly better moving on to the camera
and it's again very very close between
the g4 and the s6 we've done loads of
testing on the camera including a
shootout and it's almost impossible to
call the g4 offers the most realistic
images thanks to the color spectrum
center but the oversaturation images
from the galaxy s6 look a little better
in video the galaxy s6 is better but the
G photog you'd be better for images so
I'm calling this a draw moving on to the
last part the premium look and this is
where I personally believe the g4 is
actually a let down
the galaxy s6 is made from metal and
glass the huawei PA is simply stunning
with this metal aluminium unibody that's
just 6.4 millimeters thick but the g4
well the g4 is made from plastic and
even though there's a letter back cover
option the plastic build means that
actually the g4 is the least premium
looking of the three devices which is
the most premium well it's a tough call
on the one hand we have the galaxy s6
which is definitely stylish and premium
and on the other hand we have the
insanely thin Huawei p8 that's full of
features it's a tough one to call so I'm
not going to call it and I'm gonna leave
it as a draw between the two you'll all
have your own opinion on which is the
most premium so let me know your views
in the comments below so there you have
it your questions on the Galaxy s6 the
LG g4 and the wire APA answered
hopefully I've helped some of you make a
decision and hey unfortunately we
couldn't answer all of the questions
because otherwise you know this video
would have been an hour long if you've
got a question that you desperately need
answering why not leave it in the
comments below and hey maybe one of our
community can actually help we'll
obviously try and help where we can we
can't promise on for everything but
we'll do what we can thanks for watching
and I really hope you enjoyed this
