Android authority coming at you from
Shenzhen China in this video we'll be
checking out the Oppo our 11s so there
are three big changes with the our 11s
compared to the r11 the first as you
probably have already noticed is the six
inch 18 by 9 aspect ratio display
there's very little bezel although the
edges aren't quite as curved as they are
on the Samsung Galaxy s8 overall this
new display looks great if you look
closely you can see what Oppo is calling
the starry night effect where there is a
slight red gradient at the top and
bottom of the glass it's a subtle touch
but certainly one that makes the phone
feel more like a single piece of
hardware this effect is only on the red
model which is the one that we were able
to spend some time with you can also get
the r11 in black or champagne if you're
looking for a less flamboyant look
either way you should know that the
fingerprint reader has moved to the back
of the phone this time around to help
accommodate for the display the reader
seems just as quick as the one on the
r11 the second big change has to do with
the cameras the rear cameras are still
16 and 20 megapixels and still offered
two times lossless zoom but they're now
both F 1.7 apertures which should make
the AR 11s a tad better than the r11 in
low-light conditions while our time was
very limited with the r11 us we were
able to go out and get some camera
samples Oppo assured us that our unit
was running finalized software and image
quality is just as good as we expected
images are very sharp and detailed with
accurate color reproduction one minor
critique is a slight lack of saturation
or punchiness that some of us may be
used to from other cameras like the
Galaxy s8 otherwise the setup works
pretty well in good lighting of course
we'll have dozens of more camera samples
up on our website which you can visit
using the link in the description it's
difficult to judge low-light performance
just yet but it's quite frankly not look
much better than the r11 there's a good
amount of lens flare around bright
objects which you can see in some of our
shots we'll take a closer look into this
and report our findings in our full
review which will be released in the
coming weeks
perhaps what's most notable is the new
AI beauty mode Oppo tells us that they
analyzed thousands of photos of people
from around the world and consulted with
beauty professionals to develop what is
likely to be the best beauty mode to
date but we'll take a closer look at
that in our full review the third change
that Oppo presented was a new iteration
of its color west software color West
version 3.2 the r11 s will run Android
7.1.1
out of the box and Oppo when it comment
on any potential Android 8.0 update and
said that they would instead focus on
what the core audience in China wants
like the AI beautification mode for
example that's also their reasoning
behind the choice of microUSB instead of
USB C one really nice design feature
with the r11 s is the ports are indented
so the bottom is more comfortable to
hold with your pinky finger as far as
specs are concerned you're getting a
snapdragon 660 64 gigabytes of storage +
expansion 4 gigabytes of RAM and 3200
million power battery the r11 s + is
similar but features a larger display
and battery as well as more RAM while
global availability and pricing is still
yet to be determined you can expect the
Oppo R 11s to cost around $475 and the
r11 s + to cost around $100 more
it might go without saying but that's a
very competitive price for what you're
getting especially considering the
number of improvements that Oppo has
made from the r11
and that will be all for now stay tuned
