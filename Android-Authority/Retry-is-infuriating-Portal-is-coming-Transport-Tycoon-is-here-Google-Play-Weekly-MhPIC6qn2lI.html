Hindy the android authority app guy and
happy Friday everybody this week we're
going to talk about a new game out of
rovio portal coming to android and how i
have one less thing that i can throw in
Jay sprout his face so let's do this
after about a year of waiting my
neighbors to the north finally have
access to some google play music
goodness unfortunately i can no longer
say to Jace that i have it and he
doesn't but you know what that's okay
when this news first hit my google+ feed
exploded and i didn't realize until that
very moment that i followed a lot of
canadian people if you want to get any
are in canada just head to the google
play store and pick it up there are no
special instructions or weird things no
more proxies and no more anger and
frustration of course the bad news is i
have to think of more creative ways to
make fun of Jace now this is the point
in the show where I make a really lame
the cake is not a lie joke the game is
set to release for NVIDIA shield on May
twelfth and will reportedly cost 999 we
talked about this a few weeks ago and I
saw a few people stay that portal on
Android would make them look twice at
Nvidia's handheld gaming system
unfortunately it will only be for shield
and there's no word yet on when or if
it'll come to everyone else what you're
looking at right now is a demo from
roland deschain on youtube but it
appears to look and work pretty well
when i first heard about it I had my
doubts because portal could be a very
precise game and touch controls are
known for being less than precise and
video games however it looks pretty
clean here and that's pretty exciting
after all portal taught me what to do
when life gives me lemons so we've lived
through another Wednesday update out of
Google and this week Google camera
google wallet and Google Maps all got
some update love Google wallet's update
came with a few UI tweaks which allows
for more control and also renamed a few
of the menu items there is also a
notification now that update you on a
package shipment if you ordered it
through google wallet google cameras
update was simple if you can now take
pictures while recording video yay the
biggest update of the week went to
Google Maps and the change log is
actually pretty substantial here are the
highlights turn-by-turn navigation now
shows distance arrival time and quick
access to alternate routes there are
improved offline maps management you can
now sign in and see a places to review
so you can review places where you've
been the last big addition is
integration with ubers taxi service
should you need
that so there is a new game coming out
of rovio that's going to piss you off
but not for the usual reasons okay so
the game is called retry and it comes
out of Rovio's level 11 team for those
who don't know the level 11 team will be
the guys who work on non angry birds
games which means that they are
currently everyone's favorite part of
rovio retry as a game that's like flappy
bird in that it's insanely difficult for
no reason and that's supposed to be what
makes it fun the premise is pretty
simple you fly a little 8-bit airplane
in a little 8-bit world with 8-bit music
if the plane touches anything you're
dead unlike flappy bird the plane can
fly backwards and in circles so it's not
exactly a flappy bird clone it's coming
to the google play store soon or so
we're told but in a few markets
including Canada Finland and Poland they
have early access on iOS right now so a
full-blown release probably isn't far
off in our last bit of news this week
Google now continues to be awesome this
is a smaller update so we'll be quick
about it Google now will now tell you
when local stores are carrying goods
that you searched for online so let's
say you were looking for a pair of
headphones online and you drive past an
electronic store that happens to have
them Google now will send you a shopping
reminder letting you know that your
desired item is nearby the only downside
if the item isn't in stock Google now
doesn't know that so your mileage may
vary the who wants to see some trending
applications as usual if you want to
check any of these applications out you
can find the links in the written
companion which is in the video
description below first up this week is
chatter this is the latest app out of a
transfer and is publicly backed by John
McAfee the premise is simple this is
another one of those anonymous messaging
app for nobody can see what you type
except the person you're typing to the
idea is cool but the app is a little
buggy as developers frankly state that
they've kind of rushed this beta release
for now unless you enjoy trying out
brand new stuff it's probably best to
wait until this app gets a few more
features and a few more bug fixes
Firefox for Android desktop and pretty
much everything else got updated
recently included are a few new features
a few UI tweaks a new sync service and a
bunch of other stuff you can now sign
into Firefox Sync on your desktop and
mobile and it'll sync your bookmarks
history tabs etc pretty much like chrome
and that's actually really exciting I've
been using this for about a week now and
it's definitely worth checking out if
you're in your late 20s or older you may
remember a PC jam called tren
for tycoon if you do and you want some
actual retro awesomeness and you can now
get transport tycoon on Android the
entire game has been ported to android
so you'll be able to play pretty much
the entire game and all of its glory all
over again it's six dollars and
ninety-nine cents in the Google Play
Store but there are no microtransactions
at all so you can buy it and sim it up
old-school nine cards home launcher is
an interesting concept if you recall
back in the day I did a review of
everything me launcher imagine having
what that launcher had without being
required to change your home launcher
and that's pretty much what nine cards
home launcher does it categorizes your
apps into categories such as social
media etc then categorizes them again
depending on what time of the day you
use the application you can swipe to get
to them very quickly the best part is
nine cards lays over top of your current
launcher so you don't have to give up
anything to use it it's free and it's
kind of cool whip video stream is a
nifty Android application and Google
Chrome extension that allows you to
stream local videos to your TV through
the chromecast yes there are apps out
there that do this already but the more
the merrier I always say they claim to
fame is the ability to stream videos in
some formats up to 1080p and it's
available on both computers and mobile
devices so far it's received solid
reviews and rocks a 4.2 rating in the
Google Play Store also it's free so you
can go get it whenever you want last up
this week is frequency frequency is kind
of what would happen if you took
internet video RSS and crossbred them
into an application the app lets you
find various video feeds from a whole
bunch of sources and kind of create your
own little video channel from those
feeds it has YouTube The Wall Street
Journal and many other widely popular
and highly regarded video sources it's
not just news as you can get anything
from epic FAIL videos to cat videos as
well it's free to try so why not
download it now as always you don't have
to wait for the Google Play weekly show
