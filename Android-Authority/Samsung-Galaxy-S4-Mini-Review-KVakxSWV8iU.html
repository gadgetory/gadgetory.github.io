s4 is a fine device but maybe you think
it's a little too big maybe it does too
much or maybe you just want something
simpler
well Samsung has taken its flagship
phone and has changed it into a bunch of
different versions and now we have got
the tiniest one age Java car from
Android thority what's going on
everybody and this is the samsung galaxy
s4 mini Samsung's flagship phone has
been shrunken down but that isn't all
that's changed I will say that the
changes can be described in one key word
proportional first we'll start with this
a different form factor there's really
no way around it you're looking at a
very small device coming from the five
inch screen size of the original s4 is a
bit of a shock when you first pick this
one up but that quickly fades away when
you feel how easy the Mini is to handle
it's obviously shorter narrower a little
thinner and overall much lighter than
the s4 making it super easy to throw
around in one hand as far as the design
goes you quite literally get everything
you had in the original s4 the same
button layout same plastic build and the
same removable back with the same
features underneath it Mini is seriously
the operative word here I'm not saying
that 5-inch screen phones aren't
incredible because they are but they
have become the norm because we've
gotten used to them get a smaller phone
in your hand however and you'll be
surprised how much you missed having an
easy time with a phone such as this
everything is reachable without any
straining or any hand gymnastics it
really is an incredible feeling but of
course you lose something in this
transition we start with the display
which was unsurprisingly made smaller
all around to accommodate the change
instead of the 5-inch 1080p display of
the s4 you get a 4.3 inch screen capable
of 960 by 540 resolution and 256 PPI
it's completely understandable how much
lower inspect that many had to go but on
some level I couldn't help but think
that an extra mile moment with a 720
resolution screen would have been really
awesome nonetheless you get good
production from this Super AMOLED screen
in the saturated colors and contrast
viewing angles remain very good lowered
resolution obviously means the pixel
density gets a little bit of a drop and
it's noticeable with smaller tech
and a lack of smoothness and higher
quality games if you game or view media
on your phone obviously it would be
easier on the eyes to have a bigger
display but the s4 mini doesn't do a bad
job packing it all into this 4.3 inch
screen people often see smaller devices
and immediately think they would perform
horribly that is the case at times but
at the very least Samsung tried to make
the simplification of the galaxy s4
proportional and makes sense you get the
snapdragon 400 here the dual-core
variation of the powerful 600 that
powers the original instead of the
Adreno 320 you get the 305 and finally
you get one and a half gigabytes of
memory the scores in antutu remain
around the 15,000 mark consistently
while Epic Citadel had ultra-high
quality was able to stay afloat at
around 47 frames per second in practice
I felt like the phone performed quite
well I was able to do tasks quickly and
smoothly I installed apps while browsing
the web and multitasking consistently
with few problems when playing the
beautiful game the room lag did occur
but it happened pretty rarely
it didn't hinder from the experience
when you know how well the Snapdragon
and Adreno names fit in with good
performance you can rest assured that
despite them being toned down they still
do a great job on this small little
performer hardware is where the changes
are a little more drastic many of the
extras that were included in the s4 at
least as far as sensors are concerned
don't return in the mini so you won't be
able to do hand gestures to scroll
through web pages or gallery items or
use air view to zoom into them no I
scrolling either pretty much all of that
has been stripped away and the only real
addition that returns is the IR blaster
for controlling your TV or related
device after that you get 8 gigabytes of
on-board storage but there is a micro SD
card slot available under that back
cover voice calls worked well on my
t-mobile connection with calls coming in
clear and with no drops and incall
equalizer is available for enhancing
your call volume too I actually have a
special version of the s4 mini the duos
version capable of handling two SIM
cards it is worth mentioning that like
the original s4 there are a slew of
different versions having dual sims is
nice for you constant travellers though
a LTE version of the menu will be
available but no further information has
yet been released on it obviously you
can't put a huge battery into a small
phone body
so you get a 1,900 million barrel unit
in the s4 mini that is removable and
replaceable with the smaller screen less
intensive processing package and even a
lack of super high-speed Internet I
expected battery life to still be quite
good and for the most part it was 2
hours of playing video sucked down about
25% of the battery life so a full
rundown in this test would likely lasts
up to 7 hours general usage during the
day should be no problem for this
battery though especially with the power
saving options available the camera on
the Mini has been proportionally brought
down from the 13 megapixel shooter in
the s4 to 8 megapixels a nice way of
putting it in a nutshell however is that
this camera works about as well as the
ones found in last year's flagship
phones the app has the same interface as
before with modes and settings available
as overlays on top of a full-screen view
finder you don't get as many modes this
time around however there's no drama
shot eraser shot or dual recording best
photo and best face do return as does
HDR and panorama picture quality is
still very good with high detail and
good colour reproduction all of which
translate well into the full 1080p video
recording capabilities low-light shots
obviously take a hit but getting a
decent shot in less than ideal
situations is still possible shutter to
file speeds are pretty good so having no
lag between shots will help you quickly
get that photo you need the s4 mini does
it's big sibling proud with a more than
capable camera despite its overall
simpler and smaller outlook TouchWiz
gets smaller than the s4 mini but gets
many of the same inclusions that were
available in the original as we touched
on before the missing sensors mean that
navigation is largely classical when it
comes to apps you get essentially the
same packages watchon is therefore the
IR blaster and group play is available
if you have friends with s4 phones and
of course you get Google's own edition
of Google now as an alternative to
Samsung's S voice if you prefer
otherwise this is TouchWiz
through-and-through veterans of
Samsung's phone UI will feel right at
home with the Oubre colourful motif
despite the smaller screen this newer
version does do a better job of scaling
everything down from the mini to ensure
it isn't too bloated or feels too
crowded and on a smaller screen it is
definitely easier to handle and was
actually a little refreshing if not a
little too
miliar the s4 mini is currently on
pre-order on multiple carriers in Europe
but as yet to see any real release
information in the United States judging
on the price of the s4 mini across the
pond it is likely to be priced around
the $500 mark unlocked and so there you
have it the s4 just smaller simpler and
overall a proportionally less performing
smartphone almost everything has been
brought down to size and thus when you
see the smaller form factor you can
expect a fitting experience underneath
but what you lose in performance and
hardware is made up for in its handling
power users will probably want more out
of their OS but pretty much everyone
else will still have a good time
speedily getting things done easily in
one hand let's just face it we can get
spoiled sometimes our uber performing 5
inch 5.5 inch 6.4 inch screens with
faster performance than some laptops
well it can really all make us forget
what used to be the norm I absolutely
love it when I get a smaller phone and
realize I still have a great time with
it just like the s3 menu before it the
s4 mini really is a phone for the every
man and every woman a phone that despite
its nature can still go the distance is
refreshingly easy to handle and most of
all it works for all of the great news
