Android Authority and today we'll be
checking out mazes latest affordable
smartphones all right so before we get
started yes this is indeed a single
review of three different smartphones
the m5 the m5 s and the m5 note we've
balanced our critiques of each device
and pack them into this single review
because while there are some differences
between these models they offer very
similar overall experiences without any
further ado let's get into the review
the m5 s and m5 note follow majors
standard design language their boxy
metal slabs with deliberate antenna
lines and chamfered edges
unlike the m5 note the m5 s has plastic
top and bottom caps but the outside note
is otherwise more or less a larger
version of the m5 s overall the design
and build quality of each of these
phones is impressive given the pricing
the m5 takes a slightly different route
with it's all plastic design it's not
quite on par with the others in terms of
build quality but we found it to be the
most ergonomic of the bunch thanks to
its more extreme curbs we wish that each
of these devices had a texturized power
button like some other phones do in
order to make it easier to differentiate
between the power and volume buttons
other than that these designs are great
since these are meizu phones they
include mazes single key navigation
setup dubbed em touch what this means is
that the single tactile key on the
bottom of the phone can be tapped to go
back or press to go home for multi
tasking you just swipe up from either of
the sides and you're good to go this
setup can take a day or two to get used
to but we find ourselves preferring it
over the traditional Android layout is
it just feels more natural in practice
it's nice to see meizu also embed
fingerprint readers into the front keys
of each device they're not very fast but
they certainly get the job done and for
this price that's all you can really ask
for the displays on these units are find
the m5 notes display is 5.5 inches and
1080p whereas the m5 and m5 SS displays
our 5.2 inch and 720p the m5 and m5 s
displays lack contrast which makes
colours appear washed out the m5 s notes
display is a bit better
but it's still firmly low-end sunlight
readability is a pain across-the-board
though so you want to think twice if you
spend a lot of time outdoors
moving on to performance unfortunately
all of the models here are noticeably
slow even when doing simple tasks like
launching apps with their processor
choices - it seems like meizu is simply
clearinghouse of all parts as the
selection feels totally random these
phones are each powered by different old
low-end mediatek chips which range from
one to two years old if you're looking
for a better performance at this price
we recommend taking a look at phones
that utilize the Qualcomm Snapdragon 430
instead the m5 m5s an m5 note are all
unlocked dual SIM devices sadly none of
them include support for 4G LTE in the
United States this means if you live in
or travel to the US you'll want to look
elsewhere as you'll be stuck on 3G on
both AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile the base variants
of each of these include 16 gigabytes of
storage but you can insert a microSD
card in place of a second SIM card to
expand the storage the Untied notes
built-in speaker is the best of the
three and the m5 s's is the worst but to
be honest each produced crappy distorted
audio they'll definitely want to stick
to external audio with these phones we
were really hoping for great battery
life with these phones given their
low-end processors and low resolution
displays however even though our testing
was limited to 3g we were left
disappointed the unsigned battery life
is adequate we estimate a full day with
four and a half hours of screen on time
one connected to LTE the m5s is slightly
worse we estimate three and a half hours
of screen on time under the same
conditions but the m5 knows 4,000
milliamp hour battery left us the most
disappointed we estimate two hours of
screen on time and it was about 12 hours
of use well connected to LTE but we had
inconsistent results so take that with a
grain of salt there seems to be a bug
with system service as it drained a lot
of power in our m5 milk battery tests
hopefully made who can address this in
the future also just something to keep
in mind each of these phones includes
the older microUSB scan
but we'll let you decide whether that's
a positive or a negative
although the M side series all use
13-megapixel X to point to rear cameras
and five megapixel F 2.0 front cameras
each model delivers different results
the Mizzou m5s cameras it's somewhere in
the middle in terms of quality as you
can see the colors are overly warm and
there's a noticeable lack of contrast
the phone tends to underexpose
image too and struggles to capture both
the highlights and shadows and many
scenes
sadly the camera on the m5s performs
worse this one really struggles with
dynamic range and colors can be
incredibly inaccurate
well it's certainly possible to get a
nice photo we often found it difficult
to work with the unsaved notes camera is
better than slate but still has some
major flaws
it also has serious trouble with dynamic
range but more noticeable is how flat
and muted the colors look in most of our
sample images oddly enough it also had
trouble focusing on still objects as you
can see from some of these blurry shots
it can produce nice images though - but
again these aren't great to work with
video recording is capped off at 1080p
at 30fps on each model as you can see
from the sample clip taken with the m5
note the software can't really decide on
white balance and exposure which leaves
four abrupt shifts in color and
brightness on a positive note the camera
app is quite nice the ass Walker is a
good amount of control while still
remaining easy to use the software is
the same across all three devices the
running maze is slimey v skin on top of
android 6.0 marshmallow while slimey is
radically different from stock Android
that doesn't make it bad flemmings
design and simplified user experience is
commendable
everything seems well thought-out from
the UI colors to the special balance
between customization and practicality
we want to highlight that the core slimy
experience is great even for foreigners
however there are still some issues that
you need to be aware of since meizu
doesn't have an official relationship
with Google we use unauthorised methods
to get Google asking services on their
smartphones this means a few things some
apps like Android pay won't work
notifications can be hit or miss for
some apps like hangouts and the overall
experience can just be really quirky at
times it's also important to recognize
Mason's update strategy instead of
offering Android OS and security updates
Mazal instead updates their own slimy
skin this is an unusual at this price
but again it's something that you need
to be aware of you can now purchase the
Mizzou m5 m5 s an m5 note in China
starting at 700 un or about 100 US
dollars
there's a bunch of different variants as
you can see plus multiple color options
for each model Mizzou has once again
managed to deliver super affordable
smartphones with few compromises for its
target audience the Untied m5 s and m5
note plenty above their weight with
premium hardware polish software and
detailed additions like fingerprint
sensors however mesas offerings do
little to stand out from the competition
what we think it's great to have options
we do not recommend these devices for
Western users the global software works
poor performance and inconsistent
battery life our major drawbacks even at
$100 instead you might want to consider
Shelby's budget options or if you're in
the u.s. take a look at options directly
available through your carrier and that
will be all for this video please be
sure to give it a thumbs up if you liked
it and don't forget to subscribe if you
