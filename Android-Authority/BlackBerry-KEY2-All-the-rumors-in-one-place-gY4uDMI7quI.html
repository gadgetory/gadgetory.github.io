you left but today is for you hardcore
crack berries here's the nitty-gritty
blackberry tweeted on May 11th said the
BlackBerry key to would launch on June
7th 2018 the launch city will be New
York the tweet also confirmed that the
name of the phone is the BlackBerry key
- with the numeral 2 rather than the
name - spelled out you see the key one
was revealed last February and went on
sale in the US and Canada at the end of
May 2017 it's likely that the key two
will hit the store shelves a month or
two after the launch on June 7th but we
won't know for sure until the event no
although this device doesn't look to be
a massive upgrade over its predecessor
it will make those of us who are a dying
breed one-handed device lovers happy the
key to could sport the same 4.5 inch IPS
LCD display with a resolution of 1620 by
1080 and an aspect ratio of 3:2
the snapdragon 616 chipset is said to
power the device paired with 6 gigabytes
of RAM for comparison the key one packs
the Snapdragon 625 chipset along with
three or four gigabytes of RAM under the
hood unlike his predecessor the key to
could feature a dual camera setup on the
back with 12 and eight megapixel sensors
the battery is said to sport a 3000 360
million power battery smaller than that
of the key one was 3500 old five million
bowers other specs and features rumored
include 64 gigabytes of storage an 8
megapixel selfie snapper and a
fingerprint scanner likely embedded on
the sidebar we also expect to see a
headphone jack onboard as well as a
micro SD card slot a better speaker
would be nice as well as the one on the
key one wasn't great a better speaker
would be really nice too because the one
on the key one wasn't great but on the
software side the key 2 will run Android
reo with BlackBerry's skin right on top
which has a ton of features
these include pop-up widgets that let
you swipe up or down and hop icon to
bring up your widget of choice which is
a super easy way to access information
without having to actually open the app
then there's D Tech a security tool for
keeping an eye on your apps to make sure
nothing fishy is going on and blackberry
hub which displays all your messages
from email Facebook Twitter and so on
all in one place now let's talk rumored
design and it looks like you're gonna
get a more modern look tenna posted a
few alleged images of the BlackBerry key
2 on its website showing the device from
all angles the smartphone may have a
different keyboard than its predecessor
featuring a matte finish and a new
button in the bottom right hand corner
that seems to do something open an app
drawer maybe the keys also appear to be
larger and have a flatter look the bezel
on top looks smaller and is also covered
with glass instead of metal giving the
device a cleaner look the back has also
been redesigned featuring a dual camera
setup that doesn't stand out as much as
the key ones multi rimmed single shooter
blackberry is also ditching the metal
part of the back opting for what looks
like a fully rubberized back panel now
let's talk price but first I got to tell
you I don't expect it to be any cheaper
there's no word exactly in how much the
BlackBerry Ketu will cost but there's
always a chance blackberry will follow
the latest trend and increase the price
the smart phone sold out in just one day
in the US which could give the company
the confidence to demand more money for
its mid-range err if so we don't expect
to see the price exceed $600 especially
if the handset won't offer a lot more
than its predecessor I got to understand
something why is it that for the
hardcore crack berries that tactile
keyboard is so important is it because
it's more responsive faster more
predictive what is it because I don't
get it but then again I almost never
used a tactile keyboard let me know what
you think in the comments below or on
Twitter IT people know how this works
