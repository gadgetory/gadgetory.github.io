Authority and this is the HTC u 11 but
it's not just any ordinary HTC u 11 it's
the U 11 in solar red go back when the
agency u 11 was announced in Taiwan I
got to see all the colors up close and
personal and all the colors are amazing
in their own ways but none of them
caught my eye quite like the solar red
and at that moment I instantly knew this
was going to be my favorite color
it initially wasn't available when the U
11 first went on sale but as of a few
weeks ago you can easily get your hands
on one now directly from HTC's website I
honestly love this color and there's
nothing quite like it on any other
smartphone what really makes this color
a little more unique over the other
color options that you have for the u 11
is the way the color can shift and
change depending on the lighting or the
angle of how you're looking at it it
sort of has the chameleon paintjob vibe
so the core color the phone as the name
suggests is red obviously but if you
tilt this phone or look at it off axis
you'll see shades of yellow or gold and
it reminds me of something else that has
a lot of red and gold if this phone had
another name it could easily be dubbed
the Iron Man Edition HTC u 11
unfortunately this isn't a special
edition phone or anything it just has a
very unique color and finish but
otherwise it's no different from any
other u 11 if you're looking to pick one
up I would consider getting it in solar
red because I can guarantee you this is
a color that you won't see a lot of
people with and it's definitely going to
turn some heads I think it's awesome
what HTC is doing with the colors and
finishes on their phones and I'd really
love to see other manufacturers do
something similar because when it comes
to smartphones we could always use a
little more color but what do you guys
think about the solar red on the HTC u
11 are you a fan are you not a fan do
you care about smart phone colors at all
