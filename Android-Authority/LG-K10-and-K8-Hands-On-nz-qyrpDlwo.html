authority and we're here at CES 2017
where LG just announced the latest
additions to their mid-range K series
line up the k3 k4 k-8 and K 10 and we're
taking a closer look at both the k-8 and
K 10 just to recap these specs really
quickly the K 10 has a 1.5 gigahertz
octa-core processor a 5.3 inch IPS
display 2 gigabytes of RAM 16 gigs of
internal storage a 2,800 milliamp hour
battery and a fingerprint sensor on the
back with the k-8 you've got a 1.4
gigahertz quad-core processor a 5-inch
display one-and-a-half gig is RAM 16
gigs of storage and a 2500 milliamp hour
battery and you still have the power
button on the back but it does not
double as a fingerprint sensor like it
does on the K 10 the specs step down
respectively with the K 4 and K 3 and
you'll notice that they all come with
the now old microUSB instead of USB
type-c the software however is
up-to-date with all these phones running
Android new get out of the box with LG's
custom skin of course so it should be a
very familiar experience if you've used
any of LG's more recent smartphones they
both share the same camera with a 13
megapixel camera on the back and a 5
megapixel camera on the front but you
will get a wide angle lens on the K 10
which they adopted from LG's much higher
end phones at the b20 and g5 you also
have a removable back which will give
you access to the battery just like we
would typically expect from LG the build
quality is pretty much all plastic so I
wouldn't expect too much from the design
of these phones but for what they are it
works perfectly fine this has been a
quick first look at the new K series
smartphones from LG for more on the K 10
K a and the rest of LG's K series lineup
check us out on android for calm and
keep it tuned here to the android
authority youtube channel for the rest
of our CES 2017 coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
