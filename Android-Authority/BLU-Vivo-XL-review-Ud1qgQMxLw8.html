very nice hardware at a very low price
but with so many other affordable
smartphones how well does it stand out
this is Bailey Stein with Android
authority and you're watching our for
review of the blue vivo excel
the vivo XL is certainly one of Blues
flashier options to date with a
patterned rear finish of which is gold
on our unit well whether you like the
look will depend largely on personal
taste the glossy plastic rear and flat
matte edges combined to create an
excellent feel in the hand we did notice
that the phone scratched quite easily
during our week of use so you should
probably consider using a case
thankfully blue includes one in the box
coming to the right side of the vivo XL
you'll find the power and volume buttons
both of which are reasonably tactile
interestingly blue has switched the
multitasking and back not illuminated
capacitive keys away from the standard
layout a change which seems a bit
unnecessary what doesn't seem
unnecessary however is the vive excels
multicolored notification LED positioned
on the top left of the device there's
also a 5 megapixel front facing camera
the vive excels 5.5 inch 720p AMOLED
display looks surprisingly good despite
the lower pixel density the average user
will likely just focus on the panels
quality rather than the displays
resolution which boasts very good
contrast and punchy saturated colors
it's one of the best phone displays in
its price category resolution aside
right behind the meizu m2 note powered
by a mediatek mt6752 octa-core processor
the vive Excel offers good performance
while also having great power management
for the majority of the time the vive
excels processor and 2 gigabytes of RAM
were able to keep up with our usage with
absolutely no trouble at all however
there were also times when the phone
which is generally feel sluggish most
often when opening and switching between
many apps at once
coupled with the Mali T 7 xx the Vblock
cell is able to play virtually all
casual games and most graphically
intensive games without more than a few
framedrops although games will
definitely drop frames more frequently
than they would on more powerful devices
this is still a very respectable
GPU for mobile gamers on a tight budget
with 802 11 and Wi-Fi GPS and Bluetooth
4.0 the blue vivo XL offers the set of
connectivity options you'd expect from a
budget smartphone what you may not have
expected however is full 4G LTE support
on t-mobile and nearly full 4G LTE
support on AT&amp;amp;T we were able to test our
unit on t-mobile's extended range LTE
network
aka band 12 an experienced excellent
connectivity if you are on AT&amp;amp;T however
you may be missing out on 4G LTE
coverage in some areas most often far
outside of larger cities since the phone
lacks band 5 support on a positive note
this device is fully unlocked out of the
box with dual micro-sim support perhaps
surprisingly blue has ditched microUSB
for USB type-c with a vivo XL a change
which we welcome with open arms
although some users may view this as an
inconvenience we feel that Blue has made
a great decision to recognize the new
type C standard the rear speaker on the
vivo XL sounds alright although a slight
bump in volume and reduction of
distortion would have been great to see
however it's still about average for the
price and does do the job in most
situations
with a 3150 milliamp-hour swappable
battery the vivo XL offers a fairly
beefy battery to back it up as expected
with the 720p AMOLED display and power
efficient processor the via XL is able
to offer exceptional battery life on
average I was able to use the phone for
about 20 hours at a time with 500 of
screen on time when I started my day at
6:30 a.m. the other day the vivo XL kept
up to me until a little after 4:00 a.m.
the next day with nearly 6 hours of
screen on time as an added bonus you can
easily swap the battery if you'd like to
extend that even further in ideal
lighting conditions the vivo excels 13
megapixel rear camera with phase
detection autofocus offered average
picture quality for the price with
noticeable aliasing in some images
occasional color reproduction errors and
poor low-light abilities the camera
won't out do many of the cameras found
on more expensive devices however images
are generally very sharp and detailed
offering a respectable amount of dynamic
range the vivo excels camera app is easy
to use and even offers a professional
mode for those wishing to tweak settings
like ISO and shutter speed there's also
a variety of other modes available for
use although the tried and tested normal
will work well for most images running a
skinned version of android 5.1 lollipop
out of the box the vivo Excel software
feels very polished and much improved
from previous blue smartphones although
it does lack some staple stock Android
features like an app drawer and latch
screen notifications for all apps not
just emails and text messages and calls
the software overall seems like an
improvement in comparison to even
devices like the pure XL interestingly
the quick toggles have been completely
removed from the notification shade in
place within an Apple esque control
center many of the system UI elements
are strong deviations from stock Android
which may be disappointing for some
enthusiasts we also wanted to note that
there are a few third-party
pre-installed apps however virtually all
of them can be
installed as far as software support
goes it's difficult to say whether an
abbess will receive an update to Android
6.0 marshmallow if you are concerned
about receiving software updates this
may not be the best option for you you
can now purchase the vive excel in
either solid gold or midnight blue for
149 at Best Buy and if you're watching
this video by January 31st you can take
advantage of blues three-day $50 sale
effectively making the phone just $99 at
that price this phone is an amazing deal
for those already considering it you
will be limited to 16 gigabytes of
internal storage but do keep in mind
that you can expand that with a microSD
card up to 64 gigabytes the blue vivo XL
is an excellent option for US buyers
looking for a cheap unlocked dual SIM
device although it does have a lower
resolution 720p display allowin
processor and a mediocre camera the vivo
XL is still an excellent option
especially for the price with its AMOLED
display 4G LTE support and excellent
battery life there are definitely great
reasons to buy this phone you may also
want to consider the blue vivo 5 which
will be slightly more expensive but with
better specifications the vivo 5 won't
be released until late February however
