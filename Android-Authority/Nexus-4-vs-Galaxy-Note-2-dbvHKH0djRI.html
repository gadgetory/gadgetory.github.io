this is April in this episode I will be
comparing two super devices Google's
latest super phone the Nexus 4 and
Samsung's super phablet the Galaxy Note
2 let's find out what makes these
t-phone super and which of them is
superior to the other just by looking at
these two which one do you think is more
pocket-friendly that wasn't a difficult
question to answer huh owing to its
smaller size the Nexus 4 is definitely
the more pocketable of the two
ironically although the Galaxy Note 2 is
bigger it feels about as light as the
Nexus 4 the large build of the Galaxy
Note 2 not only earns for it the
nickname super phablet but also could
pose a challenge to those fond of
wearing tight pants both phones are
plastic which to some will always look
and feel cheap regardless of how
beautifully designed the plastic is yeah
both the Nexus 4 and Gow see Note 2 have
truly beautiful exteriors on the galaxy
note 2 as a brushed metal finish covered
with glossy coating and on the Nexus 4
is a glossy jet-black exterior these
phones look classy and elegant the front
if both phones are simple and
uncluttered on the galaxy note 2 the
front is mostly touchscreen and grey
bezels with brushed metal design
accented by the speaker grille Samsung
logo and silver front camera and the
elongated home button with silver lining
there are two capacitive buttons here
these buttons are only visible when the
phone is awake the front panel is
surrounded by a glossy silver frame
giving the Galaxy Note 2 it's
professional businesslike looks the
Nexus 4 has a simple design on the front
that to me surrounds the phone with an
air of mystery and power it's a plain
slab of black with only the speaker
grille and front camera disturbing the
peace unlike the galaxy note 2 the Nexus
4 doesn't use hardware or capacitive
buttons all navigation is done through
on-screen buttons the phone's elegance
extends even to the sides on the note 2
is a shiny silver plated plastic frame
on the Nexus 4 the frame is black
locations of ports and buttons are the
same on both phones volume rocker at the
left side headphone jack at the top
power button at the
and the microUSB port at the bottom but
there are differences to the sim tray is
on the left side of the Nexus 4 while on
the note 2 it's under the backplate also
the Nexus 4 is not shy about the two
Torx screws at its bottom side the note
2 doesn't show any of its screws yet
another difference is that the note 2
has the S Pen holder at the rightmost
end of its bottom side needless to say
the Nexus 4 has no stylus or s-pen the
brushed metal finish starting from the
front of a Galaxy Note 2 continues to
its backplate giving the phone a
metallic look although still plastic to
the touch this is a removable back cover
it's then but it's made of durable
plastic one of my gripes about this
beautiful piece of thin plastic is that
it's not hard to scratch so keep it away
from pointed or sharp objects but I do
like the idea of being able to replace
this backplate with a custom-made one or
the idea of being able to replace the
battery which is also removable as for
the Nexus 4 the simplicity and plainness
of its front is matched by the
contrasting glamour and pride on its
back panel this is made of thin glass
and serves as protective cover for the
back camera and the crystal designs
underneath the surface if you hold up
the back against the light at a certain
angle you'll see sparkling crystal
designs these two logos also appeared to
float in the air some sort of 3d
illusion being a hybrid of phone and
tablet sizes the Galaxy Note 2's display
is naturally bigger the Nexus 4 stays
within today's currently popular phone
screen size of 4.7 inches yet make no
doubt about it that this place on these
two phones are awesome but owing to the
screen technology at work one may be
more pleasing to you than the other on
the Nexus 4 is a true HD IPS plus LCD
touchscreen display showing subdued yet
more realistic colors I find this
display easier on my eyes
on the galaxy note 2 is an HD Super
AMOLED touchscreen display with its
bright saturated and enhanced colors I
particularly like the note 2's display
for watching HD videos and playing HD
games apart from more viewing space for
reading text I also like the Galaxy Note
2 smart features smart stay for example
keeps a screen awake for as long as I'm
looking at
smart rotation auto rotates the display
according to my viewing angle the Nexus
4 doesn't have any of these features
movies and videos are a joy to watch on
these two phones especially 1080p
full-hd videos which they're capable of
playing without stutter or lag images
are sharp and crisp and the respective
video players have uncluttered
interfaces though of special note are
some extra bells and whistles that
Samsung has packed into the galaxy note
2 for instance you can watch videos by
floating the video as a pop-up window on
the home screen you can watch a video in
split-screen through the multi window
feature while playing a movie you can
grab screenshots from the video without
pausing playback you can even exploit
the s-pen to preview certain parts of
the movie without having to halt
playback the Nexus 4 of course doesn't
have all that extra gravy
I wouldn't expect it to either after all
it's a pure Android device so I can only
expect it to provide me the basic stuff
both phones provide acceptable audio and
music quality both also include default
music players that include presets multi
band equalizers and sound filters and
enhancements for improving audio output
yet the Galaxy Note 2 has the upper hand
here by virtue of its louder and cleaner
sound the nexus 4 sound becomes muffled
if you play audio with a phone flat on
its back
these two are among the newly unleashed
quad-core beasts of the year on the
Samsung phablet is an X's 4412 chipset
while on the Google phone is a
Snapdragon s4 apq 806 for powering the
phablet is a 3100 mAh lithium ion
battery with 16 hours of talktime the
Nexus phone runs on a 2100 lithium
polymer battery with 15 hours of
talktime that's just about an hour of
difference in published talk times still
your battery longevity will greatly
depend on how heavily you use your phone
overall performance on both phones is
good I hardly notice any lag when
scrolling between home screens launching
apps or playing HD games except for very
slight and almost negligible and
occasional jitter when scrolling
webpages the smoothness can be
attributed to jelly beans project butter
the Galaxy Note 2 runs Android 4.1 jelly
bean with TouchWiz UI while the Nexus 4
features the
latest pure Android 4.2 jellybean the
Galaxy Note 2 has more attractive
storage options on the one hand you can
get either the 8 or 16 gigabyte model of
nexus 4 and that's the only amount of
storage you'll ever get on the other
hand the note 2 lets you choose among 16
32 and 64 gigabyte models plus you can
add 64 gigabytes more through microsd
card expansion which leaves you with up
to 128 gigabytes of film storage with
that much storage on the galaxy note 2
you'll have lots of space for photos
taken by it's 8 megapixel back camera
the Nexus 4 also has an 8 megapixel
camera both phones produce crisp and
vibrant photos photo capture is fast and
instantaneous they can also capture
1080p full HD videos the Nexus 4 uses
the stock Android 4.2 camera with its
revamp viewfinder photosphere feature
and time-lapse recording feature
meanwhile the Galaxy Note 2 includes not
just the features of the Android 4.1
camera but also Samsung additions such
as burst shot best photo best face share
shot and voice enabled controls in sum
the Galaxy Note 2 is a powerful phone
filled with more features than the Nexus
4 this phone has a fast processor that
gave me a fluid experience even though
it only runs on the earlier Android 4.1
jelly bean with its wider and
eye-popping display playing HD games and
watching your favorite movies will be
perfect on this device it also overflows
with multitasking features and the 128
gigabyte storage capacity is surely
something you won't want to ignore
although not as feature filled as the
Galaxy Note 2 the Nexus 4 is still one
of the best phones in the market overall
performance is just as smooth and you
get pure Android 4.2 jelly bean since
this is a Google device the Nexus 4 will
be one of the first few devices to
receive the latest updates from Google

Samsung Galaxy Note 2 have you made your
