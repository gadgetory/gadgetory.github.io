of great flagship devices and the Xperia
Z and ZL and then they didn't forget
about the mid-range market when they
came out with the Xperia SP well they're
still not done yet because their new
tablet offering has just been released
and it just might be the best one of the
bunch hey Joshua Garth I'm Andrew
Authority what's going on everybody and
this is the sony xperia tablet z it's no
secret that sony is pretty good at
designing their many devices but it's
hard not to be impressed by the Sony
Xperia tablet Z or Zed because you've
never seen a tablet quite like this the
fully rectangular shape of the Xperia Z
smartphone makes a return in a much
larger 10-inch design it's got angular
corners and is flat all over 10-inch
tablets are like interactive slates so
it's great to see a slate design taken
quite literally in this sony tablets
what is probably most impressive is how
thin and light the tablet Z is 0.27
inches thick and only 495 grams the
result of this feat in design is quite
possibly the easiest handling tablet
ever it is really nimble and easy to
grip due to the flat sides and thinness
you may find yourself tossing this bad
boy around with one hand the way you
would a spiral notebook it's easy to
feel comfortable with the tablet that is
as in light and nimble as this aside
from the camera optics on the back you
get a completely black textured back
that doesn't slip about when in the hand
the front of this Xperia Tablet is also
completely black with only the sony logo
and front facing camera up top on the
left are all of the buttons including
the volume rockers and the iconic Xperia
metal silver power button the speaker is
comprised of two slits on the bottom of
both sides while the microUSB and
microSD slots are on the bottom covered
by small bits of plastic as you may
infer from the Xperia Z smartphone these
plastic covers only mean one thing
water resistance yes this entire 10-inch
tablet can be submerged in water and
still remain operational we've seen this
on smart phones already but for a tablet
it's pretty damn cool a great display
makes or breaks a 10-inch tablet
thankfully Sony put a pretty massive
1920 by 1200 resolution
on the Xperia tablet Z being rated at
224 PPI is very good considering this
device will typically be far enough away
from your face to make pixelation much
less of an issue though text and all
media still look wonderful nonetheless
the viewing angle issues from sony
smartphones seems to have disappeared in
this tablet which may or may not make
that much sense due to the larger screen
the Bravia Engine 2 makes a return and
it does its job to bring more contrast
and vibrancy though the color
temperature does tend to the warmer side
make no mistake though this
high-resolution display will bring loads
of fun to your Android tablet experience
with all of these Snapdragon 600 devices
hitting the market these days it might
be a bit of a disappointment to find
that the Sony Xperia Z sports only the
1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon s4 pro that
powered last year's best smartphones
thankfully this combination with the
Adreno 320 and 2 gigabytes of RAM still
holds up and is far from slow and to to
benchmark puts this tablet right around
where its smartphone counterpart stands
on the ladder pretty squarely around the
20,000 mark as you can see here Epic
Citadel looks really great and smooth
going through all its elements ending
with a very high performance rating in
practice the s4 pro definitely shows
that tried-and-true speed as the Xperia
Tablet flies through its UI admittedly
there are some intermittent moments of
lag though they are not only rare but
they do nothing to truly hinder what is
otherwise a speedy experience
multitasking what the small absent even
going at by app was as easy as ever
further proving that the Xperia tablet Z
is a great performer for everything from
media to work coupled with that great
screen it is certainly a wonderful
platform for Android gaming as well work
or play you'll get everything done in a
timely manner with this tablet not to
mention you'll do so in style Hardware
on the Xperia tablet Z is largely
standard though of course the big
advantage it has over most all other
tablets is that water resistance we
already mentioned the microSD card slot
that can help bolster the 16 or 32
gigabytes of onboard memory you've got
the typical accelerometer Bluetooth and
Wi-Fi though an LTE version is available
overseas a nice addition of a IR blaster
allows for control of TVs and related
devices
see is available here too actually so if
you take advantage of it to data
transfer capabilities or even just
utilize smart tags from time to time
then the Xperia tablet Z has you covered
the stereo speakers are side mounted
which is better than being on the rear
but the sound from this tablet is really
decent at best perhaps to help with the
water resistance the speaker's sound
decidedly held back the sound is not
particularly rich but I will say that
the volume level is quite impressive
the real gravy of the hardware
department lies in the battery it's
great to use a tablet like the Xperia
until it runs out of juice
fortunately Sony put a massive six
thousand milliamp power battery in the
tablet Z and it goes for a great deal of
time running a whole season of community
ran down the battery to half life in
just over four hours making full media
usage probably last up to eight full
hours on a complete charge with less
rigorous usage you're likely to get up
to two whole days of work and play done
with no real issues especially with the
power saving features that's really
impressive and definitely is one of the
tablet Z's best selling points compared
to its smartphone counterpart the Xperia
tablet Z does not come with a 13
megapixel camera and instead gets eight
the app does get the same elements of
superior auto and the many different
scene settings for getting that perfect
shot otherwise there are the typical
abilities like touch to focus touch to
capture and burst shots the extras do
include HDR and a sweeping panorama mode
the quality from the resulting pictures
in this camera is decent at best it
definitely does not perform as well as
the Xperia Z nzl smartphone cameras as
photos have a level of grain even in
full daylight shots and definitely more
in lower light shots the lack of a flash
diode is an obvious giveaway that the
optics on the Xperia tablet Z are much
like the cameras for pretty much any
other tablet it's there because it has
to be not because it will really blow
anyone away with its performance and
finally we have the software if you are
already familiar with the Xperia UI from
Sonia smartphones the experience here is
largely the same the darker motif of
this jellybean 4.1.2 powered UI is
complemented by colors in darker tones a
general look reminiscent of Ice Cream
Sandwich the notification drop-down is
kept on the bottom right this time and
it has some quick settings available in
the shade navigation buttons are on the
bottom left while the small apps and
remote control shortcuts are centred you
access apps via button at the top right
this time and many apps are obviously
given a split screen motif to take
advantage of the tablet screen leaving
menus on the left for content to be
displayed on the right other than these
location changes however the experience
is very much what you'd expect home
screens app drawer apps and settings
pages
all customizable by a few themes that
simply changed the color schemes the
additions include jellybean to Google
now and so new small apps much like in
the Xperia smartphones the small apps
are small overlays that go over your
current workspace and help support quick
multitasking one addition here is the
clip manager which takes an editable
screenshot Sony stables like the Walkman
are here too so even after all these
years the Walkman name still manages to
be synonymous with good music players
social life is an app that combines the
feeds of Facebook Twitter and other
social networks so you can use that if
you're into that sort of thing all in
all you get a great suite of software in
the Xperia tablet Z productivity and
media are both simple to do on such a
stylish device as a premium tablet the
Sony Xperia Z unsurprisingly comes with
a pretty hefty price tag $4.99 for the
16 gigabyte version and $5.99 for 32
gigabytes while this might be a little
steep it's simply my opinion that having
one of the more unique looking and
performing tablets in the market does
help the price make some sense and so
there you have it
sony just might have hit another home
run with this foray into the 10-inch
tablet market bringing out the best of
the Sony Xperia Z smartphone into a much
larger form factor has resulted in one
of the best-looking and best handling
tablets that are available today one
that is more than capable of work and
play when the looks alone can turn heads
and bring out the oohs and ahhs it's
really great to see that the rest of the
tablet can corner the same response for
