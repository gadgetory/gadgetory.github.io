brought to you by fresh books so to
start off one of you wanted proof that
at one time it may have been a long time
ago like when grunge rock was all the
rage that I had hair so most of the
questions you guys have asked have
already been answered in the first you
know five fun facts about Jase that I
did over a year ago
that'll be annotated here at the end of
today's show but I thought I'd answer
some questions that I get fairly often
that I don't normally get to answer when
I'm doing tech news how old are you 42
going on 12 was pudding so good so we
really have to get to what is probably
one of the most common comments about me
personally and that is my voice yes this
is really my voice it's not a put-on
voice it's not artificial it's how I
speak it's how I've spoken for a long
long time but it's not always how I
spoke you see I'm from a little town in
southwestern Ontario where most people
speak like this hey how's it going it's
going what's going for you it's good
right on see this way of speaking
without actually breathing it's called a
vocal fry because are they on top of
that southwestern Ontario accent is a
vocal fry and when I was in theater
school it was beat into me to properly
support my voice with breath and so over
time I just trained myself to not speak
with the right on yeah no vocal fry' but
what's happened now since I do many so
many voiceovers I think what's happened
is that I'm overcompensating and I'm
adding way too much breath to it and so
it sounds wispy and and whispering so
I'm aware of it I'm working on it it's
just hard because I'm so accustomed to
it and I don't actually hear the
excessive breath but I'm working on it
what nationality is your family well
it's really a mix my wife is from China
Hong Kong specifically and I grew up
here and obviously our kids are a mix
so but if you look under the surface
it's even more diverse than that my wife
is a mix of Hakka and Han Chinese those
are two different Chinese ethnicities
and I'm a mix of European descent
Chinese German polish Scottish and some
Aboriginal my dad is 1/2 or 1/4
Aboriginal something like that so it's a
mix why do you read so many books I love
books as a kid I wasn't a big reader so
I didn't read pretty much at all when I
was a kid but when I moved out of my
house and I got some Joe jobs somewhere
I had many many hours to read as a
security guard and on the subway going
to and from work so I was consuming
books at a veracious rate because that's
all I could do at the time you know my
favorite book that I've recommended the
most is the war of art I talked about
that in the last bio show go check that
out do yourself a favor
if you ever want to do any work that's
meaningful or anything you know like
start a charity lose weight do anything
that's difficult
check out the war of art by Steven
Pressfield it has nothing to do with war
and very little to do with art and
everything to do with just making a
change in the world and doing great
things great book so the question of how
did I join Android Authority was
answered in the first bio show but it's
a question I get so often that I thought
I would answer here again for all the
new people because last time I did this
question we were much much smaller so it
was a process and it was a process of
demonstrating to and her authority that
I knew how to build an audience keep
their attention know what I'm talking
about and build quality content on a
schedule ok so that know that by a
certain deadline I'm gonna get that show
out now I'm not always perfect it's hard
it's hard to put stuff happens right
life happens and it gets in the way but
relatively speaking you need to get that
content on a regular basis and so if you
have had your own channel if you work
somewhere else for free or internship
for my internship in my late 30s I was
interning ship at xda-developers TV ok
it was really an internship because I
got pennies it was less than minimum
wage for many hours that I put in there
so but that got the attention of Android
thority and you know auditioned the
Nexus 5 video the FIR
Nexus 5 video on this channel was my
audition and you know they liked it I
made some mistakes but they decided to
keep me thank goodness and you know here
we are we're growing a big audience that
loves tech but the moral of the story is
to start small I mean I started 12 years
ago with a blog called the Tao of dad no
one read it virtually right but I got
the experience on how to build an
audience on a blog and eventually I
started my own YouTube channel that had
a moderate success like 8,000 subs or
something but that got the attention of
another channel and I kept building up
and building up until I got to where I
am now there you go so I also got a
number of questions regarding the future
of Android authority and my show
specifically and the YouTube channel
well I can't speak for all of and/or
authority but I can speak to my own
contribution it can't be overstated I
know you guys hear it most of you are
young and perhaps you take new media and
the Internet for granted but the
Internet has nucular
bombed the media industry I mean
everything from television to movies to
music you name it is just lost I mean
they do know how to make money in
sustainable ethical ways at least not
nearly as much as they did in the 90s
where you know media companies were just
breaking it in so everyone is still
learning trying to figure it out what
works and what doesn't what's ethical
what's not what's sustainable what's not
but I can tell you I am extremely
excited about it because whoever wins is
gonna have a major major impact and
hopefully the people who win are ethical
enough to have a positive impact and
will be responsible with the voice that
they get because the new media companies
like vice media BuzzFeed Vox media you
know most of you don't even know who Vox
is but you know their blogs SB Nation
polygons the verge is all owned by Vox
media and these companies are worth over
like a billion dollar valuations
I know vice media and BuzzFeed are worth
more than a billion dollars and these
were digital first companies
right now Android authority isn't there
yet but we're growing and we're working
hard and we have a fantastic team so
exactly where we're going I don't know
but we're going we're moving we're
working hard if you were in our slack
chat room I mean it just constantly
abuzz with activity and we love what
we're doing and so we're trying our best
