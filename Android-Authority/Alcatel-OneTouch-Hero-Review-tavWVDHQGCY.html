here oh is a great looking device the
screen is bright colorful 1080p
resolution 13 megapixel cameras and one
of the best battery life you can find on
a phone it also has dual SIM slots but
to achieve the price point at $400
sometimes cutting corners are required
now do these decisions affect the
overall experience
well I'm Kevin the tech ninja and we're
about to find out let's begin with the
aesthetics the hero is a large phone in
more ways than once this phone remind
you of the note 3 the size the weight
and also some of the features the hero
is made from soft touch plastic
construction the power button and volume
rocker is located on the right hand side
of the device and that is beneath the
SIM slot on the top of the device there
is a port for the headphone jack and on
the opposite side there is a micro SD
card slot on the back of the device we
have the 13 megapixel camera flash and
the port for the magic flip cover more
on that soon the stylus and also the
speaker grille are on the back as well
the construction of the hero feels ok
it's plastic but not glossy slippery
plastic that is found with other phones
rather it's a matte soft touch plastic
as cliche as it sounds this material is
also a fingerprint magnet
Alcatel found a way to fit such a large
screen on a small device comparing it to
the note 3 yes again I'm sorry
it's 1.4 millimeters wider but the
screen is a whole point 0-3 inches
bigger which is impressive to see the
1080p screen is bright with vivid colors
and the 6 inch screen almost golds bezel
2 bezel the panel is smooth so your
finger easily slides around it and at
367 PPI it delivers a crisp image the
color reproduction is accurate it
doesn't have that over saturation that
you see with some phones to portray a
beautiful image this phone actually does
have a beautiful image and it looks
natural the display melts into the
device since the bezels are so small and
there isn't much else on the front of
device so when looking at a black image
it's hard to tell where the screen ends
or where the bezels begin it's one of
those nice features that you really need
to see in person to really appreciate it
the device also has some good weight
behind it it weighs in at 6.25 ounces
when holding the phone in your pocket or
you hold it in your hand it has some
weight to it you can really tell that
it's there the speakers are located on
the back of the device so when watching
a movie or playing a game in landscape
my hands cover the speakers this is a
common issue on many devices and it
makes me wonder how much better with
these speakers be on the front
regardless the speakers can get really
loud and they remain crisp and clear
throughout the whole experience even at
the max levels calls and the phones
sound really good as well the
speakerphone although it sounds a little
tinny for my liking is still very
suitable when doing a few test calls the
people I were talking to on the phone
told me that I sounded pretty good and
nothing sounded out of the ordinary
under the hood is running a mediatek
quad-core processor at 1.5 gigahertz and
it also has 2 gigabytes of RAM the
mediatek quad core processor struggles
to keep the OS running smoothly simply
flipping through the home screens you
can easily see some of the shutters this
also happens when using in a tense
application or game it's not unusable
and it may not be noticeable to all
users
but for enthusiasts who has used a newer
phone you can definitely tell the
difference this also applies to
multitasking a touch slower that I like
it to be but still performs all the
actions you throw at it as we all know
megapixels are not the end-all be-all
when it comes to cameras the chips and
the optics are equally if not more
important when it comes to image quality
the 13 megapixel camera on a hero comes
out with very detailed images at times
the camera images appears to be a bit
soft but overall the images are good
enough to leave you satisfied the
software the camera is very basic to use
there are a few different presets like
HDR panorama smile night in sport and
also for the camera lousiest out there
under the hood there are some advanced
options to get even more control like
ISO levels exposure compensation timer
and also resolution size they're not any
features built in the camera that are
groundbreaking or changes the way you
take pictures but overall the cameras
suite is serviceable and you have more
than enough settings to grab the perfect
shot you're truly looking for the hero
pax one more surprise and that's the
included magic flip cover on the back of
the device you'll notice a few holes
with metal inserts in them this is where
the magic flip covers connect to it this
flip cover serves a few different
purposes first it protects your device
from dust accidental drops or scratches
on the screen also it's a smart cover so
when opening the flap the screen turns
on and when closing it it turns off the
last purpose is the most unique the flip
cover has LEDs built into the case if
you have a notification on your device
then it shows on your flip cover it is
an elegant way to show your displays and
it also saves battery there's no need to
turn on the screen since the
notification lights up the magic cover
which uses low power the magic cover is
a great idea and it works well I wish it
was more customizable but for what it is
it's a welcome addition it's something I
use often there are times that the cover
comes off the device because it's just
using a light magnet
hang on to it and I also wish that it
was more customizable to pick what type
of notifications for example if you use
a third-party Twitter application that
notification does not come to the Smart
Cover the hero comes packed with a large
3400 mAh battery the battery was able to
last a full day of 16 hours with around
5 hours of on-screen time and this was a
full day of heavy use
we have Bluetooth like gaming web
surfing and tons of hangout messages the
best case scenario with mostly Wi-Fi
connectivity and light use will be 3
days with about an hour of on-screen
time now this is comparable to the
latest flagship phones that have just
came out from Samsung and also HTC so
right there it's neck-and-neck with all
the big dogs the OneTouch hero also has
slots for two micro SIM cards the dual
SIM card software works well and allows
you to easily switch and manage both sim
cards independently so if you travel
often this may be a feature that can
persuade you to get this phone you can
have both SIM cards right in your phone
at the same time so no matter where
you're at you can still have service
without fumbling around and replacing
cards the hero is running Android 4.2.2
jelly bean it's a heavily modified
version of the software and it closely
resembles TouchWiz the way the
homescreen works the app drawer the feel
the transitions and pretty much
everything is similar the lockscreen
also allows for quick access to the
camera phone and messages they even have
their own application store that houses
about 20 different applications
there's no applications that are housed
in there that will change the way we use
our phone or that will change the rating
of this review but it's still nice to
have alternatives all in all the
software is fine and it's serviceable
but a little bit of me wishes we had a
stock Android alternative price
considering the Alcatel OneTouch hero as
a solid phone the 1080p resolution
screen that goes pretty much bezel to
bezel is a beauty that loud and clear
speakers the magic flip cover and the
dual SIM slots has the pedigree to be a
game-changing phone however the engine
that runs it all is somewhat of a
disappointment and it really really
hurts the overall value of the phone if
you can honestly look past at shutters
in the time it takes to go between
applications and this phone is still a
great Buy and it rivals phones like the
note 3 that's almost double the price
and it actually outperforms it in some
of the categories at the end of the day
the Alcatel OneTouch hero is the best
large screen phone for under $400 and
this completes my review of the Alcatel
OneTouch hero now if you liked what you
saw thus far you want to know more
information make sure you check out the
description below because I have the
written companion piece that goes into
things in a little more detail I talked
about the stylus and a few other things
that I did not mention in the video
review and as always guys my name is

youtube and on google+ and this is
