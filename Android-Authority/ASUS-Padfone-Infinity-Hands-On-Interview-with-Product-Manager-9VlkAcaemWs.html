gentleman named eh who works with ASUS
out of the headquarters in Taipei there

it's a good i think it's a good
experience much better even much better
than perform to ya ghous movement yeah
sonia 1280 by 800 for the platform to
was yes yes I see yes so and tell us
about the improvements over the PadFone
12 the padfone 2 to what we have today
yes remember the first padfone it was
very fat yes had a very low resolution
screen yes heavy yes yes just explain
where we are today how big of an
improvement are we looking at right now
for from papam to to pebble infinity yes
ok so first one the big improvement is a
talk about the whole ship whole stack of
the whole ship and the peplum to is a
circle and the Padfone infinity we will
change to the metal the back cover
change to let Michael and
the second one is the new feature for
our home screen ok it's its new feature
and another one is voice agent voice
agent yes this one you're working on a
lot of software yes yes yes we woke up
out of songs over and here user can
choose all kinds of what we call home
page yep he can customize their home
page when you maybe go to the office you
can choose walk when you go back to home
you can choose asus and when you want to
play something you can choose
entertainment very nice yes how large is
the battery in the Padfone infinity ok
the path the battery capacity is to 2400
and the battery in path station is 1500
5850 1,500 1,500 yes 1,500 ok so
together we're looking at 3900 yes ok
not bad not bad it's pretty good there's
nothing in here at all really except for
just to display this appears to be a
plastic type material yes this would be
a speaker here yes now for the back the
Padfone infinity we're only going to be
looking at a hspa+ variant right ya know
we are we will have LTE version will
have an LC yeah so we have a LED version
so when do we think that this will be
going to market I sing I'm April in
April yes you know talked about the
price for us oh like a lot Johnny said
in conference is 819 sorry night 999
Europe not her nine euros yes it has a
very premium price we are sent es es se
but considering technology 1080p display
in both yes and a front camera is to
make up is 0 and on the rear
13-megapixel right yes that's right epic
hammer i study make up a cell with 2.0
dance yes it's very good dance so what
kind of consumer you think would want to
have a bad
I sing the consumer who like innovation
product yeah would like to buy our
product and and the one is if we want a
big screen yeah for example I show you a
picture the smartphone's screen is too
small for you to look so you can plug
into the pay station and share with
others ensure with your old friend or
your family yes very fast we are very
very dispersion the DDS is our product
product pretty proud on this technology
you should be proud it's very innovative
yes and so do we when when do we think
we will go and sale in North America
will it be going on sale in North
America we are planing but right now we
have no I'm not sure yes yeah we know
we're not sure so what is the battery
life when it is all connected it's
similar to most of us around 10 hours 8
hours a night a smartphone for Sri to
talk about it so around night on NYE
hours but when you plug into the
PlayStation 3 times we change to 27
hours okay brain interesting yes yes so
where can we go from here how much
thinner can the PadFone get can you get
much thinner can you talk about some of
the innovation you have in mind for the
future in the future yeah mmm what can
you do to make it better I think we
could improve the battery or density
energy density that's right to see a
thing to get a thinner battery to get
the finger perform and pay station so
this is you said eight point six
millimeters I believe put the phone for
the phone yes a poll knife so I sorry
8.9 knife I a point nine millimeter and
how thick is the base station itself oh
this this is a 10.5 10.5 10.5 bad not
bad and it has expandable memory in the
phone can be expanded as well yes yes
yes and so what what memory capacities
are going to go and sale oh I think will
be two options 32 gigabyte and 64
gigabytes and you can also have a
microSD so you know we don't have my
clothes ready IM is there are you
you have a memory export in here as well
or you can plug we we support USB host
okay yes people can have it extend
extend a memory very interesting okay
yes I'm really excited about this is the
third version you know so yes one yet
yes it's packing all the latest
technology of all the most competitive
smartphones on the market right now yes
Snapdragon 600 yes all you have to do is
get the price down I'd do my best yes I
would do my best yeah talk to Johnny ok
no problem well I just want to say thank
you very much for your time for shedding
some light on that ok a lot of people in
our audience you know they're very very
excited about the PadFone yes it did
remain too expensive for a lot of people
at around the nine hundred dollar price
point I know we will try to get the path
station wrightstown that's right another
question that we've been asked to
previously there was the dongle at the
bottom yes or potential what we thought
it could work with was the keyboard
similar to the transformer Phineas but I
don't think that's there anymore is it
because we want to use bluetooth
keyboard bluetooth keyboard yes yes yes
I think using my bluetooth keyboard oh
yeah for sure inexpensively true yes
very very good maybe you can send us an
early one so we can do a nice review and
maybe we can have a giveaway for our
visitors and yeah sure yes I hope so to
hold that ok well thank you very much
for your time th ok thank you my real
pleasure yes Sandra authority we know a
lot of you guys are looking for
innovation and there's a lot of
innovation coming from asus and i'm from
android and we really have to commend
asus4 continue to push the envelope they
faced a lot of flak from the FCC and
from a lot of the carriers you don't
like the idea of consumers having only
one device that they can share their
data connection with and so we have to
take our hats off to them you say thank
you very much for trying to innovate ok
for consumers thank you thank you say
thank you thank you all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
