compact it's the smaller version of the
regular XZ one but it doesn't skimp out
on the spec sheet and for the most part
offers the same experience as the XZ one
with very few compromises the phone
features the same hardware the same
specs the same camera and the same
software there are however some key
differences between the XE one compact
and the standard XE one the most obvious
one being the phone size and its design
the XZ 1 compact has a flatter more boxy
and rectangular design and has a closer
resemblance to older Sony phones whereas
the standard XZ 1 while still a
rectangular slab overall featured more
aggressive tapers and curves the other
difference is in the phone's build
materials while the standard XE one has
an all-metal body the XE one compact
switches that out for mostly plastic but
it does have some metal on the top and
bottom portions of the phone
despite the plastic build the phone
doesn't feel cheap in the hand and it
has a satin like finish so it's not
slippery at all and doesn't attract any
fingerprints it's not the prettiest or
most forward-looking design but if you
like Sony smartphone designs you're
probably not going to have any
complaints about it the main attraction
to the XE one compact or any of the
previous smartphones from the compact
line is the smaller size and compared to
every other smartphone released in 2017
this thing feels extremely tiny even
with the chunky bezels after using so
many large smartphones it's always kind
of refreshing to go back to the phone
that fits so easily in the palm of your
hand and it's nice to be able to reach
every corner of the screen without
having to awkwardly shuffle the phone
around or use two hands a smaller phone
obviously means the screen is going to
be a lot smaller and that's one of the
downsides of using the XE one compact at
least when it comes to media consumption
purposes watching YouTube videos and
playing games can feel a little bit
cramped since you don't have a whole lot
of screen real estate to work with it's
a four point six inch LCD which is a
little over a half an inch smaller than
B standard xz1 and the screen resolution
has been dropped down from 1080p to 720p
after using a lot of quad HD displays I
can definitely see a difference but 720p
resolution works perfectly fine on the
smaller screen it's sharp enough that
reading text or browsing the web is
still a comfortable experience
and the overall quality of the screen is
pretty good it has good viewing angles
vibrant colors and Sony software lets
you tweak the saturation contrast and
white balance to how you want the screen
to look everything else on the XZ 1
compact is pretty much identical to the
regular XE wan for starters there's a
three and a half millimeter headphone
jacks so no adapters required here and
like many other Sony phones their
support for Sony's proprietary audio
technology that will upscale compress
music codecs to give you a closer to
high-res sound and you have support for
other high res audio codecs like flak
and L DAC the phone also comes with
front-facing stereo speakers so while
the top and bottom chin are pretty big
they at least have a purpose
they sound pretty clean without any
distortion I just wish they were a tad
louder because they sound pretty quiet
for front-facing speakers but it's still
nice to have a stereo pair especially on
such a small phone there's 32 gigabytes
of storage onboard and a micro SD card
slot for extra storage and like most
phones in 2017 its IP 68 certified
against water and dust there's a
fingerprint sensor embedded in the side
mounted power key but just like every
other Sony phone released in the last
few years this function isn't available
on US models so your only means of
security is either through a pattern or
pin the guts of the xz1 compact is your
typical 2017 flagship specs with the
snapdragon 835 processor and 4 gigabytes
of RAM and as expected the phone
performs very well in daily use it's
fluid and responsive it's fast to load
apps and play games and the 720p display
probably helps out quite a bit with the
phone's performance as well since
there's less strain on the processor
even though the XE one compact is
smaller than the XZ one it still has the
same size 2700 milliamp hour battery but
battery life is significantly better and
this is again because of that 720p
display the XE one compact easily last
me two days regardless of how light or
how heavy I use the phone and screen on
time was always a pretty consistent 5 to
6 hours which is pretty impressive for a
phone this small and a battery of this
size even though the phone has a plastic
body there's no wireless charging but
you do have these standard quick charge
3.0 for fast top offs or Phillips with
the exception of the front-facing camera
the camera experience on the XZ 1 Compaq
is pretty much identical to the xz1 it
has the same 19 megapixel Exmor sensor
on the back with five axis image
stabilization 4k video recording and
slow-motion video at 960 frames per
second the front-facing camera is lower
resolution at 8 megapixels instead of
the 13 that's on the XZ 1 but it's still
perfectly fine for taking selfies and
it's a wide angle so it's easy to fit
more into the frame but there is some
slight barrel distortion along the edges
sony dubs the rear camera motion eye
because it can predictably capture
unexpected motion and the way it works
is pretty simple when the camera detects
any motion such as a person running or a
moving car while you're taking a photo
the camera will automatically take a few
photos on top of the one that you take
yourself and from that point you can
pick which one looks best it's really
helpful when you're trying to quickly
capture that perfect moment and having
several photos to pick from certainly
increases your odds of doing that the
other standout feature with this camera
is the new 3d scanning capabilities and
if you saw the EXCI one review you
already know how well this works you can
scan people's faces food or anything you
want really and currently these scans
can be used as wallpapers turn into gifs
and share to social media and the scans
are very very accurate and detailed as
long as you do them in well-lit areas
the scans can also be printed off
through a 3d printer or you can order a
print of your scan through the 3d
creator app from shapeways or sculpt
Theo which are a couple of companies
that Sony has partnered with the same
camera and same image processing also
means the same image quality it's a
decent camera and you can get some
pretty nice looking shots out of it in
good lighting with pleasant looking
colors and good detail but dynamic range
is really lacking especially in the
shadows not having optical image
stabilization really hurts the image
quality and low-light photos don't look
quite as sharp as they could be and they
look overly processed that noise and
artifacting is extremely noticeable on
the software side of things the XZ one
compact runs Android 8.0 Oreo out of the
box and most if not all the features of
Oreo remain intact like notification
dots native picture and picture improved
visual tweaks better auto fill API etc
and it has Sony's usual skin on top of
Android but the experience is pretty
close to stock
so nice skin does feel slightly outdated
in some aspects like the app drawer for
example is still open with a button in
the dock instead of a swipe up but you
do get some nice features from Sony like
customizable themes and PlayStation
integration and the phone is pretty free
of bloatware aside from the typical
suite of Sony apps the Xperia XE one
compact starts at $600 unlocked and is
available through retailers like Best
Buy or Amazon and you're probably
thinking $600 sounds pretty steep and
comparatively it is when you can get
phones for equal or lesser price that
offer more for the money what it really
boils down to is how much you value
one-handed usability and there's not a
lot of phones out there that offer the
power of the XE one compact in the small
form factor after all there are people
out there who still want a powerful
Android phone that isn't massive in size
so if the XE one compact fulfills your
wants and needs in an Android phone the
$600 could be worth your investment so
