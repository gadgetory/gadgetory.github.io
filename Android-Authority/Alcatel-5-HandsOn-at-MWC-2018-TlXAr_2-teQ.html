on everybody and we're here hanging out
without cuts all taking a look at one of
five of their phones that they are
announcing here at MWC now we have the
Alcatel five here which is the most
premium of all of them and like the rest
of the devices that comes with an 18 by
9 full view display as they call it and
it has this brushed metal design on the
back that makes it feel quite premium
now we did take a look at this phone
back at CES and it does have a nice
looking screen that has a little bit
less bezel on the bottom and a little
bit more up top it makes for a pretty
unique look the screen to body ratio is
seventy seven point four percent and
overall it just feels like the most
premium one of the bunch because it is
let's get some of the specs out of the
way you have 32 gigabytes of on-board
storage and three gigabytes of RAM in
the most premium version of that but
there is a SD card slots so you're able
to expand all of that storage now the
main story with the Alcatel 5 is the
camera well you have is a dual lens
system on the front one of which is a
wide-angle view and one cool thing about
this which we weren't really able to
test in our time with the phone is the
camera is able to detect when three
people come into frame and then
automatically move to the wide-angle
view of course you could just hit the
mode button and then you'll be able to
do a wide-angle selfie pretty easily
these front cameras are a 13 megapixel
unit and then a 5 megapixel unit there
are also a couple of fun modes on here
including a social mode that allows you
to make things like collages or you're
able to do something like a photo booth
where it takes four photos in succession
and then puts them together so you can
do different poses in each one so round
out the specifications Alcatel 5 does
come with a MediaTek 6750 octa-core
processor and has Android nougats even
though there's going to be an update to
Android or EO at some point and finally
with the battery of a 3000 milliamp hour
battery and with the specifications we
mentioned earlier it should last for
quite a while so this is your look at
the Alcatel 5 one of many phones that
they announced here at MWC we'll take a
look at the other ones in other videos
so make sure you take a look at those
here at the android authority channel
and then head on over to andrew
authority comm for all of the best from
MWC 2018 because we are your source for
all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
