an Android tablet especially once I
cross the $500 threshold there's a
reason why the majority of Android
tablets released in the last couple of
years have been largely inexpensive ones
and we consider a dedicated tablet in
general or a dying breed it really makes
you wonder about their advantages Faison
just announced its latest Chromebooks
which now for support for full-blown
Android apps now that by itself should
make anyone question Samsung's decision
to launch its new Galaxy Tab s 3
consider that system a year and half to
release it after its predecessor it
makes us really question the value of an
Android tablet now all this kind of
makes me wonder because when you have
Windows 10 tablets out there even those
cheap Chromebooks and even the iPad pro
it really makes me wonder whether or not
we need another high-end Android tablet
before we get into every aspect about
the tab s3
I'll just get its biggest flaw out of
the way well it's not really isolated to
just the tab s3 but rather to all
Android tablets Samsung's marketing the
tab s3 for serious professionals every
by the inclusion of the s-pen and the
optional Pogo keyboard our biggest issue
is just the lack of tablet optimized
apps which scenario where the iPad pro
really shines we're not even talking
about maximizing the layouts it's more
of a problem when you're using a tablet
with the keyboard and when you've run a
certain app say like Instagram and it
can't be used in landscape so it
automatically reverts to portrait even
when you enable the orientation lock
that's begin the S Pen we're happy to
see that it's included with the purchase
the pre designed S Pen makes it feel
like they're using a pencil or a pen so
this bigger and with more substance
ensure it's been improved with even more
precious than tivity making it perfect
for graphics artists and such but
there's no palm rejection feature here
nor can you safely tough the S Pen into
the tablet when you're not using it
which means you'll need to keep an eye
on it as you can tell though it draws
its design inspiration from Samsung's
own Galaxy smartphones it's now covered
in glass with an all-metal frame since
it's glass though there's a certain
level fragility with it as well as being
a magnet for smudges and
when to clean however light bounces
beautifully off its surfaces its premium
in every way imaginable but just be
careful using it you don't want to
accidentally slip specs wise the screen
is the same as before it's a nine point
seven inch Super AMOLED display with a
resolution of 2048 by 1536 pixels it
looks good just as you'd expect but many
of the qualities have been improved for
starters it's significantly brighter at
over 416 it's ensure a clarity isn't
compromised when it's used outdoors
under direct light and even though it's
extremely saturated in ton when it's in
the adaptive mode which is a common
quality of AMOLED when you switch to the
basic display profile it results in
true-to-life more accurate color
reproduction the biggest change to
display however is that it now features
high dynamic range that bans the HDR
tech that adjusts details the contrast
and color saturation ticket videos that
cinematic vividness and it looks great
which makes it perfect for mainly media
consumption that's also aided by 2 quad
speakers which are tuned by a kg by
Harman nothing line now that it has
those quad speakers it gives it more of
a stereo effect but it still sounds kind
of weaker than the speakers found in the
iPad pro as for the rest of the tablet
there's a 13 megapixel rear camera that
supplies us with its quality a
snapdragon 820 processor and 4 gigabytes
of RAM handle most things but it can
still stumble when juggling more
processor intensive stuff
and while Samsung's interface running on
top of Android 7.0 and nougat is cleaner
looking there's really something new we
haven't seen before the S Pen features
in particular are still similar to what
we've seen with the note series
including the screen off memo feature
that allows us to quickly jot down notes
when the displays off in a gaming
department it excels thanks to the
Vulcan graphics API engine so gamers
will especially like its performance
it's quite clear that a tab as the Rays
largely competing against the iPad pro
from a price standpoint it undercuts its
rival with its starting price of $600
with 32 gigabytes of internal storage
which of course can be supplemented with
a micro SD card and that price includes
the s-pen whereas with the iPad pro it's
an
additional $100 cost so when it comes to
price Samsung definitely has the
advantage but that's where it ends by
comparison you can get nearly the same
experience on other cheaper Android
tablets compared to the iPad pro the tab
s3 simply lacks the necessary tablet
friendly apps that makes the iPad pro
more attractive and then there are other
things like Windows 10 tablets and
Chromebooks
for a little bit more you can get a
full-blown Windows 10 tablet which will
offer more versatility in terms of
productivity so until we see Android get
a proper treatment when it comes to
focusing more on tablet optimized apps
it's going to be tough fertile for the
Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 and there you go
guys that is a review of the Samsung
Galaxy Tab has three beautiful display
updated design it's great that it has
the s-pen but the pricing and when you
look at Android tablets in general it's
still a tough call so if you guys want
more more about the Samsung Galaxy Tab
