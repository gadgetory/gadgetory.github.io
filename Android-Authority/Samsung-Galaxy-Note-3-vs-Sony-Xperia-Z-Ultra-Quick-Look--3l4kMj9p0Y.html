think it's a huge device but it's not
the biggest dog in the yard hey it's
Josh of agar from Android authority
what's going on everybody and this is a
quick look at the Samsung Galaxy Note 3
versus the Sony Xperia Z ultra as you
can plainly see here in this image the
Sony Xperia Z ultra actually somewhat
Dwarfs the note 3 and is closer to the
tablet form factor
indeed the Z ultra brings a flat profile
that gives it a black slate look and
performs very well as a tablet covered
almost completely of glass the Sony
phone comes with the signature Xperia
silver power button and is a very thin
device handling the Z ultra is a lot
easier than its size may make it look as
the thinnest and rigid sides make it
pretty easy to position this is far from
a one-hand device however as the form
factor lends itself to mostly landscape
usage compare that to the Galaxy Note 3
that is a little smaller but still
warrants to hand operation this is
primarily due to the inclusion of the
s-pen which is definitely the nodes
trump card the Galaxy Note 3 comes with
a couple great design choices of its own
as Samsung did away with the glossy
plastic that many of its products employ
and this time comes with a textured
plastic that looks and feels a lot
better
it isn't as thin as the ultra and has
more rounded look but its angles are a
little more decisive this time around
while landscape usage is definitely in
its way you'll primarily be using the
note 3 in portrait with the s-pen it's
in the screens that both of these phones
get their larger sizes the note 3 has
gotten a point 2 inch increase from its
predecessor due to salindra bezels it's
Super AMOLED display is a lot like the
galaxy s4 screen that brought great
saturation and colors only bigger
it's a great screen that continues
Samsung's display tradition the same
1080p resolution is somewhat blown up on
the Z ultra which sports a six and a
half inch triluminos display backed by
the ex reality engine it handles the
darker tones of experience Timescape UI
very well when it comes to media you get
a great experience either way even if
the Z ultra doesn't make the colors pop
out as much as a note 3 screen it still
feels like a small Sony TV in practice
both of these phones sported the same
great processing package the Snapdragon
800 clocked in at 2.2 gigahertz with the
audrina 330 employed for graphics while
the Xperia Z ultra definitely benefits
from the speed increases the note 3 does
have one more gigabyte of RAM to
compensate for all of its s-pen and
multitasking functionality
and while the 32 milliamp hour battery
of the note 3 is replaceable that 30 50
million power unit in the Z ultra is not
both do come with expandable memory
however the camera section doesn't
benefit the Z ultra that moves more
toward the tablet form it's 8 megapixel
shooter brings the nice superior auto
powered interface but doesn't have a
flash nor the many features that are
found in the Galaxy camera app the 13
megapixel shooter on the note 3 is
capable of a ton of different creative
photography modes and should support the
same great quality as the shooter in the
galaxy s4 finally in software it's
another instance of the typical
dichotomy the super robust and feature
packed TouchWiz up against a more
simplistic and classical competitor the
note 3 not only brings with it the
colorful TouchWiz look but also adds in
a ton of navigation features that the s4
had and then adds in the s-pen indeed
with the s-pen you can write notes
contextually plug information do some
scrapbooking and overall have a great
stylus experience it's an operating
system that might prove a little
overwhelming for some however contrast
this with the experienced Timescape the
user interface that keeps everything
simpler with a somewhat stock looking UI
Sony's additions of small apps and even
its own abs like the Walkman both
through what is pretty much a classical
experience and so there you have it two
of the biggest players in the game and
while one might focus on a kind of
personal assistant experience the other
is definitely one of the best big
screens available for media your
personal style might end up dictating
which one you get
but both sport there are larger sizes
supremely Aoife is winding down but stay
tuned to Android authority because were
