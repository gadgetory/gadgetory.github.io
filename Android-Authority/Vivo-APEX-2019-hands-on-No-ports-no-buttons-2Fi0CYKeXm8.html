vivo checking out the new vivo apex 2019
concept phone and this phone isn't
probably gonna hit the market it's just
a phone that's going to introduce a
bunch of new features that we actually
haven't seen in any smart phones yet so
the biggest new feature that is probably
available in this phone is the
fullscreen fingerprint reader and this
is pretty significant because on most
phones you have to put your finger on a
very specific part of the display but on
the vivo apex 20:19 you can actually
read your fingerprint on any part of the
display so whether or not you want to
read it in the center of the device read
on the top of the vise in the bottom
device it's fine there's an optical
sensor that is basically right to pull
out a display that covers the entire
display and so it shoots light up at
your finger and you can unlock it from
anywhere now the other major thing here
is that this phone has no ports and yeah
that seems kind of strange and for those
of you who are used to using USB ports
in your phone like every single phone
that exists right now that might kind of
be an issue so what they've done here
instead is use this inductive charging
port that is magnetic and so they have
this little cable that comes with the
phone that you're able to slap on the
back and then it charges in via that now
this seems a little bit strange but of
course I asked them about this and they
said this is just a concept phone so
they want to see what it's like eight
phones don't have any ports or buttons
and of course if this doesn't have any
buttons either than like how do you turn
on the phone well on the side here
you've got capacitive buttons and touch
buttons so basically you can turn up the
volume and use your power button just by
pressing the buttons here or by sliding
your finger along here no they're not
real buttons clearly there's just
capacitive sensors right below the
display right on the side here and so it
might be a little difficult if you want
to like turn up the volume in your
pocket or maybe turn on your phone in
your pocket but it makes it so you
basically don't have any ports and it's
a lot easier to make this phone like
water resistant or just a solid piece of
glass now late last year we saw the Evo
next dual display Edition which
introduced another display on the back
which allowed you to use those cameras
as a selfie camera but this year there's
no selfie camera at all and I talked to
them about this they said of course this
is just a concept and this phone isn't
going to ship so
they didn't really see it as that
important to put a selfie camera in this
phone but we might see a similar concept
come out later in this year that maybe
has a selfie camera built-in near the
top or somewhere else on the phone now
the other thing that this phone doesn't
have is any ports or gross so of course
there's no audio girl here that is not a
microphone to hear your voice when
you're talking and there's not a speaker
grill to kind of put out sound when
you're listening to music or on phone
call so what they've done here instead
is put the speaker right below the
display and surprisingly it works pretty
well it vibrates the display and sprays
sound out of the front of the display
and it gets pretty loud this is
basically a front facing speaker module
so if you really like front facing
speakers on your phone then this is
pretty cool it's overall I really think
this phone is really beautiful it is a
solid unibody display on the back and
you've just got the display on the front
it's really nice that you can unlock it
with your fingerprint anywhere on this
play and it's actually really fast
people probably make some of the best in
screen fingerprint readers that we've
seen on the market so far and they've
rapid prototype these things like crazy
this is using the latest generation of
those and it seems to work very very
well so if you want to learn more about
this phone make sure you head over to
android authority comm you've got all
the specs and details lots of photos
over there if you really love photos and
I will catch you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
