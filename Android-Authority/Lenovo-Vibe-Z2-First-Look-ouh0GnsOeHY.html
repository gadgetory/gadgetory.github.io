Authority what's going on everybody and
once again here we are here at the
Lenovo booth which is right outside we
have a sunny day here in Berlin for
Aoife 2014 but that makes my job a
little bit easier to bring you this the
Lenovo vibe z2 now this is the mid-range
offering from Lenovo that has a metal
construction on right over here that
looks really nice and has a bit of an
industrious design with the camera that
kind of pops out up top there but you
also have these hex screws that are in
there or those Torx Torx screws up there
that are really small and essentially
gives us a very industrious like you
have the lines around this metal device
right here and it looks very nice to be
honest and around the the phone it's a
rather flat you have a little bit of a
rounded edge when it comes to the back
but nonetheless it still looks quite
nice there's some more Torx screws right
there along with the the speakers that
are on the bottom now talking about the
size of the device this is a 5.5 inch
device and the 5.5 inch screen comes in
at a 720p resolution so you have a much
larger phone right here though the
resolution might be a little bit lower
than you might want for a larger screen
like this but that's alright once again
we are looking at the metal right around
the sides now taking a look at the
actual screen we're just going to kind
of throw it on right now we do have this
log screen that comes with the UI here
by Lenovo and it does look quite nice
and is pretty standard when you compare
to the ones that we've already had
before in five devices now if I sort of
go through some of the some of the
buttons around here we're just kind of
looking at some of the elements right
here
what we're looking at on the inside is a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 it is a
quad-core 1.2 gigahertz processor with
the audrina 306
but what we haven't told us that it is a
64-bit processor so you will get this
sort of future-proofed phone right here
when Android continues its evolutions
into the 64-bit game so that's pretty
nice to have on a device like this
especially one that should be pretty
affordable given its mid-range
tendencies but above all of that what we
also have here is 32 gigabytes of
storage in here which is really great
and 2 gigabytes of RAM for the
multitasking that you may need for this
particular device
but then when we talk about the cameras
we also have the 13 megapixel optics
that are right on the back and I'll take
a look at the interface in a second
right now but the front-facing camera is
an 8 megapixel shooter which is pretty
great so for all of you who really love
to take those selfies you can have a
great time with this high resolution
camera but all in all that is the Lenovo
vibe z2 we're here at the Lenovo booth
here in Aoife in Berlin it's a nice
sunny day and we have had a good time
kicking it with Lenovo to take a look at
this the x2 and their tab a safe so keep
it tuned to it for even more from
Android Authority because we are your
source for all things Eva 2014</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
