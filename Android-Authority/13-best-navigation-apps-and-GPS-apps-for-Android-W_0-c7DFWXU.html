handy the Android authority app guy and
in this quick video we're going to take
a look at the best Android navigation
apps and GPS apps first up is
backcountry navigator this is one geared
specifically toward hikers and
backpackers
it features offline map support
topographical maps and map marking so
you can track and plan your hikes
copilot is a more traditional GPS
navigation app that features
voice-guided turn-by-turn navigation and
it's also available in many countries
all over the world it also comes with
offline map support and a 3d guidance
display GPS essentials focuses a little
bit less on directions and a little more
on other stuff you can view stats like
average speed altitude distance traveled
ETA and other stats along with some
standard navigation features despite the
bland name GPS navigation is actually
pretty decent it features offline map
support although you do have to pay for
it and it features a 3d guidance screen
to help you get to your destination here
maps is a relatively new addition and
it's developed by Nokia it contains a
sleek interface offline map support and
it's available in many countries all
around the world it's also free to use
and shows you traffic info map factor is
a classic turn-by-turn navigation out
the downloads and installs maps to your
SD card for offline use it uses off
street map data which means there are
multiple countries supported and it's
totally free to use almost everyone can
remember when MapQuest was the go to
navigation site and it's still kicking
today along with navigation the app also
has live traffic updates on the fly
rerouting and it can help you find gas
stations of course Google Maps is on
this list as well it features detailed
info and over 100 million places
turn-by-turn navigation and you can
download maps for offline use if needed
although there is a 14-day limit for
that it's also frequently updated and
comes with Street View with navigation 6
is another turn-by-turn navigation app
that includes offline map support it
also contains 3d guided navigation and
it includes wikipedia support where
applicable
it comes with a 30-day free trial so you
can try it before you buy it
Polaris navigation tries to be that
all-in-one GPS solution it has access to
Google Maps OpenStreetMaps MapQuest Maps
and cycle route maps for your
convenience and it works on a waypoint
system it's also free to use siddik is
one of the more popular navigation apps
on the list it uses TomTom maps that
allows you to download
offline access if needed it also has
voice guided directions alternate routes
and even a speed limit display if you
need it many people are familiar with
TeleNav because it used to be a bundled
application on many devices it's only
available on select carriers which are
t-mobile and Sprint if I remember
correctly and it gets the job done even
if it doesn't have much polish last up
is ways and many people love ways for
the information that it provides
aside from navigation it delivers
traffic information and gas prices that
are crowd sourced and believed to be
trustworthy
there is also ETA sharing and the app is
totally free to use and that about does
it for this video folks the video likely
won't be updated but the articles
certainly will so check back there from
time to time to see what's new also if
