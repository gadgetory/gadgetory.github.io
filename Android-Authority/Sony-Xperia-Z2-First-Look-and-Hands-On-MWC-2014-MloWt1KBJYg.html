by bitdefender mobile security maybe it
didn't take too long for Sony to come
out with their new flagship device but
the update to the Xperia z1 is
definitely a welcome one and here is why
it's Josh freghar from Andhra Authority
what's going on everybody and this is
the Sony Xperia z2 Sony continues its
design language on the Xperia z2 which
does have very much the same black slate
like appearance and sleek glass services
of its predecessors the z2 is a couple
of millimeters taller than the z1 but
that is to accommodate the point two
inch extra for the display but the good
news is that Sony also managed to shave
off the phone's thickness even better it
is a little bit lighter than the rather
heavy z1 from before and thanks to the
slightly rounded edges the z2 feels very
comfortable in the hand the very rigid
design from before has been a bit toned
down and the buttons are all in their
usual position including that iconic
silver power button and the handy
shutter button down on the loop on the
other side now if you know a thing or
two about sony's flagship smartphones
you do know about the probably less
impressive viewing angles that plagued -
the first two generations of the Xperia
Z series how unfortunately that was
because of the TFT technology that they
used in the screen so we're actually
really happy to see Sony implementing a
top-of-the-line full IPS HD display on
the Xperia z2 and as you can see for
yourself right here the viewing angles
are much better and not only is the
screen better but that extra point two
inches does give you more space for your
content but even better we see that the
bezels have been shrunken down allowing
for this phone to really make it so
scream shine through the Xperia z2 is
also the first phone announced to run on
Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor which
is a tweaked version of the popular 800
and is back to by the Adreno 330 GPU and
thanks to now three gigabytes of RAM
Sony's lean Android implementation is
able to fly through its interface with
really no lag whatsoever as far as
hardware goes we have a massive 3200
milliamp hour battery that should allow
the z2 to compete with the likes of the
phablet lines in terms of battery life
the camera on the z2 has also been
greatly improved with software additions
and is now capable of shooting 4k video
there's still no oh is but you should
get some stabilization thanks to Sony
steady shot
and we'll see just how much better the
image quality has improved either as
much or even more than was found in the
z1 compact and also music buffs will
appreciate that the dual stereo speakers
also come with built-in noise canceling
technology as far as software goes
reducing an update to Sony's Timescape
or Xperia UI to the KitKat Android 4.4
and there are quite a few enhancements
in the UI including things like
adjustable white balance a double tap to
wake up the screen USB DAC support and
even a built-in answering machine but
other than that we still see that the
Xperia U eye maintains the general motif
of keeping things about a stock like as
possible while adding in a few of their
own additions Sony's own applications
make a reappearance here like the
Walkman and also do the small apps
overall this is one of the biggest
updates I prefer Sony and we can't wait
to go through all of the new stuff in
the Xperia z2 you didn't have to wait
too long for the update to Sony's
flagship smartphone but even in that
short time there are quite a few
enhancements that we could be very happy
about stay tuned for our full review of
the sony xperia z2 coming soon and stay
tuned to android authority for all of
the best coverage here at MWC in
Barcelona Spain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
