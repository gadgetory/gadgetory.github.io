those of us lucky enough to have Google
assistant on our phones get to take
advantage of a whole host of voice
commands and cool features we can search
the web start navigation open apps
change settings send texts all without
lifting a finger but whilst Google
assistant is admittedly awesome there
are still some things that can't do and
there are those people who don't have
Google assistant at all so in this video
I'm going to look at some ways you can
add more voice commands to your device
so we can turn it into freakin Jarvis
they're actually a ton of really cool
apps and settings you can tweak in order
to get more voice functionality on any
device and it's a lot easier to set up
than you might think in fact I'm going
to show you how you can get all sorts of
cool stuff working in just 10 minutes
okay Google begin a ten minute timer in
just seven minutes okay so the first and
easiest way to add more functionality to
Google assistant is just to add
shortcuts and this is very easy to do
all you need to do is to open up the
Google assistant head into the settings
and then scroll down to where it says
shortcuts and here you can add more
voice commands and then tell Google what
you wanted to do when you add them so
you can't add new functionality to
Google this way but you can just shorten
the commands you use to access that
functionality this is also a cool way to
hack Google assistant into saying some
cool stuff because you can always use
the repeat after me phrase in order to
get it to respond to different commands
however you want this is a good way to
prank friends etc that's pretty basic
though if we want to get to javis levels
of cool then we're gonna have to use two
new apps one is Tasker which you may be
familiar with and the other is auto
voice these are both paid apps but
you're only paid once and there's no
recurring fee annoyingly in order to
access the full features of auto voice
you'll need to unlock it via a separate
app store called auto apps once again
it's just a single payment and it is
fairly simple to do if you like this
kind of thing so basically Tasker is an
automation tool
and this lets you set up a whole range
of different events which act like
triggers and then tasks which the phone
carries out in response to those events
this means we can control all kinds of
different features of our device that we
don't normally have access to through
Google assistant and we can set up
Google assistant as the trigger by using
auto voice whilst those are installs
head on over to Tasker so click plus on
the profiles tab and then choose event
and plugin so in task you have profiles
and profiles or events that trigger
tasks so the event is your input your
trigger and this can be anything it can
be your device connecting to a home
network it could be it reaching a
certain time or in this case we're
listening for a third-party app by using
a plug-in and that plug-in of course is
gonna be auto voice now choose
recognized meaning that we're listening
out for when auto voice recognizes a
command and then click the pencil icon
to edit the screen that comes up this
will open up auto voice and there you're
going to choose commands and enter the
words you want to access your triggers
you can put in several and separate
those each with a comma so what some
kind of functionality we can add to
Google that it doesn't already have well
what about some kind of captain's log
this could be something that lets us
take a voice memo and it'll be a great
opportunity for us to look at how to get
quite a complex sequence of events
working from a single voice command so
for our command let's say Captain's Log
and for our response let's say listening
click the tick in the top right once
you're done and then click the back
arrow on the event edit screen of Tasker
a little pop-up will ask you to create a
new task so go ahead choose that and
give it a name let's call it captain's
log to remember in Tasker a task is the
output this is what you want your voice
command to trigger and you can choose
all sorts of different things and better
yet you can stack multiple tasks so that
you carry out a long sequence of
different processes from a single voice
command we're gonna choose a media for
our task and then record audio you need
to give your file a name I've called
mine log and then choose the maximum
size in the format
click back so now we have our first task
in captain's log but we want to add a
few more because we want to be able to
stop the audio after a few seconds so
first add another task and call it wait
and you'll find that in the task
category and then wait then set that to
10 seconds that's long enough for a
little voice memo then we're going to
add another task from the media category
and that will be of course record audio
stop so now it's starting to listen it's
waiting for 10 seconds and then it's
automatically stopping finally we're
going to add one more media task and
that's gonna be music play and here
you're gonna put the file name that you
set in the record task and the location
and that way we can hear our memo being
played back to us to make sure that it's
works and it's captured all the
information we want so ok Google asked
Auto voice Captain's Log listening
record this message for me and play it
back ok so as we can see it's actually
recorded the end of the message from
Google assistant so to improve this we
might add a wait at the start of the
tasks and we might also want to put in
like a little beep to tell us it's time
to talk but otherwise that's working
pretty well at the moment in order to
access the features we've added via
Tasker we need to ask Google to ask for
Tasker and that's kind of cumbersome
it's a bit like Chinese whispers but
luckily we already know how to create
shortcuts on Google assistant and there
are a ton of different plugins you can
get for Tasker which can give it more
functionality and which we can access
using auto voice one of the coolest ones
is wake-on-lan and I talked about this
last time wake-on-lan allows you to wake
a computer from a sleeping State and
that means we can say something like
Open Sesame and use that to boot up the
computer another cool one is join and
joined synchronizes your PC with your
Android device that has a task of plug
in as well and that means that we can
tell Google to open a web page on our PC
ok Google
open Android authority okay and whilst
it's not a task a plug in Google
assistant also works with IFTTT which
will allow you to do all sorts of things
like send messages on social media or
turn on your hue lights or set the nest
thermostat to a certain temperature but
that's something you see quite often
there are tons of tutorials out there on
that and I did say we're going to look
at some ways you could add more voice
functionality to your device without
needing Google assistant or as it
happens this is very easy all you need
to do is to go into your settings and
set Auto voice as your default assistant
this way holding down the home button
will bring up auto voice and you can use
any of the commands that we've set up or
anymore that you want to create without
having to go through Google assistants
if you want to get really advanced you
can actually make your own apps for
Google assistant but these are called
actions on Google and to get started you
can either check out the article I've
written I under the authority calm or
just open up the actions on Google
console and then there you'll see the
option to make a new app there's a ton
of different options but the simplest
ways don't require any coding basically
all you're doing is linking to a
spreadsheet on Google Drive and that
spreadsheet will have a host of
different questions and the answers you
want to give for them using this method
you can make quizzes personality tests
and flash cards for remembering things
so thanks ton for watching guys I hope
you found this video useful and
interesting if you did please leave a
like and comment down below and let me
know what voice commands you're adding
to your device and what methods you're
using to do it and well aware that there
are lots of different ways to do this so
I'd love to know what tricks you guys
know that I missed if you'd like to see
