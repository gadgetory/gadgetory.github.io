that's the pitch for the me a1 show meas
first Android one smartphone it runs
vanilla software has some pretty solid
hardware and an affordable price
this is Bailey Stein with Android
authority and let's see if this
promising smartphone really lives up to
the hype so yes it is Android one
meaning a couple of things one it's
running totally stock Android there's no
me UI here as Google handles everything
in the software from the design to the
features as you may have guessed this
makes updating the software much easier
Xiaomi has promised an update to Android
Oreo before the end of the year in
addition to regular security updates
chummy's updates to their other mio i
devices can be a bit hit or miss so this
is pretty much the xiaomi phone to have
if you care about software updates
having used me UI in the past we were at
first disoriented to you stock android
on a xiaomi phone but it's something
that we quickly got used to there are
still some things that we miss from me
UI and some we don't but we are overall
very happy with the me a ones software
experience perhaps the largest benefit
of stock android over me UI is the
slightly snappier performance with the
me a1 everything runs quite smoothly
apps launch quickly and it just overall
feels faster than what we expect at this
price hardware wise we're looking at
shammies favorite chip aka the
snapdragon 625 as well as 4 gigabytes of
ram as we expected the power-efficient
625 chip combined with the stock android
software makes for some very good
battery life
standby times were especially good so if
you're more of a passive user you should
have no trouble getting a couple of days
out of a single charge the battery
itself is three thousand eighty milliamp
hours and can be charged from zero to
100% in two hours with the included
charger that's pretty good although not
overly impressive speaking of things
that are good but not overly impressive
let's talk about the cameras the me a
ones dual camera setup is one of only a
few in this price segment with it you
get a 12 megapixel normal lens as well
as a 12 megapixel telephoto lens this
means that you can get up to two times
to kazoom without losing any quality
we've seen manufacturers type up their
cameras time and time again only to be
left disappointed when actually trying
them out thankfully the camera here
mostly left us impressed photos taken in
good lighting look great there's plenty
of detail and color reproduction is
aesthetically pleasing dynamic range
although not the best isn't too bad
either
the bundled portrait mode also does a
nice job at correctly isolating the
subject from the background in a few
cases the effect felt a bit excessive
but it's about as good as you're going
to get at this price we were really only
disappointed when taking it out at night
images taken with less than ideal
lighting lack detail and can be quite
noisy so overall this certainly isn't a
bad package it's just one that you
should manage your expectations for as
you may have expected the me a1 includes
a dual nano SIM card tray for our
American audience please note that
you'll be limited to 3G with the me a 1
as it is not intended to be used here
you can substitute one of the SIM slots
for a micro SD card up to 128 gigabytes
this is a great option to have if you
don't think that the 64 gigabytes of
internal storage will be enough for all
of your pictures videos and music in
case you're wondering yes the me a1 does
still have a 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack when you don't have headphones on
hand the bottom firing speaker can do a
nice job at giving you a fairly loud
minimally distorted sound when you'd
rather watch on a television the me a1
has you covered with an integrated IR
blaster which basically makes it a TV
remote controller we always like to see
manufacturers include this really cool
feature as for the rest of the design
what can we say we've certainly seen it
before but it's elegant and premium
nonetheless combined with a really great
build quality we're really impressed
with how Xiaomi was able to pull this
off at this price the rounded edges and
sleek side profile make it nice to hold
on the hand the dual cameras do protrude
a bit but it's no big deal the
fingerprint reader is located below and
off to the center of the cameras and is
functionally on par with others in this
segment xiaomi has opted for capacitive
navigation keys which are illuminated
and
right below the display that display is
a 5.5 inch 1080p panel and it's pretty
good overall the glass is even slightly
curved near the top which is a nice
premium touch sunlight readability is
actually really good too which is almost
never the case at this price we would
have liked to see slightly better
contrast and more accurate color
reproduction those are really our only
complaints regarding the display 15000
rupees or about $230 that's how much the
Xiaomi me a won costs for that price
you're getting what may just be the
perfect budget smartphone there's a lot
to love about the me a1 from its premium
build to its very good camera the clean
stock Android experience with promised
updates are quite attractive to sure the
design could be more original and the
camera could be better in low light but
at this price those are some very small
compromises if you're looking for a
well-rounded future proof smartphone on
a budget look no further than the Xiaomi
me a1 and that will be all for this
