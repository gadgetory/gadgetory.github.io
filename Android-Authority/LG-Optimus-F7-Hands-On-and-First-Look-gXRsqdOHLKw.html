here here so you can kind of ready tell
it's just a slightly bigger phone at 4.7
inches it is again a IPS display and
this one is actually a 720p screen with
312 PPI the screen also has quite a bit
more sharpness than its younger brother
or smaller brother whichever way you
want to put it and the performance is
still quite good you can see the Optimus
UI doing its job right there underneath
the screen there's actually a 1.5
dual-core Snapdragon s4 underneath that
provides a little bit more performance
than the f5 and really puts it kind of
on top of the F line 2 gigabytes of RAM
or inside so we're getting closer and
closer to the more high-end specs that
were kind of used to and then megapixel
cameras on the back and there is eight
gigabytes of storage built in however
which is really something that's really
nice about all of these devices that
we've been seeing the mint and the
mid-range for LG all of them come with
the micro SD slot which is really cool
so expandable memory is available on
here the battery inside of this one is
25 40 milliamp hours that's quite a bit
of capacity for display for a 4.7 inch
display for a phone like this from one
that's not 1080p resolution screen 5.5
inch all of that going a little bit more
mid-range kind of does afford you some
advantages and one of them in particular
is that it's easy to hold in the hand
unlike the 5-inch phones that were
looking at and some of the 5.5 inch
songs that we've seen at MWC this is a
really easy to hold device you kind of
see me going in and out there oh I
wonder if that's a stock phone or if
someone took that so going through the
UI here it does look really snappy that
1.5 gigahertz processor does its job so
yeah there is still a market for these
phones and definitely a lot of people
out there should take notice that phones
like this still do exist you don't have
to go for the super high-end super
expensive phones you can still get a lot
of good performance and a great
experience on Android with devices like
this the lg optimus f7 well that should
do it for us over here at the lg booth
this is Josh magar from Android
