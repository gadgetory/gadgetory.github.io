plus screen and a quad-core processor
but how well can it fit in your pocket
find out in our review hey everybody I'm
Chris look and I just lied to you only
you can tell if the ascend mate can fit
in your pocket but i can tell you pretty
much everything else let's kick off the
review with a look at the specs the
huawei ascend mate has a 6.1 inch 720p
IPS plus display it's powered by a
huawei k3v2 chipset and has a 1.5
gigahertz quad-core cpu levante GC 4000
GPU two gigs of ram and eight gigs of
internal storage expandable via microsd
looking at the cameras we have an 8
megapixel rear facing camera with 1080p
video capture and a 1 megapixel
front-facing camera with 720p video
capture providing the juice is a hefty
4050 milliamp hour battery well it's not
the most visually impressive device
we've ever seen I like the simplistic
utilitarian look of the ascend mate both
the back and sides of the device are
very grippy which is handy with a phone
this bit the ascend mate uses software
keys so the only buttons which are the
power button and volume rocker are both
located on the right side of the device
the microSD slot is located on the left
the headphone jack is on top and the USB
port is on the bottom in general the
phone feels pretty solid and the haptic
feedback feels great the display is only
720p which is a little disappointing
stretching 1280 by 720 resolution over a
6.1 inch screen gives us a pixel density
of around 240 pixels per inch which is
just ok pixilation is noticeable if you
look close but with a device this size
you probably won't be doing that too
often the IPS plus display is fairly
nice otherwise colors are well balanced
and vivid without going to the point of
over saturation black levels are good
and so is the brightness since Huawei
produces its own CPUs we weren't really
sure what to expect when it came to
benchmarks but we started with our
favorite and 22 benchmark we
the benchmark ten times and got scores
ranging from just over 15,000 to just
under fifteen thousand nine hundred the
final average score was fifteen thousand
six hundred and thirty-nine next we turn
to Epic Citadel even though the app
recently updated to add an ultra high
quality mode we weren't able to use it
probably due to the CPU somewhat older
cortex a9 architecture so we tried high
quality mode which gave us an average
frame rate of thirty seven point seven
frames per second high performance mode
slightly boosted the frame rate to an
average of forty point two frames per
second real world use proved to be very
smooth whether scrolling through the
home screens and menus or launching apps
we tried a few games and while simpler
games like the jump ran smoothly enough
the more hardware intensive real racing
3 did give it a little trouble
the Ascend mate runs Android 4.1 point2
jelly bean and is skinned with Huawei's
emotion UI which might take a little
getting used to first there's no app
drawer everything just goes on your home
screens I found this very weird at first
but got used to it after a while the UI
is super Thema bewigged ifferent
official themes built-in right out of
the box and if that's not enough you can
mix and match elements of different
themes to create your own not a whole
lot of bloatware is present just a few
social networking apps like Facebook and
Twitter and kingsoft office which
actually lets you create documents handy
the 8 megapixel camera has some nice but
standard features like panorama HDR and
burst shot modes but the pictures it
takes on all that special colors can be
either too dark or a little washed out
and low performance isn't very good but
overall they're fairly decent the 1080p
video capture is fairly nice with the
smooth 30 frames per second and fairly
crisp picture the ascend mate has two
microphones built in so your videos have
stereo sound which isn't something we
see all that often the ascent mate packs
in a whopping 4050 milliamp hour battery
so as you might expect battery life is
great with this thing the first day that
it arrived I took it out of the box and
instead of charging it up went right
into testing and benchmarking with the
battery at around eighty percent at the
end of hours of testing everything from
gaming to the camera battery life was
only down to around twenty percent using
the charger that ships with the ascend
mate enables fast charging which is
great since even with the huge battery
it charged from around 20 to 100 percent
in just a little over an hour Huawei
claims that you can get a weekend of
normal use out of the battery and that
might be a bit much but you would be
hard-pressed to not get a full day out
of it there's a lot to like about the
ascend mate and really only a few things
to dislike most of which are just a
matter of preference anyway the mate
probably won't turn huawei into an
instant success in the West but it is a
good choice for fans of big
phones if you want to know more we have
