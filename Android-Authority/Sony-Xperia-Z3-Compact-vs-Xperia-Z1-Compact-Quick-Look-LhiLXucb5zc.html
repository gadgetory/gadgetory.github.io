one more time to take a look at the sony
xperia z3 compact versus the z1 compact
in terms of design we of course have the
same compact design here with these e3
compact which actually took a lot longer
to come out when compared to the z3 and
the z2 because we did not even have a z2
compact but another interesting prospect
here is the idea that the z3 compact
actually doesn't have the z3 styling we
don't have the rounded sides and frame
and edges but instead we have a design
that is a little bit more akin to the z2
and that's something that you might
notice here but there are still some
tropes here that do make it from the z3
and you'll see it on the front of the
phone especially because those
front-facing speakers have the same type
of design to them that you have on the
z3 itself but nonetheless we have a very
nice small form factor here with 4.6
inches in the screen and that screen
comes in at 720p resolution as far as
the way it feels in the hand you'll be
able to reach everything quite easily
and it's also a little bit lighter than
the z1 compact of yesteryear which now
this phone comes in at 129 grams
underneath the surface you get the same
power that you get in the Xperia z3 and
it was the case with the Z 1 and Z 1
compact as well so it's no surprise
there now while we had the snapdragon
800 in the Sony Xperia z1 compact we now
have the 801 and the 801 here is the 2.5
gigahertz version that brings a lot of
power on top of all of the enhancements
inside of the software which still
retains that simplistic but very
minimalistic and very fast outlook with
a kind of stock Android like feel with
the Ab drawer the home screens the
notification drop-down with the quick
settings of course the small apps and
all of the sony added in applications
that include the playstation application
which if you have the z3 compact this
also just like the z3 and the z3 tablet
compact will be able to connect your
PlayStation 4 in order for you to play
games on it wirelessly streaming across
your network which we think is great
though we do kind of question whether or
not that's something you would want to
do on a screen as small as this you
might want to fight for your
position on the TV rather than opt to
have this e3 compact as your play as
your play apparatus but from there we
also have the 20 point seven megapixel
camera that does a great job of getting
the high quality photos especially for a
phone like this and the two point two
megapixel front-facing camera should be
enough for playing of your selfie games
after that we have the two 2600 milliamp
hour battery that is a small bump up
from the z1 compact but after that it
rounds out the package here as we take a
look at this difference between the
Xperia z3 compact and the z1 compact and
we do think that it is a good upgrade
and it continues the tradition that Sony
has now with the compact offering in the
Xperia line and we hope to see it even
more so as we continue on because as far
as the mini or the compact in this case
offerings go this is probably the one
that has the least compromises so keep
it tuned to Android 34 all of the best
coverage including our future review of
the Sony Xperia z3 line including this
the compact because we are your source
