we're basically rounding up at that
point but how do you even begin to talk
about six whole years I guess probably
the best way for me to talk about it is
by starting with what I try to start
everything with
gratitude
now obviously I'm really grateful that I
even have the chance to make this video
grateful for the team because how
incredible they've been and it's kind of
it's a bittersweet video for me to make
because this is my final video at
Android Authority and I wouldn't be here
and I wouldn't have gone six years at
this company had it not been for the two
people I should be regulated before the
founders of this company see six years
ago they found me just randomly when I
applied for this classified ad and sure
enough they send me a phone I reviewed
it and what I thought was going to be
one or two articles a week turned into
hundreds of videos over the course of
five plus years
but of course if we're gonna talk about
stuff I've done in my past going down
memory lane we got to talk about the
drug test which is ironic because my
drop tests in the first couple of years
got a lot of views but when I was called
by the founders to even join this
company it was when they were doing
their drops so it was like a passing of
the guard in a weird way and of course
as the video person on and wrote his
YouTube channel I had to be the one to
start dropping phones and getting some
of that pain one in three two and one
those middle years were really fun and
looking back on it there there are a
couple of things that I really miss
doing now respect to everybody on the
channel who kind of moved on to doing
these particular things so that I could
continue doing reviews and verses and
all that but I actually really miss
doing the weekly news roundup
I remember that I experimented with that
show more than pretty much any other
ones I had some pretty silly moments but
my favorite one I'm probably one of my
favorite videos throughout my career
here at Andrew Authority was one where I
was on vacation with my family but I
knew I still had to get the news roundup
done so I actually did that episode from
a bunch of different locations in Paris
and then the end of it was me cheering
everybody with a pint of beer or a pint
of Guinness at a pub in London which man
that video it always brings back
memories because that was a good
vacation but I still was able to get
work done and that was me realizing just
what kind of really fortunate job I had
and right behind me is actually the
corner of my room where I did my first
set it was a standing desk most of the
time and this is where I did a lot of my
first videos for the first like a year
or two and yeah this is kind of where it
sort of started for me and then when I
needed even more space came out here to
one of the living rooms and the house
that Idol that I grew up in and I set up
an entire set over here and now since
I've moved to my office and everything
moved to that location there's just this
couch right here not really a whole lot
to look at in this area it's just a
little bit more free now because I'm
occupying this space and then of course
you got to talk about the podcast now we
all miss the podcast I know that
everybody that used to be on the show
really misses it a lot of you fans miss
it as well but trust me no one misses it
more than I do it was something that was
really fun for us to do every single
week and it was just a time for us to
get together it might have taken a
little bit of time for us to record
those episodes but that usually led to a
really casual and a really fun podcast
but really some of those podcasts were
some of the best moments that I've had
at Andra thority because I had a bunch
of our tech friends in there a bunch of
them had a lot of collaborations where
we had people like Fisher Nicole Scott
and a bunch of our friends all together
in one room just talking about tech and
those were definitely some of the best
moments that I've ever had in this
industry
so here we are at the final destination
my office about a year ago almost to the
tee I was able to find this office space
and it's been a great place for me to
just focus on my work and get some
consistent production done I really
loved it being in a place like this
having my own space it's been awesome
and just like with any Android Authority
video we obviously want to make it count
and I want to make this one count so it
takes a little while so you basically
have followed me throughout the day just
reminiscing and whatnot and of course
the last couple of years have been just
a roller coaster ride of just a lot of
travel so many phones I've been coming
out the industry has ramped up so much
and I've just been incredibly grateful
to have been on this ride for this long
so as long as I'm sharing stories I did
want to backtrack one more time to the
times when we were celebrating every
milestone leading up to what we have now
which is almost 3.5 million subscribers
the one that sticks up the most is the
300,000 subscriber mark because that was
when my worlds were kind of colliding
here I was with my work colleagues my
bosses if you will who happened to be in
the same area when I was vacationing
with my relatives up in Canada and the
we all came together and once the
300,000 subscriber mark hit we just set
up the camera sat in front of this
amazing Filipino feast that my aunt and
uncle made and sure enough we just did a
congratulations and thank you to you
guys the audience for getting us to that
milestone obviously there's a lot that
I'm going to miss about being here and
to just give a little bit of closure to
a lot of you fans out there who have
asked a bunch of questions in the
comment sections down below I'm gonna go
and answer a couple of them right now so
we can finally set the record straight
in my final video here at Andrew
authority number one I am Filipino
number two I was not born in the
Philippines and number three I live in
California my daily driver is indeed the
BlackBerry key one I cannot wait for the
next version hopefully I'll be able to
get my hands on it and be able to do a
review in some sort of capacity but I do
also use a Google pixel to excel and as
you know I have modded it with a yellow
backing up here to cover up the glass so
it has that black and yellow just like
my shoes kind of an antiquated question
at this point
how did I come up with a salute so for
the longest time I did a salute I'll do
it one more time properly it's Joshua
regard from Andhra Authority what's
going on everybody
now that salutes kind of started around
MWC 20 16 or 15 I want to say it was
probably 2015 it might have been even
earlier than that because I've been here
for so long at this point but I just
kind of wanted to do something at the
beginning of my videos that was kind of
a signature a little bit unique perhaps
and when I thought about doing it for
one of the videos in Barcelona what came
to mind was an animation from NBA 2k
which at the time I was playing a lot
basically my my player in NBA 2k would
do something like a bow and then go like
this to the crowd at the at the
courtside before every game so that kind
of came to mind and I just kind of put
my own spin on it and it became the
salute now as far as what I'm gonna be
doing in the future it's pretty easy to
find me I'm trying to be everywhere at
once so with a name like mine that
happens to be someone unique you can
just type it into any search box or at
the end of youtube.com and of course you
have been seeing in the lower thirds for
every video for the past two to three
years our social handles and I'm gonna
bring it up one more time below if you
really want to keep some tabs on me you
can go to any social media platform and
that is my handle so have at it
and as far as Android Authority goes I
mean obviously I am friends with so many
people here I cherish so many people and
all of you here at this company and as
the audience and of course our paths are
going to cross again it's just that at
this point it's time for me to forge my
own so I guess the best way for me to
end this video is the way that I've
ended pretty much every video here at
Android authority with my final outro
and here we go thank you so much for
watching and I hope you enjoyed this
final video of mine here at Android
