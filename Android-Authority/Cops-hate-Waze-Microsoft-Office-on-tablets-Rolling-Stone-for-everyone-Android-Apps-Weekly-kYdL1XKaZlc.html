show is brought to you by E themer
launcher hello again ladies and
gentlemen I'm Joe Hindy the android
authority app guy and welcome back to
another episode of android apps weekly
ok let's jump right into some headlines
google address the webview problem this
last week they offered some advice on
how to deal with it but the bottom line
is that it's broken and that no one
should be using it ever dishes sling TV
web TV platform is now open to those who
have an invite if you don't have one
don't worry the full release is
scheduled for a few weeks law
enforcement officials are asking Google
to shut down the part of ways that lets
people track cops after two police
officers were unfortunately killed late
last week ways said that they will not
be doing any of that the marriott hotel
released an update this last week to
patch a bug that made it stupid simple
for hackers get credit card information
apparently the bug has been in the
application since its release in 2011
the former opera CEO has announced a new
web browser called Vivaldi that will
have features like integrated mail and a
whole lot more eventually the tech
preview is available right now and we'll
have that link in the video description
below if you're interested in checking
it out Rolling Stone magazine is
publishing their entire archive dating
back to nineteen sixty seven to google
play and you can access that when it's
available using the google newsstand
application spotify is running a promo
right now to give people 60 days of free
premium service this came just before
spotify announced a new partnership with
sony to create playstation music which
will eventually be replacing playstation
unlimited with only a few days left
Humble Bundle has added a few more games
to the Humble Bundle 10 sets if you want
them act fast because the sale ends at
the end of the weekend also charity
 rocks now let's take a look at
the app updates from this last week
Google search on mobile is getting a new
feature where you'll be able to view
movie information in beautiful material
design and that update is rolling out
right now Plex released an update that
included some tweaks to the UI a new
payment structure and the ability to
cast your camera roll to any flex
clients and that update is also rolling
out right now Twitter now allows direct
messaging with up to 20 people and you
can now shoot and upload clips directly
to your Twitter stream think like vine
but for twit
snapchat released a new update that
comes with a feature called discovery it
essentially lets you view snapchats from
large news sources to keep you
up-to-date on what's going on snapchat
style hotspot shield VPN released an
update that brings three new protection
modes for improved simplicity and ease
of use and that is available now in the
google play store before we get into the
new android app releases this week let's
talk very quickly about our sponsor this
week we're sponsored by e themer
launcher it is a new launcher that
boasts over 2,000 themes 200 fonts some
gesture controls and plenty of
customization options it is an earlier
release but it's a very solid and quick
experience it's totally free with no
in-app purchases so it won't cost you
anything to try it out and you can find
that link in the video description below
now let's take a look at the Android
apps that were released this week
Microsoft has released Word Excel and
PowerPoint for android tablets after a
year of hearing us complain about not
having it the basic functionality for
each application is totally free to use
but to get the full experience you'll
need an office 365 subscription so far
each application seems to work pretty
well but do keep in mind that these are
early releases and improvements are
likely right around the corner last up
this week Facebook has released a new
light application that is intended for
devices with spotty connectivity and
lesser specs the interface is very
scaled-down although it is noteworthy
that the messaging is built back into
the main app here and it's not in the
regular one so that's actually kind of a
plus otherwise it's a basic Facebook
experience without too many frills once
again I'm Joe Hindy the android
authority app guy we're here why not
subscribe to the android authority
youtube channel if you're hanging out
for a minute we have a couple of awesome
videos for you to watch right over there
and they're also linked in the video
description below for you folks on
mobile finally don't forget to check out
the written companion which is in the
video description below along with all
of the links from all the apps that we
talked about here today also this is a
