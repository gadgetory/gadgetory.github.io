authority app guy and welcome back to
another episode of android apps weekly

last week they offered some advice on
how to deal with it but the bottom line
is that it's broken and that no one

style hotspot shield VPN released an
update that brings three new protection

of use and that is available now in the
google play store before we get into the
new android app releases this week let's
talk very quickly about our sponsor this
week we're sponsored by e themer
launcher it is a new launcher that
boasts over 2,000 themes 200 fonts some
gesture controls and plenty of
customization options it is an earlier
release but it's a very solid and quick
experience it's totally free with no
in-app purchases so it won't cost you
anything to try it out and you can find
that link in the video description below
now let's take a look at the Android
apps that were released this week
Microsoft has released Word Excel and
PowerPoint for android tablets after a
year of hearing us complain about not
having it the basic functionality for
each application is totally free to use
but to get the full experience you'll
need an office 365 subscription so far
each application seems to work pretty
well but do keep in mind that these are
early releases and improvements are
likely right around the corner last up
this week Facebook has released a new
light application that is intended for
devices with spotty connectivity and
lesser specs the interface is very
scaled-down although it is noteworthy
that the messaging is built back into
the main app here and it's not in the
regular one so that's actually kind of a
plus otherwise it's a basic Facebook
experience without too many frills once
again I'm Joe Hindy the android
authority app guy we're here why not
