Android authority and it's a phone and a
camera combined into one but is it worth
the additional bulk to have some more
legitimate camera optics well let's find
out this is the samsung galaxy k zoom
when it comes to the design of the
galaxy k zoom for the most part it looks
like many other Samsung devices it's
made entirely of plastic with a fake
metal trim around the perimeter and
Samsung savings your home button with
capacitive keys below the display the
majority of the buttons and ports are in
their usual places with the 3.5
milimeter headset jack up top microUSB
on the bottom and the power button on
the right side there is also a dedicated
camera shutter key and the volume rocker
that's usually on the left side has been
moved to the right side above the power
button the left side however does house
a micro SD card slot which you'll most
likely need as degauss K zoom only has 8
gigs of internal storage
with only 5 available to the user the
back of the Galaxy K zoom is where it
starts to get interesting if you didn't
know any better you would mistake it for
a normal port and shoot camera because
that's pretty much what it looks like
but besides the camera optics which
we'll talk about more in a sec the back
of the Galaxy K zoom has the same
perforated design that we first saw on
the galaxy s5 and it's not the prettiest
thing in the world but it's a lot better
than anything else Samsung has used in
the past and it's very practical
providing a lot of grip while detracting
finger prints the back is also removable
giving you access to the battery and
your SIM card slot also in the back
located above the camera is the single
speaker and it's just another typical
average run-of-the-mill single speaker
it's nothing that's going to blow you
away but it gets the job done just fine
and being on the back means that audio
will be firing away from you but since
it's on top of the phone you don't have
to worry about accidentally covering it
with your hand when holding in portrait
on the front of the galaxy k zoom is a
4.8 inch Super AMOLED display with 720p
resolution and in today's smartphone
standard 720p is considered mid-range
but since it's on a 4.8 inch screen it's
got a pretty respectable PPI and overall
it looks as good as any other AMOLED
panel that Samsung has put out as of
late with very punchy colors great
viewing angles and it gets plenty bright
so outdoor visibility isn't an issue for
a somewhat mid-range phone the Galaxy K
zoom comes packed with some decent specs
with an Exynos hexa core processor
inside that consists of a dual-core 1.7
gigahertz cortex a15 and a quad-core 1.3
gigahertz cortex a7 2 gigs of ram and a
Mallee t6 24 GPU through day to day
usage performance has been just fine I
haven't had any issues with
responsiveness or lag whether it was
navigating through the UI swiping
scrolling opening and closing apps or
playing graphically intensive games at
all seemed just fine and I was able to
play pretty much any game I wanted
without any noticeable lag or dropped
frames so the overall experience has
actually been very pleasant now
obviously the focus and the main selling
point of the galaxy k zoom is the camera
it's a twenty point seven megapixel
sensor but unlike many smartphone
cameras the Galaxy K zoom features 10
times optical zoom optical image
stabilization and a xenon flash since
the galaxy k zoom features much more
advanced camera optics over your average
smartphone I was expecting the camera UI
to be very different from other Samsung
smartphones but that actually wasn't the
case for the most part it's exactly the
same camera interface that we've seen on
other Samsung phones like the galaxy s5
so you've got all the same options and
shooting modes from the s5 but there are
a few modes made specifically for the
zoom like the pro suggests feature that
lets you shoot with a variety of
different filters and you can even
download more from Samsung's own pro
suggests market there's even a selfie
alarm mode that will automatically take
a photo of you just by
looking at the camera because after all
who wouldn't like taking selfies with a
20 megapixel sensor as far as the image
quality goes I think the Galaxy K zoom
is capable of taking some great looking
photos with 20 megapixels there's no
shortage of detail to go around images
look very sharp with great colors and
the camera does a great job with white
balance and exposure photos tend to be
on the colder side but turning on HDR
can help you achieve a much warmer
looking shot the biggest advantage of
the camera on the Galaxy K zoom is the
10 times optical zoom meaning you can
actually zoom in on subjects without
losing detail
unlike most smartphone cameras which use
a digital zoom that usually results in
some pretty bad looking photos the
optical zoom is really nice but it's got
a variable aperture range of 3.1 to 6.3
so photos will tend to appear darker
when fully zoomed in well I think the
picture quality on the Zoom is great I
don't necessarily think it's leaps and
bounds beyond other smartphone cameras
especially with how much smartphone
optics have improved over the last
several years but if you absolutely have
to have optical zoom on your smartphone
the galaxy a zoom is probably going to
be your best bet all right so we've
talked a lot about the image quality on
the galaxy k zoom now here's just a
quick video clip so you guys can get an
idea of the video quality that you're
going to get on the galaxy k zoom and
what the audio is going to sound like
and there is a is so you do have optical
image stabilization and just as I'm
walking here and looking through the
viewfinder it seems to be doing a pretty
decent job it doesn't look too shaky but
the interesting thing about this 20
point seven megapixel sensor is that
there's no 4k recording it actually tops
out at 1080p at 60 frames per second
which is an ideal breaker necessarily
but I just thought it was interesting
interesting enough to mention but let me
go ahead and just kind of pan up to the
sky here and then we'll go ahead and pan
back down just so you can guys can see
how quickly the camera just in terms of
exposure and then I'll go ahead and do a
little zoom here just so you guys can
see how far
this lens actually zooms and you can see
it actually zooms in really far the 10
times optical zoom works really really
well but yeah this is just a quick video
clip on the Galaxy K zoom so you guys
can get an idea of the quality of the
video and the quality of the sound but
let's go ahead and jump right back into
the review the size of the battery on
the Galaxy K zoom is nothing impressive
coming in just shy of 2500 milliamp
hours which is rather small in today's
standards and the actual battery life is
even less impressive I've yet to be able
to make it through a full day with this
phone and that's just using the Galaxy K
zoom as a phone if you plan on snapping
photos all day you'll definitely have to
recharge midway throughout the day or at
least bring a spare battery with you and
for a phone that's meant to be used a
lot as a camera it's kind of
disappointing that the battery life
can't keep up on the software side the
Galaxy K zoom is running on the latest
version of Android with 4.4.2 kitkat and
the most recent version of Samsung's
TouchWiz interface on top it's the same
version of TouchWiz that we first saw on
the galaxy s5 and most of the features
like toolbox smart stay smart pause and
my magazine have made its way over to
the Galaxy K zoom but there are some
notable omissions like multi window air
gestures s-health
and the fingerprint scanner that didn't
make the cut but I don't think many
people will mind that some of these
features were left out and overall it's
practically the same experience as any
other recent Samsung device there's no
plans for the Galaxy K zoom to come to
the United States so if you want to pick
one up you'll have to go through
third-party retailers like eBay or
Amazon and I've seen the price range
between 500 to $550 it does support 3G
and LTE but if you're on t-mobile or
AT&amp;amp;T in the United States you'll be
limited to 3G only as the Galaxy K zoom
does not support t-mobile or AT&amp;amp;T LTE
bands but there you have it for the
samsung galaxy k zoom it's a phone and a
camera combined into one but there's not
really a whole lot about it that makes
it stand out as a phone it's basically a
mid
range device and as a camera it's got an
edge over other smartphones because of
its optical zoom and it takes pretty
nice photos but nothing that can't be
achieved on other high-end flagship
smartphones whether it's worth it or not
will depend on how much you have to have
optical zoom but for the most part it's
just an average phone with a slightly
above-average camera but that is it for
this review hopefully you guys enjoyed
