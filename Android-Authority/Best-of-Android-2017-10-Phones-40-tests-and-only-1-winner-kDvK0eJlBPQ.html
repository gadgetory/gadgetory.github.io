authority and i'm here to tell you which
was the best phone of 2017 now when
people talk about the best of something
that can be pretty subjective if i asked
you what is the best sports team or the
best car or the best type of music i'm
sure I would get whole load of different
answers from you guys out there so when
we've come to look at the best of
android for 2017 we're trying to be as
objective as we possibly can and to do
that we have actually devised a set of
tests that test these phones so we come
to bat flies directly measuring battery
performance when it comes to the camera
we've actually got some camera testing
equipment when it comes to audio we've
used audio equipment to test the quality
of the signals and so on now if you go
over to the and authority comm website
you're going to see all of our testing
procedures laid out there for you in
black and white and I really would
encourage you to go over and read those
so that you know that we have done the
best we can to be objective about these
tests now before we get into tests is
time to talk about our finalists the top
ten phones that we have pitted against
each other for this year's best of
Android 2017 now I'm going to list them
to you in alphabetical order based on
the OEM so we start with b4 blackberry
now the BlackBerry key one is a fairly
unique phone in this year's lineup
because of course it comes with that
physical keyboard something that
Blackberry were very much known for in
years gone by it's also got the weakest
processor in terms of the Qualcomm
lineup it uses a core comp six to five
where's all the other phones that use
cocom in this lineup have got the core
comm eight three five however it does
come with four gigs of memory it does
have a four point five inch screen with
greater than full HD resolution and of
course it's got a 12 megapixel camera
and a 3500 five
our battery next up is the Google pixel
to excel and that comes with a
snapdragon 835 4 gigabytes of RAM the
huge six inch display it's got at least
quad HD resolution a 12 megapixel camera
and a 3,500 and 20 milliamp hour battery
next up with the huawei mate 10 Pro with
its Kirin 970 processor it's the only
device in this year's lineup that
doesn't have a Qualcomm processor course
you've got the nice six inch display a
2k resolution and of course the dual
cameras a 12 megapixel camera and a 20
megapixel camera plus you've got that
nice four thousand milliamp hour battery
next comes the LG G 30 with the
snapdragon 835 got a 6 inch screens but
quad HD resolution got 4 gigabytes of
RAM it's got dual cameras and it's got a
3300 milliamp hour battery next up is 30
novo moto said to force again with the
Snapdragon HD 5 this time with 6
gigabytes of RAM 5.5 inch display quad
HD and dual cameras with a two thousand
seven thousand thirteen million power
battery it's nice to see Nokia back in
the android market and this year the
Lafayette 8 has made its way into the
finalists for the best of Android series
Nokia 8 comes with a stamp dragon III
560 bytes of ram a 5.3 inch screen quad
HD resolution and a 2 13 megapixel
cameras all backed up by a 3019 milliamp
hour battery no showdown would be
complete without the 1 + 5 t again
Snapdragon 835 8 gigabytes of memory 6
inch display greater than Full HD and
dual 16 milliseconds and then for the
power it's got a 3300 milliamp hour
battery much has been said and written
about the razor phone and it's also made
it into our top 10 finalists razor comes
with the Snapdragon 835 eight gigabytes
of memory a 5.7 inch quad HD display
dual 12 megapixel cameras and a four
thousand milliamp hour
Factory moving on to s4 samsung we've
got the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 cause that
comes with the Snapdragon 835 got six
gigabytes of RAM but the huge 6.3 inch
display got a greater than quad HD
screen resolution and you've got module
cameras and a 3300 milliamp hour battery
and the other s in our lineup is s4 Sony
the Sony Xperia x2 z1 and of course that
comes with the Snapdragon III 5 4
gigabytes of ram a 5.2 inch full HD
display and 19 megapixels single lens
camera and a 2007 with milliamp hour
battery so let's start with the display
4 of I devices this show our LCD devices
that's the Nokia 8 the BlackBerry key
one the Sony xz1 and the razor phone the
rest are all AMOLED devices now which
one offers the brightest display and of
course that's important when you want to
read the phone outside and actually it's
the Nokia 8 and the BlackBerry key one
that offered the brightest displays out
of our lot and in third place comes the
Sony Xperia X is 8 1 now when it comes
to color representation we look at the
color temperature and look at we display
we found the keynote 1 the Nokia 8 and
the LG G 30 all have the coolest types
of displays and the others are much
warmer and so once you consider all the
different parameters including the
brightness including the color
representation our testing has shown
that the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is the
winner of the display category in second
place comes the wild wave make 10 pro
and it's great to see the Nokia 8 in
third place now the quality of the audio
that comes out of our devices is
essential because if we're not speaking
then at least we're listening to music
or we're watching Netflix or YouTube or
we're playing a game and all of them
involve some kind of audio output now
the loudest phones in our roundup are
the pixel 2 XL and the Nokia 808 in
terms of noise is the razor phone which
actually had a minus 106 DB noise level
which is very very impressive however
close behind we have the Galaxy Note 8
the Nokia 8 the LG v 30 and the
pixal to excel which all achieve - 100
DBS of noise and in terms of harmonic
distortion the LGV 30 is the clear
winner then the note 8 then the key 1
and finally the huawei make 10 Pro the
devices that support the greatest range
of Bluetooth codecs are the pixel to
excel but make 10 Pro and the sony x8 1
now when you throw that all up together
including the volume of distortion and
the noise level and the codec support
these are our winners in first place
you've got the LGB 30 in second place
you've got the Google pixel to excel and
in third place you've got the huawei
mate 10 Pro now when it comes to
performance we've used a whole range of
different benchmark when it comes to and
2 to the 1 + 5 t is the clear winner
with a score of over a hundred and
eighty thousand for GFX bench is
actually the note 8 that comes out on
top followed closely by the Sony Xperia
x8 one when it comes to Geekbench the
single core score go to the 1 plus 5t
and then the multi-core score goes to
the mate 10 Pro over at second place you
do get the Nokia 8 and the Razer phone
and finally looking at 3d mark the
winner there is the note 8 followed by
the Nokia 8 when you put all those
scores together the clear winner in
terms of performance is the 1 + 5 t so
well done 1 + then you have the Razer
phone and finally you have the note 8
from Samsung ok test the camera we've
done two different methods first of all
we've got a camera shootout which we
displayed on the annual thority website
with lots of different pictures of
sceneries and low-light and different
types of shots and you the readers of a
garage comm voted for what you thought
were the best pictures and secondly we
did some technical testing we've got
some very complicated software and we've
got all these special patterns that you
take pictures of and then from that you
can check things like the color
reproduction and the sharpness and
amount of noise in the picture and so on
so let's first of all look at the
shootout results well as you can see
here the readers have had their say and
in third place comes the 1 plus 5t
second place comes the Samsung Galaxy
Note 8 and the winner according to the
readers vandura of course comp is the
Google pixel to excel now with the
technical testing there's a huge mound
of data that we've collected and a lot
of those results are published over at
all andrew thority comm have a leader
some of the highlights for you when it
comes to color accuracy a number of
phones did a really good job including
the note 8 the pixel to excel the sony
xperia x8 one the Moto Zed force to the
huawei mate 10 Pro and none of the
flagship had any problem in with noise
when it was good light particularly the
Google pixel to excel and the Samsung
Galaxy Note 8 when it comes to low-light
things are a bit different and the
winner in the low-light category was the
five teeth 1 + 5 t in terms of sharpness
in first was a note 8 then the Nokia 8
and then the 1 + 5 t and finally we did
a test using 4k video which phone had
the best sharpness for 4k video and that
was the note 8 followed by the pixel to
excel now when you gather all those
results together the winner for the best
camera in terms of its technical aspects
is the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 for a very
closely behind by the mate 10 Pro and
then the pixel 2 X L now back to life
keys a key characteristic for many many
of us so we've done lots of different
battery testing and first of all for
just doing mixed kind of activities that
means a bit of gaming a bit of web
browsing a bit of music a bit of video
and so on the best phone is actually the
key one from blackberry followed by the
mate 10 Pro and then the z2 force
however if you kind of just do more web
browsing than maybe you do video or
playing games then again the key one
from blackberry comes in first place
then again the make 10 Pro in second
place and finally in third place is the
Nokia n8
however if you are a heavy gamer then
the 1 + 5 t will give you the best
battery life followed by the z2 force
and then the huawei mate
pro- the kind of person that's always
dashing around and you plug your phone
in for just a few minutes to try and get
that extra bit of charge before you -
out somewhere else then the phone that
charges that quick is is actually
Lisette - force then actually behind
that is the mate 10 Pro and finally the
1 + 5 t now overall when you have all
those different types of battery tests
the winner is the huawei mate 10 Pro
followed very closely by the 1 + 5 t and
in third place we have the is it - force
now to judge the user experience we
actually came up with 191 points
available to be divided across a whole
range of categories from hardware to
software to camera and so on and we're
looking at things like the screen to
body ratio does it have a headphone jack
doesn't have dual speakers does it have
optical image stabiliser they have
wireless charging clit support and micro
SD card
does it have any IP rating what version
of Android does it come on and so forth
so we tied up all the points and
actually we found that in terms of user
experience the LG TV 30 is the clear
winner next is the Samsung Galaxy Note 8
and in third place you've got these
huawei mate 10 Pro now before we get
them to look at the final scores there
is one more category and that is value
for money now the blackberry key one
cost just $500 was at the other end of
the extreme is the note 8 which can cost
over $900 there's a $400 difference
between them so when you compare the
features that these phones have with the
price the overall winner for value of
money is the 1 + 5 t their next comes
the nokia 8 are generated
nokia there in that second position and
many third place is the moto z2 force
okay so let's look at the final results
now when you boil it all down there are
just four phones that have shown
themselves strong through all those
categories the mate 10 won one category
and was in the top three for four other
categories the V 30 from LG won two
categories but it didn't get a top three
position in any
of the other categories the 1 plus 5t
itself one two categories and it was in
the top three for a further one other
category and the Samsung Galaxy Note 8
one two categories and it was in the top
three for two other categories so let's
take the result in reverse order
starting with third place in third place
we get the 1 plus 5t and then in second
place we have the Samsung Galaxy Note 8
and the winner of the best of android
award for 2017 goes to the huawei mate
10 Pro I'm going to endure authority and
