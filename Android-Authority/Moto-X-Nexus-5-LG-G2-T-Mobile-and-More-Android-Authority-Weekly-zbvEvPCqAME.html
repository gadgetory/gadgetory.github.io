brought to you by netflix head to
netflix.com / android for a free 30-day
trial alright we're talking about the
Moto X the next flagship from LG and a
lot of google updates hey it's josh
regard from andhra authority what's
going on everybody and it's time for
another dose of the week's top android
news it's android authority weekly we
start with the phone that seems to be on
everybody's minds these days the Moto X
a leaker with a pretty good track record
went on to Google+ to spend some new
rumors apparently the Moto X will be
packing what is called a clear pixel
camera now we don't really know what
that means but it does sound like a
competitor to HTC's ultrapixels and we
did hear that it probably will be
packing 10 megapixels the other rumor
involves the software in that it will be
the pure Android experience apparently
and involve fast upgrade cycles couple
all of this with the information we do
know the fact that the Moto X will be a
highly customizable device and it's
pretty clear that we're all on the hook
for more news which is why it should
come as no surprise that we got very
excited to get some real spec
information from some carrier sources
the main tidbits well the clear pixel
camera actually is quite good the
battery life is really great and the
software tested on it happens to be
Android 4.2 point2 there also seems to
be a lot of sensors on the Moto X much
like the Samsung Galaxy s4 so it looks
like Motorola is trying to go for a
phone that may not blow us away spec
wise but definitely gives us a user
experience that is very exceptional and
if our sources are any indication it
probably is and finally we got what
seems to be our first glimpse at the
actual Moto X device itself when Google
chairman Eric Schmidt was snapped using
a never-before-seen motorola smartphone
these are hardly paparazzi style photos
as the pieces look like part of a big
photo shoot I don't know if the focus
was the phone or the Chairman now
obviously the Moto X hasn't been
officially announced yet but we may have
just gotten this week our first real
look into this future phone and for moto
we move on to LG every day it is looking
more and more like the update to the
Nexus 4 will be a repeat production by
LG
insight this week reported that the
successor to the Nexus 4 is going to be
based on the LG g2 much like how the
Nexus 4 was based on the optimus G now
we're not exactly sure how credible the
report itself is but it does come from a
pretty reputable source all we can say
is that if LG continues its G and Nexus
roles we might be looking at a great
next Nexus smartphone speaking of the g2
we got a very substantial leak this
weekend saw the phone in all of its
glory what did it show us well first of
all the LG g2 does look like a very
attractive device there are no physical
or capacitive buttons on the front and
the volume rockers and power button are
definitely found on the back this time
if you want to see those images and this
full video leak head over to android
authority com for the full story when
was the last time you experienced phone
Envy were you stuck with an old phone
while everybody else ran around with all
of their updated smartphones did you
make a face did it look like this well
t-mobile is looking to fix all of that
with their new jump program short for it
just upgrade my phone this program
allows you to shorten the two-year
payment plan you probably have in place
for your smart phone on t-mobile already
you simply trade in your old phone for a
new one cancelling all of the
outstanding payments you still have left
but there's a catch isn't it there's
there's always a catch what's the catch
yeah there are a couple catches if you
want to be in the jump program you have
to pay a ten-dollar monthly service fee
hey there's that face again alright
we're going to round out this edition of
weekly with a lot of google news but
first some sponsor talk all right
everybody I just want to talk to you
real quick about Netflix with over 26
million subscribers it really is the
world's leading internet subscription
service for movies and TV and it all
streams directly to you whether it's to
a gaming console or a smart TV or if you
happen to be on the go maybe a trustee
Android device I remember when I first
became a netflix subscriber I watched
battlestar galactica on my android phone
for like an entire night now as a
netflix subscriber you can instantly
watch a ton of different movies and TV
shows with no late fees and no due dates
and if you happen to not be a member
already
we got a deal for you netflix.com slash
android is where you should head so you
can get a free 30-day trial that 30 days
is perfect for getting a taste of what
netflix has to offer some once again
it's netflix.com slash android for a
free 30-day trial so once you head on
over right now so you can start watching
some content today and we're back Google
Maps recently got a very substantial
upgrade to the version that we saw at
Google i/o and this week the mobile
version got the same treatment now in
the overhauled interface all of your
searches and data will be overlaid on
top of a completely mapped out
background also a couple of other
upgrades include live traffic updates
and dynamic rerouting oh and it only
took about a day for Google to reassure
us that they're going to be putting back
in an obvious way of saving all of your
Maps for offline usage a new cyanogenmod
update gave us some insight into android
vulnerabilities the new sources for cm 7
and 9 included a patch for what is
called the master key so what is master
key exactly well it's an exploit that
apparently can affect a wide array of
different devices apparently it can
abuse the Android signing mechanism the
safeguard against malicious apps that
are trying to act legitimate the
exploits the mechanism from correctly
identifying infectious data being
installed so are our trusty Android
devices doomed no not really Google is
already taking steps to update the Play
stores own scanners as far as we're
concerned we just have to keep
remembering to update our phones and
tablets and finally google voice and
original Google Talk users can rejoice
because a feature long missing from the
google hangout app has finally returned
an option for call a phone should now
widely be available in the menu for
users of the hangout app in gmail if you
like to use the web app to make phone
calls this should be a very exciting
development I know I'm happy to use my
google voice number like this once again
alright that should just about do it for
