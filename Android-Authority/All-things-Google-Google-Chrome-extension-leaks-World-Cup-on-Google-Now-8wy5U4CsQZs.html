Hindy the android authority app guide
it's Friday and we have a lot of stuff
to talk about this week so let's get
started first up this week Google Chrome
desktop gets in merced there isn't much
else about the update that's worth
mentioning aside from the standard bug
fixes and performance improvements
immersive mode is certainly a welcome
sight for those running 4.4 and up and
the bug fixes are a welcome sight for
pretty much everybody else the update is
rolling out right now so if you don't
have it yet you can grab the APK by
using the links provided in the written
companion below or you can just wait
next up google stars chrome extension
got leaked and that's kind of exciting
except for it actually kind of isn't
okay so you can actually get the
extension downloaded and installed
however most of the awesome features are
blocked for now unless you are part of
google's dogfooding program which lets
you test these features early regardless
you can still get a more pleasant
bookmarking experience but it's probably
better to wait until this becomes an
official thing so you can use all of
those awesome extra features oh and by
the way Google Hangouts got an update
the most notable and probably the most
usable part of this update is you can
now assign custom sounds to your hangout
calls and messages I thought this has
been around for a while but perhaps I
was mistaken the other new feature is a
unified SMS block list should you want
to start blocking text messages from
certain people some people have
complained that the latest string of
updates drains battery and is slower
overall than the older versions but your
personal experience may vary it's time
for the world cup and Google now is
ready if you're a fan of the world cup
Google now can now help you stay up to
date on the latest goings-on in one of
the world's largest sporting events you
can ask things like when does your
country play match results and standings
this is a really nifty little tool and
take it from someone who asks Google now
every day about the Stanley Cup it'll be
a really useful feature for anyone
wanting to follow the world cup yep
folks even more google updates and this
time it's YouTube this update is all
about the video resolution in Prior
updates most people could only select
between HD and non HD with the latest
update people can now choose from a
range of 144 p 2 720p if you people have
even reported being able to get
nadp on select devices such as the Sony
Xperia Z ultra for those who have always
wanted more control over the resolution
they watch this is a great update to get
in our last bit of news this week we're
going to talk about just one more update
and this time it's to the good old
google play store now this isn't
actually a new thing the last update
which we talked about here on the show
actually started the simplified
permissions roll out with this latest
update kind of finishing things out for
those who didn't have it before it
features easier to understand
permissions that you can expand and read
more about if you so choose instead of
having a wall of text to read which very
few people actually did if you don't
have it just yet just chill out because
it's rolling out now and should reach
you soon who wants to see some trending
applications as usual if you want to
check any of these applications out you
can find the links in the brigham
companion which is in the video
description below first up this week is
the venerable Nova Launcher it was
recently updated to give users the ok
Google functionality from within nova
launcher this is really cool because
really this phrase should be enabled
everywhere for everyone and this is one
step closer to that also in the updater
sub-grid positioning improvements
dynamic calendar icons and more color
options fans of Square Enix can rejoice
this week because Dragon Quest 8 is now
out it's really expensive at twenty
dollars and even an avid final fantasy
fan like myself has a little bit of an
issue working out that much dough
nevertheless you can get a fun RPG
experience that's already ragingly
popular around the world and we've no
doubt that fans of the series have no
problem dropping twenty dollars on this
game next up is sunrise calendar and it
actually made our list of the best
applications released in May of 2014
it's a wonderfully designed calendar
application that brings an interface
that is more pleasing to the eye than
most calendars along with some nifty
features like the ability to invite
people to events on your calendar it's
free to try and if you're bored with
your calendar why not try this one last
up this week is Instagram the venerable
photo social network has updated their
application and it now has more photo
editing options this includes more
filters and filter settings as well as
settings for brightness contrast and
shadows of course there is also the
usual bug fixes and performance
improvements once again I'm Joe Hindy
