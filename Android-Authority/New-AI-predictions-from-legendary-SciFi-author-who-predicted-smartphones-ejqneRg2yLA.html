be one of the funnest things to do now
it's the best thing to do first off
let's just talk about how hard this is
to predict accurately I mean even when
the internet first came out people were
very confused and had a hard time
understanding what the internet was
Allison can you explain what internet is
what do you write like mail see what I
mean we usually don't understand the
scope of the chains that's about to
happen we don't have a frame of
reference we don't have a context so we
usually miss the most important points
having said that someone was
fantastically accurate in predicting the
future when it came to smartphones meets
science fiction author David Gerald and
in 1999 he said this I've got a cell
phone
a pocket organizer a beeper a calculator
a digital camera a pocket tape recorder
a music player sometime in the next few
years all of those devices are going to
meld into one it will be a box less than
inch thick and smaller than a deck of
cards this size will be determined by
what's convenient to hold not by the
technology inside the box will have a
high-res color screen a microphone a
plug for handsets and earphones a camera
lens wireless connectivity cell phone
and beeper functions a television and
radio receiver a digital recorder etc
etc etc etc etc you get the point the
man hit a home run a grand slam you
might think in retrospect that that was
easy to do of course we could have
figured that out but many many people
were way off and did not see that coming
now
he's also predicted the future from now
what do you think he said well Gerald
has obliged us by releasing some
thoughts on robots and predictions for
AI noting he feels it is inevitable
sensibly Gerald points out that true AI
isn't possible in the near future but
robots will soon possess capabilities
beyond what any human assistant can do
the robot will require a level of data
gathering pattern recognition
information processing and
decision-making that will surpass that
of a human assistant
robots will become dance partners they
will play basketball they will pace
joggers they will walk dogs they will
take on any task that can be defined by
a specific set of rules robots will
assist in the care of the sick and
elderly they may even end up delivering
the mail Jerald goes on to say that at
that point the robot becomes a life
manager cleaning house will be the least
of its responsibilities the robot will
connect with all of your wireless
devices and monitor what TV shows you
want to watch what toppings you want on
your pizza order what bills you need to
pay and so on it will likely manage your
finances as well so that filing out your
tax returns will be as simple as saying
Robi file my tax return
now as for true artificial intelligence
Gerald says this the development of true
robots will likely take at least another
decade probably longer the process will
be slow and painstaking the development
of the self-driving car is a good
example of the kind of caution necessary
and that deliberate pace of development
will give humans plenty of time to get
used to the idea but Gerald does end
with a warning quote here's the singular
caution we must not give up the most
essential part of being human the
ability to connect with each other yes a
robot can rock a baby but I'm pretty
sure the baby would much prefer to be
rocked by a human if we give that up we
create a generation that will never know
what it is to be loved I should add that
Gerald actually predicted more than just
what I read he predicted Google
Translate the Google assistant the whole
idea of being able to walk around and
your phone would automatically make
recommendations for different
restaurants or even make reservations
for you that's happening now and that's
relatively recent the fact that he
predicted that 20 years ago is
impressive indeed now it's sad to say
that mr. Gerald just passed away a
couple of weeks ago and I thought this
was an appropriate time to bring up the
subject because who doesn't love to talk
about tech future but this is really
hard to do and you guys know that I have
talked about it a lot where I think the
next big shift and I don't mean like an
incremental shift or a new gadget I'm
talking about a new technology shift
that really changes the way we behave
like the internet the smartphone
you know the personal computer all that
kind of stuff and I really think it has
to be a technology or an ability that
opens up the internet for us so instead
of being locked into all this
communication devices through these tiny
little screens it needs to be something
that opens us up whether that is an
earpiece in conjunction with you know
contact lens that's all IP connected I
don't know but again I'm using my
internet frame of reference so it may be
something just completely wildly
different and someone 20 years from now
will be looking back in this video and
go yeah that guy had no clue what he was
talking about if you think you know what
you're talking about let me know in the
comments below or on Twitter I'm active
on Twitter I read pretty much everything
and respond to many of you and I still
read all the comments talk to you later
like me do you like ultra-thin phone
cases if so you just need protection
against everyday wear and tear and our
sponsor has super-thin cases price just
right for all major phones you can go to
