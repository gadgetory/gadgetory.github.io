collective mind with brexit so much so
that even LG and Samsung have spoken
about it so what does it mean for you
and me and for everyone who wants to buy
cool smartphones well it depends how
much we overreact
following the result of the brexit
referendum in which the UK voted to
leave the European Union a slowdown and
consumer electronic sales is imminent
now we should bear in mind that a
referendum from a strictly legal
standpoint is not binding it's simply an
advisory meaning that it tells
Parliament with the people of the UK
want but Parliament may still vote to
ignore the referendum result not that
they necessarily will but the point is a
lot can happen between now and when the
UK actually leaves the EU well when a
population faces uncertainty regarding
jobs border trade etc the first thing
they do is prepare for the worst which
means a lot less spending and
manufacturers know this and they're
afraid of it in fact Samsung and LG have
already spoken out an unnamed LG
executive told The Korea Times this week
that quote the biggest worry is that the
brexit will dent consumer and business
confidence samsung also spoke out siding
with an analysis from Moody's Investors
Service that said and I quote heightened
uncertainty during negotiations over new
arrangements between the UK and the EU
will likely dent investment the unnamed
Samsung source also noted that if the
euro falls it will affect Samsung's
business in the European market no
although both LG and Samsung will likely
not suffer significantly as a result of
briggsy at least not on a long term both
will be hesitant to invest heavily in
either the EU or the UK until the dust
has settled now for our European friends
that could potentially mean fewer
choices fewer phones to buy now let's
talk about the leaked specs for the
alleged HTC nexus otherwise known as
sailfish this week's leaks come from an
exclusive story published by android
police based on an unspecified source
while the site does caution that the
details may not only change but are also
possibly not even accurate to begin with
given that September when Google usually
announces new products is quickly
approaching the smaller of the two Nexus
devices HTC is supposedly producing has
the code name sailfish according to the
source specs and details of the smaller
device are as follows they expect a 2
gigahertz 64-bit quad-core
system-on-a-chip with a 5-inch full-hd
display 4 gigabytes of ram 32 gigabytes
of on-board storage with possibly
having other storage variants released
the phone will pack a 12 megapixel rear
cam and 8 megapixel front cam a
rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and USB
type-c ports it is said to have a 2700
70 million power battery a speaker or
speakers located at the bottom of the
device the headphone jack will be on the
top and the phone will support Bluetooth
4.2 now I know what you're thinking what
about the HTC Marlin well as nothing
about the sailfish screams amazing it
leads one to believe that the Marlin
will be Google's main offering and a
true flagship product it will likely
have at least a Snapdragon 820 or 821
four or six gigabytes of RAM a quad HD
display of a larger size and given that
last year's pair of Nexus devices had
decidedly different design details the
questions raised if they will do the
same thing again what do you guys think
let me know in the comments below most
of you in our poll believe that this was
a good follow-up to the Nexus 5x what do
you think let me know and last up let's
talk about transient smartphone
blindness two separate women in the UK
went to the hospital suffering from what
is now known as temporary smartphone
blindness fearing a stroke or other
serious conditions the unrelated women
underwent a series of complicated and
expensive tests before being referred to
an eye specialist the specialist
diagnosis one-eyed smartphone usage in
bed it turns out temporary smartphone
blindness is more common than you might
expect with the issue being detailed in
the New England Journal of Medicine the
problem occurs simply enough because one
I becomes accustomed to the brightness
of the smartphone display while the
other usually obscured by a pillow stays
accustomed to darkness however you
should know a spokesperson from the
American Academy of Ophthalmology said
two cases were hardly enough to
constitute proof that one-eyed
smartphone usage in bed is the root
cause behind transient smartphone
blindness but at least if you do suffer
from something similar you may not have
to go through the stress of suspecting
you are having a stroke and if you're
all concerned please consult your doctor
