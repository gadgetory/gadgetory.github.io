is Jace and this is where we cover the
week's Android use and sometimes that
news involves corporate bloody warfare
like last week when Google dealt a blow
to Apple by acquiring nest nest is the
thermostat company and of course nest
was led by former Apple employees who
have now jumped ship to Google further
dealing a blow to Apple in the home
automation market but not to worry
because the senior vice president global
marketing at Apple Phil Schiller
has now unfollowed nest on Twitter
moving on to wearables and those Google
glasses are so 2013 no now we're moving
on to Google's smart contact lenses holy
crap
Google claims they're smart lenses are a
painless non evasive and accurate way
for people suffering from diabetes to
keep their blood sugar level under
control
Google smart lenses work by putting a
minuscule sensor a hair thick antenna
and a chip the size of a piece of
glitter between two contact lenses the
sensor in the contact with the tears
naturally found on the surface at the I
can take readings of glucose levels once
per second the lens can communicate with
an external device and receive the power
it needs wirelessly now for all you
people who think this is just too sci-fi
for 2014 just remember that only a few
short years ago all of these 15 devices
you could buy at RadioShack can now be
done more effectively with this one
device moving on to a new augmented
reality game Google's Mantic Labs will
work with HarperCollins to create an
augmented reality game based on the
upcoming young adult trilogy end game by
controversial author James Frey do you
remember who James Frey is James Frey
was the author who wrote his memoir
which became a massive blockbuster hit
called a million little pieces but then
Oprah slammed him on international
television for marketing his memoir as a
true story when it was in fact almost
completely fiction that James fire of
course this is the holy grail for media
producers in the digital age they want
to extend the story's capacity to
money right I mean 40 years ago it was
you know create a great book and then it
was create a series of books and then it
was create a series of books with a
multi movie deal and now of course we
want the augmented reality attached to
it because that is a process that can be
scaled you can maintain that much easier
than writing a whole new book or
producing a whole new movie and there
are endless possibilities for it just
imagine for a moment if we had an
augmented reality game for Game of
Thrones for example we could have a game
that teaches wives how to properly treat
their geek husbands pull him to you
clothes look in his eyes look at his
lips as you bite yours and then lean
over and with fur a Lannister always
pays his debts and stab him in the gut
while his mother watches o geeks love
that stuff but what I find really
fascinating here is that although James
Frey may be a liar he is a fantastic
storyteller and that's what augmented
reality needs not just a technology but
a great compelling and grossing story
and I think James Frey can deliver I'm
looking forward to it
what new phone has been added to the
Google Play Store that's right it's the
Moto G and many of you have asked me
about my favorite entry-level phone
under 200 bucks and the Moto G has got
to be right at the top of that list and
now that it's a Google Play edition you
get vanilla Android enjoy thanks for
