well be that the p20 series is all about
the camera it was initially thought that
Huawei's upcoming flagships would go by
the name P 11 and P 11 plus but Huawei
has all but confirmed with a teaser
video that at least one of the
smartphones would be called the P 20
while the other is rumored to be called
the P 20 pro now you might have thought
that Huawei would debut these devices at
the Mobile World Congress but know
they're gonna have their own event on
March 27th in Paris but hey let's talk
hardware and we think that the P 20
series smartphones will be bigger than
its predecessor
you see xda-developers obtain firmware
files of one of the p20 smartphones
likely to be the pro model it revealed
that the handset could sport a 6.0 one
inch LCD display with Full HD plus
resolution when future suggests that the
P 20 and P 20 Pro will sport 20 to 40 by
1080 resolution displays with a 19-9
aspect ratio now if that leek is legit
it's a educated guess to say that the
smaller of the P 20 series phones would
be between 5.5 and 5.7 inches but let's
talk about what's under the hood we're
almost certain that the devices will be
powered by the latest cure 970 chipset
the same chipset found in the May 10
series this means that they should have
AI related features onboard including
photo based translations and a few smart
tips like suggesting to enable iComfort
mode when reading in a dark environment
but the camera is what could take this
to a whole other level you see what
might set apart the P 20 Pro from the
competition is its camera setup
according to Evan Blass and others it
could house a triple lens 40 megapixel
rear camera set up with 5x hybrid zoom
it's also expected that the setup will
be co-developed with lekha like in
previous years the P 20 on the other
hand is expected to come with dual
cameras on the back both devices may
also have a 24 megapixel selfie snapper
onboard and laser autofocus now I feel
pretty confident about these leaks and
rumors because we're hearing them not
only from multiple sources but Huawei
itself is getting pretty clever with
saying that we will quote see
more with AI and they spelled more with
three o's suggesting that there will be
three lenses what do us think pretty
excited I would love to see what this
camera will actually look like in
real-world comparisons the smartphone's
may arrive with a new digital assistant
on board called high assistant which may
or may not be exclusive to the Chinese
market it should allow users to control
nearly every setting on the device with
their voice like Wi-Fi volume levels
screen brightness and so forth other
details we expect to see is six or eight
gigabytes of RAM on micro SD card slot
and Android reo with Huawei's user
interface on top now adding the
headphone jack and some water resistance
would be a fantastic idea and just make
it easier for us Westerners to buy your
phones and Huawei will love you love you
dearly what do you think let me know in
