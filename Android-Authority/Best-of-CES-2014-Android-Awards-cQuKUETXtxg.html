by Toyota at CES 2014 we found a very
very large emerging trend in the
accessories Department and it's wearable
tech wearable tech is going to be
booming this upcoming year and when we
look at accessories we have to look at
very specific factors on the one hand
you can have an accessory that tries to
do everything at once or you can have an
accessory that has a very specific focus
but when an accessory kind of merges the
two that is what really catches arrived
and has the reason why we are giving LG
the best accessory award for a live band
touch it is a fitness tracker that is
very in obtrusive and just latches right
onto your wrist and it gives you
notifications for all of your tracking
needs however while you're doing your
workout and tracking all of your
calories burned and also your actual
workout and also is able to get your
phone notification straight to here so
you never have to miss something
important the technology in here is very
easy to use and makes your workouts that
much easier in your life and as the
reason why we give the LG live band
touch the best accessory reward for CES
2014
here at CES 2014 we've been inundated
with exceptional technology
what do we look forward for the best
android tablet well samsung has unveiled
the galaxy tab pro 8.4 it's a beautiful
mid sized tablet packings best-in-class
specifications and exceptionally high
resolution display an extremely powerful
processing
the mandroid authority were extremely
pleased and proud to award samsung
galaxy tab pro 8.4 the best android
tablet of CES 2014
here at Android Authority picking the
best android phone of a particular show
like the Consumer Electronic Show of
2014 is always a daunting task we have
to look at a lot of different factors
including the power of the phone or the
size of a phone or even the user
experience underneath with the software
and whatnot however we have to look at
the big picture and it is there that we
find that accessibility is probably one
of the most important factors when it
comes to us choosing what we believe is
the best phone of a show and for that
reason we have to give the award of best
android phone to a sous not just for one
phone but for a line of phones called
the zenfone line and the reason why is
because at $99 149 and 199 for different
sizes of the zenfone you can get a great
experience at an accessible price point
that makes these phones applicable for
any user in the Android space and it is
for that reason that we give a sous the
award for best android phone of CES 2014
and once again thank you to Toyota for
sponsoring our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
