headphone jack but that's okay because
google has come out with not only a new
pair of wireless earbuds but ones that
are powered by Google Assistant it
structure for Gaara what's going on
everybody and here we're taking a look
at the new Google pixel buds now what we
thought might be truly wireless earbuds
actually has a tether on it but that's
actually a good thing because the pixel
buds take on a lot of the design
philosophy behind the pixel line the
cord itself is made of a fabric and then
there's a certain portion of it that
loops through the earpiece that way you
can make it bigger or smaller depending
on your ear size and that loop will
allow it to stick cleanly and also
securely inside of one's here there are
touch controls on the right earbud that
allows for Google assistant support
there's also a great feature of using
Google Translate on the fly you do have
to have Google Translate opens up on the
smart phone that way of course you can
broadcast what you are saying to
somebody else and that person will be
able to hold a button on the smart phone
and be able to say what they want to say
after which you'll hear inside of the
pixel buds these are also not in ear
monitors you might be used to seeing ear
buds that have a protruding piece that
goes straight into your ear canal and
that is not the case with these pixel
buds however even though they are non
occluding much like the ear pods from
apple's camp they still sound pretty
great I did get a demo of it with a
couple of songs from google play music
and one thing I did notice is that any
little brush or touch of the Wrights
earbud allowed for google assistant to
give me some prompts mainly I was
getting prompts for what time it was
right now but if I were to press the
button and be able to say something that
I wanted Google assistant to tell me
then you will give me that information
easily the pixel buds come in three
different colors much like the pixel to
itself and they have five hours of
playtime per charge while the case
allows for more charges they're
available for pre-order at $159 with
November being pretty much when they're
going to come out keep it tuned to
Android 34 more about the announcements
at today's San Francisco event and for
more about Google assistant coming
across all different products and going
outside of just the realm of the pixel
smartphones but if you haven't checked
out our pixel 2 and pixel 2 XL hands on
make sure you do so here at Android
authority because we are your source for
all things
