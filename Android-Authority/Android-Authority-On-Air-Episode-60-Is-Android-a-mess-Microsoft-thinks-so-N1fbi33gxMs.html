android authority share this post moving
on alright so we'll come back to that a
little bit for people that are tuning in
late okay so moving on to to some news
this week so at dive into mobile earlier
this week Microsoft's Terry Myerson who
is the VP of Windows Phone had something
to say he said that Android is kind of a
mess look at Samsung there's clearly
mutiny going on the only OEM making
money off of Android is Samsung which we
all know that Samsung is making a lot of
money there they're selling tons of
devices so that's true the main point of
discussion on this is Microsoft's VP of
windows phone saying Android is a mess
and there's there's been a debate going
back and forth about this throughout the
week you know is Android a mess is it
not a mess so what I want you to do is
let us know in the comments if you think
Android is a mess or if it's not a mess
and you know just give us your thoughts
on that and we're going to go back and
forth here we're going to talk about you
know compare it to iOS compare it to
Windows Phone is it the carrier's fault
OEM samsung what actually is Google's
job what does Google's role with Android
and ultimately you know do we think
android is a mess
so I'm going to ask Dan Charlton here
dan do you think android is a mess and
what is your response to Terry's
accusation I think yes and no is the
answer to that question and really it
depends on what you're talking about
when you say Android when I tell you
about Android I'm talking about AOSP the
platform itself I don't think it's less
at all I think it works just like Linux
works right you've got a group of people
to contribute to the core code they
release regular updates I'd like for
them to release more regular updates
right like Linux is constantly being
updated in public and Android as you
know just incrementally done in public
like that I'd like to see it faster than
that but I get that it isn't in that
respect though no it's not all a mess
the platform is perfectly stable
perfectly fine evolving quickly being
well maintained what's a mess is all the
people who are not really maintaining
their own forks of Android despite the
fact that they're running their own
forks of android right Samsung forks
Android to make it run on other devices
they don't put that information back
into Google's code and then they build
their own framework on top of it they're
shipping TouchWiz for samsung devices is
their very own Fork of Android but the
problem is they don't support it they
don't treat it like a forked a Detroit
they don't actually maintain it they
expect the carrier's to support it
that's the big difference in my opinion
between Apple and Android in this
respect Apple supports every iPhone on
every carrier you have a verizon iphone
you have a problem with it you call
verizon they're going to direct you to
an apple representative same thing on
AT&amp;amp;T or sprint or t-mobile or anywhere
else in the world you have a samsung
phone you call verizon verizon's dealing
with it you have one from AT&amp;amp;T 18 tease
deal if one from t-mobile they're
dealing with it so it's a big contrast
there ok so the counter-argument to this
is well to rehash what you said so
you're saying that you know it's the
it's the OEMs and
the carrier's fault because they're
they're customizing Android so the
argument is as well whenever we look at
the success of Android we say that
Android is worldwide you know seventy to
seventy-five percent whatever the
numbers the latest numbers are of the
the market it's you know is Android we
look at this massive dominating force of
android yet what you just mentioned and
what you just talked about wasn't that
massive seventy seventy-five percent
that was I'm gonna say a number i don't
even know but world to say that's
probably a single digit number is what
you probably just mentioned you know
that your nexus devices AOSP supportive
devices so that's what the people on the
other side of the fence are saying how
do you respond to that i'd say that
android is that entire seventy percent
that's underneath of all of it that's
the foundation that all of those little
things are built on right it's not that
androids a mess because Samsung can't
get their crap together and support
their phones agreed agreed not so it's
not a fault of Android that's not a
symptom of Android that Samsung not
being good at their business I agrees
that crap load of phones and in that
regard they're doing good business but
they aren't treating their customers
well Apple sells crapload of phones but
they can get the absurd margins they do
and the people willing to fork over crab
loads of money for them like they do
because they're going to follow that up
with the customer service right that's
why every apple store is always freaking
packed with the Apple fanboys because
they love going in and getting that
service Samsung's not providing that
they're expecting verizon to provide
that for them or sprint to provide that
for them they're gonna get themselves
all right now now John do you have
anything that you would like to to add
to that you know is this is this
google's fault you know that they are
putting out code and then whatever
anybody wants to do with it you know
they have no control over it but but the
other side of the fence here is saying
that that's the that's the problem that
Google has no control once they put the
code out there
it's not a product that was the intent
you know it's not necessarily a problem
that's open because as a development
platform android has worked very well
for them because even with the Nexus
even before the Nexus you had the code
and by the time really developers have
had their hands on you know developers
generally buy nexus devices or even I
are given Nexus devices but I'm Samsung
comes out with their version of four
point to point to the developers apps
are up to snuff it's stable you don't
have to worry about even iOS suffers
from development um you know everybody
jumps on the nuke left formal taneously
we were developers haven't had that much
time to work with it and you have more
issues with applications force closing
and giving us so from the perspective of
development it works well from the
perspective of the users I don't think
it necessarily is a bad thing that like
what dan was talking about with Samsung
if the person is happy with their phone
you know I have somebody like say my mom
and she's perfectly happy she has a
galaxy s3 they don't really think about
whether they're on the latest version of
the software that is care that it works
the thing is the the people that do care
about it should have the option to get a
pure you know if they want a Nexus
device that that needs to be available
to them everywhere on every carrier
globally you know if as long as the
consumers get what they want that's
really all that all of the boils down to
it matters and you know if the consumers
have that choice but don't have the
choice that they want that's when it
becomes a mess or a problem in my eyes I
mean if you know obviously they got some
much market share that it's working it's
just a question of is everybody happy or
is everybody know what they want I be
capable of being happy if that question
what kind of maine's yes then that's all
that matters all right Scott in regards
to everything that John and Dan had said
in what I had had said you have anything
you wish to add to this discussion yeah
going back to the initial comment of
you know mutiny with Samsung and Android
the take over the whole like take over
mutiny of the whole ecosystem of Android
from Samsung is kind of far-fetched it
can't happen because they have to have
some underlying features in order to you
know have it the Play Store you know all
the google apps so ideally you know it's
working for google but the issue is
basically update time and that in lies
you know the biggest problem that
definitely people have the choice
whether to buy a device that is updated
or not but the thing is in order to do
that you have to be somewhat educated on
what phone to buy and who to buy it from
so there are lies kind of the problem i
guess i agree that that that is a
problem that you shouldn't have you a
consumer should be able to buy
relatively any phone and assume they're
going to get the support that they
desire and and that just doesn't happen
all the time unfortunately and you know
Google can do their best to help
mitigate this by relief releasing such
things as the platform development kit
and they can have OEM manufacturers use
this and and help you know which will
help them get you know code available
before publicly release to help them get
updates out in a timely manner um if an
oem doesn't use this or doesn't take
advantage of this tool then I mean
that's really not google's fault they're
maintaining their line of devices Nexus
devices so my this really isn't an
answer but but my thoughts is let's see
what happens with the new upcoming
versions of devices from Motorola now
that you know Google is technically run
the show let's see how they react to
this let's see if they also fall
susceptible to the carrier you know is
is that is the carrier still going to
bog down the release time frame the same
way that they have in the past now let's
see what actually happens I'm uh I'm I
don't know you know I can't tell the
future I would like to assume that since
rumors are that it's going to you know
new Motorola phones are him just be
stock Android then it's going to be
easier in Google's behind the wheel
they're going to be timely updates but
that but that still doesn't solve the
entire problem that's just one
manufacturer you know that's motorola
you know which is a tiny sliver compared
to what samsung is able to do so I don't
know how Google can tighten this up a
little bit when they're not in charge of
anything after the code leaves them and
you know I I don't think that they can
do that one one thing I was going to UM
when you compare saying iOS release
versus an Android release Google doesn't
have that control but the reason Apple
has that control is also because they
make sure that they get all the
necessary carrier approval prior to a
phone release so it's not necessarily
that the process for them is faster it's
more that they hold back the process so
it becomes invisible to the consumer and
then they handle all the updates after
that but they make sure ahead of time
that Verizon Sprint AT&amp;amp;T global carriers
are on board before they even put the
phone on the market so the only option
realistically because Apple suffers from
this carrier problem two is either
google holds back and doesn't release an
android version and tries to get OEM s
onboard kind of simultaneously prior to
the next Android release or they just
keep moving forward and keep moving
platform for so it's really you're stuck
between a rock and a hard place as to
where you take it and really I think
that's that they've gone about it and
about the best way that they can
considering the circumstances because
they have a lot more OEMs to keep on
board than you know obviously someone's
hardware control but that is a big
factor in it then there's no reason to
hold back android just for the sake of a
novia that would be like Microsoft
holding back windows in for a second how
am yeah yeah I mean one of the problems
with what meyerson's little rant went on
about I mean he talked about how
androids a problem because Google's you
know Google's going to move away from
the closed or open and start closing
things down to get control over it and
to back that up claimed that's why they
hate Facebook home and are going to try
and block it meanwhile at the exact same
conference Eric Schmidt was praising
Facebook home and I think the reason why
Google likes Facebook home is because
it's showing the rest of the OEM because
at this point Facebook essentially is
the OEM of the Facebook first phone
right HTC in that capacity is going back
to what they used to do for windows and
and polym and just contract make the
phone so that's Facebook's offering it
is stocking Android with one application
they didn't break apart the android
framework to make it do what they want
it to you they wrote one application
runs on top of the core framework so you
can't say that Google isn't putting out
a stable platform that all of these
other companies just have to do all of
this crap too in order to make it work
because they don't Google's putting out
a stable platform everybody else is
still stuck in this once that they're on
donut and that they need to do that so
it's a problem these other OEMs
everything in touch wiz could be boiled
down to a highly customized launcher and
then additional plugin apps those apps
don't need Corp TouchWiz framework to
run at least they shouldn't they do now
but all of that framework could be
broken out into the app
okay all right so if you have any
additional points you'd like to add to
this discussion let us know in the
comments here on YouTube or Google Plus
and we'll check it out here a little bit
we're going to mention our giveaway this
week for those of you that are just
tuning in now to being a little bit late
ah so if you have a galaxy s3 or you
know somebody that does you want to hook
them up with something that's unique we
are giving away 10 of these special clip
on snap on cases they are officially
licensed art by tats cru tats cru but it
shortly is a graffiti artist
professional graffiti artist they've
been doing it for 30 years or so and
they've been commissioned by
institutions in New York Museum schools
and major companies um said these
one-of-a-kind you can't get them
anywhere else they're only for the
galaxy s3 we have 10 of them to give
away and if you do share this post or
share a new post with hashtag android
authority we will add that to the queue
in pick a winner after the show at some
point and we'll let you know if any of
you for those of you watching on YouTube
that are wondering what post the Google+
page and earth or android authority
google+ page the youtube link on that
that post look at that Scott's on top of
things he is that that's why he's that's
why he's in this hangout right now Derek
can you keep that thing there the whole
time just so we don't you know so I
could hold you so you'll see that I like
that well I like over here we
give best of both worlds you know all
right so anyways enough about this we'll
talk about this one more time we don't
we don't need to hold up in front of my
beautiful face the entire time of Scott
said all right so let's let's yell about
some some other news Oh going well let's
talk constructively ooh I like that
better so Dan had some Sam's on the
infos for yes so Samsung has gotten into
some hot water in Taiwan apparently
after people found out that they have
been paying people to anonymously write
negative reviews about HTC all over the
web
they didn't necessarily admit to doing
this but they did promise to no longer
do it the future so the kind of implied
that it was going on without saying oh
yes creepin during this yeah won't do
that anymore I mean we didn't do it in
the Prairie but we're not gonna do it
anymore yes know what in Samsung's
defense i would bet money that they
aren't the only company has ever done
this i'm certainly although most
companies do it proactively most
companies pay bloggers to rate positive
stuff about them they don't pay bloggers
to write negative stuff about their coop
Oh someone now what about Furion molar
Florian Miller there are some exceptions
but by and large it's a PR proactive
it's not just a smear campaign yeah it's
not always scroogled scroogled right so
we have some other a device news dance
so yeah they're they're big flagship
phone everybody i know is waiting to
note here when it's coming to them when
coming to their carrier in particular
and so we've gotten official dates from
four of the six largest carriers on
that's t-mobile is going to be the first
of them it will be available on May
twenty-fourth which is what Tuesday
Thursday next week so next week you can
get it for $150 down payment with two
years of twenty dollar monthly payments
which actually shakes out to six hundred
and thirty dollars over the course two
years versus a 648 our list price for
the phone so really not bad financing on
the phone um and obviously that's
separate from the contract and you can
sell the phone back to tmobile with
their uncarrier strategy a sprint is
going to be the next one out you can get
it from them on the twenty-seventh of
april it'll be two hundred fifty dollars
with a two-year contract but you can get
a one hundred dollar discount if you're
switching to sprint from another carrier
I don't know how they verify that you're
switching to sprint from another carrier
you may have to port your number or
something but you can get a first always
cry until maybe yeah you can get as low
as 150 there so that's good um one of
the bigger unconfirmed
still is verizon they've confirmed that
it will be in May which is rather late
but they haven't specified a date there
are various rumors suggesting it could
be the 30th of May based on staples
internal document but they're also
called a press conference for the 22nd
of may so that also seems like a likely
date AT&amp;amp;T meanwhile has announced
officially the 30th of April for two
hundred dollars on a two-year contract
or 450 on a one-year contract and US
cellular has also confirmed the 14th of
May for two hundred dollars on a
two-year contract so if you want the s4
you can get it HTC One dates are still
very nebulous rumor suggests that will
be launching on tmobile at least the
same day as the s for other carriers
it's still murkier when or if it will
appear okay so John what about motorola
for some other OEM news here yeah not so
much for motorola themselves but Eric
Schmidt and Larry Page both spoke at
different conferences this week and they
both pretty heavily praised moat
Motorola's upcoming lineup Schmidt was
at the All Things D mobile conference
and he called the lineup phenomenal and
Larry Page stated that and this was
during Google's earnings called it was
pretty enthusiastic about the upcoming
lineup and layered he specifically said
think about your device battery life is
a challenge for most people you should
need to carry around a charger to make
it through the day if your kid spills a
drink on your tablet the screen and
die and when you drop your phone it
shouldn't shatter he said having just
seen Motorola's upcoming products myself
I'm really excited about the potential
there in just under a year they've
accomplished a lot and have impressive
velocity in execution so some pretty
encouraging words coming from that and
news this week that Motorola is going to
be pushing stock Android in the you know
upcoming future it does make me wonder a
little bit when I say upcoming lineup if
they're talking about something that's
this year they mean
roo because it typically takes a lot
longer to get a phone on the market than
something like a tablet but then again
when they made the Nexus 7 you remember
them talking about google and asus
working day and night for i think a four
month timeframe to me it was a very
short time where you know there's it's
going to be interesting to see what
motor oil has been able to accomplish
even with a kind of what already was a
hardware cycle that was in the works
before google acquired them but you know
things could happen maybe they've got
something really compelling coming out
this year that you should expect to see
and definitely keep your eye on motorola
this year reckon I do think even without
it being a hundred percent Google
influence they're going to come out
swinging dad definitely nice to see
something you know positive and
energetic coming into Motorola fridge
I'm excited I you know I'm excited I
can't wait for the next possible rumor
to unfold alright so let's talk about
some ecosystem news here and we'll talk
about some apps everybody's favorite
boring section on the show right I so uh
amazon they're lacking something major
compared to Google when it comes to
voice search they don't have it and
compare compared to to iOS you know they
they just don't they don't they don't
have the same the same features I know
Google Google now and you know all that
good stuff so they are there's evidence
showing that they are looking to buy a
serie alternative now do we say is Evie
Evie Evie I will call ed okay ed so
they're looking to buy a serie
alternative so that that's interesting
about for those of you that are embedded
in the Amazon ecosystem and have kindle
fires you might be getting some neat
stuff for voice in the future and the
Google Play Store app revenue is up
ninety percent in first quarter 2013 so
that's awesome you know yeah making
money here maybe we'll play
store which you know the Play Store has
been under scrutiny in the past that it
doesn't make any money so it you know
having it be op ninety percent after the
holiday when typically loud people don't
spend money you know because they spent
tons of money over the holiday in q4 of
last year so that's great that it's up
that much the first quarter I find that
very very respectable support your
developers because this is why we're
getting compelling really good
applications lately is because
developers need to know that they can
monetize the platform yeah and so if
you're into giving money to charities
and you wanted to do it with Android
maturities the companies they're selling
your product nonprofits I'm sorry I'm
profits their companies okay anyways if
you want to donate money to the charity
of your choice oh this woody did that
you're still talking about I told all
right did this this is where Dan you
were wrong on a show everybody document
is the first aid is for 18 2013 8 10 01
p.m. um when a year comes around I'm
gonna mention it and you're gonna start
crying oh so so unbeknownst to Dan there
is a new app on the google play store I
maybe I should have entered with that
unbeknownst to dan I just did so that
this mute this new app allows you to
donate to the charity of your choice not
nonprofits it's limited beta app you
have to sign in the app and request to
be put on the waiting list but you can
donate a doll or directly to a charity
of your choice and you can do it through
a new app from Google it's called one
today so when you say a charity of my
choice is that as sure to my choice off
of some list that's been pretty
established or is that just any charity
that I name I believe it is off a
pre-configured lift so how does it
Cheryl how can um but that is the that
is the question I guess um since this
app was just released like this is like
breaking app news I'm not sure uh just
mentioning it because it's a worthy
mentioned so new google app on just let
you know there's a one
nine percent credit card fee okay it's
so Chrome Beta you know chrome beta gets
update every week and whatever chrome
babe yeah it's getting better and faster
and bigger and stronger and we love it
um WordPress gets a little bit of hollow
so those of you that have a blog
wordpress blog and you use your android
device to do some wordpress action you
you've probably already updated you know
what I'm talking about right now but
it's a little bit of hollow you know
it's good major UI overhaul and speaking
of doing some hollow linkedin gets a
hollow ask app a completely newly
redesigned the UI so if you're into
LinkedIn for business social networking
connections you can now do it properly I
guess with a nice nicer you I now on the
opposite side of this spectrum here out
Microsoft's outlook.com was updated it
doesn't look like you know Android 1.5
anymore yeah it was pretty bad yeah so
it doesn't look like you know Android
from five years ago anymore it doesn't
look like really Android at all it
actually looks like it actually looks
like office 2013 so if you're using all
if you're using outlook 2013 right now
that's pro pretty much what the outlook
com app looks like or if you have an
Outlook com email address it yeah it
looks all the same and yeah so some
people might say oh it's on Android it
doesn't have an Android UI well you know
what it's microsoft's UI and their
unifying it across devices and platforms
and that's that's awesome so the hats
are happening something across platforms
round of applause please yeah you know
that hats off to bed that's cool i'm
glad doing it so then they've been
crying for that forever maybe they would
get it so uh google voice um get ready
for it google voice was actually updated
yeah i mean you know it's an epson hat
but never gets updated you know like we
had google TV remote get updated you
know like wasn't a couple weeks ago and
and now you know google voice like it's
nice to see some love for some apps that
never never get updated um
oh my god the update you know what did
it do I'm not a whole lot so SMS
delivery improvements may be related to
integration to glass who knows but you
know anything that's an improvement is
obviously good so let's talk about glass
real quick so new app launched this week
and it wasn't a charity app it was for
glass called my glass and my glass
allows you to set up Wi-Fi for your
glass manager glass you create a QR code
and you hold the phone up with your
glass and you look at the QR code and
hey you connect to your you that's how
glass connects to Wi-Fi through looking
at a QR code um if you want to send
messages to your two contacts or hang
out with contacts you need to manage
those contacts you can do it through the
myglass Android app or the myglass
website but you can like I said you can
do through the app manage your contacts
interesting it has permissions for
google voice so it actually has you know
google voice some type of google voice
integration and related to that glass
will use my glass to send text messages
and if you don't have my glass installed
or you're on a device that like you know
an iphone whenever you say ok glass
message contact it'll actually be an
email it won't be SMS you actually need
my glass to do that my glass is actually
you know surprisingly it's actually very
very dependent or glass is very very
dependent on my glass you know it gets
your location data you know in GPS
through the app as well since glass
doesn't have well the FCC filing said it
had GPS but official tech specs do not
mention GPS so glass gets the location
data from the app that's actually a
pretty pretty relevant so that means it
right now there is no iOS app so that
means that you can't do a lot of the
features and what what's interesting is
to see people mention mentioning this
that are currently you know iphone users
saying huh looks like I'm switching to
android because they want the
integration for you know navigation and
they want the integration for you no
text messaging and stuff like that who
knows what else is going to come down
the line that is only going to be
available
android so that that's interesting that
you find that out they won this week arm
android police did a APK teardown you
know they extract the APK they looked
through all the code strings and folders
and everything and that they found some
neat stuff apparently google games is
looks like very close to being you know
launched you know if google games was
initially i'll say mentioned a year or
so ago where they said you know good a
Googler said you know a year from now we
won't talk about chrome games and
android games and google+ games we're
just going to say google games and we
said oh that's neat wonder what that
means and finally we know we have some
more insight into that so what's the
what did I Ron from android police find
out when he found out that there's going
to be real-time multiplayer games in
this game center or game service ah
there's going to be turn-based
multiplayer games there's going to be in
game chat as well as a no lobby in games
yet yet another chat from google Oh God
anything we try to go the other
direction maybe maybe it's going to be a
you know I'll basics check yeah maybe
it'll be babble based who knows but uh
integrated that'd be pretty cool so
there's going to be achievements and
leaderboards and of course you can
invite your friends to a game so those
of you that do android gaming google
gaming whatever i'm gonna call it oh
that's neat I don't do a lot of it but I
know a lot of you do so congratulations
Android gamers who knows when it's
coming maybe uh maybe I oh it will find
out something in I oh uh if you like to
do news news save stuff for later uh you
know press got some major updates this
week with widgets so Scott as our
resident aokp fan the man down with the
pink unicorn aokp had some some news
this week will tell us what's uh what's
on a ok peace front I
so first they released jelly bean Mr one
milestone one this is a first milestone
that they've had for jelly bean which is
basically a whole bunch of bug fixes and
also new toggles reboot and screenshot
from the toggles which is kind of nice
and very organized from there a lot of
bug fixes no reboots things like that
just nice and clean they have 1 million
downloads which is a milestone I think
that's why they released a milestone
they also released an app called a okay
push and basically what that is is you
can subscribe it's an app that's a
basically kind of like a donate app you
can subscribe to feeds the fees that you
can subscribe to our the nightly feed a
test feed and a milestone feed and
there's also a fun feat um so basically
they have a new release cycle nightlies
are going to be released every four days
which hasn't happened before it hasn't
been this quick for release cycle which
is awesome and then milestones at least
once a month and yeah some awesome stuff
so quicker releases it's what I wanted
so we have Joe Hindy right now watching
this he's the Andhra thority app guy and
you know Joe when I said the boring part
of the show was was apps I didn't mean
that you know your whole entire you know
what you do is boring I just meant our
show your app reviews are great you do a
good job you know yeah we weren't I
wasn't laying the smackdown on you know
i'm kidding HUD we were we were no jijou
yeah i really like your uh i like how
you go out there you find the underdog
you know that the diamonds in the rough
you know the apps that you know art on
the top 50 you know downwards you know
that people have sometimes a tendency to
to not find so thats that's nice
help give some lonely developers a few
bucks maybe you can you know maybe
interview some of these lonely
developers in future segments not with
that so with that simply see this see
this show the show is good this segment
is actually good for you Jill anyway is
there enough rambling Alana you guys
don't even care about I'm talking about
all right so let's move on to some news
dan carriers do LTE and other things
right yeah so so last week we mentioned
that sprint was rumored to be launching
LTE in some 21 cities today they made
that official they also that actually
brings so much for total 88 cities that
they cover so it's kind of a lot kind of
that really they're promising some
hundred and seventy plus in the next few
months and they also today named 33 of
those so that's a pretty big chunk on
there they're building it's slow their
LTE is slow kind of a bummer for sprint
users can deny 3g phone yeah I prefer
edge yeah okay only get us because it's
best when I XLT v8 but verizon is also
expanding their LTE footprint Derek Ross
is finally on the list and you can whine
about that in his focus on G+ all on his
own um but meanwhile some 90,000 people
have cited online petition asking
verizon to end their contracts um I
believe doubt that's gonna go anywhere
but that is a crapload of people yeah
it's not going to happen but that's fine
that's what that's what there's the CEO
Verizon actually said he's like if
people want to get rid of a contract
yeah let us know and then boom yeah boom
90,000 dv8000 people like we call it
ignored so what they're gonna do is keep
the share plans it simply be like
prepaid they're just gonna stop
subsidizing phones and think that's what
people really want ya know they're gonna
let you pay full price for the phone and
then charge more for the service yeah
exactly then pay exact same prices that
you're paying now yeah exactly no it's
gonna be terrible um meanwhile though
verizon is rumored to be trying to lease
or potentially buy some 1.5 billion
dollars with the spectrum from clearwire
which could certainly help them out of
their financial woes if sprint ends up
not having the cash to keep bailing them
out um and speaking of sprint and
getting bailed out we all know that
Softbank had made a little over a twenty
billion dollar offer to buy sprint they
still claim that that deal is gonna
close by July first of this year uh but
Dish Network surprised everybody by
dropping a 25 point five billion dollar
bid on sprint so there's certainly some
competition to buy sprint now that it's
clear that they're on the market um so
yeah Dish Network desperately trying to
buy their way into the cell phone market
meanwhile softbank trying to buy their
way into the u.s. they have suggested
that they are willing to pony up some
extra cash since their bid is about five
billion five and a half billion dollars
short of dishes even if softbank's
losses though they stand to make about
four billion dollars off the deal only
it's not like the AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile by out
where 18t had to fork over tons of cash
Sprint's only going to lose about 600
million out of that and then there are
other sort of related things that
Softbank will do to make a crapload of
additional money off of it so either way
softbank is going to be fine but it'd
definitely be interesting to see Dish
Network jump into into the carrier
market like that and then in some other
entertaining industry news in the world
of patents in the neverending appleby
Samsung trial the first one Apple has
filed yet more briefs arguing why they
need to move forward immediately with
the retrial on damages and why it would
be a horribly prejudicial to Apple if
they didn't basically Apple's argument
boils down to even if our patents get
invalidated by the
and trade office we still deserve to get
paid for the infringement because the
jury found it to be infringing so even
if these patents are totally and
completely bogus stam some should still
have to pass mine and they're arguing
it's about protecting their at
intellectual property no it's obviously
about hurting their competition this is
really just getting ridiculous how
obvious it is that Apple is just about
to hurt this competition is it that
surprising though I'm sorry is it that
surprising I mean the other companies
that they're attacking our you know
ultimately hurting them by taking their
market share and they're just trying to
stop the bleeding and this is basically
all they can do because they're not
gonna release another product you know
more than once a year well I mean they
could though they have that opportunity
to say they couldn't do anything else is
ridiculous because they could they're
sitting on a hundred Billy plus billion
dollars in cash they could do whatever
they want your like sitting on it sure
but don't blame my need to set on more
more cash than the entire United States
government has on hand as the reason why
I couldn't possibly some release another
device triple has other options and
really the terrible thing of this is
Apple spending an exorbitant amount of
money to go after all of these other
companies and the end result is going to
be Apple losing patents and losing
trademarks on things that never should
have been granted in the first place
right up until the point when all of
these companies went on this rampage of
soon crap out of each other for patents
people got patents on ridiculous crap
because everybody knew the US patent
trade office just rubber stamped every
piece of paper that comes through the
office but people weren't going around
suing on them because they knew that
they were crap right somebody's going to
challenge this patent we're going to
lose pen we stand in a better position
by sticking here saying oh we hold that
on this and not suing people about it
Apple chose to buck that trend and
they're going to lose the patents for it
right they they lost slide to unlock
injury they're losing bounce back here
losing slide to unlock here they're
losing most of their other gesture
related or shape
related patents here it's gonna end up
with Apple not having the ammunition
that they think they do I don't think
about what Apple could have bought with
that amount of money they could I've
bought their own foundries and made
their own hardware by now made hey
ludicrous amount of profit they could by
Qualcomm yeah in hard cash they could
buy out every stock of Gotham they can
launch a hostile takeover of Intel I
don't want them to so so then we have a
question here from Shane more what what
do you think of the ACLU sued against
carriers and phone companies against
Androids update progression I mean I
think they're getting really to the crux
of the problem the carriers are saying
that we have to do all this stuff in
order to support these devices and the
carriers have a legitimate position here
because verizon shouldn't need to
support Samsung's 47,000 devices that
they're selling tomorrow HTC is 12
Motorola's three or four ZTE far away
you know you've got how many different
android oems and you're asking verizon
to support all and all of their
different devices that is an unrealistic
expectation of russ and of ATT and
Sprint and t-mobile it's unrealistic to
expect them to do that nobody expects
them to that with with iOS that's why
Apple can roll out the updates faster
because they're doing the testing
they're doing the Quality Assurance they
aren't relying on verizon to do that
they aren't relying on verizon for that
1st level support and so you know when
the carriers make these claims about
needing to protect their network and
needing to do all this crap to support
all their users there right because
they're being expected to offer all of
that support right when you have a
problem with Windows you go to microsoft
support if you have a problem with the
physical hardware in your computer you
go to the dell for support you don't go
to you know whoever's providing your
internet because you know your computer
is not working well today
right it's not yeah I'm cast fault that
your Ethernet card died it's whoever
major ethernet card sir I'm on the
subject of carrier updates no it almost
makes you wonder because of the process
of it and update queues you know they're
taking that on themselves whether it
might not be better in the long run that
care is kind of outsourced that testing
we're like a third party where to take
care of it to a third party they're
really invested in having the resources
to crank out really fast instead of you
know verizon does it kind of as a
prioritized you know yet the s3 is a
really good selling phone so the s3 is
going to be ahead of sale a razr HD
probably or things like that whether if
they outsource did they could really
have a third point that gets this stuff
done a lot quicker than verizon or
anyone elses capable oh yeah now I mean
the OEM is make it harder for the
everybody to because look at sams as an
example just because they make so many
different devices the version of Android
the chips on the note 2 is not the same
as the version of Android the chips on
the s4 he is not the same as a version
of chips on the s3 mini is not the same
as the version that ships on any one of
their other devices you look at Apple
they should one operating system that
runs on all of them samsung doesn't
maintain one cohesive TouchWiz code base
that is you know everything just
branches out of it they build a
different one for each device it's too
compartmentalized within their company
the software stack bill everybody's
building their own instead of everybody
using the one samsung android and it
being pervasive across all samsung
devices same thing the same thing with
motorola same thing with all of them we
have a user comment and mark assets if
they can't support the updates and
support then the android name then
remove the android name and go back to
being a closed ecosystem just sell nexus
and nobody will claim android as a mess
but now
that gets you know that completely
defeats the purpose of Android there the
initial you know you thought of Android
was to be open do it as open source and
get on as many devices as possible yeah
that that defeats one of the original
visions in missions and goals with
Android yeah I mean the point is to
allow companies like Samsung or legs I
owe me for example as a you know a niche
company that's hoping to sell 10 million
devices this year right they build their
very own very highly customized version
of Android they put it on their own
devices that they manufacture and they
sell them and then do so successfully
right but they maintain a cohesive
platform the same version of miui that
runs on the my two runs on the Maya one
it's cohesive they maintain their
software stack Samsung is free to make
their own version and ship it than they
do but they don't take appropriate care
for their product so Dan would you agree
with me saying that androids greatest
strength is also androids greatest
weakness that don't mean that being open
source sure and I think that that's true
of any open source software is that
being open source is both a strength and
a weakness I think that's also true
proprietary software though I mean I had
not to brush off the comment but I think
that it's true all over the place of
course bad things can happen because of
open source software but you know that's
typically because somebody's not
maintaining it so people were doing
their job then they'd lesson had that
chance of happening yeah and when it
comes down to it is you have to look at
whose job is it i bought a device from
HTC is it google's job to maintain the
code for the device that they don't know
anything about specifications on they
didn't build it that wine or should they
be get responsible for it you know the
enemy i have a great verizon they didn't
build the device they're not software
engineers they're not device engineers
why are people going to HTC and saying
you're not providing me with a suit
work of Android so Dan so AOSP yeah the
garden the Nexus line doesn't have a
lock screen bug various Samsung devices
had a lock screen bug that you know and
Samsung source is closed source you know
so that that you know but obviously
besides the colonel but yes so that that
that solidifies that argument right
there that you know that but you can be
clearly close source and you can still
have the those exact same you know it's
exact same issues that just because it
wasn't it watch just closely or
maintained as closely yeah and but the
difference there is Samsung is faced
with this problem we need to catch this
bug in order to do that they have to
patch the code of 47 different devices
and then push those out get all 47 of
them approved by hundreds of carriers
all over the world then get them rolled
out to users and deal with all the
hassle that as opposed to Google
maintaining AOSP they push the update to
a OSP they push it to the source and it
boom it's filtered to all AOSP based
devices goes to the nicest for coast the
nexus 7 goes so the Nexus 10 goes to the
galaxy in essence goes to nexus s goes
to all of them at once same thing with
iOS same thing with me you I from dile
me but that is the appropriate way to
maintain your software and that's not
what Samsung does they maintain 100
different silos for every individual
project and so pushing out one update to
a fixed and all of their underlying code
requires a hundred different silos to do
the exact same thing that's why you're
getting slow updates it's because the
companies that are building these custom
overlays aren't maintaining their
software and then you the consumer are
left with you know the fallout from that
and the argument is why maintain it when
you know the lifespan of a toys is so
short and you know and then you go to
the fact that the contracts are long and
you know they have to keep the devices
will tough luck go with somebody that
has a no carrier you know fork you're
running over right away I mean it's all
avoidable if you really want to but you
have to be somewhat educated in order
to actually do it because nobody you
know oh I believe John you wanted to say
say something about this it's an
interesting situation of being it's
probably the first time in a software
experience that this expectation has
been put because Microsoft if you look
at Windows people are happy to be on XP
for people are still on XP yep um you
look at him the this Hardware controlled
model with phones is really the first
example Android is often equated to
Linux in terms of that whole deal but
the thing with Linux is linux unlike
android doesn't have the advantage of
applications that are compatible across
the board Linux is big Achilles heel has
been the lack of a package manager that
will work universally on say you bun to
fedora or so you know if Android was
Linux it doesn't matter if samsung or
HTC or whoever's it does it because it
still runs the applications so when you
don't break third-party applications
that part of it still works so where
does open source come into play it gets
modified and kind of like the lockscreen
boat like was mentioned because it
affects Samsung it only affects samsung
users it doesn't affect the whole
ecosystem whereas what iOS which also
has a lot of screen bug it affects every
single user in that ecosystem so there's
some obscurity that comes with open
source that can i you could say helps in
that sense kind of like with a linux
distribution if you're running slackware
there's a you're probably not going to
get a virus and you're probably not ever
going to get a virus because nobody's
going to invest effort to specifically
exploit something that's so small are so
broken from the rest out of it so when
you kind of have everything a fully
stacked deck in one investor downside of
closed source is that when everybody is
on this exact same thing it's so much
easier to target when it comes to
vulnerabilities when it comes to things
like that
so yeah yeah I mean I do agree androids
biggest strength is also its biggest
weakness but it's also our processional
thing because this is really the first
time that an open source operating
system has reached the consumer love
yeah where it just has existed before at
all and the expectations and the
perception of it is completely different
than what you've seen from anything in
the past okay um let me talk about this
giveaway real quick here I know if
you've already watched me same twice

case two things you could get any
windows for free but the fridge okay
well you guys are watching us on youtube
buffy is like what you're seeing you get
subscribed also if you want to follow us
there here are all the ways it's were on
soundcloud if you don't want to watch us
although we didn't see much of Derek
tonight because he had the phone in
front of him which was no it was
bearable it was bearable yeah we're also
on google currents they have the mp3
podcast integration in this stream us
from their run the stitcher radio iTunes
they also do have an RSS feed on that we
do a post step out every show and what
we talked about in Sky News in there
anybody have anything to add um you know
well we didn't talk about glass besides
the glass app but people start getting
glass this week um very cool interesting
conversation next week yeah I said you
know a handful people got already more
and more people are going to be getting
it over L you know the next few days and
ultimately they'll be thousands and
thousands of people to get it probably
over the next month or two to see that
video the go-kart above Joshua Maria you
know that was pretty cool yeah very cool
I've been been watching it I'm excited I
johnathan franklin dyer if i had glass
contest winners and so we don't know
when we're going to be able to get it
yet i'm going to guess based on
completely nothing and say june first
because that
that way it's a few weeks after i/o and
things can die down a little bit for
google but that's just me who knows when
it'll be but it's exciting times uh all
sorts in a glass information is coming
out you know got the official specs you
know we got you know how that you know
just some insights and how glass
actually works I you know how you can
use it for voice commands and the
trackpad and recording videos and you
know taking pictures and so forth with
people's consent you know all sorts of
neat stuff so yeah we will obviously we
talk more about glass as more and more
develops in the near future and as
special especially with John and I doing
here like you're like a month and a half
or a month like we're gonna have like
hangout ception like John and I are
going to be joining from our webcam out
and it's never going to join from glass
too so you could you'll be like hangouts
it glass ception hangout ception or
something yeah that are we can do a
myspace style we John I could go to the
bathroom and stand there in front of the
mirror so you guys could you guys could
see us in front of a mirror and just do
the show through glass now the only
thing is that we got to uh but we got to
practice our duck faces no John yeah we
can do that okay alright so I'm being
told to shut up so I guys have a good
night thanks for watching thanks for
their for listening thanks for
subscribing and all the other good stuff
have a good night you guys mega</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
