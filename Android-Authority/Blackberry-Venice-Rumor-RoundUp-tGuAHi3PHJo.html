brought to you by domain.com yes this
device is real an android-powered
blackberry smartphone it's called Venice
and if you listen real carefully you can
hear those tactile keyboard geeks giddy
with excitement here's what we know the
whole tech world is raging about the
blackberry Venice design now we've had
pretty good keyboards in the Android
world before but none of them have quite
matched BlackBerry's quality this is why
our hearts dropped when we first heard
the rumors that an android blackberry
smartphone was probably coming on the
surface the blackberry Venice looks a
lot like a regular black slab one of the
earlier images from evleaks shows a
phone with a speaker below the screen a
microUSB port and the 3.5 millimeter
headset jack as well as what seems like
a curved screen displaying a rather
clean version of Android this
information was great and all but it was
the leaks that came that really got the
conversation going this thing has a
tactile keyboard and it's hidden right
under the screen you can literally slide
the screen section upwards to find a
beautiful button layout the image
showing this part of the phone also came
from Evan Blass who then decided to
treat us with an actual video of the
phone now what has us most excited are
the leak shots we saw on the internet
last weekend these are true photos of
the phone not press renders or fancy
animations the phone looks just as we
expected and we can finally see it from
all angles the latest rumours state that
the phone will come with a five point
four inch qhd that's 2560 x 1440 display
this would put blackberry Venice up with
the big boys it's said to also be a
powerhouse though we should expect no
less now the rumored spec list is still
not worthy of too much trust mostly
because it was not back by any other
sources or separate rumors these facts
came from n for BB which claims the hens
that will feature at 1.8 giga hertz hexa
core qualcomm snapdragon 808 processor
and 3 gigabytes of ram now when it comes
to the camera we know the pixel count on
photos will be pretty high rumours
suggest the phone will come with an 18
megapixel rear facing camera the images
also show some in
around the lens with the words o is and
fast focus so we can assume that the
camel will tell both mention features on
the front side the Venice is said to
feature a 5 megapixel camera nothing out
of the ordinary here but it should
definitely be good enough for those old
selfies now we know the blackberry
Venice will come with Android but we're
not sure which version with Android 6.0
marshmallow right around the corner we
certainly hope the new handset will
adopt the latest and greatest mobile OS
iteration from google what's interesting
is that this phone software features
will be more than just about Android and
its benefits over blackberry 10
blackberry CEO john chen previously
mentioned that if he could find a way to
secure an android phone he would build
that and this seems to hold true for
Venice a list of installed apps acquired
by evleaks shows us a bevy of blackberry
apps being pre-installed on the Android
handset this will include popular
services like blackberry messenger hub
calendar tasks notes emails and more now
Evan blasts where's this phone will be
launching in November and that it's
coming to all four major US carriers
other than that details on availability
are scarce no rumors on pricing have
emerged either but don't expect the
blackberry Venice to be cheap it has
high-end specs and likely a high-end
focus on security which will make it a
valuable asset to many enterprise users
not to mention this smartphone will be
all the hype among previous BlackBerry
users now for those of you who don't
know blackberry used to be the thing
they were the power users smartphone of
choice now there was many other feature
phones you could get in the mid 2000s
but if you had to get serious work done
and we're able to type and many people
would be able to type like long emails
on those tactile keyboards they were
very useful for that you got a
blackberry device and they were
completely dominant there a Canadian
company Canadians are very very proud of
blackberry for a long time they're based
out of here in southern Ontario
southwestern Ontario I got high hopes
for it how many of you people would
actually buy at blackberry Venice an
android-powered blackberry device are
you excited what will it mean do you
think this opens up the future for
blackberry I'd love to hear your
