original android hangout show on google+
I'm derrick rose and I'm Scott Anderson
this week we're joined with Dan Charlton
Jon Kerley and John Franklin thanks guys
for being here thanks for having us I'm
gonna be here alright so let's see we're
going to talk about this week we're
gonna hit up some Android ecosystem news
talk about some new devices that are
leaving the market coming onto the
market it has been a whole ton of app
updates this week google updated but
won't say everything but for argument's
say we really updated every stance end
devices we have some devices getting
jellybean devices getting unlocked
carrier news you know LTE all the things
pretty much everywhere you know every
carriers give an LTE all i got except
for tmobile but their hspa+ all the
things and well as usual we'll hit up
some patent wars before we call it a
night so so let's talk about some
Android ecosystem updates those of you
that are watching across the pond which
we know some of you are over in the UK
you'll be happy to know that play
magazines is now available in the UK so
if you wanted to check out some
magazines in Google Play now you can if
you're watching from Russia which we
know that some of you are play books and
magazines are now available in Russia so
you can go ahead and check those out get
books and magazines over Russia that's
cool oh you know global domination phase
two dr.
yeah oh poor Derek will wait for Derek
to come back right now I don't think
they're just going to come back that's
that's that 2g network for you oh you
got rid of the teaching our hangouts on
air does this I don't know why usually
happens during his introduction as well
yeah and he's back and I'm back you know
this is this that's getting annoying all
right so do you guys say anything you
just like say damn it Derek left now we
were yeah that pretty much sums up yeah
alright so the hangouts messed up is
sometimes as the usual sometimes not um
right so so Dell is officially leaving
the android smartphone market if you uh
interesting enough you know the only
smartphones that the DoD was allowed to
use were smartphones made by dell so now
the dell was officially not making
anymore I wonder what they're going to
do what vendor they're gonna approve
next um the nook in the Nook HD+ are now
available at Walmart for 199 and 269
respectively um you know Walmart's
largest retailer in the world are one of
the largest I'm not sure their sales
numbers but there that's that's great
for you know for barnes and noble the
nook devices and get more exposure for
them and on the android nexus front
nexus 4 images without a word or
actually there was a word jbq said i
cannot comment on that the nexus 4
images disappear from the google
download site and apparently the nexus
10 images actually we're never there and
people didn't care or didn't notice
because the next score was there a but
so nexus 10 binaries were there well
they're not there now so they this is
just the nexus 4 that was affected the
nexus 4 binaries were never there but
the images were sinless reporting that
both were taken down but only one was
ever actually there one was ever
actually I than the nexus 4 was the only
one that was ever actually there yes so
people were wondering you know
speculating why were the nexus 4 images
remove was it is it because in licensing
is it because of LTE is it because of
something we don't know is it because
the Android 4.2 point2 is coming out I
mean there's a lot of reasons uh dan
what what do you want to add to the
rumor mill as to why you think they were
removed some of the rumors that I've
seen and I think that this is is
potentially has some Samara to it is the
hit after people hacked it to run on a
couple of places that ATT actually has
ltd to play it on AWS it's running into
some sec problems so in order to
actually be allowed to operate on any
particular frequency in this country you
have to get approved to do so by the FCC
and the next four is not approved to do
so on LTE / AWS and so some enterprising
XD I users made it do that and the
government tends to frown on that and so
complete not going to do anything I mean
it's all in the software didn't require
any special software hacks or anything
if they just found out it works exactly
and so I think Google is likely to
update things such that that is disabled
in the hardware or in the software app
yeah so those of you don't remember are
one hundred percent shore in the process
they just brought up the phone testing
menu with its and entering a bunch of
pound signs asterisk numbers into the
phone it brings up the phone testing
menu and there's also a nap you get the
Play Store to bring up the phone testing
menu you may be able to do that and
Android for you know since time began
it's something you can do it on most
phones yeah so when you bring that up
you have the option to then switch bands
and you know and since the nexus 4
technically has kind of sort of has LTE
when use when you select alt it uses
band 4 and found out there's off
argument's sake maybe ten places AT&amp;amp;T
has banned for AWS here in the US and if
you just happen to live in one of those
ten cities it has a very small
deployment you're going to get LTE
you're not supposed to but it's it the
hardware supports it I said there's not
too many people that can actually do
that like you know like dan and I said
it's only very very very select few
places in the US well that's going to
change when he rolls out their LTE but
in general yeah right now there's not a
lot places you can do that but still
it's not licensed to do that at all and
so Google probably had to stop
distributing software that it's allowed
to do things that the government says it
can't yeah I I agree with that I think
that was probably the case there's one
point brought up in the comments by John
likes the the nexus 10 images were
removed because they were formatted for
16 gigabyte version ah well that's more
of a maintenance thing
my smells like so that does make perfect
sense yeah they found an issue with the
images that release so they took him
down uh yes so um some of you that are
watching right now may have may have
noticed that the past couple weeks I
didn't get disconnected during the show
and now one of those viewers is back it
hasn't watched in a couple weeks and I
randomly get disconnected i think it's a
conspiracy theory um so so let's move on
here let's uh let's talk about some
exciting news that is part of the
Android ecosystem it also affects our
very own dan Charlton as you could if
you're an avid here the show I used to
introduce Dan as from diamond team it is
a colonel used to be were also roms to
but now it's a minute mainly mainly
Colonel uh that Dan has been doing for
quite some time he develops kernels for
I'm gonna just make it easy and saving
pretty much every HTC device there is so
I got to the point when I would do
introductions I started feeling bad that
Dan doesn't do colonels anymore you know
so well dan doesn't do kernels and
publicly release them anymore because
he's busy what life happens you know job
moving being awesome I mean he uh he
didn't have time he didn't want a lesson
is awesome to get back into curl
developing until recently dan has made a
nexus for kernel and he's also correct
me from wrong working on its sister the
optimus G huh working with a couple of
other developers on that one and some
some breaking news that somehow somebody
in this hangout Ross might be the
maintainer for the team it Colonel for
the DNA as of last night dan and I were
working on the teaneck kernel for that I
well I have a lot of work to do still
but fingers crossed confident I'm gonna
be running a team it Colonel compiled
and chciala all the gift commits cherry
picked and
pulled into the kernel and run that here
very very shortly so I'm excited that
I'm gonna be running my own kernel with
the help of Dan and we're gonna bring
team it back from back from the grave I
still resent the implication that it was
dead but yes I really haven't done a lot
of public work lately I've been doing a
lot of behind-the-scenes work with other
developers here and there but been just
generally busy with life and not really
not really working on it and a lot of
the HTC devices lately have been such a
pain in the neck to work on that I've
just not been motivated so what would
change that you decided to you said hey
I want to get back into you know a
little bit of Colonel diving that you
decided to do with the nexus 4 well I
noticed that uh even on stock it will do
this it has a issue where it basically
idols about about blingy guards on the
single core which I mean that's less
than a hundred percent of one out of
four cores so really not a whole lot in
the total processing potential but
that's a lot to do just sitting around
idling on it all the time so there's a
lot of ways where there's extra battery
power to be saved and tweaks here and
there to make things better and so I
mean now that now that I have a Nexus
device and it's much easier to actually
do these things on it I don't have to
fight with it all the time I'm killing a
lot more motivation there yeah it's fun
you know I'm excited I'm gonna you know
be a maintainer for the device that I
have which we'll get to talking about a
little bit later in the show cuz
apparently everyone needs to know why
I'm not using the Nexus device and I'm
using an HTC device the horror alright
so let's talk about some after news
that's gonna get off the ecosystem in
T&amp;amp;T Matt news all right so uh Google's
been on a tear with updates lately um a
big tear and some of them have been
small update some of them have been very
significant updates and complete
overhauls so let's start off with play
magazines basically it got support for
future in our activity um listen what
that means maybe
different types of places that they can
get it not quite sure the search google
search got updated it was a minor update
well we don't really know because
there's no changelog but they pushed a
big one and then they had a small one so
we're not really sure what that update
entails um shame on you for no changelog
drive I got bug fixes and other
improvements I've noticed a lot smoother
and less bugs it's nice other
improvements is not a changelog people
need to understand what a change log is
um just people right like some random
developer Diaries can change log okay
fine got that guy needs to learn how to
really this is google come on get it
together at least a freaking changelog
it's not that hard it takes you five
minutes to sit down and really do an
epidemic is think about it how many apps
that have been updated in the past so
many months have the old changelog when
they're update yeah it's like they're
generalizing it way too much a few
things you know lots of people well no
but ever but even when they're allocated
you know like I I really wanted to know
about one of the updates this week that
came out with Google search you know and
it didn't say anything I was upset about
it he has ever looked at a google chrome
for a desktop they're stable Channel I
mean it gives pretty great detail of the
fixes and stuff and the holes that were
you know closed right like I don't hear
bug fixes I don't know what bugs were
fixed yeah how it affects me Rick I i am
not a huge current user google currents
dan you are i'm excited i saw the new UI
and I'm excited I'm thing when I start
using it a little bit more so I tell us
a little bit more about what went on in
that update it was a pretty significant
update it brought in a new widget which
is very nice more of the cards kind of
you I that they've been going towards
that adds an addition sidebar so it's a
lot easier to navigate through your
different news outlets some scanning
improvements
you can mark different stories more
easily for read and unread including
having it automatically hide things
you've already read saving stories for
future reference basically just starring
and favoriting them as well as breaking
stories ranked by google news so it's
definitely a big update I've noticed it
being a lot faster than it had been
previously and kind of chugged before um
I mean it definitely is a huge
improvement on Curren yeah that's deal I
think it's interesting how it integrates
with Google News it pulls in you know
breaking stories from there uh yeah I
wish that that integration with the
other directions like when I went to
Google News on my desktop it was pulling
from my like current sources for it
actually looked like google currents
instead of his care so much about the UI
I care about the random nonsensical news
outlets that google news feeds me that
aren't like aren't outlets that I care
about never the best let's warm water
just like them odds a little bit yeah
yeah yeah like currents under
subscribing to particular like
particular publications I'm obviously
selecting my news in that regard but
you'd think that they then in a news
aggregator pull from the obligations
that they know i'm selecting well
basically from day one of currents
release it was slow and now it is a lot
faster so great job google on that in
that respect it's definitely improved
there's this one place that that's one
place they could afford to consolidate a
little bit more to google reader and
have it all readers is dying a slow
death it is greater because of the
simplicity and the low data usage it's
phenomenal in my personal view for what
i use it for I whenever I got my nexus 7
I stopped using reader and I started to
use currents is my main news aggregate
and I love currents now I I use it all
the time I you know I like reader
because I obviously i still use that
every day in the desktop but uh I I like
current has turned into a beautiful app
you know it it's it
a lot better than it was when i first
got released and I I really like it hey
uh YouTube viewer wants to see your
phone ah Dirk my phone okay yeah so uh
HTC droid DNA and I have a cruzerlite
TPU enduro defied case that I got on it
I'm not normally a case user I haven't
used a case uh ever in my mom will say
ever I may be used one ten years ago who
knows how to use a case in a long time I
don't like cases because nowadays no
manufacturers spend so much research and
development to make these things light
thin sexy and what do we do we
bastardized and put a case on it right
away Joe knocks yeah yeah but uh you
know what did this phone is so thin that
this case doesn't increase its footprint
really at all and it's a little slippery
and plus I picked the damn thing up and
I don't know which way i picked it up if
it's upside down right side up and it
really annoys me and I was like well you
know I'm gonna get a case they're only
nine bucks um look at why cuz there's a
person's on one end wasn't a giveaway
okay when it when this then when you
pick this thing up and the alarms going
off you know I don't want to sit there
and feel around it you know trying to
find the hole you know I let those go by
no but um it's a Electra fun you know I
hate the UI I hate sense fences garbage
but I love this film I really do Russell
Holly he's a smart guy should listen to
him the beginning when he told me not to
buy the nexus 4 not to try to use it on
future that I was gonna hate it I
thought I told her to yeah but I tried
to make you believe opponents want you
to get instead i prime used the nexus 4
on 2g in my area cuz that's all i have
here for two weeks i use this the hell
out of that thing and you know what I I
can't do it 2g sucks so I went with the
next best thing it has the same process
or enter the nexus 4 does has a 1080p
screen sure anchoress looks a little
weird that's because the screen is too
awesome for ingress you know like
that's the first time I've ever heard
Derrick Rose dish ingress ingress
ingress is a good time I like the phone
I do and crews were like you know we've
had them on the show before they're
they're good people I'll plug them for a
second you know go ahead and their cases
are cheap ten bucks or so maybe you know
15 bucks uh they're nice they're it's
TPU no it's not rubber it's not plastic
you know it's some space-age material
you know it's a it's not bad um it's
it's it's not too hard it's not to solve
it I like the case and I got one for my
wife on she has my galaxy nexus now she
loves it she likes the case and she's
not really a case person either oh I'm
not watching one either i had one on the
nexus 7 l will say they pay a lot of
attention to details for the cutouts for
them you know where a lot of cases kind
of fall short especially with a USB
ports and headphone jacks they pay a lot
of attention to detail I'd go a good
question your old devices do you guys
just sell them right away or do you give
them to other people um close to you I
sell them he's alone I normally sell
them but my wife was my wife was stuck
with this guy here the my original phone
which she got a different she had one of
her own but the HTC incredible and I
couldn't let my wife use this old
dinosaur anymore so I gave her my what
gave her my galaxy nexus so it's still
being used in a year from now whenever
that phones ready to be sold i'll sell
it i'll give her the DNA and i'll get
the nexus 5 or whatever yeah yeah i've
got the three that i just picked up plus
two more that I've either loaned or give
it away to other people it dan has an
arsenal phonesat usual item ok let's
move on what employers we go off on a
tangent there sir yeah so let's move on
to some more app updates youtube is
another one I got a revamped UI for
tenish Hamlet tablets finally um it's
just kind of like the other one but a
little bit more features kind of things
look better it's nice UI overhaul and it
has bug fixes
for all devices it is general but I on
my current phone galaxy nexus that's
just for the mail um I sense that it is
less buggy which is nice especially on a
data connection with a carrier then
sound search it made its first debut in
the Play Store pretty cool a personal
opinion it's really slow but it is
accurate from what I've used it for
comparing it to other services like
Shazam and SoundCloud or soundhound um
it doesn't compare and speed at all
alright so Scott like Shazam and
SoundCloud and they do sound hound sorry
they don't take you to the google play
store to buy music for Google Play they
don't burrito if you're in a sound will
link you to other places even if you're
under Google's uh ecosystem you know I
sound search is great I use it all the
time um like what's significant about
this being released on the Play Store is
that not all phones had it I mean it's a
google app most phones had it but for
example the HTC DNA did not have it and
because of it the latest Google place um
I'm sorry the latest Google now Google
search update where you could do the
voice command and say what song is this
it didn't work on the DNA because stock
DNA doesn't include that APK it doesn't
include that application that sound
search so google released it to play
stores now everybody can install it if
your rom is missing it no big deal it's
just a gap to install from the store um
sound search still doesn't work with the
voice command it still says that your
device is unsupported i'm assuming the
this is a big assumption on my part but
i'm assuming the search update that
happened this week yesterday i believe
that is going to fix that i assume that
the last part is they have to basically
just update the
server-side patch that says this device
is no longer supported make that say you
need to have XYZ application installed
in this case sound search and if you
have it give the result back if you
don't say if you want this to work you
must go here and download this app I
think the update is probably just the
linking to the Play Store because they
were able to fix the DNA with a
server-side fix so they can turn it back
on with a server-side fixed yeah so if
they turn that back on then hopefully
search will just say you need to install
this app if you don't matter and that's
I mean that's our gas it I still can't
use it I don't know if I would ever use
it besides one or two times because
honestly it's easier just attack the
widget instead of you know hitting the
microphone button Todd anything and then
talking to it when I could just tap the
widget info but but hey I want to be
able to do it damn it because it's a
feature and samantha mclean my main
phone is a Galaxy Nexus right now um in
a couple of days it will be a nexus 4
but what you okay moving on a Google
Calendar got updated um the Play Store
version right not the Play Store version
AOSP version yep and basically it has
the features of a call and go to map
directly from notifications location
suggestion on event creation very nice
and quick event creation from month view
which I believe that was in the AOSP
version create quick event I think so no
that's a new addition amina not in the
month of you oh yeah ok so it's specific
to the money ok yeah when you switch to
the month you a tip them on the way ok
and then placed or movies got updated
it's now available in 11 countries also
the master updates when new TV episodes
are available and it fixes to make
downloads more resilient is that 11 more
countries or 11 total countries now
available in 11
total countries wow they're they're
moving along though no that's five
percent of the world's countries you
know it doesn't I'm sure of google 15
percent I'm sure Google wants to have
movies available everywhere but it's not
google's fault it's you know licensing
regulations you know it's the movie
industry saying you know we want money
damn it a lot I'm sure it's not google
being evil here it's not their fault
John on Google+ state so we need an IRC
channel I agree with him you know what
we do have more you can go there right
now I'm not there but it's a register
channel on freenode android authority
all one word go there talk amongst
yourselves maybe uh I'll load up X chat
and join a few seconds go I i would so
move on our google or actually implement
that you know I made that our channel
like I really gonna do I mean I made it
six months ago and then we never used it
maybe we start using it just you know
whether you ops in that channel that's
awesome let ya buddy let's use it and
next week you know and see if it works
and works will continue to use it yeah
we go you can join now if you want give
a test drive alright so google earth
again generic bug fixes I haven't
noticed anything on google offers got a
greatly improved purchase purchase
experience which is true although there
is still have some faults and then it
has some assorted bug fixes not just bug
fixes assorted they have two edition
knows me um Google Shopper bug fixes UI
enhancements and performance
improvements it is a lot faster and they
still need to do some stuff with picture
picture cash it's not as good as it
needs to be and then the Play Store got
updated as well you've got some bug
fixes we assume there's no real change
log for it and maps for iOS google maps
for iOS got released which is okay news
used for people in iOS getting lost now
you know and have them come and save you
in Australia yeah so I mean that's big
news um comparison between the Android
version and the Apple version I haven't
seen an article that compares them
directly I mean I haven't either so I I
mean if anybody is writing articles i
would love to see a comparison because
that would be interesting because then I
would know what they have in what we
have yeah I mean it looks like there's a
lot of new UI drawing pretty heavily
from the google now style um which
person I think looks great and there's a
lot cleaner than the Android version
yeah i understand it still has a feature
deficit compared to the android version
it does the firt the verge did a pre
they mentioned Android Maps in their
review of iOS maps I do like the look of
iOS maps better but they did have the
benefit of starting from scratch so yeah
me you know you're talking about an
android situation from bringing changes
that have to also work for Gingerbread
and for your users and you know they're
not building onto an existing platforms
so the thing the main thing that Android
has over still is along the lines of
like a places and location share whether
I mean they have most of that but uh
like latitude know that I can I can't
verify was meant as there and also
immediate controls if you want to do
stuff it's you know pretty much there um
that was I've written article about that
and that made a lot of sense okay and
then you know how you know Facebook one
of the biggest social networks in the
world they say they had a shitty android
app just it was horrible they added a
little bit of features and stuff then
today they added a brand new app no
html5 it's all native java it is a lot
faster and it is actually usable
um even I haven't used it for like an
old phone but for my galaxy nexus it's
like night and day oh no I have a grab a
question for those of you watching right
now on do you still use facebook on your
phone i uninstalled it a year and a half
ago when Google+ launched and I haven't
had it on any phone since plea use
facebook anymore at awesome dude I'm
just curious you know wha what are what
our viewers you know are you are you
into the end of the fbook you know
there's no i have it installed for the
sole purpose of me watching for updates
yeah cuz i'm curious to see if they ever
improve it um until it drains your
battery yeah I mean you can turn this
often it's really hard to do but
whatever but yeah and they also do have
like a when you click on a photo it's a
kind of a cool animation um Google+ kind
of need to copy that and or something
like that your picture viewing sucks ok
I think all right let's move on alright
so devices um if you are if you're
rocking the verizon galaxy s3 on stock
you'll be happy to know that jellybean
is going to come out tomorrow so
sometime tomorrow start smashing that
ff5 start smashing that check for system
update and a little trick that works
from time to time is to go in and clear
the Android services framework for stop
it clear data cache on and reboot your
phone sometimes that does that help
sometimes it doesn't it there the road
out in batches you know so it might not
be available for your device so Monday
who knows but you know what if you're
bored and you want to tap check update
do it to your heart's content um to
continue jellybeans jellybeans all the
things sprint's HTC evo 4g LTE which is
just an awesome name for a phone HTC evo
4g LTE like anyways
it's getting jellybean started that
started today and and uh Motorola's razr
HD is getting jelly bean on telstra so
congratulations users of those devices
on those carriers your you're getting
some jelly bean good you know good six
months after it was released um he doing
all with devices there was some note 3
rumors this week so some of the rumors
said that it was going to be a six point
three inch screen so all about that our
initial thoughts were wow that is huge
can you handle a six point three incher
you know that that's free that's pretty
big give me 7 i'm happy yeah oh yeah and
some of us carry around you know the the
nexus 7 which you know is a 7 inch or so
you can handle that fine so you know is
it really that big of a deal you know
some of us put the nexus 7 in our front
pocket our back pocket um and then you
look into a little bit more and you
think well is it really going to be
actually that much bigger than the
current note 2 and i'm guessing probably
not so let's talk about that's a lot at
some point 8 inches well it will look at
it here so the note the original note
was point seven eight inches by three
point two seven inches okay and had five
inches of viewable now the note 2 is
5.94 which is only about an eighth of an
inch difference by 3.17 which is
actually a little bit smaller so and
they got an extra half of an inch out of
that sao paulo jewish is actually it was
5.3 on the note one yeah do what did i
say five okay yes so the 55.3 okay so so
yeah they got its 22 inches different so
on the note 3 what if they got rid of
the bezel mayor or you know an edge
it made it much smaller made a judge
like John said and that's how you're
getting that's how you're getting me
know six point three inches you know
could that could that happen but what if
they did like Apple be made taller but
not licensed oh not oh my god stop that
but you know I don't like because 6 10
or 12 aspect ratio yeah I mean when you
get into the bezel and a larger device
like with the nexus 7 it has a bezel and
I would not like it if it didn't have a
vessel because it is actually really
nice because I don't interact with my
device when I pick it up and I
personally think that on a bigger device
like when you get past the note tues
size a bezel is kind of nice to have
actually whether you get uh you know
less screen real estate yeah usability I
think it's better yeah I know what when
I was debating whether divide the note 2
or the DNA I put the two side by side
and there's a good half inch difference
between the two and yet they're both
while the ones up you know the screen
slightly bigger but in terms of width
which that doesn't have anything you
know that where that doesn't have
anything to do with the actual well it
does but that's not the actual 5.5
inches of screen but but the width is
about a half an inch difference right
there those are the same roughly the
same length so it looks like a
microphone compared to it but they have
the same roughly in the same 5-inch
screen so i think that i think that
we're not going to notice a difference
really notice if they just get rid of
the bezel that that's my fellow that's a
big difference to hide out of just the
bezel you're talking about point 8
inches you don't have that much bezel on
the note 2 to begin with so what if
they'll they made it right down the
footprint so it's only just a little bit
larger that makes a difference in terms
of holding in your hands but that
massive difference in like usable area
there's not a remote chance that you're
going to be able to reach the far corner
of the screen with your thumb and you
know what that's why it has a stylist
yeah but it means you absolutely have to
use it as to hand with
yeah I know good thank you I was gonna
say i was using the galaxy tab the
original as my phone hacked up so I mean
you take away the bezel and seven inches
is just right fits in the pocket take
away the thickness of the galaxy tab
also and seven inches 6.3 it's not that
big nowadays that's average make it was
smaller all the time I you know I walk
around with a nexus 7 in my front pocket
in my back pocket you know and it feels
fine people ask you if that's the nexus
7 in your pocket actually today we had a
discussion about that on google+ and i
took a picture of the phone in my pocket
and got all sorts of comments about that
because i was trying to go through the
comparison is that the DNA in your
pocket or is that the nexus 7 in your
pocket that's done a google+ community
or alright so so what up next on device
is the galaxy note 2 and we keep talking
about it here uh well we're comparing it
to the rumored note 3 Adam out ler famed
XDA Android hacker did his awesome
things that he does and he unlocked the
bootloader for the galaxy note 2 this
week and John Franklin Johnny Frank he
has actually gone through the steps to
unlock the bootloader and uh John you
want to tell us a little bit about that
was your experience unlocking the
reloader this pretty shameless i did
wait until this morning to do it because
i didn't want to be the guinea pig for
the first the first run of this but it
is it is important to know that this is
not just a bootloader lock it's an eye
rom I'm lock which is actually higher so
Adam put out a post today reminding
people that this thing is basically
development board kind of unlocked and
you could flash anything under the Sun
on top of them so make sure that you if
you do flash flash the unlocked stock
bootloader that they provide or a
verizon stock do not
Babu motor feminine and realistically
you won't have a lot of reason or
justification to flash a boot lower form
of the carrier but just to cover it
don't do it don't do it okay do not use
odin to flash any roms anymore unless
you're flashing back to stop as far as
the exploit goes is pretty seamless the
team of people that he worked with
basically came up with the pit file they
injected it into a partition and what
you're going to do is load up his
revision rom in addition to the pit file
and flash that to you phone by Odin then
you're going to it's going to reboot
your phone adam has his casual it's a
Java applicable Java applet this step
for cross-platform atb scripting
universal Android loader and that's how
you deploys the exploits you're going to
boot up and put it into USB debugging
mode and load that up with the phone
another thing to note is if you're on
windows 7 64-bit to right click and go
to properties on the applications hit
unblock for everything to make sure that
you have that the application has the
privileges to because it's going to pull
files off of your device to cash them
for later to put back on there after you
get done with this you're going to run
the casual scriveners upon a boot your
phone back into download mode and this
is actually an insecure download mode
that allows you to pile this boot loader
on and the package is you're going to
load the pit file again in the sukkot
verizon odin package which takes about
10 seconds and you're going to run
through this you want to keep casual
open during the entirety of this and
you're going to reboot the phone it will
load back to make sure you have LTE all
the files it's cached and will give you
a notification that your unlock and
after that you're good to go it takes if
you're paying attention it takes less
than 10 minutes a lot of people had
issues with it and I would say that if
you're having issues you should make
video look at the documentation watch
his videos both
times to make sure you're doing every
single step correctly like Alexis you
definitely want to watch those videos
before you start not like oh I'll just
follow along yeah make sure you
understand what's going on before you
start messing around with us this is not
at all something you want to do based
upon a quick glance in a form or fly by
the seat of your pants because there's
no guarantee that you'll be able to go
back to stock and I'll end up with a
freak device so make absolutely sure you
follow every direction to the T and once
you do it's going to boot you back into
team win recovery and you know that's
team win recovery is the point you're
going to reboot system have casual
hoping this call notify your urine lot
and you're good to go um you know it's
pretty much gone from a lot bail secure
device to development board status
you're gonna see roms kind of start
pouring in now yeah John so are there
any uh you know d bloated rom start at
least for starting on it didn't really
deep load it but beings town put out an
initial rum and of course he's going to
come out with his own themed and
modified version that's basically just a
do decks and quit all the typical
modifications nice nice insecurities
insecurities now you we've obviously all
unlocked multiple devices before you
know compared to well compared to the
Nexus device mean Nexus device you look
at it and unlocked itself no one the DNA
was a the DNA was a little bit of pain
in the ass to to unlock it um for me I
think it was easy i evil empire what's
that get away from the evil I'm I gotta
get away from the old car I'll get away
from the evil empire whenever another
Empire comes in puts up towers here but
it was a pain in the ass but it wasn't
hard um you know same type of thing John
yo wasn't hard just a pain in the ass to
go through all the steps yeah um it's
one of those things where the more you
want to reading about it and getting
yourself hyped up about it kind of helps
you because the more the more you know
the less frustration you're going to
have so just make sure that your
informed before you try because that's
when you're going to start wanna throw
something against the wall when you get
to methods like this and speaking of
getting away from the evil empire so so
uh Scott you're on your Galaxy Nexus is
part of the evil empire right now I
can't believe calling verizon that I
like Verizon so what which carrier you
go into with a nexus 4 i'm leaning
towards t-mobile just because i'm
looking at HSPA networks and t-mobile's
is better flat out no you know hands
down and I'm in a big metropolitan area
Minneapolis so t-mobile i think is going
to be the way to go yeah well John not
um I assume your curly Jon Kerley I
assume your nexus 4 is on AT&amp;amp;T right yes
it is 3g as the house there i'll just
say hey do you have hspa+ down my in
your neck of the woods in PA i have LTE
in my area and uh uh let's just say that
my top is seven megabits per second I've
seen all my nexus 4 oh that's sad I've
seen 21 I t-mobile and it's not bad here
in the here in center in state college
area on hspa+ I saw three one day yeah
wait let me go get my s3 and I forgot 30
2 megabits for a second oh honey 42 42
okay just wait two more people join the
network that's because it's you and that
other guy on the other set of town
pretty much oh wait we got enough of
wilkes-barre to now I mean if ever go up
there so speaking of carriers let's talk
about how they keep you know growing the
their networks doing things to make
their customers hopefully happy happy
relatively speaking cutie um is actually
having six more markets to their LTE
coverage zone in Allentown I saw which
is about two and a half hours from each
that doesn't help me out I just want
wilkes-barre is up there too right yeah
yeah you have a good enough places um
and several others verizon is adding 16
more
the twentieth of December they're all
out west yeah they're all out west in
Colorado Wyoming Oregon Washington um so
yeah they saw 18 keys and raised them
ten more and tmobile those morons yeah
is officially lighting up there a iphone
friendly pcs hspa+ in five more markets
bringing it to 23 total and covering a
hundred million people which puts them
at their your end goal which is great
for t-mobile it'll be nicer when they
start building LTE but small steps um
but uh the bigger news with t-mobile is
their plans for next year not just their
their you know their network concerns
but they are going to start carrying the
iphone sometimes they're the only major
carrier in the US that hasn't been but
unlike all of the other carriers they
are going to stop using carrier
subsidies and start selling the iphone
and all other devices at full price
they're just going to kill them well I
don't think you're right about that
because what they're doing is basically
going to a plan that they currently have
where you get a discounted plan rate
monthly plan rate and then you pay on
top of that it's like ten or fifteen
dollars a month for your the full price
of your phone spread out for however
many months it takes to pay n it to 10
or 15 bucks a month so you aren't
necessarily gonna have to pay six
hundred dollars to get your phone it'll
be you know three hundred dollars with
another three hundred dollars spread out
over the next several hots that's what
they have right now they're chanting
they're going to fully on subsidized no
no they're going to keep that because
it's it's still be fully on the
subsidized price they're just allowing
you to amortize it across six months but
you're directly paying a fee for the
phone ah that is separate from your
monthly bill for service it is paid off
on a different term
that's gonna be fun it's gonna be
interesting I that that I think is gonna
stir things up a little bit yeah I mean
I think for consumers nobody wants to
pay six seven dollars per phone but on
the other hand I think it will do good
for the market if people realize that a
six-hundred-dollar phone is worth six
hundred dollars and that the crappy
tracfone that you see at Walmart that's
one hundred and twenty dollars off
contract isn't really competing with
your two hundred dollar brand new
Android and iPhones right like yeah sure
that's only eighty dollars apart but
they're not in the same league it would
be interesting he might see a a big push
there for consumer awareness anyway but
with Google coming in with a $350 device
if people start competing in that market
is going to become a lot more viable to
talk consumers into it yeah I mean
especially with Google or computing at
the three hundred price point right leg
that's the same price as a lot of brand
new devices subsidized on verizon yeah
I'm excited about the shake up and just
kind of doing in a different way I like
it yeah i mean i think that the real
reason behind it is the in order to get
the iphone you basically have to pay
apple in advance for the next five years
of all of those subsidies and then you
actually have to meet the sales goals
otherwise you're just screwed out of the
money that you spent and t-mobile is
pretty much saying screw you know we can
buy them wholesale to break from the
manufacturer just go online and buy
10,000 iPhones and resell them at full
price without dealing with all of your
contract and so this is more or
less their way to sell the iphone and
not have to deal with the Apple crap
mm-hmm no they're really the only
carrier with a network that they could
do this yep yeah so other carrier news
sprint is going to try and buy out the
rest of clearwire so the other 49 point
six percent that they don't already own
for a little over two billion dollars
but only on the condition that Softbank
gets to complete their
or seventy percent take over sprint for
twenty billion dollars in change
anything so we know where the first ten
percent of that investment is going and
in Europe everything everywhere is
targeting 17 more markets for LTE
rollout Wow day they're moving pretty
quickly in the UK and this is still all
before the Ofcom auction so they are the
only game in town so to speak so good
news for four people in the UK who use
everything everywhere in the I've heard
relatively narrow areas that they
actually cover um and then in patent
news that really hasn't been a whole lot
this week but a patent troll company
called mobile media it's got a lot of
sony and nokia own patents won a small
victory over apple patents a potential
injunction and damages hearings to come
so this is nokia and sony basically
hiding behind their little shell company
patent troll to go after Apple without
any retribution from Apple so kind of a
win for Android but kind of a dull dirty
mess in them from top to bottom I don't
think we really ever say that pet no
patents and patent trolling anything
involved with that is ever anything not
but a dirty mess yeah any of those yeah
and we never say and and in patent news
something was this awesome patent troll
today yeah I mean it's always it's
always pretty shitty quite frank yeah
yeah yeah hopefully one of these days
reform comes yeah in entertaining not
quite patent news but I guess licensing
Apple and Microsoft are apparently had a
spat over the in-app purchasing policies
through iTunes so apparently Microsoft
in their SkyDrive application for iOS
have made it so in app you can purchase
additional storage problem is if you
ever run your service through itunes for
an in-app purchase all future
made by that end user have to go through
apple so if you on your iPhone buy more
storage on SkyDrive and then later on
and your desktop computer go and buy
more storage that second transaction
still has to get piped through apple and
an apple still wants a thirty percent
cut unsurprisingly Microsoft's not
willing to give Apple a thirty percent
cut for sales that aren't actually made
through apple and so Apple is evidently
frozen their app block it all updates
them in the App Store and Microsoft is
it so yet more developers getting
annoyed with apples ridiculous in-app
purchasing policies it's it does I don't
see where they have any right to they
don't you know so they don't like I give
this guy driving storage I'm what about
a sale made through our service for
in-app purchases on the iPhone but it's
really offensive to then turn around and
demand another thirty percent cut off of
sales made elsewhere like that is just
really really arrogant and as much as
people used to complain of them it was
like you know Microsoft like Microsoft's
getting mayor's but as much as people
used to complain about Microsoft with
antitrust getting mad because they used
to put a browser on an operating system
in Europe and apples dictating so much
of their own operating system yeah
hawaii's come after because I mean the
problem that people haven't realized is
they look at oh there's competition in
the smartphone market and it's open and
you know you consumers are free to
choose Apple Android Windows Phone
blackberry whatever that is relatively
open but what's not open is the app is
the market for iOS applications right
that is a market unto itself and Apple
has absolute dictatorial control over it
in an absolute monopolistic fashion the
most ill app developers start going
after them for it it's you know it's not
going to be until really the core see
app development as its own market
so one thing we didn't talk about
earlier when we did ecosystem kind of
its Android related it's google related
and we're all here because you know
where we like elgoog a little bit so
Google announced that they they aren't
going to join the the windows RT the
windows ecosystem they're not going to
put out google apps for for windows RT
so that means you know there's not gonna
be an official you know Maps or earth or
Gmail which you can use all those in the
browser well except for Earth I guess
but that's pretty much Maps anyways so
um big news not a big deal who cares a
bad move what do you guys think I think
I'm gonna side with Darryl Barnes to say
 google on that one whoa yeah I mean
they're right until there's actually
users and people who want the apps it's
not worth their time to develop it but
they also said if that changes if people
start using these things and if there's
a market for it sure will enter that
market but right now the market doesn't
exist so why are we gonna waste your
time well boil windows RT has a giant
question mark on it I don't think
there's any doubt that the x86 version
windows 8 is going to get adoption the
hearty version on the other hand right
now is garbage yeah even they say no
windows 8 support they mean windows 8/rt
they the modern UI the Metro all that
crap the thing that nobody's like in the
first place until I use windows every
day and use Google products in desktop
mode in Chrome yeah it works just fine
nobody worried chrome is still gonna be
there yeah well and there is a Windows
RT uh um chrome yeah it just sucks
because they don't actually because
Microsoft doesn't allow them access to
the AP the operating system api's yeah
it's I just don't see Artie as a
platform competing that much on the
tablet space oh I don't either
I mean x86 legacy tablet they can
support you know backwards applications
I could see that if Intel gets a legit
mogul competitor power consumption wise
but other than that I crammed in your
tablet that's taking us we see what
happened to yours in that early life
give it some times you take off I don't
think it's gonna take off but let's see
what the adoption rate is in a year and
then if it's viable then yeah then why
the national rate seems to be the ones
that Microsoft paid for itself to give
to its own employees or they are people
accidentally bought it because it was
cheap because I thought it was an iPad
and then they realized oh wait nothing i
have actually works on it oh right ya
know they were misled into thinking that
it was a windows machine crazy so
Windows RT is the exact whose windows 8
oh yeah yeah Chuck no wait you mean I
can't run anything that I can run on the
other platform oh okay and that's a big
marketing fail or or it's not a
marketing fail and they know what
they're doing they're just trying to
push people towards it Virginia's is it
making people accidentally buy our
products I sweet have any questions here
well you wouldn't need to wrap up I know
it wasn't anything extremely exciting
this week there were there wasn't any
major news I mean actually there was
some exciting news dare cross is gonna
become a team it colonel maintainer for
the DNA that that's pretty damn exciting
i'm up in a lot where do I get one of
those cool little like graphics for my
profile at you and like Randall and BRD
have or what no comment no badge I got
five guy who made it I don't need one
man I'm just busting yelling oh but I
yeah auto shopping and whatnot then you
view the original but I don't know my
idea of graphics is microsoft paint
anything should make a month ever listen
to us that that's your homework
assignment for next week make me a
Microsoft Paint team it colonel logo and
i'll use it for the DNA and that'll be
the official tiamat DNA love ene okay
what's up wrap up your um so if you guys
are watching us and
want to listen to us later we are
available on soundcloud we are also on
stitcher radio also on podbean we've
been thinking about going exclusively on
some cloud but we'll see how that works
out in the future but we're pretty
excited about that um to go to android
authority calm and you scroll down to
the bottom right there's a second called
on air and that will be our RSS feed and
you can stay in tune with oliver goodies
their comment on youtube comment on the
Google+ page android authority google+
page we see all the comments and we are
going to be newly implementing the IRC
channel which will be nice i think it so

us there will be idling like hell over
the next week from time to time may be
popping in there and evening once or no
for a few minutes our screens will be in
there so we won't really be in there
maybe also its irc.freenode.net and then
channel android authority a said we made
it six months ago maybe it's about time
to actually use it so you'll see if we
like it oh yeah also with regards to the
IRC channel will be in there pre-show so
if you guys want to talk about anything
or if you think anything you guys want
to talk about or you want to hear about
