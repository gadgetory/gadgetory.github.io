also looks like the motor Z force but
it's not that either this is actually
the latest modular smartphone Adam
Lenovo scamp
this is the motor Z plane on Verizon's
case the Moto Z play droid while it
shares similar design language we're
dealing with the mid-range ER here so
the specs aren't as cutting edge as
those found in the other two moto
zphones visually however the Moto Z
played droid doesn't stray too far from
what we're familiar with it's glass and
metal construction which also features
the same nano coating for protection
against minor incidents with water it
slightly taller wider and thicker but
it's only by smidgen the construction
feels solid at the very least which is a
good thing there are actually two things
that really stand out with the design of
the Moto Z play droid now you could tell
you can tell but it's actually a little
bit thicker with its chassis but there's
a reason why not only because there's a
slightly larger battery in here but
there's also a three and half millimeter
headphone jack now this is something
that was taken away with the Moto Z and
the motor Z force so for me I'm pretty
happy because it means you don't have to
worry around using some sort of adapter
or remember to bring in data just use
your headphones you have it right there
at disposal and the second thing about
it is that it has that same modular
design so if you look in the back the
phone you have those same pin connector
ports on the backside here so that means
it's compatible to work with any of the
existing motor mods that are currently
available to the Moto Z and the Moto G
force so out of the box this mid-range
row foam has plenty of accessories to
choose from right now and that alone is
pretty versatile since the general size
of bone closely matches the others bones
it means we have the same 5.5 inch
AMOLED screen here however the
resolution the pound drops down to 1080p
placing it in that mid-range category
now my testing the Emlyn
panel he exhibits some favorable
qualities but it's still not as perfect
as the AMOLED screens in Samsung's
flagship s-- you can say that it's
above-average it's bright with the
maximum luminance of 517 nits so it's
visible in direct sunlight for the most
part the 7 300 Kelvin color temperature
is a tad bit on the colder side but it's
not as colder than some other AMOLED
panels we've come across finally there's
a hint of saturation with its color
reproduction in the srgb gama chart
colors such as green yellow and magenta
tend to be overblown by little so it
means that it's not perfectly calibrated
but then again some folks prefer that
like we mentioned already the screen
isn't the best from the AMOLED camp but
still has some above-average qualities
throw in a familiar feature like moto
display it means that notifications the
time and the date are all accessible at
a moment's notice you know it's a mid
ranger because it's powered by qualcomm
snapdragon 625 chip coupled with three
gigabytes of RAM and the audrina 506 GPU
superficially it moves with the same
finesse and subpoenas as its siblings
but exhibit some choppiness with its
graphics processing performance they'll
more than be capable handling the basic
stuff but we wouldn't go far I'd say
that it's the ideal thing for gamers as
it currently stands there's only a
single storage option for the Moto Z
play droid that's there two gigabytes of
internal capacity for those that require
more there is a micro SD card slot the
fingerprint sensor below the display is
just like the ones found on the Moto C
and a moto Z force use it to unlock the
phone and conversely it can lock the
phone when it's powered on by just
placing your finger over the sensor the
5.5 inch AMOLED screen is perfect for
watching videos thanks to its wide
viewing angles the punchy colors and its
sheer size as for the audio though it
comes through the earpiece it sounds
clean and crisp for the most part but
there's no thump or punchiness with its
quality so it's the kind of thing that
gets drowned out in noisy conditions
we're not at all disappointed that the
Moto Z plane droid has a thicker chassis
in fact we're happy it is because not
only is it able
to accommodate a headphone jack but also
larger 35 10 milliamp power battery now
when you have a 1080p screen instead of
one with quad HD resolution that phone
has the recipe for some serious battery
life when it comes to longevity this
phone is difficult to drain in our Wi-Fi
browsing test it managed to put up an
outstanding mark of 16 hours and 13
minutes while it's recharge time of 109
minutes using the included turbo charger
is also respectable best of all you can
always expand the battery life with one
of those battery pack moto mods the
motors E and motors ephors feature 13
megapixel and 21 megapixel cameras
respectively with the Moto z-plane Droid
it's a 16 megapixel one with an F 2.0
aperture lens you have laser and phase
detection autofocus dual LED flash and
up to 4k video recording the only thing
missing here in its arsenal is optical
image stabilization but besides that
everything else is the same
the camera app too is the same there is
a manual mode to compose a shot to your
liking as well as all this customary
modes we get in most phones like
panoramic and all the other stuff it's
not as diversified with its package like
some other phones but it gets the job
done for the most part given its
mid-range err attachment
we're actually impressed by the
performance of the 16 megapixel camera
when the conditions are ideal it snaps
some crisp and detailed images it seems
to favor a warmer tone but colors in
general have some degree of saturation
the front-facing camera that's nicely
with selfies - there's a pleasant level
of sharpness there - company it's solid
details capture our only issue with the
camera is it's longer a snapshot time
under low-light settings it does that to
gain enough exposure but the downside is
that it becomes prone to blurring at the
same time its quality becomes a bit more
grainy looking while the general tone of
the shots are softer more speckled in
the details the same results are evident
with its video recording performance
unfortunately due to lack of oh is here
videos are far more shaky so you see
more jitter in the process last thing
about the software is that
a mostly stock experience it's not pure
vanilla Android but it's close
so it's android 6.0.1 marshmallow and
the experience is whole is the same as
the Moto see in the Moto G force it does
have some some tweaks and customizations
in the form of some of the Moto stuff
we've seen the passo moto actions moto
assists and also motor display they're
all very useful and I like them but
there are some bloatware stuff from
Verizon scamp now they're not all that
obtrusive for example the default
messaging app is the message plus a from
Verizon you could switch that of course
so for me it's not a big problem it has
those bloke where out of the box now the
bigger question here is when Syd can get
the next version of Android Mugen now
who knows when but that's ultimately the
last piece to the puzzle here under
Verizon's coverage call quality in our
testing has been pretty good
what's is coming out of the earpiece are
distinct inaudible so we're lucky that
barely exhibits any sort of distortion
under noisy conditions though the volume
output could have been better
just because can easily be drowned out
by the ambient sounds that are round
don't be fooled by its looks the moto Z
play droid looks and feels like it's
modular siblings it's about the same
size and weight features the same
fingerprint sensor and also leverages
the same set of moto mods the trade-offs
for this mid-range er are mostly related
to its screen resolution and processor
and that's about it if you don't
consider yourself to be a power user
you'll be pleasantly surprised by how
the Moto Z plane droid managed to
deliberate nearly the same experience
and performance as it's a purely SPECT
siblings and yes there's a headphone
jack here too for those who don't have
the budget to spend on a flagship the
Moto Z plane droids cost places it below
it's more expensive modular relatives a
savings there is appreciated
given how it can leverage all the
existing moto mods so at launch the
phone already has a healthy selection of
accessories to choose from it might be a
mid-range row when you think about the
specs but the Moto G play droid is
really nice because you kind of get a
similar performance
out of it and on top of that you do have
the headphone jack and you also have all
those motor mods to choose from so it
has a healthy selection of accessories
right from the start so if you guys
