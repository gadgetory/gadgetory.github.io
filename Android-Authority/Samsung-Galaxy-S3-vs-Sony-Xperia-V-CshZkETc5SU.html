Android Authority channel in this
episode we're going to compare Samsung's
much celebrated quad-core super phone
the Samsung Galaxy s3 GTI 9 300 and so
nice new water and dust resistant phone
the LTE capable Sony Xperia v LT 25 I
which phone surpasses the other how or
in what way said through this quick
preview and find out with just one
glance at both phones I could instantly
see a different aesthetic philosophies
at work both phones try to keep the
exterior as simple and as minimal as
possible without sacrificing uniqueness
to me the galaxy s3s overall look
appears to be that of a flat rectangular
and smooth and pebble it looks like a
rectangular tile with edges and corners
rounded and smooth in a bit I find this
look somewhat relaxing and zen-like the
expiry on the other hand combines smooth
curves and angles it doesn't skimp on
class but doesn't scream to loud of
glamour either I find this design formal
businesslike and active the Samsung
phone is bigger I find its width and
height not as comfortable as that on the
Xperia v yet I can easily grip either
phone with one hand
both are nearly the same thickness - and
although the galaxy s3 is in fact
heavier the weight difference may not be
a big deal to many users the first time
I took a really long and hard look at
the experiece front I had an aha moment
that looks curiously similar to the
front of the galaxy s3s predecessor the
galaxy s2 but without the home button
it's an all black affair with only the
Sony wordmark
accenting the surface a galaxy s3s front
in contrast is a mix of shades black
screen dark grey bezel with brushed
metal design and metallic accents
provided by the speaker grille Samsung
logo and the edging on the elongated
home button the presence of this
physical home button on the s3 and its
absence on the Xperia v is one of the
chief differences between the two phones
there are also capacitive menu and back
buttons on each side of this home button
again the Xperia doesn't have these
types of buttons instead it has dynamic
virtual navigation buttons let's now
take a look at the sides on the Xperia v
notice
health front panel seems to your eyes
from a chrome-plated frame which makes
up its sides this frame seems to be made
of plastic the silver coating could
eventually wear away and expose to the
plastic underneath the volume keys and
power button are within easy reach by
either one thump or one index finger
they're here on just one side this hole
down here is for hanging phone
accessories on the opposite side is the
microUSB port it's covered by a
protective flap with a rubber seal to
prevent liquid penetration beside it our
dock pogo pins at the top is the
headphone jack
again I'm protected by a flap and rubber
seal the bottom edge has nothing but the
phone line on the galaxy s3 you'll find
a blueish grey plastic frame surrounding
the front still burying the brushed
metal design the frame is thicker at the
left and right sides and thinner at the
top and bottom it's a smooth and simple
design ports and buttons are equally
distributed and the control buttons are
with an easy reach by the fingers you'll
need two fingers to be able to use the
control buttons usually the thumb and
the index the power key is here at the
right and the volume keys at the
opposite side headphone jack is at the
top and microUSB port at the bottom just
as the Front's and sides of these two
phones look lovely the bags of these
films are lovelier on the galaxy s3 you
get a dark bluish grey polycarbonate
backplate with the same brushed metal
design as the phone sides and bezels
this is a removable back cover which I
like so much it's very thin and light
but it seems dirty the side the micro
SIM slot there's a slot for a micro SD
card for up to 64 gigabytes a default
battery on the s3 is a 2100 mAh lithium
ion pack with reported talktime of about
22 hours on 2g for 12 hours on 3G the
Xperia v has a plastic back cover that
curves downwards towards the centre the
matte white back contrasts nicely with a
black front and the metallic frame this
is also a removable backplate then in
light but feel sturdy there's a rubber
seal here meant to prevent dust and
liquids from seeping into the battery
compartment this one's a water sensor
texe if you've overexposed your phone to
any form of liquid the battery itself is
removable in fact you'll need to remove
it to be able to access the micro SD
card slot and the Micro SIM tray
underneath it which you'll have to pull
out with your fingernail like this this
is a 1700 mAh lithium ion pack with
reported talktime of about 7 hours the
two phones use different display
technologies HD super amoled on the
galaxy s3 and TFT LCD on the Xperia v
both are quite capable of displaying all
my delicious high-definition photos and
videos and all their crisp vibrant and
colourful glory the galaxy s3 has a
bigger screen at 4.8 inches while the
experi is at 4.3 inches yeah both
screens display at the same 1280 by 720
pixel resolution which gives the Xperia
v the upper hand with its pixel density
of 342 PPI resulting in sharper and
crisper images both screens are
protected by tough cover Corning Gorilla
Glass 2 on the s3 and scratch resistant
glass on the V between the two though I
find the galaxy s3s display sharper more
brilliant and richer in color it is more
saturated and more vibrant with whiter
whites and black or blacks resulting in
sharper contrasts but personally I
prefer the experiece less saturated and
more realistic colors the galaxy s3 is
well known among its quad-core peers it
is looked up to with deep respect
because of its Hardware superpowers and
truly it lives up to the praise that it
has been reaping performance and speed
on the galaxy s3 are smooth and nearly
seamless placed beside a quad-core
monster the dual-core Experion it's a
misperception that's easy to form in
fact they found the Xperia v quite
smooth and fluid although it's not
perfectly seamless as I noticed some
jitter and lag while web browsing
launching apps and playing HD games
those were noticeable but not a huge
disruption for me at all the galaxy s3
though offers more options for internal
storage while the exterior Vee has only
an 8 gigabyte model the galaxy s3 has 16
32 and 64 gigabyte
models both phones allow microSD storage
expansion too but the Xperia v only
allows up to 32 gigabytes while the s3
allows up to 64 both phones come with
Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich out of
the box the galaxy s3 however received
its Android 4.1.2 jelly bean update
months ago thanks to project butter
navigating the galaxy s3s TouchWiz
nature UX is buttery smooth aside from
the inherent smoothness that comes with
jellybean handy features like smart stay
smart rotation and Papa play are a
welcome addition to the TouchWiz bundle
meanwhile Sony just started rolling out
its jelly bean update for the Xperia a
few days ago we have not yet received
our share of jelly bean yeah but we did
get an Ice Cream Sandwich update
recently one thing I hated about the
update was that I needed to connect the
phone to a Windows or Mac computer just
to be able to apply the software updates
with a galaxy s3 it all happens
over-the-air and without need for a PC
but even with just Ice Cream Sandwich
the Timescape UI on the Spear via rarely
jitters or freezes one thing I like
about Sony smartphones is the emphasis
on keeping your phone experience true to
life the Xperia v comes packed with
features such as the Mobile BRAVIA
Engine 2x loud and clear Audio plus
giving you that extra multimedia punch
only real life can a Galaxy s3 and the
Xperia v both have similar connectivity
features both can share files using
Bluetooth NFC and DLNA you can even sync
the phone screen to an HDTV both can
connect to Wi-Fi Wi-Fi direct 2g and 3G
networks but they spear v has one
connectivity feature that makes the s3
envious 4G LTE although there's a galaxy
s3 variant with LTE functionality
the GTI 9 305 both also use a micro SIM
card for mobile network connectivity and
a standard microUSB port for charging
and file transfers a charging dock is
also available of her the Xperia v if
you don't feel like using the USB cable
1080p full-hd videos play smoothly on
both phones stock video player
I didn't experience any lag at all it's
like watching a movie in the cinema with
a smaller screen the gaseous 3s puppet
play feature however gives me more
flexibility when watching a movie I
don't have to switch to another app to
view my mail or messages the Sony phone
likes this or a similar function music
sounds awesome on the Xperia v
especially with extra audio controls and
enhancements such as clear Audio plus
surround sound clear stereo clear phase
and X loud music on the Xperia v sounds
even better when listened to with
headphones yet the galaxy s3 tends to
produce clearer audio through its
loudspeakers even at maximum volume
makes POVs loudspeakers create
distortion at max volume some may be
impressed by the Xperia P Colback camera
with an X more R sensor but to Samsung's
credit the galaxy s3 is 8 megapixel
camera with its CMO censor still
captures great photos in fact in bright
settings the galaxy s3s camera turns out
less noisier photos than the experi the
two phones have stock camera apps that
make photo and video capture simple and
easy
both have essential camera features such
as white balance photo effects and image
stabilization I find it very curious
that the Xperia v has no dedicated
physical shutter button the Xperia T and
TX each have one regardless you can set
the phone to capture shots either with
the on-screen button or by touching the
viewfinder the galaxy s3 doesn't have a
physical camera shutter Eater both
phones can record videos in 1080p full
HD resolution but I observed that the
autofocus for videos on the experi tends
to be a little bit slower causing blur
when fast moving from one subject to
another I didn't observe such extensive
blurring in the galaxy s3 it doesn't
need to be said again the Samsung Galaxy
s3 GTI 9 300 is definitely a great
Android smartphone packed with smart and
convenient features its processing power
isn't something that you can easily
overlook
however the experi doesn't necessarily
pale in comparison to it the Sony Xperia
v LT 25 I has several features that make
the phone one of its
find one is its ingress protection
rating of 55 and 57 which means
protection against dust against low
pressure Jets of water from all
directions and against water penetration
when submerged under 1 meter of fresh
water for up to half an hour another
special thing about the Xperia v is that
it is LTE capable supporting LTE bands
one three five seven and ten Sony and
Samsung have been making great phones
for the past few years in both the
Samsung Galaxy s3
and the Sony Xperia v are testament to
their innovation in the smartphone arena
although I leaned towards the sturdy
build and beautiful audio of a Sony
Xperia v I can't deny the call of
quad-core processing and jellybean on
the galaxy s3 what about you which phone
is right for you share your thoughts in
