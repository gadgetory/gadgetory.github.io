describe the note 8 or any of the
previous galaxy notes is productivity
but what exactly makes the note 8 a
productive phone well here are five
reasons why the note 8 is great for
productivity so the biggest and most
obvious reason why the note 8 is so
great for productivity is of course the
s-pen and with the s-pen you get a lot
of really nice software features you can
create drawings you can jot down notes
you can annotate on screen grabs you can
translate entire sentences you can now
send gifs or gifts to people which is
kind of fun and the screen off memo is
probably one of the most game-changing
features of the S Pen and I'm not that
big of an S Pen user but even I find the
screen off memo to come in handy from
time to time when I need to quickly
write something down so I think that
says a lot about that feature itself but
outside of these software tricks
the S Pen just has a lot of utility in
general you can write on PDF files you
can work with Excel spreadsheets a lot
easier it's kind of like using a mouse
instead of using a trackpad it's just a
lot more accurate you have finer control
and it's also a lot faster and I think
that's where the S Pen is a really
powerful tool the second reason why the
note 8 is great for productivity is
multi window and multi window isn't
anything new it's been around for a
really long time and it's also a native
feature of Android now so a ton of
phones have this feature but Samsung
basically pioneered multi window and the
experience is still slightly better on
Samsung phones because you have a
feature called app pairing which lets
you pair two apps together and open them
up simultaneously in multi window view
so if you have two apps that you use
together pretty frequently app pairing
makes that process a lot easier so multi
window is still a much faster and more
convenient experience on the note 8
reason number three is a feature called
dual messenger and don't messenger
basically lets you run two instances of
the same app at one time and this is
really great for applications that don't
have multiple user login support so
snapchat for example you can have
instance for your personal account and
then another instance for your business
account if you happen to use social
media to spread information about your
business this is where a feature like
dual messenger can really come in handy
for work purposes next up is a feature
called the secure folder and the secure
folder will protect any information that
you want to keep private or any sort of
sensitive information that you might
have and even if somebody has access to
your phone they won't be able to access
the secure folder because it does
require a password a pin or a pattern or
any one of samsung's biometric security
measures like the fingerprint sensor or
the iris scanning and you can place
anything inside of this cure folder that
you want any application or even certain
accounts like a business email account
that you want protected you can place
inside of this folder so it's a really
great feature to have if you happen to
use your phone for both work and play
and it's just a great feature in general
for anyone who wants to protect any sort
of sensitive information the fifth and
final reason why the note a is great for
productivity is the one handed mode and
a ton of phones out there have a one
handed mode but it's especially useful
on a phone as tall as the note 8 and
it's also really easy to access with
just a triple tap of the home button and
when you're trying to be productive
while on the go you need to be able to
use your phone one-handed and that's
where the one-handed mode really comes
in handy yeah handy so there you have it
