handy the Android authority app guy the
Google Play Store is great fantastic
even but there are points where you may
want to just try something else for a
little while so in this video we'll show
you the best Google Play alternatives
for Android number eight on our list is
a fun little app called apps fire this
app is reminiscent of tap to where the
interface is driven by a number of
horizontal lists unlike the Play Store
and most Play Store alternatives apps
fire tries to fit as much as possible
into a single screen there's nothing
really outrageously wonderful about apps
fire but it does do a lot of smaller
stuff it told me what apps can be moved
to my SD card it recommended apps based
on the Snapdragon processor in the Nexus
4 the overall experience is a tad
lackluster but the small stuff makes it
worth putting on this list next up is an
app called f-droid this Play Store
replacement app will feel familiar and
wonderful to pretty much any fan of
Linux instead of having a store and
instead shows you the available apps
based on what repositories you have it
comes with the standard f-droid
repository but you can add additional
ones if you want and it's minimal it's
quick and it works most of the stuff on
there is free and you can even see what
licenses each app has everything is open
source which is a huge plus and while
the selection isn't very huge there are
often open source alternatives to most
popular apps if jar is next on our list
and this one is probably the best when
it comes to downloading and trying apps
you normally wouldn't download or try
the interface is ridiculously simple and
it doesn't even give you things like
categories but people still somehow
liked it ok here's how it works you
download the absent get jar and you're
given gold coins these gold coins can
then be used in in-app purchases and the
other various apps this is kind of cool
because it encourages people to try apps
they otherwise might not have tried and
users can use the gold coins instead of
money to get extra stuff in the apps
they do like it's a pretty nifty system
if you're looking to try new things
number five on our list is one you may
not be expecting yes the Opera browser
one of the many features added to the
new browser is an app store so if you're
in the market for a Play Store
alternative and a browser well here's a
potential two birds one stone scenario
for more on the browser side of things
we actually reviewed opera browser just
head to our YouTube page to find it as
with most of these the links actually
defer you right back to the Google Play
Store it isn't the most feature fill to
the bunch and the interface could use
some work however you can access it
immediately within the browser at any
time without opening up a second
application that is until you actually
download an app number four on our list
is the well-known app brain you may know
this app pretty well already because a
lot of blogs will post app brain links
when doing a particles instead of the
usual Play Store links it's a solid app
and a solid Google Play Store
alternative even if it looks a little
plain perhaps the best part of this app
is that the apps come from the Google
Play Store this is simply a different
skin that you can use to surf them there
at brain stream the recently used apps
and the manage and sync settings give
you a unique view of your apps and your
recommendations
all in all not a bad app to try
first in our top three is yet another
surprising app Go Launcher e^x this is a
launcher but baked within the launcher
is the ghost door since it has a billion
users and no one ever complains about
the ghost or we assume that it's
probably not that bad if you need a
launcher and a Play Store replacement
here's another two birds one stone
scenario the store is pretty simple and
it works you can browse games and apps
by trending or category this is also
great if you already use go launcher as
you can find themes for Go launch your
go logger etc much easier than you
probably code in the Play Store number
two on the list is a newer Play Store
alternative called fetch we don't know
if it's because of the genuinely fun to
use interface or the constant references
to puppies but we really enjoyed fetch
it is as solid as they come in a very
confident alternative to the Play Store
so here's the main function of fetch it
allows you to narrow down your search by
using an absurd number of parameters you
can narrow it down by ranking price
category and pretty much anything else
you can think of you can even narrow
down games by 2d or 3d graphics then you
save searches so fetch learns what you
like and fetches it for you see dog
references dog references everywhere
well here we are the creme de la creme
the best of the best and it's the Amazon
Appstore we would be disappointed if
this weren't the best alternative
because you know Kindle Fire owners kind
of have to use it that said it looks
nice and has a lot of fun features of
course everyone should already know
about the free apps every day every day
you can get a paid app free of charge
and sometimes it's actually pretty good
another unique feature is the test run
mode where you can run an app within the
emulator inside the App Store before you
buy it that's actually really cool if
you take a look at our leaderboard you
can see how all these apps stack up
against one another as usual ladies and
gentlemen it is your ratings and reviews
that drive these lists and not us if you
want to check out one of these apps the
links are in the video description if
there's a good one that we missed let us
know in the comments this was a very
interesting list mostly because a couple
of these weren't even in the Google Play
Store Amazon App Store and f-droid have
to be downloaded from the web and we had
to put them here based on their
popularity rather than a ranking system
it's not everyday people think of trying
out an alternative to the Play Store but
if you do these are apps that will help
you out once again I'm Joe Hendy the
