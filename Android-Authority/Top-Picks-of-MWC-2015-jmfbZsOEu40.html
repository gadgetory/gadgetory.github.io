Barcelona Spain we saw a lot of great
devices but there were some that were
standouts in our eyes and we gave them
our top picks this is Josh freghar from
Android authority what's going on
everybody and I'm here to bring you what
became our top picks of MWC 2015 our
award for this year a nice one
if I may add adorns a number of
different counters at MWC 2015 and
though we saw quite a few huge flagship
announcements at this year's event the
smaller players had a lot to show for as
well and the mid-range game seems to be
heating up but our top big list will
then start with ZTE with their grand s3
now underneath the surface this is a
pretty decidedly mid-range device maybe
a little bit higher up on the list given
the specs that it has and the nice
screen and handling in its design but we
give it the topic award mainly for a
unique feature called the eyeprint
ID and setting it up the 8 megapixel
optics on the front facing camera will
capture a video of how your eyes look
but also zoom in in order to see the
blood vessels or round your pupils in
order to get a proper print and every
time you use this particular feature the
scan will further refine the information
basically after you have it set up you
just wake up the phone swipe down from
the top and keep your eyes inside of the
area and after a few seconds you will
get right into your phone it made a lot
of sense to us because you're already
looking at your phone when you're going
to unlock it so it only makes sense to
use your eyes in order to unlock the
device despite what may be a mid-range
offering this unique feature is the
reason why we gave the grand s3 one of
our top pick Awards of MWC 2015 standout
features in mid-range devices were also
the reason why that we went to lenovo
and found their vibe shot which also got
one of our awards for top pick of MWC
2015 it's easy to mistake the Lenovo
vibe shot for a slim point and shoot
digital camera when looking at it from
the back and that is exactly what the
company hope to achieve in its look
premium mid-range best describes the
look and specifications of this phone
but its standout feature is the 16
megapixel rear camera and 8 megapixel
front-facing unit and the overall
experience that we'll offer in its
camera a dedicated tactile shutter
button is coupled with a physical toggle
to easily switch between smart and pro
modes with the latter offering a level
of manual control that you'd get with
regular cameras the 16 megapixel
autofocus rear facing camera also comes
with an infrared autofocus tricolor
flash oh is and a sixteen by nine BSI
sensor and in short while with this
device we were certainly impressed with
it
and we couldn't wait to put it through
its paces to see its true picture
quality but for this nice innovation and
the ability to create a camera on the
back of what is otherwise a mid-range
smartphone we are looking forward to
getting more from this phone and for now
it gets our top pick at MWC 2015 we take
a visit over to the tablet game with
Sony and their Xperia z4 tablet now
there aren't really too many
enhancements on this particular tablet
but that is already considering that the
Xperia Tablet from before were some of
our favorite devices coming out of Sony
with a very thin profile at 6.1
millimeters thick the Xperia z4 tablet
further refines what was already a
fantastic design language and handling
experience and of course there are some
bumps and specifications that you would
expect from current generation high-end
Android tablets the minimalistic Xperia
UI on top of Android 5.0 lollipop really
lets the Snapdragon 810 showcase its
performance and media consumption will
be a blast on what is now a quad HD
display sony staples like water and dust
proofing also returned with this device
which is just one of the many reasons
why we gave it this award we return one
more time to the mid-range offerings
with the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 and
Alcatel has really stepped up their game
in terms of providing the basics in a
very nice way but also adding a few
features underneath the surface that you
may not be thinking of before what we
have here in this mid-range phone is a
1080p display a 13 megapixel rear camera
and a megapixel front-facing unit that
would be a delight for selfie lovers but
the idol 3 also boasts a fantastic audio
experience with dual front-facing
speakers featuring JBL audio and the
built-in mix music application that we
got showcased where you can actually mix
two different audio tracks together even
if they are coming from streaming
services so you can let the amateur DJ
in you shine but another really
interesting feature of the idol 3 is the
ability to flip the phone whichever way
you want even if it's upside-down you
are still able to use this phone as
normal as you normally would and you are
actually able to take calls with it
upside down as well which is kind of
cool if you're just going
pick up your phone any which way and use
it no matter which way you want the
world will game continues to grow and at
MWC 2015 we got a look at LG's new watch
urbane and it was announced a bit ahead
of MWC 2015 but it wasn't until that
particular week that we had the
opportunity to go hands-on with the
latest LG watch this watch features a
premium metal designed that sleeker and
more elegant than the G watch R that was
side from aesthetics we're looking at
pretty much the same device but that
means you'll get the snapdragon 400 with
half a gigabyte of ram a one point three
inch p OLED 320 by 320 display and a 410
milliamp hour battery there's also the
same stock Android wear experience which
judging by the G watch ours should fly
through its elements with these
particular specifications but really
what makes us really like the watch
urbane is its aesthetic it manages to
look a lot like a regular watch but have
the smart capabilities underneath that
we are seeing in the wearable space of
course the urbane will be as attractive
as your personal tastes dictate but
there's no denying that LG continues to
step up their game with each new
wearable that they create but LG wasn't
the only company coming out with a watch
that really took to a timeless design
well for MWC were heard a few rumors and
whispers about Huawei's plans for
wearables and for Android wear and at
MWC 2015 the Huawei watch became a
reality and what a stunning looking
watch it is the new wearable stands out
as the most watch like SmartWatch today
barring a full circle display like the
LG G watch an urbane but with in a less
bulky package the watch also offers a
1.4 inch AMOLED display with the
resolution of 400 by 400 as protected by
a sapphire crystal display and the body
is equally durable thanks to a 3/16 L
corrosion resistant stainless steel as
far as internal hardware and
specifications go the Huawei watch
should perform similarly to its existing
brethren from the likes of LG Samsung
and Motorola there's a snapdragon 400
underneath with half a gigabyte of ram
and the software is pretty much the same
stock experience you would find
elsewhere in Android wear watches but
why we give the Huawei watch the award
is because of its timeless design
because Huawei decided to take on the
original watch aesthetic and really
improve on it much like LG did but in
their own way we finally move into the
flagship space with the HTC One m9 it
may not have been the aesthetic and
that's um we're hoping for but that
doesn't mean that this isn't a device
worthy of your attention further
refining the design language started
with the m7 and arguably with the NIR
perfected m8 the m9 takes what we loved
about those predecessors and puts them
together with a few coats of extra
polish gone is the much criticized ultra
pixel rear cam replaced with the 20
megapixel shooter other improvements
include a jump to the Snapdragon 810 and
three gigabytes of RAM and inside of
Sense 7 it now has HTC themes along with
a couple of other enhancements in things
like the blink feed but it's design is
really what we give HTC a lot credit for
because they stick to their guns with an
aesthetic that is still one of the most
attractive in the Android space today
the back material is now not quite as
slippery as found in the m8 and it's
backing moves to the front with a lip
that provides a bit more of a pinch so
this is one of the best-handling HTC
devices yet maybe HTC could have done a
little bit more to set the m9 apart from
its previous phones but we don't really
fault them too much because we do love
what we see from HTC one devices and
don't be fooled because this is still
one really premium device on the inside
as well as on the outside another one of
our top picks went to Samsung and you
are probably expecting this already but
the Samsung Galaxy s6 edge gets another
one of our top pick Awards announced
alongside the Galaxy s6 the s6 edge
might not be dramatically different from
its standard screened brother but it's
unique dual curved display helps it
stand out from the crowd and that is
exactly why we think a lot of users will
like it the galaxy s6 edge packs the
same specs as its brother including that
powerful Exynos processor with only a
few minor changes like a slightly larger
battery but you still get the 5.1 inch
qHD display and three gigabytes of RAM
and one area that the edge does stand
out from the gs6 aside from aesthetics
is when it comes to the software the s6
edge offers two special features the
first of which is people edge which
allows you to assign colors to up to
five contacts and when you put the face
down you can know who is calling because
you will see the color glowing from that
right edge the other special feature is
the ability to show notifications and
other bits of info on the edge giving
users a quick way to see text calls and
more for those that are impressed by
what Samsung did with a Galaxy s6 but
are looking for a product that will
stand out in an even better way you
can't go wrong with yes
edge is definitely going to be a
conversation piece and something that
will set you the user apart from some of
the other devices that are available in
the markets after MWC 2015 and finally
our last topic from MWC 2015 goes to the
Samsung Galaxy s6 if you're going into
MWC hoping to see something really new
from Samsung maybe you expected that
that wasn't going to be the case but the
galaxy s6 actually exceeded those
expectations as Samsung finally brought
the world that much-needed infusion of
premium materials building a glass back
with a metallic frame the design may
have required a few sacrifices such as
the lack of a microSD card slot and a
removable battery but the latest member
in the Galaxy S family certainly takes
things up a notch when it comes to its
looks on the hardware front you still
get that really good bump up that you
expect from the next Galaxy S device
like the XE no 720 as there are no
snapdragons here anymore
you'll also find three gigabytes of RAM
a 5.1 quad HD display and internal
storage options that begin at 32
gigabytes and go up to as high as 128
Samsung hasn't just changed up the
aesthetics and given us a hardware
upgrade the software site has also
received improvements maybe better put
that it was dialed back a little bit a
dramatic reduction in the bloatware and
several other improvements that should
make the galaxy s6 software the latest
iteration of TouchWiz to date one of the
best that is coming out of this crop of
flagship devices I can't emphasize this
enough and I already have in my first
look that's the smoothness in this
particular version of TouchWiz is
something to really remember and I'm
really looking forward to putting this
particular device through its paces when
I get my hands on it for a long form
review the s6 finally brings Samsung's
design language a bit more on par with
premium devices like those from HTC and
Sony which we already gave our top picks
for at MWC 2015 and for the most part
the device seems to be well-received by
the tech world at large but there's no
doubt in our mind that the latest galaxy
is worthy of being deemed an Android
authority top pick we hope you enjoyed
this presentation of some of our
favorite devices coming out of MWC 2015

other ones that were seen at the Mobile
World Congress in Barcelona Spain so
