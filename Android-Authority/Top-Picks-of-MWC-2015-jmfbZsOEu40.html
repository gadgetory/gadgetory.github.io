barcelona spain we saw a lot of great
devices but there were some that were
standouts in our eyes and we gave them
our top picks this is josh pagar from
android authority what's going on
everybody and i'm here to bring you what
became our top picks of mwc 2015 our
award for this year a nice one if I may
add adorns a number of different
counters at MWC 2015 and though we saw
quite a few huge flagship announcements
at this year's event the smaller players
had a lot to show for as well and the
mid-range game seems to be heating up
but our top pig list will then start
with ZTE with their grand s3 now
underneath the surface this is a pretty
decidedly mid-range device may be a
little bit higher up on the list given
the specs that it has and the nice
screen and handling in its design but we
give it the topic award mainly for a
unique feature called the iprint ID and
setting it up the 8-megapixel objects on
the front facing camera will capture a
video of how your eyes look but also
zoom in in order to see the blood
vessels or round your pupils in order to
get a proper print and every time you
use this particular feature the scan
will further refine the information
basically after you have it set up you
just wake up the phone swipe down from
the top and keep your eyes inside of the
area and after a few seconds you will
get right into your phone it made a lot
of sense to us because you're already
looking at your phone when you're going
to unlock it so it only makes sense to
use your eyes in order to unlock the
device despite what may be a mid-range
offering this unique feature is the
reason why we gave the Grand s3 one of
our top pick Awards of mwc 2015 standout
features in mid-range devices were also
the reason why that we went to Lenovo
and found their vibe shot which also got
one of our Lord's for top pick of mwc
2015 it's easy to mistake the lenovo
vibe shot for a slim point and shoot
digital camera when looking at it from
the back that's exactly what the company
hope to achieve in its look premium
mid-range best describes the look and
specifications of this phone but it's
standout feature is the 16 megapixel
rear camera and 8 megapixel front-facing
unit and the overall experience that
will offer in its camera a dedicated
tactile shutter button is coupled with a
physical toggle to easily switch between
smart and pro modes with the latter
offering a level of manual control that
you'd get with regular cameras the 16
megapixel
auto focus rear facing camera also comes
with an infrared auto focus tricolor
flash Oh is and a 16 by 9 BSI sensor and
in short while with this device we were
certainly impressed with it and we
couldn't wait to put it through its
paces to see it's true picture quality
but for this nice innovation and the
ability to create a camera on the back
of what is otherwise a mid-range
smartphone we are looking forward to
getting more from this phone and for now
it gets our top pick at mwc 2015 we take
a visit over to the tablet game with
sony and their xperia z4 tablet now
there aren't really too many
enhancements on this particular tablet
but that is already considering that the
Xperia tablets from before were some of
our favorite devices coming out of Sony
with a very thin profile at 6.1
millimeters thick the Xperia z4 tablet
further refines what was already a
fantastic design language and handling
experience and of course there are some
bumps and specifications that you would
expect from current generation high-end
Android tablets the minimalistic Xperia
UI on top of Android 5.0 lollipop really
let's the Snapdragon 810 showcase its
performance and media consumption will
be a blast on what is now a quad HD
display sony staples like water and dust
proofing also return with this device
which is just one of the many reasons
why we gave it this award we returned
one more time to the mid-range offerings
with the alcatel one touch idol 3 and
Alcatel has really stepped up their game
in terms of providing the basics in a
very nice way but also adding a few
features underneath the surface that you
may not be thinking of before what we
have here in this mid-range phone is a
1080p display a 13 megapixel rear camera
and a megapixel front-facing unit that
would be a delight for selfie lovers but
the idol 3 also boasts a fantastic audio
experience with dual front-facing
speakers featuring JBL audio and the
built-in mix music application that we
got showcased where you can actually mix
two different audio tracks together even
if they're coming from streaming
services so you can let the amateur DJ
in you shine but another really
interesting feature of the idol 3 is the
ability to flip the phone whichever way
you want even if it's upside down you
are still able to use this phone as
normal as you normally would and you are
actually able to take calls with it
upside down as well which is kind of
cool if you're just going
to pick up your phone any which way and
use it no matter which way you want the
wearable game continues to grow and at
MWC 2015 we got a look at LG's new watch
urbane and it was announced a bit ahead
of mwc 2015 but it wasn't until that
particular week that we had the
opportunity to go hands-on with the
latest LG watch this watch features a
premium metal designed that sleeker and
more elegant than the G watch our that
was side from aesthetics we're looking
at pretty much the same device but that
means you'll get the Snapdragon 400 with
half a gigabyte of RAM at one point
three inch p OLED 320 x 320 display and
a 410 million power battery there's also
the same stock Android wear experience
which judging by the G watch our should
fly through its elements with these
particular specifications but really
what makes us really like the watch
urbane is its aesthetic it manages to
look a lot like a regular watch but have
the smart capabilities underneath that
we are seeing in the wearable space of
course the urbane will be as attractive
as your personal taste dictate but
there's no denying that LG continues to
step up their game with each new
wearable that they create but LG wasn't
the only company coming out with a watch
that really took to a timeless design
well for mwc were heard a few more
rumors and whispers about Huawei's plans
for wearables and for Android wear and
at mwc 2015 the while we watch became a
reality and what a stunning looking
watch it is the new wearable stands out
as the most watch like SmartWatch to
date barring a full-circle display like
the LG G watch and urbane but within a
less bulky package the watch also offers
a 1.4 inch AMOLED display with a
resolution of 400 by 400 that is
protected by a sapphire crystal display
and the body is equally durable thanks
to a 316l corrosion resistant stainless
steel as far as internal hardware and
specifications go the Huawei watch
should perform similarly to its existing
brethren from the likes of LG samsung
and motorola there's a Snapdragon 400
underneath with half a gigabyte of RAM
and the software is pretty much the same
stock experience you would find
elsewhere in Android wear watches but
why we give the Huawei watch the award
is because of its timeless design
because while we decided to take on the
original watch aesthetic and really
improve on it much like LG did but in
their own way
we finally move into the flagship space
with the HTC One m9 it may not have been
the aesthetic enhancement that some were
hoping for but that doesn't mean that
this isn't a device worthy of your
attention further refining the design
language started with the m7 and
arguably with the neo perfected m8 the
m9 takes what we loved about those
predecessors and puts them together with
a few coats of extra polish gone is the
much-criticized ultrapixel rear cam
replaced with the 20 megapixel shooter
other improvements include a jump to the
Snapdragon 810 and 3 gigabytes of RAM
and inside of sense 7 it now has HTC
themes along with a couple of other
enhancements in things like the
blinkfeed but it's design is really what
we give HTC a lot credit for because
they stick to their guns with an
aesthetic that is still one of the most
attractive in the Android space today
the back material is now not quite as
slippery as found in the m8 and it's
backing moves to the front with a lip
that provides a bit more of a pinch so
this is one of the best handling HTC
devices yet maybe HTC could have done a
little bit more to set the m9 apart from
its previous phones but we don't really
fault them too much because we do love
what we see from HTC One devices and
don't be fooled because this is still
one really premium device on the inside
as well as on the outside another one of
our top picks went to Samsung and you're
probably expecting this already but the
samsung galaxy s6 edge gets another one
of our top pick awards announced
alongside the galaxy s6 the s6 edge
might not be dramatically different from
its standard screened brother but it's
unique dual curved display helps it
stand out from the crowd and that is
exactly why we think a lot of users will
like it the galaxy s6 edge packs the
same specs as its brother including that
powerful Exynos processor with only a
few minor changes like a slightly larger
battery but you still get the 5.1 inch
qhd display and 3 gigabytes of ram and
one area that the edge does stand out
from the GS 6 aside from aesthetics is
when it comes to the software the s6
edge offers two special features the
first of which is people edge which
allows you to assign colors to up to
five contacts and when you put the face
down you can know who is calling because
you will see the color glowing from that
right edge the other special features
the ability to show notifications and
other bits of info on the edge giving
users a quick way to see text calls and
more
for those that are impressed by what
Samsung did with the galaxy s6 but are
looking for a product that will stand
out in an even better way you can't go
wrong with the s6 edge it is definitely
going to be a conversation piece and
something that will set you the user
apart from some of the other devices
that are available in the markets after
MWC 2015 and finally our last topic from
mwc 2015 goes to the samsung galaxy s6
if you're going into mwc hoping to see
something really new from Samsung maybe
you expected that that wasn't going to
be the case but the galaxy s6 actually
exceeded those expectations as Samsung
finally brought the world that much
needed infusion of premium materials
building a glass back with a metallic
frame the design may have required a few
sacrifices such as the lack of a microSD
card slot and a removable battery but
the latest member in the galaxy s family
certainly takes things up a notch when
it comes to its looks on the hardware
front you still get that really good
bump of that you expect from the next
Galaxy S device like the XE no 720 as
there are no snapdragons here anymore
you'll also find 3 gigabytes of RAM a
5.1 quad HD display and internal storage
options that begin at 32 gigabytes and
go up to as high as 128 Samsung hasn't
just changed up the aesthetics and given
us a hardware upgrade the software site
has also received improvements maybe
better put that it was dialed back a
little bit a dramatic reduction in the
bloatware and several other improvements
that should make the galaxy s6 software
the latest iteration of TouchWiz to date
one of the best I was coming out of this
crop of flagship devices I can't
emphasize this enough and I already have
in my first look that the smoothness in
this particular version of TouchWiz is
something to really remember and I'm
really looking forward to putting this
particular device through its paces when
I get my hands on it for a long-form
review the s6 finally brings Samsung's
design language a bit more on par with
premium devices like those from HTC and
Sony which we already gave our top picks
for at MWC 2015 and for the most part of
the device seems to be well received by
the tech world at large but there's no
doubt in our mind that the latest galaxy
is worthy of being deemed an android
authority top pick we hope you enjoyed
this presentation of some of our
favorite devices coming out of mwc 2015

other ones that were seen at the Mobile
World Congress in Barcelona Spain so
