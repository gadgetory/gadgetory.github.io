season has officially begun and we'll
start with how Google may have
inadvertently revealed the release date
of the pixel 3 well according to this is
tech today and Android police a leak on
content marketing platform famebit
suggests that a new pixel 3 phone is
coming on October 4th of this year
you see famebit is a Google owned
platform that connects creators with
advertisers so if you're an advertiser
and you want a youtuber to promote your
product you go through famebit you see
this famebit listing which may have been
written by google or one of its agencies
reveals that the company was apparently
looking for Canadian content creators
for the pixel 3 launch on October 4th
again we aren't 100% sure that this is
indeed Google's work or one of his
agencies so don't put all your faith in
this listing but if it's a hoax it's a
convincing one now let's move on to the
whole fortnight Google Play Store
Samsung saga remember a few weeks ago we
got all excited that fortnight was
finally coming to Android well it is but
not through the Google Play Store
fortnight for Android might be an
exclusive for owners of the Samsung
Galaxy Note 9 at least at first the
source of that rumor told Android
headlines that the note 9 exclusive
would last up to 30 days since that was
the only information available at the
time the assumption was that after the
30-day period anyone would be able to
download and install the game but no it
gets more complicated even though the
original source told Android headlines
that the note 9 exclusive would last
only 30 days we know now that it's
likely the Samsung exclusive could last
an additional 90 days after that this
means that the note 9 owners will get
access to fortnight first then there
will be a period where owners of other
Samsung devices will be able to play it
now that is likely because Samsung is
paying Epic Games gobs of money for an
exclusive also you got to remember that
mother Google charges a 30% cut off of
each app sale in fact epic games CEO Tim
Sweeney confirmed the release plan with
the verge citing quote economic
efficiency of avoiding the 30% cut
Google earns from all app sales on the
Play Store so do you all want
this guy Kurt McMaster the former CEO of
cyanogen and he is infamous for saying
things like Samsung will get slaughtered
in five years and that he was going to
put a bullet through Google's head well
a short time later when CyanogenMod
became cyanogen and tried to become a
profitable business it utterly failed
and McMaster had to wear egg on his face
and be humbled very publicly I would
suggest that Huawei learn from cyanogen
because just days after surpassing Apple
as the second largest smartphone maker
in the world
Huawei has announced its ambition to
take the top spot as reported by
Bloomberg Huawei's consumer division
chief Richard you said that he wants the
company to achieve the goal by the
fourth quarter of 2019 according to you
Huawei aims for a market share of more
than 20% this would be quite a jump from
15% market share that the counter port
research says the company recorded in
the second quarter of 2018 according to
the same research firm Samsung is the
current number one with a market share
of 20% now don't get me wrong if you
guys remember I've been a big fan of
Chinese manufacturers I've said before
that they were gonna take over the
middle market and they virtually have
and they're gonna continue to do so the
problem is when you make big bold
announcements like this you tempt the
gods and you also have a serious hurdle
that other manufacturers haven't had
you're gonna have a hard time POIs way
getting into the US market for real I
mean you're there but you're not there
so unless you have a specific plan to
tackle that the carriers are gonna fight
you and make sure that you can't get
into the US market let me know what you
think in the comments below or on
Twitter but just wait a second because I
got something really important to tell
you
there are two types of people in the
world I tell my teenagers this all the
time there are sheep and there are
Shepherds 98 percent of the world are
sheep but sheep don't know that they're
sheep sheep think that their original
sheep think that they're not doing
what's normal that they're not doing
what's expected that they're not just
following the rest of the sheep but most
of them are you see if you're just
watching umpteen YouTube videos and you
didn't do anything to make your life
better today or someone else's life
better you might be a sheep
Shepherd's on the other hand they have a
plan they have a goal they do what is
going to make their life better or
someone else's life better that's why
they're shepherds and I got to tell you
if you watch youtube videos on a mobile
operating system you may have the seeds
the potential to be a shepherd when it
comes to tech and I'm talking about
being a developer not just a wannabe
geek but someone who actually makes
something that matters because we here
at Android authority want to be
shepherds so we created the digit
Academy and that's where our own Gary
Sims teaches you how to build your own
Android app right from the beginning if
you're a complete noob and don't know
anything he's gonna help you right from
the start you also have access to a
private slack channel where you can
connect with Gary and other students
like you so I'm gonna make it easy for
you I'm gonna give you a 50% discount
code 50% off but it's only good for 7
days why because many of you are sheep
and are not going to take action so this
forces you to take action right now 7
days from the publish date of this video
that discount code will no longer be
accepted or valid so act now because the
world needs a lot more shepherds in the
tech community
