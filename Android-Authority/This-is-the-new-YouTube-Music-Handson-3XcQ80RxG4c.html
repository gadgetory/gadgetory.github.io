hindi the android authority app guy and
the new YouTube Music app is officially
out in the wild which means we're about
to check it out
insert silly rhetorical question here
and let's get started to be perfectly
honest YouTube music UI is delightful
it's a little bland and minimal however
you can also get to just about
everywhere in the app within two taps
the app consists of three main screens
which are the home screen the hot list
and the library the home screen shows
recommendations for things like new
releases various playlists music videos
and stuff like that the hot list is
basically just the most popular and
trending music videos the library shows
your playlists saved artists saved
albums downloaded content and like songs
you can tap the profile picture in the
top right to see some more stuff that
includes settings downloads viewing and
listening history the switch account
action and the help and feedback section
the settings are fairly bare-bones with
most settings dealing with network usage
notifications and a restrictive mode
that blocks things like offensive
language the actual music player UI is
also fairly standard fare there aren't
any surprises here you swipe up for
playlists and hit the three-dot menu for
additional options and that's basically
it for the UI really it's simple
effective quick to navigate and it
shouldn't take you long to get it down
we really hope that they keep that core
simplicity as they continue to expand
the app and add new features we can
definitively say that this is vastly
easier to use than Google Play music
ever was even if there isn't much there
yet
YouTube musics content is a little bit
of a mystery it offers all of the music
videos from YouTube and that gives it a
greater list of songs than any streaming
service there is also a separate
selection of stream only songs without
the video searching for content shows
both along with people's playlists and
albums
thus it solves the age-old problem of
not finding a song on your streaming
service and then having to open YouTube
to find it there the application
searches for both in the same spots and
subscribers have unmitigated access to
both video and audio only content we're
not sure how many on-demand non-video
songs YouTube music supports but we
imagine it's in the tens of millions
much like Google Play Music &amp;amp; other
comparable services the application
still gives access to every music video
on YouTube though and that really helps
fill in the blanks left by
most other streaming services the
integration between on-demand music
streaming and music videos is present in
every function of the app and that's
where things get a little interesting
you can create playlists with both music
videos and on-demand music content in
the same place giving YouTube music and
advantage over other music streaming
services additionally all videos have a
toggle that turns off the video for an
audio only mode which is an older
feature from before the update and this
essentially turns all music videos into
on-demand music streams thus in practice
you can't really tell the difference
between a music video from YouTube or an
on-demand song from YouTube music
integrating the two was a stroke of
genius in terms of content even in its
current form it has more music than
whatever it is you're already using
there aren't a ton of additional
features aside from the usual array of
music streaming mainstays like playlists
music on-demand and other such things
the application is fairly bare-bones
right now but we expect that to change
as the application and service both
mature there are a few extra things
though the previously mentioned
restrictive mode makes the application
more friendly for younger folks or for
those who don't like swearing and of
course the application has grown cast
supports this is an early access bait of
those so there aren't a ton of extra
features to write home about yet it
should get a bunch of features from
google play music as they integrate the
two over the course of the next several
months and we're sure that there are
other plans for this application as well
that we don't know about yet in short
there isn't a ton of additional features
but there is more than enough evidence
to support that more features are coming
soon nothing is perfect though and that
includes the new YouTube music we did
see a few flaws that we'll talk about
briefly in hopes that they get fixed
before too long for some reason this
application doesn't show song lengths in
the search results this is odd behavior
because YouTube does show the length in
its search results and considering that
bands like dire straits have live
versions of Sultans of Swing that are
both 5 minutes long and 11 minutes long
we would have liked to have seen track
lengths so that we know what we're
dealing with everything you do in
YouTube music is reflected somewhere in
the main YouTube application for better
or for worse any playlists you make in
YouTube are visible in YouTube music and
vice versa every song on YouTube music
is also a video on YouTube and this may
reflect in your recommendations on the
standard YouTube app eventually
you can choose video quality on YouTube
but not audio quality and the same goes
for YouTube music you get whatever audio
came with the video and that's all you
get it's usually fairly
middle-of-the-road stuff and it's not
terrible by any stretch but we're
definitely not dealing with high quality
mp3s either most people likely won't
notice or care and that's perfectly fine
however those who enjoy higher quality
audio might be disappointed finally
there are a swath of popular videos that
are basically entire concerts or albums
in a single video YouTube viewers have
long relied on comment sections and
video descriptions for timestamps so
they know where the songs start and end
YouTube music doesn't show comments or
video descriptions and you can see why
that might be a problem for longer
productions longer concert style videos
are still better on the main youtube app
at least for now and if we're being
perfectly honest other than changes to
the UI
we're having trouble discerning the
differences between the new YouTube
music and the old one most of these
issues are minor nitpicks but they are
issues that we would like to see fixed
sooner rather than later there are some
UI elements that seem a little
undercooked however this is an early
release so we kind of expected it
YouTube music is a very interesting
product it's massive library of content
already eclipses basically everything
else on the market even SoundCloud and
it's absurd number of tracks the
integration between YouTube and YouTube
music is neat and the promis'd inclusion
of the best parts of google play music
should make almost any music fan giddy
with excitement this one has a lot of
potential
however like we said a moment ago there
really isn't much of a difference
between the new YouTube music and the
old one there is no audio quality
setting everything you listen to in a
video is available on YouTube anyway and
aside from these scaled back UI a larger
focus on music and removing non music
content you'd be hard-pressed to find
features in YouTube music that aren't
also available in the main YouTube app
already for now though we recommend that
you don't cancel your spotify
subscription just yet YouTube music is
an early access beta and it has a long
way to go
there is definitely promise the
application works well and some of the
ideas here are utterly fantastic however
until it starts acting like its own
product and less like an offshoot of
another product it's difficult to
recommend that people spend money on it
right now of course we want to hear your
thoughts as well
and you can tell us about it in the
comment section below and that about
does it for this one folks if you liked
this video you know what to do and if
not well you still know what to do we
have the written version of this video
linked up in the video description below
along with a download link to YouTube
music if you want to check it out as
always thanks for watching everybody and
have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
