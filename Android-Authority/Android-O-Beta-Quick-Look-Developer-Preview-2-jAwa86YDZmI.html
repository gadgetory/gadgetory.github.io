hindi from android authority comm Google
i/o had a lot of announcements and one
of them was they Android Oh beta you
know where this is going so let's take a
closer look okay so we did a big giant
video about the first Android o
Developer Preview and a lot of that
information hasn't changed all that much
the interface the settings the under the
hood stuff is all pretty much the same
we're not going to reinvent the wheel
here so if you want to see all that
first wave of major changes check out
the first Android o developer preview
which will be linked in the video
description below
ok first let's start with the visual
tweaks because there weren't a whole
bunch of those the first noticeable
change is the notification toggles Andy
quick settings there now grayscale
instead of the really dark gray like
you'd normally see don't know if that's
permanent or not but it's there well
we're hanging around the area it's worth
noting that the Settings menu button
quick settings edit button profile image
and date and time are now at the bottom
of the quick settings and of the toggles
it's a minor thing but it'll take you a
few minutes to get used to it lastly
Google updated the emoji in Android oh
these are far more animated and 3ds than
they were before whether or not you
liked them is purely up to your personal
taste however they do fall more in line
with the kind of stuff you see on
Facebook messenger and iOS
there were several new features with the
Android o beta release the biggest one
is the picture-in-picture mode which is
now available to everybody for now
YouTube is the only one that can use it
you start the video hit the home button
or the recent apps button and you have a
tiny little screen to watch on your
phone
there is an additional setting in the
system UI tuner that lets you kind of
minimize it by tucking it away partially
off the screen you'll need to enable
that manually at least for now and it's
in the system UI tuner those rocking a
Google picks will have a few more fun
things to try out the biggest one was an
announcement at Google i/o today called
notification dot it lets you long press
an icon and then check a notification
it's probably not faster than using
quick reply but it's there
additionally the pixel launcher now lets
you select your icon shapes as you can
imagine this isn't available on the
Nexus 6p or the Nexus 5x another small
tweak is the ability to adjust the
intensity of the nightlight feature it's
just a little slider that filters out
more blue light the higher you go it's
good for what it is and again it's only
available
one pixel devices lashley google play
protect is another feature announced
today at Google i/o it is built directly
into the Android o beta preview you
can't really do anything with it but you
can see the evidence of its existence
all over the settings menu it'll tell
you which apps are recently scanned and
you can turn it off if you want to
although we really can't imagine why you
would there were a few features that's
got some more explanation today at
Google i/o but we're not in the actual
beta smart text selection was probably
the biggest one in future releases of
Android oh you'll be able to double tap
things like names addresses and phone
numbers in order to select the entire
thing from there it's really easy to
copy and paste and there will be some
contextual options like opening maps if
you select an address it may be there
but we couldn't get it to work really
that's about it for stuff not in the
beta a lot of stuff from the previous
developer build still isn't present yet
and we encourage you to watch that first
developer preview video again linked in
the video description below to check all
of those out there were plenty of under
the hood things announced today at
Google i/o the first is a new developer
dashboard in the Play Store that more
accurately shows when apps crash when
they consume too much battery and when
they screw up in general we really hope
Facebook is paying attention because
their dashboard has to look like
whatever the opposite of Christmas is
right now most of the other
announcements were focused on app
development tensorflow Lite will allow
developers to play with machine learning
a little bit easier there were more
talks about how developers can add their
own font pack to their applications as
well there was a second talk after the
keynote that talked a lot about the new
API s that helped with things like multi
display supports new media playback code
new media recording code text
auto-sizing improvements new
accessibility options and far too many
more to list here app developers are
going to have a lot to play with very
soon finally they announced during the
keynote that Android Oh was going to
have tons of optimizations to reduce
resource usage by background
applications location pinging and some
optimizations that will even help
applications load up to twice as quickly
and reboots to take about half as long
they dubbed the initiative vitals and it
should come with the Android o beta
again there's a bunch of other stuff
that we didn't mention here that was in
our first video and we encourage you to
check out that video ok folks that about
does it for this one it's a shorter
video than the previous one but most of
the big changes are things that we've
discussed before the beta is by far more
stable than the first of
a preview however it is not entirely bug
free you can flash it if you want to but
just beware that is a beta and sometimes
acts like one as for the name while they
have a ton of Oreos at Google i/o today
whether that's man dication or just
google trolling us remains to be seen if
you're a bit disappointed that there
isn't more here don't you worry the next
Developer Preview is only a couple of
months away according to a road map
published by ARS technica it should have
all of the API is loaded in and it
should be all the complete as we run up
to the final release until then stay
tuned to Android Authority calm
rapidly-expanding are diving into
android o series and will no doubt have
some additional videos to talk about
more of the features our diving into
android o series is also linked up in
the video description below if you want
to check it out and that about does it

broken record by now but do check out
