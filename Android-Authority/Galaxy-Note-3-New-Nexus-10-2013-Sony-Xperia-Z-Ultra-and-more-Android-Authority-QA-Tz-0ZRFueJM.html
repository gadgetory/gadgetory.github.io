brought to you by netflix head to
netflix.com / android for a free 30-day
trial ask and ye shall receive an answer
hey it's Josh of regard mandroid 30
what's going on everybody and it's
android authority Q&amp;amp;A for August
fourteenth 2013 our first question of
the day comes from Fred I'm waiting for
the second-generation Nexus 10 and you
news about it one will it be released
will it have key lime pie Walt Fred we
don't currently have a whole lot of
information regarding the new Nexus 10
just yet but we can expect a lot of news
to come out in the coming weeks this is
because mid november of last year was
when the original nexus 10 was out and
obviously we're coming up to that
general time frame what we can tell you
about though is a couple details that
have surfaced in the last couple of
weeks mainly that the new Nexus 10 might
not be produced by Samsung what was once
thought to be a statement by sundar
pichai actually wasn't while we haven't
really heard anyone specifically say
that a sous will be the next developer a
couple of details point to this being
the case mainly that the company
originally commissioned to make the
video for the Nexus surround sound
feature listed the video as being for
the Nexus 7 and the Nexus 10 with these
two companies continuing what looks like
a pretty great relationship one can
certainly hope as far as key lime pie
goes the general idea for android 5.0 is
that it will be out by the end of this
year so the Nexus 10 is here by the
holidays it could very likely have the
newest version of Android built-in I'm
interested in buying a new phone on
contract but I'm not sure which one
should i buy one of the current flagship
phones or wait it out until later this
year to see what else is beyond the
horizon now I think this is a great
question because this is arguably the
best time for smartphone tech there are
a lot of different devices to choose
from and it's only going to get better
throughout the rest of this year
honestly it really does come down to how
patient you are the current flagship
phones are wonderful choices like the
Samsung Galaxy s4 and the HTC One but
don't forget about the other players in
the game like the Sony Xperia Z you can
wait a little while for the Moto X if
it's customization options and generally
simpler outlook please you
if you're looking for a bigger phone
while I just reviewed the huge sony
xperia z ultra and unless you are
willing to wait for the samsung galaxy
note 3 it is pretty hard to beat if you
are willing to wait though you actually
don't have to wait that long the Moto X
is weeks from release and the great
looking LG g2 will be out within the
next month or so and by the holidays we
will have the Galaxy Note 3 like I said
it really just comes down to how patient
you are speaking of the galaxy note 3
Daniel wants to know if you should wait
for it or just go for the galaxy s4 with
the Galaxy Note 3 still impending it is
likely to have even better specs than
the older s4 those are of course the
stamp dragon 800 the 1080p resolution in
that huge screen and of course there is
the S Pen many users flock to the S Pen
on top of that larger screen and that is
what made the note to quite the runaway
hit the galaxy s4 introduced many new
sensors and navigation features and all
of these are sure to be included with
the note 3 on top of the ways to use the
S Pen it's hard not to get excited for
the note 3 because it could be one of
the most full-featured phones available
ultimately it comes down to those key
elements the larger screen more power or
the s-pen with Eva in Berlin just about
a month away it's only a matter of time
before we get all of the information on
the Galaxy Note 3 confirmed and then of
course after its announcement it's not
going to be that long until we actually
get that phone in our hands here's an
interesting one to try and pronounce
amblyopia amblyopia amblyopia 57 asks
will the LG g2 be coming to sprint yes
it definitely will be just like the og
made its way to spring last year Sprint
is really pushing the g2 as the main
gateway for its unlimited plans and
services it's a two-way street too
because LG is catering the g2 on sprint
to be able to connect across all
possible LTE frequencies that the
service uses the g2 is looking to be a
major release and by the end of this
year Sprint will be one of the many
places that you can get it our last
question comes from proud to be pinoy i
love the Nexus 7 and the Xperia Z so
instead of having the Nexus 7 and the Z
in my pocket can I just have the Xperia
Z ultra does the Xperia Z ultra
for me and is the Z ultra better than
the nexus 7 first of all a Bligh and
good timing on asking me this question
just days after I reviewed the Sony
Xperia Z ultra now it's no secret that
I'm a big fan of the Nexus 7 and the
Xperia Z ultra just comes this short of
stepping on its territory but my
suggestion here would be to really
evaluate if a device of that size is
really something you want to have on you
all the time the Xperia Z at five inches
for example is just below the threshold
of breaking portability and it works
just as it should as a phone on the
other hand the Nexus 7 tablet is
something you can bring out but it might
primarily be used in an office or a home
the Xperia Z ultra just might not work
when you're really out and about for
example I tried using the ultra while
driving and let's just say it was far
from easy or more importantly safe I
think it's a very fine device don't get
me wrong but it works best in a more
controlled environment as a tablet it's
almost as good as the nexus 7 after all
I just love stock Android a little bit
more but as a phone it's simply much
more difficult to fathom as always a
written companion for this video can be
