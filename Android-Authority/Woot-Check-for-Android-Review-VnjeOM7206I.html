authority and I wanted to show you all
one of my newly discovered deals apps
it's called won't check now if you're
listening to this audio or watching this
video or reading this review chances are
you've probably heard of woot woot has
one really great deal a day and as
they've expanded they've gone from just
a general item to wine two shirts to
electronics to you know random things
like that and so it's been kind of
difficult to keep track of everything
and that's why I found a woot check now
it's asking me to review it while I'm
giving them a good review hopefully so
I'll dismiss that now looking right at
woot check you'll see a there's a
32-inch 720p out of 720p bomber LCD HD
TV being sold on woot now if you want to
buy it you hit I want one and you'll be
redirected to purchase it one of my
favorite things I'm a huge stickler for
the Android design guidelines and so the
fact that we can swipe left and right to
change from what we cite we're looking
at is a big deal to me so looking at
what we can swipe we're looking at tech
woot oh man 1080p home theater that's
what I'm talking about home woot a flat
iron not necessary for me Oh buoy rope
nope kids woot don't have any kids but a
band in a box shirt woot a pocket
monster it looks kind of interesting
wine some red wine sellout milk cafe
frother for those of you that like
frothy milk and then there is mufi which
I honestly have never heard of but it
looks like there's a lot of just general
items deals.woot.com moving to and fro
is very very simple hopping right up
into the Preferences menu you can have
background notifications anytime a new
day happens because as the day's change
the woot deals change so you can turn on
background notifications and also the
associated sounds with them as well you
can change the automatic refresh
interval the default appears to be
eight minutes so I would imagine every
eight minutes if it pings a server and
nothing has changed then you're good to
go now you can do generic notifications
which will be a single notification for
any new product which is great because
they all change it about the same time
from what I've noticed or you can do
certain ones like I would probably do
tech boot because i'm really interested
but i would also be interested to see
what home dot woot would have because i
like building out what's in my kitchen
otherwise it's a fairly straightforward
app it works well you can manually
refresh it like so you can read whatever
the the text is from the website by
hitting that paper button up there so
all their goofy little written up
paragraphs that make it sound like what
you're buying is the best thing ever but
the most important part is that you can
see all the important specs for whatever
it is you're looking at instead of
having to see when you get to the
website but that was very quick tech top
let's see if we get the same perfect on
the same background color as the web
page that you're looking at within the
would check at and otherwise that's it
woot check is free there aren't any ads
but I do need to disclose and this is
also in the apps description that the
developers GT media are what they call
it minions so when you click I want one
you might be redirected to an
advertiser's third party site it funds
they get a small Commission for every
purchase via the woot check app which
they say helps fund their app
development but if that's something that
you might feel a verse two then I would
figured I would let you know before you
purchase something before using the woot
check app with that being said I'm very
pleased with how it looks and very
pleased with how it works so that is
woot check by GT Media LLC it is free
and you can find it in the google play
store</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
