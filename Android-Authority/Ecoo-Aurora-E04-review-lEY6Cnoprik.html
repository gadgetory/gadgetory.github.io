more mainstream with Android smartphones
and it's going to be interesting to see
over the next 12 to 18 months how the
Chinese OMS use this next generation of
processors in their phones today we're
going to be looking in a new 64-bit
device called the echo Aurora a 0 4 it
uses an octa-core cortex a53 processor
coupled with a mali t760 GPU it has a
5.5 inch display and only costs one
hundred and ninety dollars the way you
spell the name with this Chinese OEM is
EC oh oh and I suppose you could
pronounce it ekoo or maybe ech ooh but
I'm just going to go with echo it's just
easier taking a look at the design and
build the phone is quite light at just
160 grams and surprisingly easy to hold
considering it has a 5.5 inch display
I've always felt most comfortable using
a phone with a 5 inch display and the
Aurora efore is certainly larger than
the average 5 inch device at 156 point 7
millimeters tall is around one to one
and a half centimeters longer than a
typical 5 inch device however at 70 7.5
millimeters wide it's only a few
millimeters wider this means that for me
at least it fits comfortably in my hand
and I don't feel that I am performing
any more finger gymnastics than I would
with a smaller phone my test unit is a
white model and so the colouring is
chrome and white but there is also a
black model available around the phone
is a chrome colored band which is made
of plastic the back cover uses a
textured plastic which aids the grip
slightly according to the specs the
bezels are just 2.5 millimeters wide
which means that the phone has a screen
to body ratio of 78% to complement the
narrow bezels the echo Aurore uses 2.5 d
glass sometimes this term can be used
without much justification however it is
true the glass does curved at the edges
and it's rounded at the corners
however have a sneaking suspicion that
it has achieved more with a kind of
factory fitted glass screen protector
rather than buy some expensive glass
technology the reason I say that is
because of the little gap around the
earpiece which is reminiscent of the way
a screen protector is overlaid on a
display however I could be wrong
underneath the 2.5 D glass there is a
full HD 5.5 inch display the
front-facing camera a set of sensors and
the capacitive keys the home button is a
physical button and contains the
built-in fingerprint reader down the
right-hand side of the power button and
the volume rocker both are easily
accessible when the phone is held in
your left hand on the top you'll find
the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and
the microUSB port on the bottom edge of
the speaker grills and the microphone
flipping the phone over you will see the
prominent eco logo and the dual LED
flash and the camera lens the 5.5 inch
display on the Aurora efore it's good
considering the price point it is an IPS
display with a full HD resolution 1920
by 1080 that means it has a dpi of 400
overall the color reproduction and
definition are good has other viewing
angles I found the display to be quite
bright in a good sense
leaving the brightness on auto works
well but whenever I did force the
display to maximum brightness it was
just too bright for indoor use of course
this is a good thing as it meant the
display is easy to read when outdoors
the phone comes with a 3000 milliamp
hour battery which about what I would
expect for a phone of this size and
price my testing revealed some
interesting numbers before I started
testing the phone I left it to one side
when I worked on some other videos when
the battery went flat I were charged
again and so on when I finally got
around to testing the unit I just
started using it as it was the final
battery numbers for that first period of
real usage was 3 days and 18 hours with
3 hours of on-screen time once my
testing was fully underway I was hitting
around one day in five hours with about
two and a half hours of screen time I
also ran my customary set of tests on
one charge would be able to play
intensive 3d games for about three hours
game bench shows that tower madness will
run for about 5 hours for those into
multimedia be able to get about four and
a half hours of YouTube streaming from
this device on one charge the phone has
to speaker wheels on his bottom edge
however there is only one speaker
covering the right grille muffles as
sound as you'd expect
however the left grille appears just to
be for appearances overall the sound is
reasonable considering the price point
of this phone here's a sample so you can
for yourself unfortunate the GPS
performers isn't very reliable the
device is able to lock outdoors however
indoors a lot can't be achieved but the
main problem seems to be the lot isn't
stable or very accurate according to GPS
test of precision is over 20 feet some
six meters this leaves a big enough
margin of error that navigation software
like Google Maps or Nokia here don't
always know which rotor on the Aurora is
there o4 comes with two gigabytes of RAM
which is good for a phone in this price
range in terms of internal storage the
device comes with 16 gigabytes of flash
and has a micro SD card slot which can
accept cards up to 32 gigabytes
unfortunately the internal storage is
divided into two partitions called
internal storage and phone storage the
first is for your apps and the second is
for your personal data the good news is
the first partition is almost 6
gigabytes which should be sufficient to
install quite a few apps the other bit
of good news is the apps can be moved
from the internal storage to the phone
storage from within the settings menu
the phone has a 16 megapixel rear-facing
camera and an 8 megapixel front-facing
camera the pictures are crisp and the
color reproduction is good and overall
the camera is what you would expect for
a phone in this price range
the included app looks to be the
standard AOSP camera app and offers a
few interesting features including HDR
and panorama overall the app is fairly
comprehensive but it doesn't have any
advanced modes or filters of course you
can always install third-party camera
apps including Google's camera app if
you'd like to see more sample shots then
please check out the written review the
aurora is zero for run stock Android
4.4.4 you get access to Google Play in
all of Google services like YouTube
Gmail and maps interestingly the device
is rooted by default and comes with
chain fires supersu pre-installed the
fingerprint scanner is incorporated into
the home button and the software allows
you to set this screen to unlock only
with your fingerprint overall the
scanner and the unlock mechanism work
well the number of mysteries is quite
low and I was able to keep the feature
activated for quite a while
personally I deactivated it
not because the scanner isn't capable
enough but because swiping my finger to
unlock the screen became a bit
monotonous as for upgrades Eco has
promised to release an over-the-air
update to upgrade the phone to Android
lollipop there is no official release
date however it is expected soon and so
there you have it the echo Aurora is 0
for 5.5 inches full HD display 2 gigs of
RAM and an octa-core 64-bit processor it
cost us $190 and he's available today my
name is Gary synth Andrew authority I
hope you enjoyed this video if you did
please give it a thumbs up also don't
forget to use the comments below to tell
me what you think about this particular
device don't forget to subscribe to
Android authorities YouTube channel we
will see other videos bye my brother's
an Android Authority including JC Oh
Josh lon Chemical ninja Ashton Taylor
Martin and as for me I'll see you in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
