think of some people think of best
friends
some people think of beer and some
people think of legalize plants well
when I hear the word buds I think of ear
buds and today I'm reviewing the Weston
w10 ear buds let's begin this journey of
the Westone w tens with the Box first
thing that meets your eye on the box is
a square cardboard covering with a color
scheme of grey and orange in big bold
letters is the w-4 Westone and also in
white you see the W 10 model number at
the bottom and just under that it says
designed for serious listeners on the
back side it has a diagram that shows
all components of the headphone in a
brief description of each the box is a
soft touch material with the embedded W
logo and established in 1959 stamp once
you get the Box open you instantly get a
feeling of a high-class premium package
you are greeted with a message welcome
you to the Westone family and how they
appreciate your business
on the right side of the box we have the
actual hardware which is the earbuds the
padded star silicone tips trufit foam
tips epic g2 cable with MiFi control and
mic changeable face plates wax removal
tool mini screwdriver to remove the face
plates and a monitor vault if you want
to see a full unboxing you can check out
my youtube page that has the video on
there the link is in the description
below what makes these earbuds unique is
that the features and designs coincides
well all the way from the detachable
cord colored face plates into the dozens
of tips of different styles all allow
for an enjoyable experience a big
problem with a lot of earbuds or
headphones is that the cords are not
detachable this means that the cord
malfunctions it renders your device
useless and a lot of times you have to
send your headphones back to the
manufacturer to get it repaired I'm glad
that companies including West's own is
now giving options for the detachable
cord the W tents come with two cords one
that has a microphone and audio controls
on it and the other one is a braided
cord design both cores feel durable and
also feel like they are just the perfect
size just simply pulling it from the
earbud and
cords removed out of the box that w tins
use the cord with the microphone using
an iPhone all the controls work
flawlessly I was able to pause start go
back go forward adjust the volumes all
via the controls this functionality is
something that West don't cause the g2
rounded cable with my five it is a
mouthful but it works extremely well and
the buttons are very responsive you know
I wish I could say the same thing about
Android but just like the other earbuds
we only have some of this functionality
the w10 earbuds are not going to win any
beauty contests nor are they going to be
a pop culture icon but for people who
are serious about their music there
shouldn't be a problem if you're looking
to add an additional layer of style that
it comes with two additional shields
that can be replaced with the default
black ones additional plates are red in
blue and this just adds a subtle layer
of color to the earbuds not
groundbreaking but is still an option if
you want to change things up a little
bit the hardest thing for most users
about earbuds is finding the right size
that fits your ear in the past I've
returned earbuds because I could not
find the right tip the Debbie 10 tip
that came with the buds fits shockingly
well and I was able to seal my ear from
any outside noise since one of the
selling points are the true to fit foam
tips I gave them a try too so I ended up
finding the tips that fit my ear and to
my surprise they fit even better than
the defaults although the comfort level
was good I still had a bit of
awkwardness with the cord I know that
comfort is a subjective feeling one
thing that's comfortable to me may not
be comfortable to you with that being
said I was a bit underwhelmed with the
cord placement it is suggested to move
the cord over your ear to keep the buds
in place the cord would often fall from
behind my ear and then pull my earbud
partially out of my ear and this one
happened without physical activity I was
just sitting at my desk working or even
watching a movie on my tablet overall I
was unimpressed about how they felt but
you should take that with a grain of
salt at times I can wear earbuds for
four or five hours at a time and comfort
to me is a huge selling point
performance is where audio equipment
makes their names I tested the earbuds
using an ear test comparing FLAC audio
against other air buds in the same price
range and also running a series of audio
tests these tests consist of frequency
response dynamic range quality driver
matching and
so wiring these tests were performed
using audio check net the sensitivity
came in at 122 decibels SPL at 1
milliwatt the frequency response range
was 20 Hertz to 16 kilohertz impedance
which is a measure of the opposition
that a circuit presents to a current
when a voltage is applied it is a
complex ratio of voltage to the current
that is an AC circuit passive noise
attenuation is at 25 dB the W tens use a
balanced armature full range driver and
now to explain this this really needs
its own video to really explain what it
does and sort of a Reader's Digest
version this is what it is a balanced
armature is a sound transducer design
which is intended to increase the
electrical efficiency of the element by
eliminating the stress of the diaphragm
characteristics of many other magnetic
transition systems the W tends way in at
a light point for four or five ounces or
12 point 7 grams these buds are pretty
lightweight if you can get the perfect
fitting you hardly notice that they're
there now as far as base the W tens
aren't the boo Mia's pair of in ears in
the root song star the base is a little
recessed and it just sounds a bit muddy
it's not as extended when compared to my
monster I support in ears and also the
beats by dre earbuds now I would
recommend these to a base set that
listens to a lot of hip-hop or any type
of EDM music because this could ruin
your experience completely now with the
mids the w2's put a slight emphasis on
the mids when compared to the bass they
could get a bit muddy though but overall
they have a nice organic sound to them
and especially shine in alternative rock
songs in regards to the highs these
earbuds really shine listening to Celine
Dion belt out those high notes was a
true dream and it almost seemed like she
was sitting next to me wisely now for me
the trouble sounds good as well
it doesn't have that crashing sound that
you expect with other earbuds especially
at the higher levels I know the other
earbuds sometimes when it's in your ear
it just really sounds bad now this has a
smooth and subtle treble sounds
extremely good now what I like to do is
instead of heaven all the way up I have
to go one notch under the full volume
and for me that sounds very good
overall I think the Westone w tins would
do a good job for people who prefer
listening to jazz rock or similar genres
the sound signature is more natural
compared to my monster I Sport and beats
by dre studios I also own a pair of
cliffs extends and
ears which offer a very similar sound to
the W tins I do feel that the W tins
really shine we're listening to vocals
at times other earbuds can sound
uncomfortable at high level but if
you're a basehead you may end up a bit
disappointed the bass is just not as
strong to justify the purchase if that's
what you're looking for still these
headphones are pleasure to listen to and
if you can get the right audio behind it
they could truly become a bargain for
the quality this concludes the west
