authority here we're wrapping things up
at MWC 2016 and one of the most
interesting things to come out of the
show is actually not related to a
specific phone but rather a feature
common to quite a few phones so a few
days before the show we heard word from
a few people that pre-release versions
of the Android and release that would be
out later in the year actually don't
have an after all
so we investigate a little bit more we
got some more confirmation and then on
the weekend we found out that the LG g5
does not have an app drawer the next day
we found out that the galaxy s7 and s7
edge do have an app drawer that have an
option to get rid of it not long after
that we found out that the HTC One X 9
also doesn't have one and this starts to
point us in the direction that Android
7.0 will not have an app drawer so we
reached out to Google Google of course
didn't want to say anything in
particular we're keeping an eye out for
any further confirmations but when you
think about it it's starting to make a
lot of sense obviously OMS has early
access to new builds of Android and it's
a little bit too convenient that
everyone is doing something similar at
the same time of course the next bit
Robin doesn't have an app drawer far
away and Xiaomi haven't had one for a
while either
so it's quite possible but the next
major version of Android will be losing
one of the most recognizable features of
Android itself now we know that Google
hasn't been happy with the app drawer
for a while in Android marshmallow we
saw it go from a horizontal card stack
down into a endlessly scrolling vertical
list now just because Google wants to
get rid of it or may want to get rid of
it doesn't necessarily mean that it will
be gone Samsung having the option with a
happy face smiley face kind of up-down
vote system means that if enough people
with the galaxy s7 and s7 edge actually
want to keep the app drawer there's
potential that Samsung will choose to do
so and of course they can because
Android is open source and manufacturers
can do whatever they like with it so the
big question is why would you get rid of
the app drawer in the first place it's a
bit of a fan favorite it's pretty
convenient and moving to a home page
based endless list of app icons is very
iOS and also
adds quite a few steps to getting to the
app that you want we asked LG obviously
that were the first cab off the rank and
we were told that they did extensive
market research not just in Asia but
globally and it was actually the North
American market that swung the favor in
balance of getting rid of it they told
us that it was a bit too difficult to
have the option it would only confuse
things more and they're generally
speaking people want a simpler more easy
to navigate interface make of that what
you will we're kind of fans of the app
drawer but let us know in the comments
below what you should want to see in the
next version of Android and of course
hit that subscribe button like this
video if you have liked the video
not necessarily the topic of the video
and let us know in the comments what you
think Google should do in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
