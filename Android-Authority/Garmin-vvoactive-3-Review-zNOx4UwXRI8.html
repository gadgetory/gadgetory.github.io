active 3 is my new favorite fitness
tracker and that's because it takes a
lot of the best features from older
Garmin devices and puts them into a
newer and more premium looking design so
yeah the first thing you're going to
notice when you look at the vivoactive 3
is that new design if you're familiar
with the older vivoactive HR then that
was quite a square bulky industrial
looking plasticy fitness tracker this
looks a lot more like a watch in fact it
looks quite a lot like the Phoenix 5
which is a much more expensive model
from Garmin gone is the square design
you've now got a round watch race and
that's surrounded by a nice stainless
steel bezel the screen is bright and
punchy which is also a big improvement
from the older devices and that's got
Gorilla Glass 3 to protect it from
scratches and around the back it's nice
and flat and that makes it very
comfortable to wear there's no ugly
protrusion where the heart rate sensor
goes meaning that when you take it off
you don't have a nasty red mark on your
wrist this looks like a watch it feels
much more comfortable to wear and it's
easy to forget you're wearing it which
is something you definitely could have
said about the previous models it's a
lot less conspicuous under a suit and in
general it's something you can wear
comfortably all day which is kind of the
point of a fitness tracker the device
comes in 3 different colors and that
includes a slightly more feminine white
and that's very welcomed because the
older devices were very masculine and if
you want more personalization
customization then you can buy new watch
straps for it and the good news here is
there's no proprietary technology it's
just your regular 20 millimeter strap so
yeah the device looks good it feels good
it's also durable and it's water
resistant up to 50 meters so you can
take it running in the rain you can
shower with it and of course you can go
swimming and use the swim tracking there
as well note that you won't be able to
use the heart rate monitor at the same
time as swimming and there's no open
water swimming so if you are a
professional swimmer this might not be
the watch for you but for most of us who
just want to use the pool for a bit of a
cardio workout every now and then it
should be perfectly sufficient and
speaking of activity tracking this
device has got it all going on there are
15 different profiles in total that
includes all of your regular stuff like
walking jogging cycling and some more
unique and interesting options like golf
like elliptical like Miska lanius cardio
workouts and like strength which I'll
get to more in a moment of course this
being a Garmin watch and Garmin being
well known for their GPS devices running
and walking that's where it's really at
this is a very good running watch so
yeah Garmin uses not only GPS but also
GLONASS which should
runs more accurate and in my test it
does seem to track my roots very well
what's also really good is just how much
information gaffe to run so you get all
of the usual stuff such as your heart
rate your time and different heart rate
zones your average pace your best speed
etc but you also get some more
interesting options such as your
elevation during the run thanks to the
barometer and you get your cadence which
isn't always available and you'll even
get an estimate for your vo2 max which
is very useful for seeing your general
fitness improve over time so select new
feature that comes over from the
vivosmart 3 is weight lifting tracking
and the idea here is that it can count
reps and identify different exercises
for you this is a really useful thing in
theory in practice not quite so much so
the rep counting even is hit or miss a
lot of the time I'll do 8 or 10 and it
will say I've done 6 or 7 or 15 so
you'll have to edit it manually in terms
of identifying the exercises I do think
it's really impressive it can do this at
all and I am amazed when I do a bench
press or I pull up and it tells me
that's what I did but again it hits and
misses on about a 50/50 basis so that
means a lot of the time I'll do one
exercise and it will say it's something
different or it just won't know at all
and of course there are some exercises
that you're never gonna be on a track so
if you're doing a leg press for
instances you don't move your upper body
there's no way that that can be detected
and all other exercises I do just won't
be on there like a muscle up isn't going
to be detected by your beaver active 3
and not only that but a lot of time I
won't just do a normal set of exercises
then just do 3 sets of 10 I'll do a drop
set and mechanical drop set I'll hold it
at the end I'll do a burn set I'll do
force reps and these are things you just
can't pick up I do complexes and this is
stuff that is just beyond the ability of
a fitness tracker to register so this is
a useful feature at all well not for me
really but for the average gym rat which
just does 3 times 10 of their different
exercises then arguably it could be
somewhat useful the fact that it has
this nice big screen and the touch
screen needs that if it gets it wrong
you can very easily edit the exercise or
the number of reps and fortune if you
want to enter your weight on here for
some reason it goes up by one and you'll
just be tapping like this so that's not
terribly helpful but yeah it could be
sort of useful for some people and I do
hope that Garmin keeps working on this
because in theory
like I say it's a good idea one other
thing I will say is that in principle
something like this takes your head out
of the game and being mindful of your
workouts and being focused on what
you're doing is really important the
mind muscle connection is really
important and if you're taking ages to
input your data on your wrist and you're
forgetting sometimes to press start and
stop then again it kind of takes your
head out of the game and you might have
a slightly less intense workout as a
result our knee would not be impressed
so this is the difference of vision I'm
gonna see guys texting then that's to us
this is Mickey Mouse stuff but that
aside as a fitness tracker is very good
it's got a lot of different options and
a lot of different features the ability
to change the readout on the screen is
super helpful and you can even design
your own workouts and put them on your
wrist you can download workouts so
really it's a very feature packed
fitness tracker for heart rate
monitoring doing your exercises
elevators back once again and this is
one of the better heart rate monitoring
solutions that you can wear on your
wrist again it's not going to be as
accurate as a chest worn heart rate
monitor and for something like
weightlifting it's going to be
particularly difficult because the
contractions in your muscles actually
alter the blood flow that makes it more
difficult for heart rate monitor on your
wrist to work but again for most
people's purposes it's more than
sufficient and I haven't had any
problems with it I think it's fairly
accurate and of course during the day it
will monitor your health and tell you
things like your steps taking your heart
rate and it will measure your sleep and
show you that and this is all once again
fairly accurate and it is useful to be
able to see how you perform during the
day whether you could be a little bit
more active you get your movement
reminders as usual although you can turn
them off they annoy you and you can have
an auto adjusting goal so that it gives
you realistic step targets it's all very
good
just helpful little reminders to keep
you active and healthy it does
synchronize with My Fitness Pal and
that's also very useful because if
you're tracking your calories to lose
weight or following your macros then
this can save a lot of time and effort
for you as a sleep tracker it's not one
of the best Fitbit does do it better not
only does it not give you the same
breakdown of information as a Fitbit
does but I find it's not that good at
auto detecting when I fall asleep and
wake up sometimes it's very good and
it'll tell me that I've been awake for
10 minutes because I needed the loop
other times it's not so good and it'll
think that I was still asleep when
actually I was awake for an hour so
sleep tracking isn't my favorite feature
on this but it's nice to
it there nonetheless in whatever shape
it takes one slightly more novel aspect
for health tracking and life logging is
the ability to measure your stress this
should monitor your heart rate
variability which in turn tells you
whether you're sympathetic or
parasympathetic nervous system is
dominant in other words it tells you if
you're in fight-or-flight more or rest
and digest more this is something of a
novelty my friends really enjoy it they
like asking me Adam how stressing you
and I go oh I'm 90% stressed and it can
be useful as well because it has this
rest timer on it so if you feel stressed
and you and your wrist tells you your
stress you can take this two-minute
timeout and do a little breathing
exercise you can make it longer or
shorter I always think that this would
be a good place to put a meditation app
but I've yet to see a fitness tracker do
it I'm not sure how useful this is
really though in theory it could be
useful it could tell you a little bit
about how recovered you are after your
training because heart rate variability
also cover Lakes with your recovery so
it can tell you whether you're ready to
go to the gym again or not but for now
it's just kind of a fun novelty and it
doesn't always correlate with how I'm
actually feeling in general I'd like to
see fitness trackers and companies
synergize their information a little bit
more for instance wouldn't be good to
see whether or not your stress levels
affect your workout quality or your
sleep quality that's the kind of thing
I'd like to see in future and hopefully
the companies are just collecting all
this data our gonna be sticking that
into some big algorithms and we can get
more useful insights like that in future
another slight criticism of this device
and of Garmin fitness trackers in
general is the app whilst it has a ton
of data and it's really good for that
and I like all the insights it gives you
and the ability to compare yourself with
other people your similar age on the
other hand it's rather obtuse to
navigate the UX is not particularly good
and a lot of stuff you're not going to
discover because it's so hidden behind
the layers of menus it's not as good as
fitbit's but it does the job and once
you get used to it it's not really a big
issue but something that often gets
overlooked with these Garmin devices is
that they're also actually quite good
smartwatches so you get your
notifications on here and you can see
text you can even respond to text you
can see your whatsapp messages you can
see your calendar appointments and all
that regular stuff you also get the
ability to control your music playback
though unfortunately there's no music
storage and that will lose at some point
against competitors like the Fitbit
ionic which can do that but where this
device really comes into its own as a
SmartWatch is
it's ability to install custom-made apps
from the community so you can head over
to the connect IQ store and here you can
download a range of different things so
there's a ton of useful and not so
useful stuff on here I've got Tetris and
I've also got Tasker and this means that
in theory I can control any feature of
my phone from my wrist which is very
cool there's also custom watch faces so
you can again change the look of your
device even more unfortunately when I
download third-party watch faces at the
moment they drain the battery but
hopefully this is something they'll be
patched before the watch is officially
released and another new feature is
Garmin pay which means he should be able
to use contactless payments from your
wrist because getting out your phone is
apparently now too much effort to be
honest this is something I'd like to use
unfortunately it wasn't ready for
testing at the time that I got the
review device but in theory it should
all work and it means that yeah you
don't have to fiddle around with your
phone even let alone a wallet Garmin
says that the device has got a battery
life of seven days in practice it's a
bit closer to four or five days but when
you consider all this stuff it's got
packed into it that's actually pretty
good so you're in a nutshell the garmin
vivoactive 3 is just a really good
fitness tracker it combines pretty much
all the different features and activity
tracking options that you could want and
then some and puts it into an attractive
and affordable design this is an example
of a company iterating on previous
generations and coming up with something
that is just the best version of what it
can be and for the end user those are
often the best kind of devices of course
it would be nice to see a little bit
more innovation in this market but for
now this is one of the best all-round
fitness trackers you can buy as you can
tell I am a big fan so thanks ton for
watching guys I hope you found this
video useful and interesting if you did
