Authority and we got a chance to take a
pretty extensive look at the LGV 20 and
we figured why not compare its camera to
one of the best smartphone cameras
currently on the market with the note 7
but before we get into all of that
our very own Joshua Pagar is going to
walk you through the new camera app on
the LGB 20 hey it's Josh regard from
Android Authority what's going on
everybody and here we're taking a look
at the LG v 20 but in this particular
video we're going to take a look at the
cameras CS cameras we have two different
lenses on the back and the front of the
LGV 20 that have wide-angle lenses as
part of the construction so you have the
ability to take some narrow shots and
some wide shots no matter which side of
the cameras you're using but we're going
to go ahead and fire up the camera here
and take a look at the different
elements now the interface of the LG v
20s cameras actually use the second
screen up here so you can change between
of a number of different modes there is
the auto mode here that will allow for
the usage of the simple mode just
tapping on the screen in order to focus
and taking your shot which is really
easy and there are a few modes that you
can go through including time-lapse
which I used a lot in a vlogging video
that you'll be able to see here at
Android authorities YouTube channel now
you also have pop-out the multi view
which are also used and after that you
also have the panorama a couple modes
that are pretty standard for a camera
like this moving over to the manual
photo mode you have all of the different
options down here for shutter speed the
white balance even manual focus so that
you can change the focus and as you can
see there it has focus peaking so all of
that green fuzzy lining that you see
around certain subjects that means that
that subject is in focus so it'll be
easy to get the focus so that you can
easily get a very crisp shot so finally
we have
the manual video mode now you get all of
the same options on here with a couple
of additions including an audio monitor
and the ability to change the audio
settings by changing limits also the
gain and even changing the direction
which you try to do in a couple of Clips
in that vlogging video so if we turn off
the options that you just have the full
area in the viewfinder and we turn off
the lock on the autofocus and the auto
exposure and you can still use it for
the most part like an auto mode but it's
when you get into all of the different
settings that you can change everything
to get the perfect shot that you want
and of course you have the manual focus
which will be available with the focus
peaking but the focus peaking does not
work while you are recording your video
now that you're a little more familiar
with a be twenties camera software and
the features that it brings to the table
let's take a look at a few camera
samples and see exactly how will it be
20 stacks up against the note 7 in terms
of picture quality something to bear in
mind as we take a look at these photos
is that the b20 that we have is a
pre-production unit and while we're
pretty confident a whole lot isn't going
to change with the final production unit
it is still a possibility that there
could be some changes to the camera
software and its image processing so
we're going to start with a low-light
shot simply because a lot more people
these days are taking photos in low
light so low light performance on a
smartphone camera is becoming
increasingly more important this is an
image of the outside of a local bar in
Berlin and without zooming in and pixel
peeping the first thing you'll notice
right off the bat is the colors of these
two images are very different the image
on the note 7 has much warmer color
tones whereas the b20 is much cooler and
a warmer or cooler image is more of a
matter of personal preference but the
note sevens image is actually the one
that is more accurately portraying how
it looked like in real life but that's
about the only advantage that the note
seven has in this shot as far as detail
goes the v20 is much sharper and more
detailed if you zoom in you'll
definitely see noise which is to be
expected on any camera in low-light but
the noise on the b20 is much finer and
more compact whereas the note 7 is much
more spread out and splotchy in
appearance and it just makes the overall
image look much softer another prime
example would be this cappuccino
come again the note seven looks warmer
than the image from the b20 and if you
zoom in you'll see that the note seventh
image is much softer especially along
the edges and there's less detail now
the V Tony isn't always superior in
every low-light condition this one for
example is from the inside of a bar and
just like the first low-light shot that
we looked at the note seven produces an
image that is much more accurate to how
it was perceived in real life
while the v20 produced an image that
looked extremely unnatural with
excessive amounts of reds and oranges
and it's also very overexposed if you're
a foodie type person like me you'll most
likely be using your camera a lot to
document restaurants that you go to and
the food that you eat so this next shot
is of a sign for a restaurant called bun
Bao yes I know what you're thinking an
Asian restaurant in Germany sounds a
little weird but trust me it was good
stuff in terms of color and detail they
both look pretty similar and I think
most people would be happy with either
one of these shots but it won't take
long to notice that the biggest
difference between these two shots is
the dynamic range if you're look on the
right side you can see perfectly through
the windows on the note seven while on
the b20 it's pretty tough to make out
much of anything that's going on through
those windows so there's definitely more
detail here on the note seven but what
about actual food photos well this first
image is of a mango lassi drink that we
had at this restaurant and you'll notice
right away so the colors again are very
different Samsung is usually known for
putting a lot of saturation in their
images but next to the same photo from
the v20 the note 7 almost appears flat
now extra color and saturation doesn't
necessarily make one photo more superior
than the other because things like color
temperature and saturation is a matter
of personal preference and you can
easily achieve the same look by altering
it in post which most people typically
do anyways when posting photos to
Instagram if you zoom in and take a
closer look it's the same story that we
saw from previous photos the noise that
you see along the edges it's much finer
on the b20 and it's just a much sharper
image overall if we take a close look at
this bun Bao burger that we had here
you'll notice the same thing there's
much more detail and more definitive
lines on the v20 while everything just
looks much softer on the note 7 and even
looking at the background of this image
you'll see a lot more splotchiness and
it's just not as clean
an image as the bee 20s another type of
shot that a lot of people tend to take
with their smartphones are macro shots
this is a pretty simple close-up shot of
a flower and in terms of color
reproduction and detail you too look
practically identical however you will
notice that the note sevens image looks
a lot closer and that's because it is in
our experience of note 7 has a much
shorter working distance allowing you to
get much closer to your subject so if
you like taking macro shots and getting
up close and personal the note 7 looks
to be a better camera for that to wrap
up this camera comparison we're going to
take a look at some wide landscape shots
which is another very common type of
photo that people like to take and this
will give you an even better idea of how
these new cameras perform in terms of
overall detail and dynamic range this
first image is of a fountain that we ran
across here in Berlin just like the
images that we looked at prior you'll
immediately notice that the note sevens
image is warmer and in this type of shot
it works really well in Samsung's favour
the Sun reflecting off the leaves around
the fountain are much more prominent
whereas on the b20 it almost looks like
there isn't any Sun at all and that it
was shot on a completely different day
you'll also notice that again dynamic
range here is also better which is
easily noticeable just by looking at the
clouds you can see the sky and the
details and the clouds on the note 7
while on the v20 it's completely blown
out and overexposed the same thing can
be said with the second image here where
there was a lot of harsh sunlight and a
lot of shadows the clouds are blown out
on this image as well and you can tell
that it doesn't handle the harsh
lighting from the Sun bouncing off these
stone walls quite as well as the note 7
so in these type of situations
Samsung definitely wins out here well
that about does it for this quick
feature focus and camera comparison
between the b20 and the note 7 hopefully
this gave you a better idea of how these
two cameras compare in terms of photos
and if you're wondering about the
superior video capabilities of the V
Tony you can check that out in a
separate video where we spent the entire
day blogging and testing out the video
quality and features of the B Tony so
