whole note 7 Fiasco is that the Galaxy
s8 may be coming a whole lot sooner
there's been plenty of rumors suggesting
Samsung will move up the timeframe for
the Galaxy s8 in order to put the note 7
drama behind it and get back into the
news in a more positive light a new
report from the Korea Herald backs up
this claim and I quote if Samsung's
flagship smartphone launch is delayed to
the end of the first quarter of next
year the profitability of the mobile
business division could be worsened next
year also now in the middle of all this
insiders reporting to Sam mobile have
now revealed the new model numbers for
the Galaxy s8 the S M G 950 and the SM G
955 reportedly one of the models will be
a smaller screen the other larger
similar to the s7 and s7 edge though
both phones might have edge displays
this time round internally they are
reportedly going with the code names of
dream and dream two but let's talk about
more positive Samsung news in the form
of the Samsung Galaxy a nine pro samsung
has unveiled its new Galaxy a nine pro
in India which is the new cream of the
crop of the company's Galaxy a series
the handset features considerably more
powerful specs than the other a series
handsets and a few upgrades over the
regular a nine for starters the handset
packs a powerful octa-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon 650 two processor the chips
boast for high-performance 1.8 gigahertz
cortex a 72 cores and for low-power
cortex a53 cores backed up by an Adreno
510 GPU there's also a huge 4 gigabytes
of RAM on board
accompanied by 32 gigabytes of
expandable internal storage it's turning
out to be a pretty sweet mid-range
device keep in mind that by comparison
the original a 9 had a four thousand
milliamp hour battery 13 megapixel
camera and three gigabytes of RAM not
too shabby
and it's even better now now let's talk
about Google and Google continues to
play offense when it comes to the
messaging market google announced their
brand new
a low messaging service at i/o this year
and we did know exactly when it would
launch but now we do for those of you
who don't know Google a low is a
messaging service that promises
self-expression Google assistant
features and security and privacy some
people compared to whatsapp as it pulls
users from your contact list but it also
has its own set of features which
include a plethora of emojis and
stickers as well as smart replies our
virtual assistant and an incognito mode
now I had already shot today's show it
was all done and then I had some sort of
audio problem and I had to reshoot it so
I'm reading it now but I learned in
between that time that Google allo will
actually launch September 21st that's in
two days so what do you guys think will
this be successful or will it go the way
of the duo bird see what I did there
dodo bird duo bird google duo little
things that give me pleasure now after
all the beating that Samsung has been
taking over the Galaxy Note 7 there was
only really one thing left for Samsung
to do and that's apologize last week Tim
Baxter the president and CEO of Samsung
Electronics America personally addressed
all note 7 users his message we
apologize and please turn off your note
7 here are the facts Baxter says beseech
in the camera with a look of dismay the
CPSC has worked closely with us to
develop expedite and execute a plan to
protect users we notified them of a
potential defect in the original Galaxy
Note battery then issued a global
directive to stop sales immediately to
date we have already exchanged a hundred
and thirty thousand units it's a fast
and meaningful start now Baxter's final
words to all you note 7 users is to our
note 7 owners if you have not yet
replaced your original note 7 please
PLEASE power it down and return if you
guys will remember from like 15 years
ago when people were making money hand
over fist in the.com bubble
remember we didn't call it a dotnet
bubble or dot org bubble we didn't call
them dot biz billionaires we called them
dot-com billionaires because that's the
power of a.com now why is that because
no domain name extension tells your
story with the same two
of trust as a dot-com or dotnet domain
name.com and dotnet domain name
extensions inject credibility into your
online presence save 15% on domain names
and web hosting when you use our coupon
code Android at domain.com check out
when you think domain names think
domain.com now for all you early
