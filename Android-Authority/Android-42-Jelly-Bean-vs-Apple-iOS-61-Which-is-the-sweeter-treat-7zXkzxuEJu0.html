Authority channel Android and iOS are
two greatly different worlds each one
having a thick population of users the
experience in each environment is such
that by grading from one to another
often causes culture shock but then
again once settled in the newcomer
realizes that even though Android and
iOS seemed to be completely worlds apart
they actually do have certain
similarities in this episode let's talk
about the latest version of Android
Android 4.2.1 jelly bean and apple's
latest software
iOS 6.1 how are they alike how do they
differ watch this review and find out
first let's talk about one of the most
important aspects of any mobile
operating system please your interface
right after booting up your phone or
tablet you'll see its lockscreen
what does jelly beans lockscreen allows
you to do besides unlocking the device a
lot actually
for one it shows you a digital clock
with the day and day this wants the icon
for unlocking the phone just drag it to
the outer ring to unlock you can also
launch androids default search app
Google now like this or launch the
camera by pulling the right edge to the
middle or even view lock screen widgets
for Gmail text messages calendar events
and more you can also access your
notifications right on the lock screen
just pull down the notification shape to
see what new notices are waiting for you
or change some device settings quickly
by pulling down the quick settings menu
in jelly bean on tablets you'll also see
user icon part of the new multi user
feature which lets you set up more than
want to use your profile on a tablet
what about on iOS 6
not nearly as fancy as Android but the
lockscreen here pretty much does a lot
of what Android can for instance the
time day and date are also displayed
here although without the year this
slider as a guest is for unlocking the
phone slide it this way to launch the
camera it's a little bit different on
the iPad 4 there's no shortcut to the
camera but there's one for the photo
frame feature Apple's virtual voice
assistant Siri can also be summoned from
the lockscreen
just tap and hold the home button the
Notification Center however is not
accessible from the lockscreen unlike an
Android instead the notifications
themselves are shown on the lock screen
and you can act on them right from the
lock screen in both jellybean and iOS 6
the home screen is the starting point of
all that you want to accomplish on your
phone or tablet it basically functions
like the desktop on a computer in jelly
bean the main home screen looks like
this you get a status bar which usually
just shows the time network signal
strength and battery level here's a
clock widget which you can remove if you
want down here is the favorites tray for
holding your most used app shortcuts and
below the favorites tray is the
navigation bar in iOS you get pretty
much the same elements and functionality
although they look a bit different
this is the status bar here you don't
get a clock widget in iOS because it
doesn't allow visits on the home screen
but you do get all of your apps on the
home screen this down here is the app
dock or favorites tray and below it is
the navigation bar with only the home
button in jellybean you'll have five
home screens to use and that's a fixed
number you can't remove home screens or
add more you can play stuff here such as
widgets which are useful mini windows to
your apps this is something that I OS
doesn't support you can change the home
screens background you can even change
it to a moving background known as live
wallpaper which is another feature not
available in iOS you can place app sort
cuts like these ones here you can even
organize the shortcuts into folders like
this one if you don't like the
arrangement move things around or remove
them except the Google search bar which
always wants to stay on this spot on all
home screens iOS on the other hand
creates home screens as needed when one
home screen is filled up a new one is
created to accommodate the new shortcuts
like an Android you can also group these
icons into folders or rearrange the
icons according to your preference the
search function is on its own page to
the left of the main home screen the
favorites tray in jelly bean and the app
dock in iOS 6 are nothing more but
containers are holders for your favorite
app shortcuts
unlike shortcuts on the home screen
these favorite shortcuts don't move with
the home screen they stay in place on
this bar on all home screens within
quick and easy reach on bones you can
place up to four shortcuts or folder on
the favorites bar and more on tablets in
jelly bean however the app drawer
shortcut is not removable iOS doesn't
have an app drawer for navigation
Android 4.2 relies heavily on dynamic
virtual buttons such as these ones for
back home in recent apps you will see
these buttons a nearly every page and
screen but at times they hide or
completely disappear from view to give
more viewing space iOS 6 uses a
different navigation logic instead of
using virtual navigation it relies
mostly on just one physical button the
home button which is a check of many
traits including waking the device
returning to the main home screen
opening the search page on the home
screen
launching Siri showing music playback
control bar on lock screen and opening
the app switcher to switch between tasks
tap the recent apps button in jellybean
or double tap the home button in iOS to
open the app switcher in Android you'll
see a scrollable wall of thumbnails of
apps that you recently opened easily
remove apps from the wall just by
flicking to either left or right in the
app switcher in iOS you'll see only the
app icons to remove them first long tap
on an icon until it Wiggles then tap on
the remove badge on each icon it's a
simple app switcher but there's more
scroll to the left of the app switcher
to access buttons for locking screen
orientation playback control and the
music app scroll further to the left to
find the volume slider notifications in
both jellybean and iOS alert you to
items that need action or your attention
the two operating systems however differ
in the way notifications are displayed
or handled in jellybean you get
notifications through the notification
shade or the notifications menu just
pull down the status bar to open it you
can expand or collapse long
notifications dismiss notifications one
at a time by flicking it to the left or
right or dismiss all in one go with the
help of this button certain types of
notifications are also actionable
notification of a missed call for
example will display callback and
message buttons so you can respond right
away from the notification shade jelly
beans notification shade also lets you
reach for your most frequently accessed
settings and toggles through this new
button which opens the quick settings
menu this menu can also be accessed by
pulling down the status bar with two
fingers or on tablets by pulling
downwards from the right half of the
status bar in iOS 6 the Notification
Center can be open just like an Android
but unlike an Android you can't flick a
notification to dismiss it you can
remove notification groups only one at a
time it can get tedious if you get a lot
of notifications but this also ensures
that you do see all notifications after
all in iOS just like an Android you can
set which apps to allow to push
notifications to the Notification Center
iOS however lets you choose how to
display notifications while the home
screen in iOS does not allow widgets'
its Notification Center does although
just a select view on the iPhone 5 for
instance the weather in the stock
exchange widgets are present in a
Notification Center by default or you
can deactivate them if you
if you log into your Facebook and
Twitter accounts widgets for them will
also appear in the Notification Center
and you can post updates and tweets
right from the Notification Center both
Android 4.2 and iOS 6 provides simple
stock keyboards with multi-language
support voice detects input word
prediction spelling suggestions auto
correction and more I like the jellybean
keyboard for four reasons first the
keyboard keys display in uppercase or
lowercase when using the shift key in
the iOS keyboard the keys are always in
uppercase second it has voice-to-text
functionality just like the iOS keyboard
but jellybean lets me use it even
without an internet connection
boy stur texting iOS always wants an
internet connection third next word
selection guesses and suggests what word
am I type next it saves me time iOS
doesn't have this feature and fourth if
I don't feel like tap typing I can slide
type through jelly beans gesture typing
feature this works like swipe and is not
available in iOS asks for the iOS
keyboard I like it for two reasons first
it has a bigger collection of emoji
icons which puts the Android keyboards
text emoticons to shame and second the
iOS keyboard for tablets can be split to
make thumb typing easier the stock
Android keyboard doesn't have this
ability jellybean and iOS have features
that make them usable and accessible to
as many people as possible including
those with disabilities Android 4.2
accessibility features include voice
feedback navigation by swiping display
magnification larger text auto rotating
screen speaking out passwords
text-to-speech accessibility shortcut
and web accessibility scripts I like iOS
sixes accessibility features better they
are grouped according to disability such
as vision hearing learning and physical
and motor disability the options include
such features as voice feedback zooming
in large text inverting colors text to
speech output hearing aid mode camera
flash alerts monel audio guided access
assistive touch and adjusting click
speed for the home button on a regular
desktop computer screen savers activate
to prevent screen burn and to lessen
power consumption Android 4.2 has a
similar feature called daydream it
automatically kicks in when your device
is charging or docked you can
used to show a photo frame a photo table
trends from Google Currents a dynamic
colored wallpaper or a clock a
screensaver let's now take a look at the
communication features in Android 4.2 in
iOS 6 for managing contacts he have the
people app in Android 4.2 and the
contacts app in iOS 6 both apps perform
exactly the same role to organize your
contents you can't store contact
information locally import contacts from
the storage or sim or sync existing
contacts from your Google account in the
case of jellybean or from iCloud in the
case of iOS the contacts list in iOS
looks like a virtual phonebook nothing
more just a list of names even a
contacts info page looks very plain and
simple small thumbnail photo here
contact name and contact number and
email to call tap the phone number to
send email tap on the address there are
also quick buttons down here for
composing a text message sharing the
contact card calling through FaceTime or
adding the contact of favorites I find
Android 4.2 s people app more colorful
and more interesting it gets three
different ways to view your contacts
through the group's tab through the
contacts list and through your favorites
all your contacts are sorted
alphabetically on the list with a mini
profile picture beside each name each
contacts page shows a bigger profile
photo contact info in recent status
updates from google plus calling
contacts can be done with just a tap on
a context number in iOS the phone app
has tabs for favorites recent contacts
keypad and voicemail tap the label to
switch to the tab in Android you get
only three dialer call logs and people
switching between tabs is easy just
swipe left or right the iOS phone dialer
is simple it's just a tile of number
keys with the call backspace and add new
contact buttons at the bottom the
Android dialer is the same but I think
it looks better androids call logs tab
and iOS this recent tab show your call
history iOS lets you view all calls or
only missed calls missed calls are shown
in red so you can easily spot them
Android lets you see more of your call
history you can view all calls or filter
the list to show missed calls only
outgoing calls only are incoming calls
only iOS splits favorites and contacts
into two separate tabs
start contacts are on the favorites tab
and the rest are on the Contacts tab
Android merges these two tabs into just
one the people tab where your start
contacts are displayed in a magazine
style layout at the top of the list
followed by your most frequently called
contacts and finally the rest of your
contacts who have phone numbers for
incoming calls both platforms display
the contact information and profile
picture on the screen iOS makes it
extremely easy to take a call just swipe
the slider like this to decline a call
you'll need to take an extra step drag
this tab upwards to show additional
buttons to reject the call reply with a
message or to decline the call and
remind you about it in one hour the
extra step is a feature for preventing
accidentally rejecting calls in the case
of Android every action that you might
possibly need to do for an incoming call
is right there on the incoming call
screen answer the call reject the call
or decline the call and send a canned
message to avoid accidentally answering
or rejecting you'll need to drag this
button to the outer ring tax-base
communication in jellybean is handled by
the messaging Gmail and stock email apps
in iOS
it's the messages and mail apps the app
for SMS and MMS messages in both
operating systems have similar functions
conversations are displayed as text
bubbles in a conversation thread I find
androids conversation threads more
pleasant because thumbnail photos of the
sender and receiver are displayed along
with the messages iOS has a plain and
simple conversation thread the text
bubbles in iOS are color-coded grey for
messages received green for messages
sent via your phone carrier and blue for
messages sent via iMessage long tapping
on a message in iOS lets you copy the
message in Android you can copy forward
lock delete or view details of the
message iOS also allows you to select
multiple messages in a thread to either
forward or delete in Android you have to
either delete individually or all
messages at once you can access messages
from the lock screen and home screen on
either iOS or jellybean in iOS a message
notification alert appears on the lock
screen and in the notification center
Android allows more access by letting
you use the messages widgets on both
lock screen and home screen jellybean
uses Gmail as a default email client but
for
those who don't have or don't want Gmail
there's the stock email app for Android
it supports the pop3 IMAP and exchange
protocols in iOS you only have the mail
app there's an official Gmail app for
iOS but it is not installed by default
you can set up an iCloud exchange Gmail
Yahoo AOL or hotmail account in the mail
app you can also manually set up a pop3
or IMAP account both Android and iOS are
app driven platforms everything you do
on your device you do through an app in
Android the Google Play Store is the
main and preferred source of apps but
definitely not the only one in iOS it's
the Apple App Store these repositories
practically have the same functions
although they look and are laid out
differently to install an app from these
official sources just tap on the install
button on the apps page when you install
apps in iOS the system will prompt you
for your password this is a security
feature Android 4.2 however doesn't
prompt you for your password every time
you install an app but you can restrict
app purchases by setting a pin also in
Android you will see a list of
permissions that you need to grant to
the app before it will be installed this
list of permissions lets you decide
whether or not to proceed with
installation because it tells you what
parts of the device the app will have
access to Android also allows
installation of apps from third-party
sources as a security measure this is
not enabled by default but it's
available if you need it to uninstall an
app in iOS just tap and hold an app icon
on the home screen until the icons start
wiggling then tap the uninstalled badge
or you can go to Settings General usage
tap the apps name and tap the delete
button in Android 4.2 you can uninstall
apps from the app drawer itself long tap
on an app in the drawer then drag and
drop the icon to the uninstall button
you can also uninstall apps from the
apps page in the settings menu for
browsing the web Android 4.2 has Chrome
and iOS has Safari both of these
browsers provide simple controls for web
browsing both are capable of tabbed
browsing and private browsing they also
let you add bookmarks sync browser data
to are from a cloud account and more in
chrome I particularly like that it can
open unlimited tabs browse in incognito
mode or view a pages mobile view or
desktop view Safari on the other hand
can display a page in a reader friendly
way
save a page for offline reading and on
supported devices show sites in
full-screen landscape view for search
jellybean uses the google now app which
in google's own words gets you just the
right information at just the right time
it can show you info such as news
weather traffic events in appointments
bookings package deliveries and more of
course it can also search your devices
content such as apps contacts music and
bookmarks as well as search the web
using google search services the Google
now app also integrates Google Voice
search functionality which means you can
just tell the app what you're looking
for
it can even act as a voice-activated
assistant so you can instruct it to
launch apps for you compose and send
messages compose and send emails create
calendar events look for maps find
directions and more Google now is
accessible in at least three ways from
the lock screen by tapping the google
search bar on any home screen
or by swiping the home button upwards in
iOS searching is done through the search
home screen which you can swipe from the
left of the main home screen you can
also invoke the search page by tapping
the home button once on the main home
screen the app can search through your
device's contents such as your messages
emails and contacts as well as through
the web or on Wikipedia or you can
dictate your search terms to Siri the
voice-activated assistant and iOS and
Siri will do the lookup for you
Siri of course does more than just help
you with search you can also run
commands using your voice what I find
endearing about series that it interacts
is me even responds to me both iOS and
jellybean stock camera apps are simple
easy to use very fast and responsive I
rarely noticed shutter lag in either the
iOS or jellybean camera both provide all
the basic features that a casual
shutterbug like me needs including auto
focus and face detection you can use
pinching gestures on the viewfinder to
zoom in or out of your subject to both
are likewise capable of HDR mode and
panoramic shooting from the viewfinder
you can quickly view your previously
captured photos just by swiping between
the two camera apps however the
jellybean camera app brings more goodies
Android 4.2 on the Nexus 4 for example
has the photosphere feature which lets
you photograph your surrounding in 360
degrees you can choose
whitebalance modes exposure levels and
scene modes the video recorder in iOS is
also a very simple app the jelly bean
camcorder in contrast provides extra
frills such as time-lapse recording
video quality setting geo-tagging and
white balance presets despite its being
a very simple and minimalist camera I
like the iOS camera app chiefly because
of its simplicity I also like the
shutter effect when capturing photos
most of all I find it awesome that I can
use the volume buttons as shutter
buttons in iOS your pictures and images
are stored in the Photos app it's the
equivalent of the gallery app in jelly
bean captured photos and recorded videos
are stored here usually organized into
albums or folders in each album the
images are shown as thumbnails you can
also view individual images and can pan
or magnify them iOS displays album
photos as thumbnails arranged on a grid
however in jelly bean you can switch
between grid view and filmstrip view in
Phil strip view you can easily delete
photos just by flicking up or down
Android also lets you group your photos
not just according to album but also
according to locations times people and
tags
neither iOS nor jellybean lets you move
images from one album to another but iOS
lets you copy images from an album to
another jellybean won't lets you add new
empty albums either but iOS does both
platforms provide basic photo editing
functions iOS only has four image
rotation Auto enhancement red eye
removal and cropping Android lets you do
more such as apply filters and effects
use custom frames transform images and
adjust image and color values the two
operating systems are capable of running
photo slideshows but i find i OS more
flexible in this regard in jellybean you
can tweak slideshow settings but in iOS
you can for example you can choose
transition effects and play background
music for your slideshow you can even
run a slideshow on the lockscreen of iOS
tablets videos captured by the camera
app are stored in the Photos app in iOS
and in the gallery app in Android when
playing a video file you'll see scene
thumbnails on the progress bar you can
also share or delete videos from here as
you can see the interface is very simple
you can trim your personal videos to
copied or downloaded videos are stored
in the videos
in iOS Android doesn't have a separate
app for videos like iOS does instead
downloaded videos are stored in the
gallery app video playback controls in
iOS are simple but unlike its
counterpart in Android this video player
has previous and next buttons plus quick
access to the volume slider but yet
can't share videos from this app jelly
bean also has a new feature for sharing
your device's display wirelessly to
another supported display such as a
compatible HD TV it's similar in
functionality to airplay in iOS 6 though
the feature is currently available only
on the nexus for iOS stores all your
music files in the music app grouped by
playlists artists album and etc songs
purchase from iTunes are also synced in
the app you can use equalizer presets
but you'll need to go to the settings
menu to be able to pick a preset you
can't adjust equalize your levels
manually either on the iPhone 5 you can
use the shake to shuffle feature there's
also a volume level normalizer function
called sound check even when navigating
away from the music music continues to
play but you won't find playback
controls anywhere not even in a
notification center album art for the
currently playing music will be shown on
the lockscreen and the tracks title
below the time double tap the home
button to bring up the playback control
buttons the lock screen controls for the
music app in iOS 6 are tweaked a bit the
previous and next buttons are much
farther away from the play and pause
button this way you'll be ensured that
you won't accidentally press the play or
pause button when trying to select the
next or previous track the equivalent
app in jelly bean is the Play Music app
songs are also grouped according to
playlists artist album songs genres are
recently added songs bought from the
Google Play Store also synced to your
local device this bar here shows your
currently playing song you can use
equalizer presets if you want you can
even manually set your own equalizer
levels and like in iOS when navigating
away from the Play Music app screen
music continues to play in the
background and playback controls appear
on the notification shade and on the
lockscreen but perhaps the greatest
thing that I like the most about playing
music in jellybean is that I don't need
special software to copy my music files
from PC to phone or tablet I only need a
USB cable
both jellybeans and iOS of course have
security measures in place as
all mobile security and safety are
important in jellybean most of the
security features from Android 4.0 Ice
Cream Sandwich have been carried over
including different lockscreen types
device encryption displaying owner
information on lockscreen SIM card lock
on phones and preventing installing apps
not from the Google Play Store Android
4.2 adds some new features such as a
built-in air verifier that warns you if
an app contains malicious content in an
improved Android permissions list which
I find easier to understand than the
bulleted list in previous versions you
can also tap a permission like this to
expand the description meanwhile in iOS
6 you get security features such as a
four-digit or alphanumeric passcode on
the lockscreen restricted access to apps
and media contents on a device automatic
data wipe after entering wrong passcode
more than 10 times email confirmation if
an Apple account has been used on
another device remotely locating locking
and wiping data on Apple device with the
Find My iPhone app restricted
installation of apps not from the App
Store
privacy settings for showing which apps
have access to your personal data and
stronger protection against hacking and
jailbreaking
in some Android 4.2.1 jelly bean and iOS
6.1 represent the best of what the
world's latest and hottest mobile
operating systems have to offer they do
not offer uniform experiences not even
alternative experiences both platforms
differ but they serve a common goal that
of satisfying your mobile needs in iOS
you get a well defined and well guarded
environment that will have you using
your mobile device easily and seamlessly
in Android you get a feature-rich
environment that lets you enjoy the
freedom to make your device truly your
own and to make it do your bidding the
question really is not about which
operating system is the absolute and
Universal best it's about which
operating system can serve your needs
best it's all about you
so which OS has the features that fits
your needs Android 4.2 jelly bean or iOS
