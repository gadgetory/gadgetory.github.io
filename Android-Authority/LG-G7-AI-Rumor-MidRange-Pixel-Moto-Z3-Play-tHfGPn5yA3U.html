this take you know what I think I'll
just sit here and uncomfortable silence
and tell the title runs or I could wake
up your phone and say okay Google
remind me to spam Jaime Ravana every day
[Laughter]
and in the near future you may be able
to have even more fun with Google's AI
because the LG G 7 may have a dedicated
AI button
LG's upcoming smartphone probably called
the g7 will reportedly have a dedicated
AI button and a rear camera with an
f-stop of 1.5 this is according to et
news who says the device will be
unveiled in Seoul at the end of April
and will be released in Korea in mid-may
the AI button will reportedly be placed
on the side of the device this fits with
the rendering of the phone that Steve
Hema Stauffer revealed over the weekend
on Twitter that showed an extra button
underneath the volume switches the other
big reveal from et news is that the g7 s
rear camera is expected to have a 1.5
aperture this would put it in line with
the galaxy s 9 the phone that currently
has the widest aperture available having
a wide aperture allows for more light to
enter the camera and reach the sensor
what this essentially means is that the
g7 would be well equipped to take
pictures in low light
however the g7 will not feature a dual
aperture like its Samsung made
competitor but let's say you live in
India and you don't have an Android
phone to have that kind of Google
assistant fun and you're looking for a
mid-range er good news for you Indian
customers could be in for a treat this
year because Google is reportedly going
to develop a mid-range pixel according
to the economic times setting for senior
industry executives Google will launch
its home family of smart speakers the
pixel book laptop a nest smartphone home
one intriguing claim is that the tech
firm is working on a mid-range
smartphone especially for the markets
such as India the report asserts that
the mid-range pixel smartphone is set to
launch this July or August as for the
Google home family the executives tell
economic times that these smart speakers
are planned to launch at the end of the
month
Google is seemingly taking on Amazon's
echo family in the market also trying to
price match with 4499 rupees for the
mini and 9999 rupees for the standard
home but not to leave you motorola fans
out there because a recent render of the
moto xiii play paints an interesting
picture the telecom listing spotted by
trusted reviews shows a phone with a
model number XT one nine to nine as well
as variants for various parts around the
world most importantly the FCC listing
also shows some specs and it looks like
we've got a Snapdragon 636 chipset 4
gigabytes of RAM 32 and 64 gigabytes of
on-board storage a 32 gigabyte model is
set to appear in Canada and on Verizon
while everyone else gets double the
storage now the Snapdragon 636 4
gigabyte combo means we shouldn't expect
huge flagship power but it is a notable
step up from the Snapdragon 625 and 630
in fact Qualcomm claims that the cryo
260 CPU in the Snapdragon 636 packs
quote up to 40% higher performance than
the Snapdragon 630 well we'll see about
that Qualcomm once we get to our review
but you should know that most areas of
the world will also get a dual SIM
option unless you live in North America

like ultra-thin bone cases if so you
just need protection against everyday
wear and tear and our sponsor has
super-thin cases price just right for
