note device at the oneplus one as a more
comparable competitor to that device so
it's Josh of Agartha manager Authority
what's going on everybody and this is
the oneplus one versus the Samsung
Galaxy Note 3 there are two very
different design philosophies at work
here with the angular and rounded
corners of these note 3 going in
contrast to the also angular but now
sleek lines of the design of the oneplus
one the oneplus one features a
minimalistic look in a premium feel with
almost no embellishments with it
slightly raised display on the front
surrounded by chrome frame and then on
the back you have that hard plastic but
very smooth back plate but the Galaxy
Note 3 instead offers an equally nice
feel in the hand this time with a full
leather plastic back cover that was a
great addition as compared to the glossy
plastic Samsung was known for before the
front of the oneplus one is all black
with no logos or physical buttons to
draw the attention away from the display
and such you get capacitive buttons but
also an option is available to switch
over from the on-screen keys to the
capacitive buttons and back and forth if
you so desire the Galaxy Note 3 of
course comes with Samsung's or a
signature button layout on the front
with the physical home button being
flanked by two capacitive keys in this
case back-end menu in terms of
dimensions the oneplus one is almost 2
millimeters taller than the note 3 but
it's also narrower which makes it a
little bit easier to hold and the
difference in the way between the two
devices is almost negligible at only 6
grams apart handling is largely the same
between both devices though the note 3
does benefit from having very flat sides
that help with grip the one is really
nimble though due to a very even weight
distribution giving it an edge as well
and as such either device really toes
the line of discomfort both just barely
both devices feature 1080p displays with
the difference in the size 5.5 inches
for the oneplus one and 5.7 inches for
the Galaxy Note 3 resulting in a pixel
density of 401 and 386 pixels per inch
respectively and as for the technologies
underlying both screens we have a
beautiful IPS LCD display on the oneplus
one which also comes with touch on lens
tech and it is also said to be more
shatterproof than other screens due to
the Gorilla Glass 3 you also get great
viewing angles here but you also get
them as well on the galaxy note 3 which
on the other hand feature
is the super vivid super amoled display
that provides very good colors great
contrast high saturation and colors that
essentially pop out of the screen and
punch you in the face it continues the
tradition that Samsung has always had
with good display quality and in this
case we do look at these two screens as
pretty much head-to-head especially
because you have a great experience on
either one in terms of the performance
the oneplus one does have an advantage
over the note 3 thanks to an updated
Snapdragon 801 processor clocked in at
2.5 gigahertz that is backed by the
adrenal 330 and 3 gigabytes of RAM the
note 3 in contrast features the 2.3
gigahertz Snapdragon 800 processor but
also comes with 3 gigabytes of RAM so
the difference in performance should be
pretty nominal in theory the biggest
difference between the 801 and the 800
are the slightly higher speeds and in
practice however the devices still go
head-to-head and are very lightning fast
and are going to be able to handle most
tasks without a hiccup the full range of
connectivity options are available for
both of these devices as the oneplus one
can also handle 4G LTE now the note 3
does feature expanded storage which is
an option that isn't available with the
oneplus one which attempts to make up
for it by offering a version with 64
gigabytes of built-in storage and of
course the Galaxy Note 3 includes its
own trump card the S Pen for anyone that
prefers a stylus experience the S Pen is
an invaluable tool and provides even
more functionality by simply taking
advantage of its own capabilities you
can clip out various elements on the
screen right out contextual text and
enjoy precision due to the well executed
pen both phones have large batteries
with there being a 3100 milliamp power
unit and the oneplus one compared to the
3200 milliamp hour battery and the
Galaxy Note 3 allowing for more than a
full days of use with with either
smartphone and even with the promise of
better than average battery life the
note 3 gets a slight advantage by virtue
of the battery being removable giving
you the option to carry around a spare
but once again we see how one device
tries to be more or less what you see is
what you get and while it is able to
provide an incredible core experience
the oneplus ones Hardware offerings are
minimized quite frankly by the sheer
amount that the Galaxy Note 3 does
provide and it continues to do so as
Samsung always does in their ecosystem
as we move on to cameras the 13
megapixel Sony Exmor RS sensor of the
oneplus is combined with a six part lens
construction with a
2.0 aperture and dual LED flash and a
great software package provided by
CyanogenMod in this particular version
of the app does give a lot of options
for your smartphone camera experience
and on the front you get the 5 megapixel
camera with a wide lens that enables 80
degrees field of view both cameras have
2.0 aperture lenses great for low-light
photography and for obtaining that
blurred background effect that adds a
little extra bit of class to images the
note 3 definitely holds its own in this
area though despite being a little bit
older you get a 13 megapixel rear camera
and great image quality with the camera
app that is packed with a lot of
software features many of which you may
or may not use but this is the case with
every Samsung flagship release anyway
we've always had a good time with the
note 3 camera and in the future we may
be doing a camera shootout to see which
one of these 2 is better in the larger
phone device Department and finally in
software we find that the oneplus one
runs CyanogenMod 11 s a special release
built specially for the one to take
advantage of all of its hardware and
features and is based on Android 4.4
KitKat you get a clean minimalistic
stock like experience with various
customization options available useful
software features such as the voice
command allow you to wake the device but
you can always launch your favorite apps
by drawing preset gestures on a sleeping
screen and as mentioned before you can
also choose between on-screen and
capacitive navigation buttons to suit
your preferences so really cater the
stock Android like experience of signage
and mod to your liking with a Galaxy
Note 3 on the other hand you get the
all-too-familiar bright and colorful
TouchWiz UI which is as always packed
with tons of software features and also
includes very useful apps that work
really well with the s-pen now
multitasking has always been a Forte of
the Samsung ecosystem and you get the
ability to do so in various ways like
with the multi window or through the pen
window application provided by the s-pen
multitasking is a little more
conventional in CyanogenMod of the
oneplus one relying on recent app
screens now more tools are available in
the galaxy note 3 but many of them were
already introduced in previous Galaxy
devices like every gesture you may or
may not use ultimately when it comes to
software you get another simplistic
elegant look when it comes to the
oneplus ones in nerds with CyanogenMod
11 s and what TouchWiz we get the same
somewhat oversaturated list of features
and tools that you may or may not take
advantage of in the end now the Galaxy
Note 3 has been out for a little
while now but its price is still very
high especially when compared to the
great price of the 1+1 which comes in at
299 dollars now that makes the oneplus
one an absolute steal and it might be
its biggest trump card when compared to
all of these flagship devices so in the
future we are going to be doing the full
review of the oneplus one and pitting it
against these flagships once again for a
real comparison but until then I hope
you enjoyed this quick look at the
samsung galaxy note 3 and the oneplus
one stay tuned to android authority for
our future reviews and coverage of the
oneplus one because we are your source
