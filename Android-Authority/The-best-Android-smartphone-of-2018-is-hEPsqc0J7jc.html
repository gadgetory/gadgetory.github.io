Authority and this is the best of
Android 2018 now over the last couple of
months all of our writers and testers
have been working around the clock to
find out what phone is really the best
out of every single category you could
possibly imagine so we've got new
testing facilities in the US and the UK
we've doubled the amount of testing that
we're doing on these phones because we
really want to make sure that you have
the best option available while over
testing is finally done and we have
narrowed down the nine best phones on
the market today we believe that every
phone has something different to offer
it so if you're wondering what phone has
the best screen what phone has the best
camera
what phone has the best battery life
then you really have to look no further
than this video and all of our articles
that explain the stuff in detail
so without further ado let's dive into
the best of Android 2018 first we've got
the best of value phone and this one was
kind of hard to decide on so we actually
ended up choosing two winners here we've
got the oneplus 60 and the xiaomi poco
phone f1 because both deliver a ton of
performance for the money it's just an
insane amount of value in both of these
devices next for Best Performance we've
got the huawei mate 20 pro with its
kuren 987 nanometer processor which just
drives this phone like crazy if you're
Lee for the best screen we actually gave
two different phones the best screen
award this year if you want the
technically best screen then you're
gonna have to go for the Samsung Galaxy
Note 9 but if you want something that's
just a little past the normal boundaries
that we awarded it to the razor phone 2
for its 120 Hertz screen which you can
only really get on the razor phone one
otherwise
if you're looking for the best battery
life on any phone right now you're gonna
have to go with the Huawei P 20 Pro
though we didn't forget about the May 20
Pro that phone actually won fastest it's
a charge with its 40 watt charger if
you're looking for the best camera which
a lot of people do we actually awarded
two phones for this category as well if
you want the most technically accurate
camera then that is gonna have to go to
the samsung galaxy note 9 but the way we
use our cameras are changing in a lot of
ways and if you're looking for the best
AI camera that you're gonna have to pick
up the Google pixel 3 or Google pixel 3
XL you want the best audio and any
smartphone right now it's pretty much
hands-down the LG v 40 you can plug in a
pair of headphones and even ones that
require a lot more power and that quad
DAC in that phone is gonna drive those
til tomorrow you're just gonna enjoy
your music non-stop and finally we've
got the best gaming phone which is kind
of a new category I guess you could say
it started in 2017 but that award is
going to go to the asus rog phone for
its overclocked snapdragon 845 and has
got a ton of accessories that just make
the gaming experience a lot better but
the best phone of 2018 which pretty much
stayed near the top of every single one
of these categories is the samsung
galaxy note 9 so if you just want a
phone that's pretty much over all the
best on the market you're not gonna go
wrong with the samsung galaxy note 9
congratulations to samsung for clinching
the top spot of the best of android 2018
so that's been it for the different
categories are in the best overall phone
but we'd still do have the Readers
Choice Awards that's coming out on the
27th of this month and there were over
500,000 votes cast for this thing so you
guys were obviously very passionate
about what phone you think deserves the
top spot this year so make sure you stay
tuned to Android Ithorian comm to see
that and ever
coming this month it's near the end of
November it's almost the holidays and
we're pretty much done with the year so
I'm gonna see you guys in the next video
but until then have a great 2018
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
