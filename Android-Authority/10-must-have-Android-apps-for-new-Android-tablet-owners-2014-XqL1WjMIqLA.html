hindi the android authority app guy did
you just get a brand new tablet and you
don't know where to start with the
applications if that's the case you're
in the right place the first up is the
Amazon Kindle app one of the main
reasons people buy tablets is so they
can read books on it and Amazon Kindle
is about as good as it gets when it
comes to literary selection pricing and
maintaining a solid experience books do
cost money obviously but you can get
some free open domain books so you can
test out the platform first the app
itself is free people will always at
least think about putting some device
left protection on their phones but
barely on their tablets don't be like
those people Android device manager is a
light anti-theft app developed and
maintained by Google you can ring your
device find it lock it and wipe it if
need be just because your tablet is big
doesn't mean it can't get lost or stolen
if you have this installed that won't be
such a huge problem the tablet is a
great place to keep your notes on and
there are a few better apps to do it
than Evernote it's great for homework
and school use and has a rich set of
features that are available on multiple
platforms like PC Mac Linux and iOS the
free version is very good but if you
spring for the premium version there are
a bunch of extra features that you may
like as well the Google Play Music is a
great application for tablets it can
play music that's on your device or you
can upload up to 20 thousand of your own
songs to the cloud and stream it to your
tablet which is handy because tablets
are notorious for not having enough
internal storage if you spring for the
all-access pass you can listen to pretty
much any song on google play music and
have access to a number of curated
playlists it's definitely worth checking
out
google hangouts is Google's
all-encompassing messaging platform and
it's great for tablet owners you can
message call and video chat with other
hangouts users free of charge and it
remains one of the precious few ways to
make a call on a tablet since you
already have a Google account because
it's required to use the Google Play
Store that means you already have a
hangouts account so all you have to do
is sign in and go HD widgets is one of
the most popular clock and weather
widgets of all time it's been around
since the good old days and continues to
be relevant and enjoyable even today
they have a range of widgets and toggles
that help fill out those large home
screens that you have on your new tablet
you can also pick up color form and Kiro
theme packs to give your widgets more
theme options they look nice and they
work really well my script calculator
lets you draw out your problem on the
screen using your finger or a stylus
and then solves the problem for you it
can do basic stuff like arithmetic and
some more complex stuff like
trigonometry functions and logarithms it
should do for most students although
more advanced students may need
something a little bit more complex it's
also totally free one of the best uses
for a tablet is watching videos on the
go and one of the best ways to do that
is with Netflix it's a cheap service
that costs less than $10 per month and
has a seemingly insurmountable amount of
content for you to enjoy you can get
multiple profiles so multiple people in
your household can use it and maintain
their own settings Plus house of cards
and orange is the new black are both
really awesome SwiftKey keyboard is one
of the premier third-party keyboards on
Android it comes with some themes and
you can buy more if you want and the
predictive text and auto correction are
far above average however the big winner
here is that it comes with not one but
two keyboard layouts specifically for
tablet owners it's free to use so it
won't cost you anything to try it out
edge is one of the most popular
wallpaper and ringtone applications
available on Android with it you can get
ringtones notification tones alarm tones
live wallpapers and of course regular
wallpapers there are a lot of options
including seasonal offerings for those
of you who like to decorate for the
holidays it's free with advertising and
truly a must-have application on any
Android device once again I'm Joe Hindy
