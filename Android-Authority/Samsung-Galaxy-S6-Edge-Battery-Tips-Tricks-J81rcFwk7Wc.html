Android Authority and one of the biggest
problems with the Galaxy s6 edge is that
it comes with the non removable battery
as the first Samsung flagship that you
can't date the battery out of you
limited to the 2600 milliamp hour
battery that comes in the hands in
itself and in this video I'm going to
show you some of the tips I've picked up
on how to get the most out the battery
right so my first tip is about display
brightness and trust me how bright your
display is makes a huge difference to
your battery life by reducing from full
brightness to around 50% or less I found
they can add actually a whole hour on to
your screen on time I personally keep my
hands on auto brightness but the slider
set to around 50% or less and this means
I'm often able to get four to six hours
screen on time from a full charge it's
not perfect but a 50% auto brightness I
found the screen is actually bright
enough for most scenarios from display
brightness to a problem that's
definitely of Samsung's own making smart
networks rich smart networks which
basically means the handset will
constantly scan your mobile networks and
your Wi-Fi networks and whenever you're
accessing data it uses whichever it
thinks is the strongest network the
problem with this boy it does definitely
very drain your battery so let's take a
quick look at how to turn this off
turning this off is as simple as going
into Wi-Fi networks and deselecting the
box at the top and by switching this off
you'll find it can add around 15 to 20
percent to your battery life in the
context of ours this works out between
an hour an hour and a half extra battery
life which can be the difference between
your handset dying on the way home from
work and actually lasts until you can
get to a charger at home right from a
Samsung problem to an Android problem
and one that affects just about any
Android phone Android can do a lot but
the one thing it doesn't do is manage
your location well enough so it doesn't
drain your battery
there's loads of options so let's take a
look at the best ways to preserve your
battery life location is traditionally a
big drain a battery but with the galaxy
s6 edge it can actually be a massive
problem if you're someone who relies on
location-based widgets and apps you'll
often find that Google Play services is
listed as one of the biggest drains
your battery the other thing about
location is Google's own method or
periodically scanning for Wi-Fi networks
even when you switch and Wi-Fi off when
you first attempt to use a Google
service
it actually prompts you to allow it to
constantly scan for your location and
that includes using Wi-Fi when it's
switched off but this can cause massive
battery drain
I personally don't allow Google to do
this as I prefer the battery savings
that disabling the feature offers if
you're on the fence about this head over
to the location menu which can be
accessed by pressing and holding the
location button and then change the
locating method to GPS only using GPS
only will prevent your friend from
scanning for your location using mobile
and Wi-Fi networks and should help your
battery massively from an android
problem to a google problem an issue
with sync settings now one of the great
things about Android is that you can
simply add your Google Account and then
it just sinks every service whatsoever
that means you've got your Gmail you've
got your updater you've got your
calendar you got your contacts you've
got your Play Store you've got your Play
Movies and so on the problem with this
when you like me and you've got several
Google accounts on my galaxy s6 edge
I've got seven installed and to be fair
I don't need all of those services
syncing full of those accounts I mean I
used one Google account for all services
and the rest are just for email so me
and just about anyone who uses multiple
Google accounts certainly doesn't need
all seven account syncing every service
if you never used playbooks before you
don't need to sync it and trust me
Google Play newsstand I don't think on
any device I see absolutely no need for
it what I'm going to do now is show you
how to preserve your battery life just
my 15 or few options on your phone head
over to your accounts menu and select
your Google account then look through
each of the services and tap to disable
any that you don't use now if you're
like me and you use them all but you
have multiple Google accounts installed
make sure you disable them on all but
the main account you use for each
service so I use the same Google account
for all my services and as such all the
others I've disabled Play Movies
newsstand Google Play Books just to
prevent it from sinking in the
background
and to my fifth tip which is actually
quite interesting for the Galaxy s6 edge
because it's easily the least bloated
Samsung smartphone ever made alongside
the build camera and everything else
we've covered in the full review which
you'll find a link to in the description
below
Samsung have finally decided that less
is actually more this means the hands
icons are just a handful of preloaded
apps and TouchWiz actually lets you
disable all of them anyway
in this fifth tip I'm going to show you
how to disable the preloaded apps that
you don't use just to prevent them from
running in the background and draining
your battery now I personally don't use
onedrive s health or s voice so I
disable ease and especially in the case
of s voice it improved battery life it
wasn't by much but it was enough to be
noticeable so there you have it five
simple tips to getting the most out your
Galaxy s6 edge battery and to be honest
most of these can actually apply to just
about any Android smartphone having come
from the note 4 which has a removable
battery adjusting to this galaxy s6
edges certainly been a child if I'm
completely honest actually fine I'll
stop reaching for the charger offer
around 14 to 18 hours as I covered in
our galaxy s6 edge battery overview this
isn't a problem for me personally and
for most consumers this should mean an
average full day's usage now if you're
someone who uses your phone a lot and
we're talking around 5 to 6 hours screen
on time you are probably going to end up
charging your phone more than once a day
however with quick charging built into
the handset this is less of an actual
problem for me personally the trade-off
between all the features the Galaxy s6
edge has to offer and the battery life
is not so much of an issue and
especially with quick charging can add
around 50 percent to my battery for 30
minutes or so I'm more than happy to
charge it twice a day
I'm never than this has been my quick
tip video on getting the most out your
Galaxy s6 edge battery and you got a tip
that you think I'm left out let me know
