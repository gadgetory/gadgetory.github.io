to you by Norton security so if Santa's
not bringing you your favorite Android
phone this year it's ok because you
don't have to keep up with the
kardashians of tech no you just need a
phone that works and works well that's
why today is all about the Android
phones that are the best bang for your
buck so you can keep more bucks in your
pocket so to start us off is the Moto G
second generation and I feel like I
talked about this phone all the time
because I do the follow-up to the
original moto G holds a lot in common
with its predecessor including the 1.2
gigahertz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon
400 CPU and the one gigabyte of RAM this
time around however the display size has
jumped up to 5 inches and the camera
package is also improved the Moto G runs
a near stock Android 4.4 it but should
be getting 5.0 lollipop sometime before
the end of the year Motorola's Moto G
series proves that low price doesn't
have to mean low quality and something
we're also seeing a lot of with the even
cheaper Moto e now I feel like a broken
record on this but it has to be said we
have both the Nexus 5 and the Moto G
here in our own home and we have the
Moto G first edition and I can tell you
that other than the thicker profile and
the fact that it's a little bit smaller
the day to day user experience between
the two is roughly the same and the Moto
G is significantly cheaper than the
already cheap Nexus 5 this is why the
Moto G is right at the top of the best
bang for your buck Android phones we
have it we've never been disappointed
with it now if you're on a really tight
budget you really want to consider the
Moto e yet another phone for Motorola
proves that you don't need to pay top
dollar to get a solid Android experience
the Moto e is far from a powerhouse
however and you should realize that it
has a dual-core Snapdragon 200 CPU and a
smaller 4.3 inch display but the phone
performs rather well in large part due
to its clean stock like Android
installation the Moto e actually had a
few small advantages over the first
generation Moto G such as the microSD
expansion slot and the inclusion of
front-facing speakers but the second
generation Moto G takes those advantages
away without a front facing camera and
slightly weaker speakers the more
second generation is the better deal of
the two if you are absolutely looking
for the cheapest phone around then of
course you want to consider the Moto e
now we have to point out the obvious
here to remind you that the Moto e is
pretty underpowered compared to a lot of
other phones it is primarily a browsing
texting phone phone it is not something
that you can play in all the games with
or utilize apps that are CPU intensive
keep in mind if you can spend 50 bucks
more or 75 books more you're likely to
get your hands on the Moto G and you'll
be in much better shape now last off is
a phone that some of you may not know
that much about and it's called the
sharp aquos crystal while we typically
focus on unlocked phones here every once
in a while we find a prepaid no-contract
device that will stick out enough that
we feel compelled to mention it in our
best cheap phone list the sharp aquos
crystal is such a device while it's
locked down to just sprint and Boost
Mobile
the price is exceptional and with the
ultra thin bezels it really does stand
out from the crowd
beyond the stunning bezels you get a 1.2
gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon 400 CPU
with 1.5 gigabytes of RAM 8 gigabytes of
internal storage a 5 inch 720p display a
2040 milliamp hour battery an 8
megapixel rear facing camera and a 1.2
megapixel front-facing camera it also
comes running Android 4.4 to KitKat

already offered and you can have a
discussion about it you don't want to
