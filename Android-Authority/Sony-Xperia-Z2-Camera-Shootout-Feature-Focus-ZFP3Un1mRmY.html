what's going on if your buddy and every
photo and video that you're seeing in
this camera future focus was taken on
the cameras of the Sony Xperia z2 and so
here we are taking a look at the cameras
of the Sony Xperia z2
now it does do 20.7 megapixels after all
that is the G lens by Sony that we're
working with but aside from some of the
samples at the end that are taken at
that full resolution you're looking at 8
megapixel samples here because I took a
lot of these photos the majority of them
in full auto you will also be seeing a
lot of 100 crops like from this
particular picture right here as you can
see the detail is actually really great
in these broad daylight shots and at the
8 megapixel count you will be able to
get some spectacular shots from here
pretty consistently because the sampling
is just really great you have a lot of
detail and sharpness in these photos at
20.7 megapixels as I said in my review
you do get a little bit less detail but
at that huge size you are also unable to
use a lot of the features that the
camera app affords you so in this case
we're using full auto to show you what
the 8 megapixels are all about the other
thing I should say is that every video
in this camera shootout taken with the
rear-facing camera save for the intro at
the beginning all of those videos were
taken using the 4k video feature so
those are all 4k videos that were
obviously downsampled to 1080p for this
particular purpose but you will be able
to see the three different clips that I
have here at 4k in a sample that I'll
have linked at the end of the video and
in the description below so we're taking
a look at more 8 megapixel shots here
the full-auto the superior auto rather
inside of the camera app does a pretty
good job of finding exactly what a
setting would be best for the photo and
you can see in some of the macro shots
that I have in here really getting
close-up on the flowers that the detail
is there as well I'm really am impressed
by the Sony Xperia z2 s camera primarily
because it does good color rendering but
that detail is really great you just
have to keep it at the 8 megapixel
counts in full auto in order to make
sure that everything
is set up the way it should be so coming
up right next is another video clip for
you to take a look at
now of course there are some extra
features inside of the camera and those
range from very useful to just kind of
trying to add some style or fun to your
smartphone photography in the Xperia z2
app you have things like AR effect which
I used in the full review to show you
those dinosaurs walking around on my
table or even like the leprechauns or
whatever you want to call them and after
that you also have things like time
shift video which I also used in my
review to show the slow motion water
falling onto the phone and then of
course timeshift burst in which you will
be able to take a bunch of photos at
once in order to pick from them the best
one and then of course you have things
like sweeping panorama but those are
pretty standard but the one that you
probably want to know a little bit more
about because every camera is doing it
is selective focus as you can see here
now it has the same issue as you can
already tell that a lot of the other
cameras already have its that it can't
really draw the line between your
subjects very easily you can see on the
left there that there is some blur on
the actual bench but nonetheless you can
select the different kinds of focus that
you can have here that range from just
the regular Bocage shot the blurriness
or you can actually have a little bit of
a stylized effect where it looks like
it's a motion blur going up and down and
then on the third effect that I've shown
this particular one it's from the
side-to-side but nonetheless you do have
quite a bit of freedom there to actually
show the level of blurriness that you
want and it usually does end up being a
pretty decent shot here is one where the
subject was a little bit more defined so
it wasn't hard for it to create the
effect and as promised here are your 20
0.7 megapixel samples now as you will be
able to see in the 100 crops the level
of detail in these pictures is not quite
as high as a level of detail found in
the 8 megapixel shots but as you can see
here these twenty 0.7 megapixel shots in
broad daylight do bring a lot of good
color still and as long as you're not
really trying to zoom in too much you
will be able to find a very nice photo
most of the time I am pretty pleased
with the camera on the Xperia z2 as I
said before it is pretty much one of the
top cameras available now rivaled only
by the likes of the Samsung Galaxy s5
with its 16 megapixel ISO cell camera
but nonetheless one thing I will say is
that the Xperia z2 is really fun to
shoot with especially with its dedicated
camera button in which I could always
have the camera in a particular position
in my hand
down the camera button when I saw a shot
I wanted and be able to snap away
it is probably out of the three flagship
phones out right now the one that I had
the most fun using in terms of the
camera shootout that being said the
Xperia z2 sits among the best in the
camera optics game and if you use that
full auto the superior auto you will be
getting a lot of consistently great
photos and so there you have it for this
camera shootout as I said already there
is a 4k video sample that you can watch
on YouTube and all of its 4k glory by
clicking this particular video right
here you will be able to go straight to
that video experience u2 is a great
camera to use and is one of the best
ones that I've used in these camera
shoot outs I will say but it does
require you in a way to use the superior
auto at 8 megapixels to really get the
best that you can possibly get from
these photos nonetheless stay tuned for
all of the best coverage from the Xperia
z2 and the other flagships in the game
