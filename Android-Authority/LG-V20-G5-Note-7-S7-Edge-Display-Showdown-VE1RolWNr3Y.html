authorities so everyone knows about the
LGB 20 by now so now it's very recently
a couple days ago and it's a big
multimedia powerhouse and it seems to be
really great when it comes to audio and
even video recording but besides that
it's still a high end high spec
smartphone so I got the chance check it
out recently I did the hands on some of
the guys checked it out on the site as
well and if you didn't watch our video
of the drop test for the display
definitely recommend so you can see the
type of durability it has but in this
video I'm actually going to talk more
about the display I just got a unit in
ran some benchmark tests on it and
whenever I do a review I like to look at
the display and run those tests because
it's one thing to look at a screen and
say it looks really nice because it's
bright nice vivid colors but it's mostly
subjective but it's totally another when
I run these benchmark tests and they
deliver these results that tell me
whether or not a panel is you know color
accurate what kind of color temperature
or whether or not it's bright or too dim
and all that really helps to tell me
exactly what is a superior display so
I'm going to dive in and talk more about
the V 20s display I'm going to even
compare it against some other handsets
out there like the galaxy s7 and the s7
edge the note 7 and even the LG g5 so
let's just jump right in and talk about
the panel
first thing I'm going to talk about here
is the specs for the display now the b20
actually has the same specs as the v10
so that's a 5.7 inch quad HD IPS LCD
screen also with Gorilla Glass 4 so
between 2 no difference no change but
then again that's not a bad thing either
because at five point seven inches quad
HD it's still more than detailed enough
especially when you're looking for
normal distance they didn't really need
to go in and well beyond that
so it's perfect just the way it is there
so next up we'll talk about the
brightness output now when I tested out
the V 20 it actually reached an
impressive mark of 714 nits and you know
in my testing the past other phones
anything more than 500 nits was pretty
much visible outdoors when the Sun is
out so at 714 it's you take it outside
you look at it more than visible you're
not going to have any issues and just as
a comparison here it actually is better
than most of the galaxy s devices the
galaxy note 7 the s7 edge the galaxy s7
they generally reach a little bit over
500 nits but nothing close to the 700
nits mark that this phone achieves and
when I compare the b20 to the g5 the g5
is actually a smidgen brighter just a
little bit it tops out at 755 nits so it
looks like the IPS LCD screens are able
to achieve a strong illuminance so in
terms of visibility especially in
brights on bright sunny days the Jeep v
and also the b20 are pretty much solid
with that next area I'm going to talk
about its color temperature and before I
even ran the test for the V 20 I could
tell right away that it is a colder
display because when I look at the color
white on the screen it has a
distinguishable bluish tinge to it now
for the V 20 it has a very cold color
temperature of 91 hundred Kelvin that's
really on one side of the spectrum now
the ideal color temperature for a
smartphone display is 6500 Kelvin
indicating that it's neither too warm or
too cold so if you're under 6500 Kelvin
to have a yellowish tone with the color
white and then think above that 6500
Kelvin tends to be bluish in tone so v20
90 100 Kelvin very cold same thing with
the g5 it's around that nine thousand
Kelvin range so it's far from the ideal
reference value on a flipside when you
look at this Super AMOLED displays from
Samsung's camp they are significantly
better very close to that 6500 Kelvin
mark the Galaxy s7 s7 edge and even the
note 7 all seem to be under 7000 Kelvin
next up I'm going to talk about its
color accuracy in the srgb gama spectrum
now when i run this test it measures all
the colors red green blue cyan magenta
yellow and produces this chart and a
chart shows us exactly how well a
display is able to reproduce colors
accurately so in the case of the v20
it's pretty bad
just like the color temperature so if
you look at the chart you could see
exactly how it you totally misses all
the reference targets which are the
squares when it reads each color the
dots are the actual values and it's
nowhere close to being color accurate
for example you look at the color yellow
yellow is tend to be influenced by
grains you look at magenta there's a
noticeable bluish tone to them and in my
experience of testing displays out for
the last couple of years the easiest
color to reproduce is teal and in the
case of the b20 it also fails in doing
that now there are phones that that
don't accurately produce tail but the
majority of phones I'd say 90% phones
managed to do teal pretty well but you
can see here the b20 nowhere close so
overall when it comes to color accuracy
it's far from it ok so after looking at
the V twenties display and running all
the tests to me it's an OK to display
you know the specs are nice great and
output with its brightness but call it
temperature called accuracy viewing
angles they are subpar in those three
areas so to me it doesn't really the
display doesn't really draw me in from
first luck and that's important because
you know when you look at their phone
for a very first time the first thing
that you're probably going to see is
they screen the display and it failed to
really draw me in it didn't really look
as though it was vibrant or iridescent
it just lacked something about it just
was lacking and it didn't really draw me
in like the Super AMOLED displays and
Samsung's phones so to that regard you
know it's not the best screen out there
or is nor does it really have the best
qualities I'll get the job done you know
when it comes to visibility and also you
know detail but for everything else you
know it's just me it's okay so if you
guys wanna learn more about the V 20s
display the benchmark test I ran all the
charts and stuff you could check them
out on our website and rathore EECOM
