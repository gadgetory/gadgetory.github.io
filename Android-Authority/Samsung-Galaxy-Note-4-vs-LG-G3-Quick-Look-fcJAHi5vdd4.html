as we take a look at the Samsung Galaxy
Note 4 and the LG g3 in terms of design
both LG and Samsung have been attempting
to leave behind their older design
aesthetics in favor of more premium
looking designs in terms of LG they have
been making a new sleeker look when it
comes to especially the g3 that now
comes with the 5.5 inch screen but the
Galaxy Note 4 despite having still its
5.7 inch screen now has a metal frame
all around that really gives it an even
better look and feel from before the
note 4's bezels aren't exactly massive
and the LG g3 has some of the thinnest
bezels around accomplished by moving its
power and volume buttons back to the
back of the phone the front of the LG g3
is also without any physical buttons
while the note 4 has its same button
layout with the tactile home button
flanked by back in recent apps now while
both handsets offer large displays the
note 4 is still noticeably bigger and
makes it a little bit harder to handle
comparatively the battle in the displays
is going to be an interesting one
because now we have 2 quad HD displays
now while one is a little bit bigger it
also sports the Super AMOLED compared to
the LG g3 which has the IPS plus LCD
display now both of these there's no
denying that they're both quite great
and some people do prefer the Super
AMOLED vividness over the LCD of the LG
g3 but it is certainly no slouch on its
own as far as the pixel density goes we
do still get over 500 pixels per inch on
either of these displays and it should
make for a very sharp experience whether
you're looking at media or text we will
be looking a little bit closer at these
when we get our review units but as of
right now we can say that as you don't
really have a preference between Super
AMOLED and LCD you're getting a great
experience either way with either of
these devices so you really only have to
take a look at the size in your
comparison obviously the note for being
the newer device will be getting a
little bit of a boost when it comes to
is performance primarily because it will
have the quad-core Snapdragon 805
processor which is the newest one in the
bunch that does trump the 801 from the
LG g3 but we do have to say that the LG
g3 processing package even though it
might be a little bit lower than that of
the note 4 is still no slouch at all you
will be seeing a lot of great
performance on either of these devices
that we will say that the note 4 given
that it is making a focus on
multitasking in this
version of the note will be sporting
four gigabytes of RAM over the two or
three that you can get with the LG g3 so
that is a bit of a feather in the note
force cap but with both of these devices
you'll really see how top-heavy the
actual UI is and with the processing
packages that you do get you'll also see
that it's still able to go through all
of its elements pretty well as well in
that case then performance really does
seem a little bit neck-and-neck here
unless you really want to be on the
bleeding edge in which case you would
probably go for the galaxy note 4 when
it comes to the hardware you will be
getting expandable storage in either of
these devices so storage shouldn't
really be too much of a problem and
everything that you would expect from LG
and Samsung flagship smake the cut when
it comes to the connectivity but of
course the note 4 has the added benefit
of its stylus the patented s-pen which
really adds to the experience especially
for those professionals out there who
really want to be able to jot down notes
on the fly at any time which we'll get
into in a little bit but when it comes
to the cameras we do have to say that LG
is one of the pioneers when it came to
optical image stabilization on their
phones but Samsung has finally adopted
it with the note 4 which means you'll
get smoother video clearer pictures and
especially better low-light performance
with its bumped up 16 megapixel
rear-facing camera on the LG g3 you also
get oh is plus which is a software
enhanced version of OIS that is at 13
megapixels but also comes with a great
laser focusing system that we did fine
did a great job with quickly finding the
subjects in order to really get you to
capture your images fast now the note 4
does take the lead with its front facing
camera because it is a three point seven
megapixel front facing units that
features a 90 degree viewing angle that
can be further enhanced with a wide
viewing angle that you can use a
panoramic mode to be able to get group
selfies very easily and finally in
software we take a look at the feature
rich package of the Samsung Galaxy Note
4 which adds enhancements on two
previous packages including in the S Pen
and in multitasking in multitasking you
now get the ability to trigger the multi
window straight from the recent apps
screen and be able to seamlessly move
from it and the floating app apparatus
very easily
when it comes to the S Pen you also get
some new modes like the smart select
which will make doing research a lot
simpler on the phone and the snap mode
which digitizes handwritten info with
any pictures that you take using the
mode and it will
detect the writing and the images I can
be used inside of an S note note now the
LG g3 features some big changes on its
own and mostly comes with the new
flattens and streamlined UI and the GUI
but it also comes with the smart
software suite which will help you
maintain some parts of your phone and
also customize things like the keyboard
but from there you also get the qslide
apps and the ability to use a dual
window on here which is great because of
the larger screen that it has from the
original g2 ultimately you do get a very
good rich software package and either of
these but the note 4 does have the
stylus that adds some more functionality
to it so if you really do need those
features then the Galaxy Note 4 is
probably the one for you these two
Korean manufacturers have really been
going neck-and-neck when it comes to
their flagship devices not only do we
have better designs and both of them now
we also have quad HD displays underneath
the surface we have great performance
and then from there we have a camera
experience on the LG g3 that was already
great with the laser guided autofocus
but then the note 4 is catching up with
its own version of optical image
stabilization it really comes down to
the usage that you need out of it and if
the S Pen is better suited for you then
that would really make the note 4 over
the top for everyone else so the LG g3
still performs very well and provides a
lot of useful features for anybody out
there that wants to get a lot done so
keep it tuned to Android Authority for
all of the best coverage of the Galaxy
Note 4 here are the unpacked live event
