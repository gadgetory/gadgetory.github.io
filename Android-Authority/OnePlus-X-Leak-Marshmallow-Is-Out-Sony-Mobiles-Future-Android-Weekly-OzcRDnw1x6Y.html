brought to you by domain.com marshmallow
is here and we can show you how to get
it right now if you happen to own a
Nexus device and you've been waiting to
get your hands on the most recent
version of Android your wait is finally
over google has just posted Android 6pm
our shmellow factory images for all
current Nexus devices owners of the
Nexus 5 Nexus 6 nexus 7 2013 edition the
Nexus 9 and Nexus player can now
download and install android 6.0 on
their devices however installing these
updates directly from the google
developer website does require a bit and
know-how but my brother joe hindy has
put together a great walk through that
should be able to help you if you're new
to the manual installation method if you
weren't keen on updating manually google
should be rolling out android 6.0 ta to
these Nexus devices very soon could one
plus be delivering a mini sort of looks
that way while some of the juicier
details were made confidential in the
filing a photo in the FCC filing does
reveal a device that looks smaller but
similar to the one plus two complete
with a USB type-c port and dual speakers
on the bottom beyond that the only other
thing you can see in the image is a rear
facing camera unfortunately that's all
we've learned from the filing but
thankfully the rumor mill can help us
fill in the gaps the next one plus
handset is rumored to offer a 5-inch
display with a MediaTek Helio x10
processor with 2 gigabytes of RAM other
specs include 13-megapixel rear-facing
camera and a 5-megapixel front-facing
camera from sony and it also includes a
3000 milliamp hour battery and perhaps
even NFC technology baked in this time
round one remaining mystery is the
phone's name though a Weibo post from
the CEO Pete Lau might give us an answer
to that as well last week Pete Lau
posted an image of what appears to be a
running route around his city but it
happens to make the shape of a nearly
perfect x while some might think this
has no significance at all some believe
it is a hype generating tease that could
be pointing to the name 1 plus X for the
company's next device given how 1 plus
likes to use social media to generate
attention
we're certain it means something even if
it isn't the name of their next phone
and it turns out that sony has given
itself an ultimatum they have got to
start making money the company has given
itself an ultimatum to try and return
its mobile business to break even
following 2016 before considering the
fate of its Xperia brand we don't know
exactly what the alternative option
could be but exiting the smartphone
market altogether hasn't been ruled out
CEO hirai has already presided over a
number of important cost-cutting
measures including the decision to axe
the struggling PC business at Sony we
will continue with the business as long
as we are on track with the scenario of
breaking even next year onwards
otherwise we haven't eliminated the
consideration of alternative options but
it hasn't all been bad news for Sony
their smartphone cameras are someone
like hotcakes Sony's RS image sensors
have proven wildly popular in the
smartphone market but some of the
company's other divisions I'm looking at
you mobile have not proven to be so
successful over the past couple years in
order to promote continued growth in its
semiconductor business sony has publicly
stated that it will split the division
off into a separate entity while still
retaining full ownership Sony's RS based
cameras have been featured in a number
of high-end smartphones this past year
including the s6 series the LG g4 and
sony's latest benchmark topping
experience at five sony sensors are also
proving popular in the mid to your
market as companies push towards better
camera tech in order to help
differentiate themselves from the
competition so as you can see it was
kind of a slow news week but they didn't
stop me from having fun with some of you
this weekend i caught a serious brown
trout monster fish tasted great and i
celebrated by posting it on twitter
within minutes after that one of you had
sent back an edited version of that
photo saying seriously bro and at the
bottom with a disapproving stare so in
response to that I'm seriously
considering buying seriously bro calm
