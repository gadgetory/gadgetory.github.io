tablet lines Samsung was making one
thing clear they're not messing around
all of the pro line of tablets come with
great power and uncompromising
performance and the smallest of the
bunch just might be the best mid side
tablet around hey it's Josh regard from
Android Tony what's going on everybody
and this is the Samsung Galaxy Tab pro
8.4 when it comes to the design there is
really one good way of describing the
Tab pro 8.4 it's like a blown-up Galaxy
Note 3 with a pretty flat profile all
around and only slightly rounded corners
it's a pretty unassuming design all
around until you get to the back which
takes on the faux leather textured
plastic originally introduced in the
note 3 the button layout is pretty
classic Samsung but this was the first
line of devices to do away with the
signature setup up front instead of a
menu button with the tactile home button
there is a recent apps button to add to
the simple multitasking power button and
volume rockers are on the right side
when looking in portrait and on the
opposite side you can find the micro SD
card slot as far as the handling goes
this is really one nice and nimble
device coming in at 331 grams it's
really light and the thickness is only
7.2 inches right here and also as you
can see in my hand right now the flat
sides and the rather thin profile the
more narrow and slender profile allow it
to be easily gripa belen one hand
primarily at the top and bottom of the
screen are nicely sized bezels that do
help with landscape handling but with
the capacitive keys so close to the edge
of the bottom of the device you might
accidentally trigger those buttons but
overall we're looking at a device that
isn't that all flashy and design is very
Samsung in its look but when you get
underneath the surface you find that it
holds a lot of power the 8.4 inch Super
Clear LCD is the smallest of the proline
but comes with the same amount of power
the super-high 2560 by 1600 resolution
that makes for one of the highest
resolution to size ratios on any tablet
with a pixel density of 359 PPI and also
considering the distance away this
tablet might stay from your face this is
indeed a very sharp display and provides
a great experience
Samsung proves its prowess once again
with the screen that really exudes its
colors well and provide
wonderful viewing angles on top now you
might argue that a lot of content isn't
necessarily made for such a high
resolution but that's still not going to
stop you from enjoying all of the media
you might throw at it
everything from YouTube videos to
Netflix to even games like my current
obsession Riptide gp2 which looks great
and performs wonderfully without any
issues and the lack of hiccups even
during heavy gaming is due to the
uncompromising power package inside the
Snapdragon 800 clocked in at 2.3
gigahertz and the adrenal 330 provide a
snappy experience all around it can be
argued that TouchWiz even this slightly
updated version of it still has its
issues with speed and sometimes the
stutters but I will say that it is a
little bit more noticeable here than on
other devices at least to me but I
believe it's because of the super-high
resolution that this tablet has to
consistently pump out even then however
it's not hard to get anything done on
this tablet and even in more intense
tasks like using the multi-window there
is little to complain about when you
have a powerful slate like this now
Hardware takes on a media motif first as
we mentioned the microSD card slot that
can bolster the already built-in 16 or
32 gigabytes of storage and that's
always a big plus for people who love
their media now there are dual speakers
found on the bottom of the tablet right
here and they do perform pretty well but
for a tablet that has this much
uncompromising power it would have liked
maybe a little bit richer sound what I
will say though is that it gets really
loud and if you are sharing your media
on this tablet with anybody else they
will be able to hear everything coming
out of it very easily
Samsung does love to add in as much as
they can as you do get the usual bevy of
connections with Wi-Fi Bluetooth and GPS
along with an IR blaster for the watch
on application now as far as power goes
you do get a 4800 milliamp hour unit
inside of here that powers it for a
decent amount of time I say decent
because even though the Snapdragon 800
is supposed to be a bit of a power
sipper the resolution definitely evens
it out gulping up the power and giving
you maybe a day to a day and a half
worth of heavy usage an 8 megapixel
shooter on the back of the Tab pro 8.4
provides a decent experience but falls
in line with pretty much any other
tablet camera the app takes on the
general motif of Samsung cameras
providing quite a bit of functionality
but ultimately not the highest
quality which honestly is expected the
pictures are decent but you won't be
using this tablet for more than probably
just your backup camera anyway the
updated version of TouchWiz comes with
the new tiled interface called the
magazine UX especially on the larger
tablets it really takes advantage of the
screen real estate but still works very
well on the smaller 8.4 inch screen the
best way to describe the magazine UX is
it's like a stretched-out Flipboard
literally as it is a front end to what
you would basically find in the
Flipboard app that pert that being said
it is pretty easy to set up your new
sources and your social media feeds but
what I didn't like about it is that it
often doesn't take you straight to the
content you're seeing instead it makes
you wade through the Flipboard
application to finally get to your
destination ultimately though it is a
nice addition that allows for quick and
easy glances at what you probably want
to see but the list of widgets and the
magazine UX is still rather limited and
the app controllers are basically for
just the Samsung specific apps so if you
are looking for an easy way of looking
at your Gmail or a controlling Google
Play Music you're not going to get it
here other than that however TouchWiz is
still TouchWiz with the colorful motif
even the new move to circular buttons in
the power widget actually doesn't really
change things all that much it's still
rather bloated and maybe uber colorful
and in the end it still looks like the
TouchWiz we all know or maybe love or
hate functionality like the multi window
does continue to set this UI apart from
the others but if you were looking for a
big change in the pearl line you
probably didn't get here as this is
called a pro tablet you are going to be
paying a premium price for it all of the
power and the wonderful resolution in
the screen will come in at $400 making
this a pretty expensive tablet at its
size but for some of you out there it
might make sense to pay that much for
this much power and so there you have it
the Galaxy Tab pro 8.4 provides all the
power the pro name suggests while
keeping it all in a manageable size
while the tablet will let you get a lot
of work done it's an absolute blast to
use for fun and games
making this the all-purpose device for
tablet lovers the size makes it a
shoe-in for a book reading for example
while the nimble weight and size will
keep it as portable as it can possibly
get yes you do pay quite a bit for the
Galaxy Tab 8.4 but if you need your
tablet to do pretty much everything
short of taking phone
Falls then perhaps the price is right
for you and as always thank you guys
very much for watching and I hope you
enjoyed this review of the Samsung
Galaxy Tab pro 8.4 it is one hell of a
tablet and it does almost stand alone
with its sheer power and it's super high
resolution in the tablet space however
you do pay a pretty hefty price point
for it and all of the updates that
Samsung put into it may or may not be
enough to justify that that being said
however you will be seeing a future
focus on the magazine UX in which I will
create a page full of widgets for you to
see exactly what kind of functionality
you can get out of Samsung's new tiled
interface but until then make sure you
keep it tuned to Android Authority
