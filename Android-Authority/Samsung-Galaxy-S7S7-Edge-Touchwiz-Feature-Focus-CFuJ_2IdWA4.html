authority and TouchWiz has changed a lot
over the years and the same way Android
has evolved TouchWiz has evolved along
with it
the new version of TouchWiz on the s7
and s7 edge or whatever Samsung is
calling your UI these days has changed a
lot even if you're coming from something
as recent as the note 5 you're going to
notice some differences so what is
TouchWiz like on the s7 and s7 edge is
it good is it bad what's changed and
what is still the same so the easiest
place to start would be the aesthetics
because those are usually the
differences that you can spot right away
without having to dig too far into the
software and I think the way TouchWiz
has looked over the years has been a
pretty big reason why I and maybe a lot
of other people out there haven't really
been a fan of the UI it definitely still
needs quite a bit of work but this is
probably the most i pleasing version of
samsung's interface that we've seen so
it looks like they're headed in the
right direction the first thing you'll
notice is the notification shade has
been replaced with a more subtle blue
and white which I personally think looks
a lot cleaner over the nasty blue and
green that Samsung stuck with for so
long if you're still not a hundred
percent satisfied with some of the
aesthetic changes that Samsung has made
the theme store is still a really great
option this was actually introduced on
last year's s6 but it is by far one of
the greatest features that samsung has
ever implemented into their phones
there's tons and tons of themes to pick
from including a lot of Android 6.0 and
material themes to make it look a lot
more like stock Android there's also
been some subtle changes made to the
animations like the way the shortcuts in
the notification shade expands as you
pull down or how the recent apps expands
onto the screen
they don't drastically make a huge
difference to the user experience per se
but these little changes definitely help
in making the UI feel a little bit more
polished speaking of Polish many of
samsung's features have been put into a
single location in the settings under
advanced features making them much
easier to find so all the Samsung
features that you may have been used to
in the past like pop-up view smart
capture palm swipe to capture and some
of the more recent ones like the camera
quick launch one-handed operation and
game tools are all under one convenient
location another feature that I've
really liked is the bill
to move multiple applications to another
home screen at one time you just drag
the applications that you want to move
to the top of the screen and this will
allow you to move up to five
applications at once and this is just
another good example of how Samsung is
really trying to focus on the minor
details of how they can make their
interface easier and more user friendly
there's a couple new features that
Samsung has added to the s7 and s7 edge
this year to further refine the
experience the first one is the
always-on display right now it can show
you the clock calendar or a couple of
random predefined images and it can show
you notifications but only from samsung
apps at the moment it is very limited in
functionality and nowhere near as robust
as something like Motorola's motor
display but it is handy to see the clock
or calendar and because it doesn't drain
much battery it's not that big of a deal
if you leave it turned on the second
feature that I've really enjoyed is the
game launcher and game tools and if
you're a big mobile gamer I think you'll
really like this feature a lot the game
launcher automatically aggregates any
game that you download it into a single
folder and provides you with an option
to save power during gameplay by
reducing the resolution and frame rate
if you've ever been annoyed with getting
notifications while you're playing a
game or always found yourself
accidentally pressing the capacitive
keys this is where the game tools really
comes in handy the game tools puts a
floating bubble on top of your game that
lets you mute incoming alerts lock the
capacitive keys minimize the game take a
screenshot or record a video now I know
I've been seeing a lot of good things
about Samsung's interface so far but it
still isn't without its quirks the
default icons are still very bright and
cartoonish but the app drawer is
probably the worst offender the app
drawer gives you the option of sort apps
alphabetically but it only sorts the
apps that you currently have installed
so if you download a new application it
automatically goes to the end of the
list and you'll have to resort it again
the same rule applies when uninstalling
applications and if you uninstall a
bunch of apps at one time this leaves a
gaping hole in your app drawer not
entirely sure why samsung chose to do it
this way but it would have been nice to
have an option to keep the app drawer
sorted alphabetically at all times the
same way it normally is on stock Android
if you have the s7 edge you're obviously
dealing with some extra software
features that take advantage of the
curve
screen you have many of the same
features from last year like the people
edge and the apps edge but the edge
interface is 2 columns wide now to fit
more information and twice as many apps
you can now also create shortcuts to
commonly-used tasks and quickly view
information like stocks sports scores
and the current weather and I really
like that you can rearrange these panels
in any order that you want because the
edge UX offers a lot more utility now I
won't go as far as calling it a gimmick
but you do have to train yourself to get
used to these edge features or else you
may end up forgetting that these
features even exist which is something
that happened to me a lot when I first
started using the s7 edge once you do
make that adjustment I think you might
actually find some of these features to
be quite useful so overall I think
Samsung has made a lot of really great
improvements with their UI and it's not
something that I feel compelled to
completely change out with a third-party
launcher anymore like I did in years
past it's not perfect and there's still
some quirks that Samsung needs to iron
out but they are definitely on the right
track as always thank you guys so much
