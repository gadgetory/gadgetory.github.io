Authority today we are having and look
at the Samsung Galaxy s3 unboxing is the
latest quad core Exynos phone from
Samsung is the 1.4 gigas quad core with
full HD recording all 8 megapixels of it
comes with 21 100 Mille mAh battery GPS
GLONASS 4.8 HD super amoled so this is a
sealed box from Samsung Malaysia and I'm
going to do the unboxing right now
well the s3 is one of the most
anticipated device from some so many
because the suit did so well last year
so this is a brand new bottle opening
right now the packaging seems similar to
what Samsung did for the s2 so the cover
is off here's the phone
at first glance it feels rather good in
the end is light it's great to the touch
we have been of metal here if I'm not
mistaken and it's very keen I believe
8.6 me meters to be exciting so let's
put that aside what else is in the boss
mean stickers they are mammals to talk
about the device the warranty
registration a little leaflet on channel
your earphones really really slim
battery here we'll eat in freeze leaking
2100 deaths almost as big as the one in
the notes I believe that note is 2500
this is 2100 for your earphones
your USB cable micro USB your charger
which is a pull-up and this is basically
a convertible one I believe you can buy
the converter if you are traveling
internationally you can just easily
detach this and you can change it on the
go
pretty interesting stuff here and that's
it in the box so let me just put this
aside and what you have is the earphones
the micro USB your earphone its battery
phone and your let-let's
and charger the spacer boxes inside your
s3 box let's take a quick boot first
boot error the s3 uses the micro USB Wow
it comes off quite easily it feels for a
job but I believe is quite strong it's
polycarbonate if I'm not mistaken but
it's quite glossy which feels really
really great to the touch in goes the
battery
as you can see my micro SD card this is
a mini sim or is it a micro sim not sure
about that eight megapixel camera the
speakers are at the back no other sized
speakers but yes okay let's just pop
this in and boot up and we'll have our
first impressions of it right now
right
as you can see is gt300 that's the model
of that's a blue notification light here
which is really nice
start okay skip there are basically two
software keys and one hardware button
there alright skip networks the end time
let's just skip that for now escape some
some account
not now Google account Google location
next alright let's just go next first it
comes to your Dropbox account if I am
not mistaken I'm not sure really have no
clue what size of Dropbox they are
giving us but let's go no thanks first
and finish and finish booting up the
phone swipe left okay
notifications see all apps
we had the launch of the ds3 today in
Malaysia and one of the things I noticed
during the launch was that within the
apps page now you can basically change
your view stop here you type yeah you
can now listen
alphabetical grid something which is big
welcome a lot of people who are using
the notes and the s who didn't have this
option but now that include that it is
is great so that's S Memo as well so
look it's the price they are including
this but it's an interesting thing to
have as memo as well not sure how they
are going to incorporate a stylus in
there but as you can see the just only
one button here is very thin profile
micro USB volume rocker the flash and
the speaker is here tom is the 3.5
millimeter jack and that's it for now
I'll be reread for a few days and now
let you know the outcome
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
