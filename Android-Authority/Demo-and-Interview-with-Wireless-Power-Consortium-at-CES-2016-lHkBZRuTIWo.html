president market development for the
wireless power consortium and we're here
at CES 2016 this is the wireless power
consortium booth what we do is create
the standard for wireless charging the
ability to charge a personal device like
a cell phone a toothbrush many other
consumer handheld devices without
plugging it in there's lots of ways to
do it you can do it in the public public
locations you could do it at home in
your car and we're showing all the
different systems that make that
possible right so what we have on
display here is an example of how
wireless charging supports the consumers
journey through life through the day
starting perhaps in in a home
environment where you have wireless
charging your phone wireless charging
say on a bedside table wakes you up in
the morning most of us use our cell
phones for a clock and an alarm and so
forth take your phone into the kitchen
where you have a wireless charging stand
put it there while you make your waffles
or eggs
Gharib your cup of coffee you charge
your phones continually at 100% charge
the next step might be going into a car
we have an automotive applications we
have over 25 models I think it's 28
today Mercedes just added one an Audi
just announced one today but there's
about 28 models of cars that have Qi
wireless charging built in put your
phone down on a charging spot and it
also takes information from your phone
allows your your car to adapt to your
personal preferences like seat position
temperature radio stations favorite
locations that sort of thing get out of
your car your phone's fully charged
over here we have an enterprise
application where folks like Google and
Deloitte and Facebook and so forth have
designed wireless charging into their
office buildings put your phone down on
the desk it's charging application comes
up gives you access to lighting HVAC
door locks that sort of thing
so what is charging is not just a way of
easily charging your phone
your phone charged all the time but it
also gives you access to your
environment in ways you didn't otherwise
have all right well we just got a look
at the wireless power consortium I want
to make sure I say the word right uh-huh
and we've got a look at some of the
demos at the area that is actually right
above our Android authority booth so you
saw that and we also got a spiel from
John here who was able to tell you about
applications in the home in the car and
of course in a business and now we're
gonna do a little quick talk just to see
what how things are going with the WPC
and with things like qi wireless
charging what i'm gonna go a little bit
of vague on this one you know so you can
go anywhere you want with okay what
would the future of wireless charging
look like in your eyes right now that's
that's awesome question sufficiently big
yeah the future part is charging as most
of us in the wireless power consortium
see it is phones that don't ever die
okay phones that have small smaller
batteries than they do today but don't
die because we we move from one charging
location to the other it's just embedded
in our daily journey so if I was sitting
here right now and you had a Qi wireless
charging unit built-in I would I would
probably have my phone on the table
maybe I turn it upside down so you don't
see exactly who's calling but whatever
it's charging it's just charging as I go
through my day absolutely and it's
always around 80 or 90 percent my phone
right now is at 99 percent because I
this is what I do so I have it in the
car of course we have a few charges in
our booth I am but they're in McDonald's
they're in hotels they're in public
spaces and the idea is that these are so
critical to our lives now there are
safety devices there way we stay in
touch they're entertaining devices and
entertainment devices sometimes
entertaining like when Siri says
something I don't like but we always
want them online and so to have chargers
embedded in our environment
ensures that we don't have this thing
called battery anxiety which better
anxiety's when my battery gets low and I
start changing my behavior yeah right I
stopped texting I stopped using internet
searches and so start asking for a
charger around I'm looking around for an
AC outlet yeah sitting on the floor in
the airport yeah exactly so my view all
of us at the WPC our view is you don't
need that as long as the systems are
efficient they work well and they're
ubiquitous it's a different way to keep
charge you mentioned ubiquity how how
tough I suppose I shouldn't say how
tough but what what is it what does it
look like when the market strategy is to
get these wireless chargers into as many
places as possible is it tough to create
let's say the the infrastructure for it
you know if you go to Starbucks or you
go to the airport there are want the
hard charging docks and everything like
that but what does it look like when
you're trying to actually create
wireless charging areas and pretty much
everywhere like we can't even talk about
the Convention Center yeah you know if
we could get a bunch in every corner of
every yeah every block why not yeah yeah
well there's ways to do that so it's the
easy way is that the members of the WPC
or some member company that has the
pockets deep enough it just doesn't they
just pay for it okay we don't do that
because we feel that if there's value in
it then the market will support it so
we're we're a little different in that
way we don't actually fund deployment of
wireless chargers we let we let the
market drive that and it might take
longer but they're committed and so what
we've seen in fact the last year has
been a really exciting year for the WPC
because that deployment has just taken
off so over 4,000 locations now
McDonald's in the UK and other test
markets around the world
hotels public spaces
especially cars so there's now 28 as of
today there's 28 models of cars this is
a really good place to charge your phone
oh absolutely we just won't plug them in
I just don't want to be bothered
plugging it in especially when you're
driving but we just don't think that you
wanna plug or flop it down put it down
yeah
the charges and oh by the way when you
put it down to charge it things happen
like the car knows you're charging your
phone so it enables a personalization we
talked about that personalization of the
space and it doesn't have to be your car
right you could get out in another city
and put that same phone down in it
another car and it adapts to your
settings so the difficulty or the
hurdles in establishing an international
ubiquitous deployment is the those
companies understanding the value their
customers asking for it which is now
happening yeah so last year 2014 most of
our members were running around the
world helping people understand what
wireless charging was and selling this
vision now it's reversed now it's a pull
market so we have hotels coming to us
and restaurants coming to us saying
which one should I use yeah if they're
not asking which standard should I use
because there's only one standard it's
really deployed they're not asking
should I use wireless charging because
they know how valuable it exactly
they're saying well there's a hundred
and fifty different types of
transmitters I can install here
network-attached stand along under the
table in the table on the table there's
all kinds of ways so just that cycle
getting that cycle ramped up and last
year 2015 we saw that
go up okay so you mentioned earlier
batteries that the fact that we don't
want our phones to ever die where are we
going to be seeing because uh for
example the Nexus 6p that came out it
actually went away with wireless
charging whereas the previous version of
the Nexus had it right and I think and
and and the consensus for the most part
was that they did that to focus on the
fastest type of charging right I could
put in anything USB type-c yeah is there
is there an answer to that well wireless
charging have the kind of speed that
that a wire let's say USB type-c will be
able to have right so the the USB see
and quick charge however you call it
quick charge turbo charge fast charge
different names different companies all
the same thing my phone is a little over
is the Motorola Droid turbo and it's got
a large battery and fast charge yes best
phone I've ever had
anyway it it's a it's a great USB see
was seen as a way okay you don't
necessarily need as much alright but the
answer is they would have used fast
charging if it was out it was a that
came out middle of last year our spec
for 15 watts we just released a 15 watt
spec which enables the fast charging so
this phone fast charging takes about 15
watts a little bit less than 15 watts to
charge that's what you need and that
spec was released in about the end of
June or so in products and chips to make
those systems are now on the market but
Android need to get their phone out I
should say Google need to get out and
now you could do fast charging or you
could do Wireless fast charging which is
really the best of both worlds yeah
exactly
okay great well in terms of batteries
you know we were discussing just before
the interview the the the fact that
really one of the only things that
manufacturers are able to do right now
is like you said the brute force
strategy which is putting huge batteries
into phones yeah exactly so if you if
you're looking for a smaller battery in
order to have a smaller
form-factor then I guess providing all
of the different types of charging would
be kind of you guys as focus obviously
and that's what we've been talking about
it really is yeah so why does charging
enables a number of things one of them
is if you have wireless charging really
deployed throughout your daily journey
and that's well on its way then you
better anxiety goes away but you can
actually decrease the size of the
battery right a smaller batteries charge
faster with less heat and and they don't
last a song but you don't need them to
because you're never without the ability
to charge in fact charts quickly so what
that does is it decreases dependency on
the lithium ion battery material
decreases the cost of the phone the size
of the phone it's a real benefit for
consumers cheaper phones better for the
environment it's just it's a good thing
all around well then I'll tell you one
thing one thing I do want to see are
more external batteries yeah with
wireless charging built-in yeah I'll
just lay it right on top yeah that would
be the thing that I'm looking for but
we'll have to see if that's going to
become more prevalent and whether about
twenty of them in our booth right now
but the dark yeah they're called power
banks so on one side is a receiver and
the other side is a transmitter so you
put this power bank which might be a
2100 milliamp hour battery you know
something that's gonna double your
battery life set it down on a wireless
charger and you charged you've got a
fuel to actual bank gap right put your
phone on top of that fill that in your
purse your wallet whatever put that on
the table if there's not a wireless
charging spot at the table already put
that down you got one now dad I think
that would be for me personally at least
that would be a perfect solution for us
so there's a really good selection of
those things yeah and they call them
power banks yeah power banks I'll have
to take a look at them especially maybe
we'll pop back up to the data booth but
you know what for now I want to thank
you John for coming by and I really
appreciate the interview and everything
yeah from WPC John over here make sure
you stay tuned to Android 34 even more
and don't forget to check out even at
the beginning of this video or if it's a
separate video all of the stuff that
they were showing at their booth that
was right above ours so thank you once
again John a pleasure always a pleasure
kiai authority there we go keep it tuned
Sandra 34 even more because we are your
source for all things
