the Moto G for and the Moto G for Plus
and this is the G for plus the for is to
tell us that this is the fourth
generation moto G and the plus is to let
us know that this is the highest end
model with the best specs and the most
features from a design standpoint it's
very reminiscent of previous Moto G's
there are a few minor aesthetic
differences but for the most part it's
sort of the same look and feel that
we've typically come to expect from a
moto made device it's an all plastic
build like it's always been and while
the faux metallic frame may lead you to
think otherwise
do not be fooled it is indeed entirely
made of plastic the g4 plus definitely
doesn't feel as nice as a phone made of
metal or glass before a phone made of
plastic it's one of the more sturdier
feeling phones out there and this is
something of motos always been really
pretty good with it doesn't rattle creak
or feel hollow and it just feels like a
very solid phone the back features that
signature motorola dimple that we all
know and love and it has a nice texture
to it which helps a lot with the grip
but the frame is a smooth finish so it
still feels just a tad bit slippery the
back is also removable and underneath
that removal back cover is a micro SD
card slot and a SIM card slot or dual
SIM card slots depending on which
version of the Moto G 4 plus that you're
using
despite the back being removable the
battery however is not that is
completely sealed in so there's no
swapping batteries here the sides of the
phone have been kept pretty minimal with
the headphone jack up top microUSB port
on the bottom powering volume keys on
the right and the left side has been
left completely clean of any buttons or
ports the power button has a Ridge
texture to it to make it easy to
differentiate from the volume rockers
but it actually feel like it's a little
bit too high up on the chassis and the
position of the power and volume Keys
really should be the other way around on
top of that the buttons aren't very
clicky or tactile and sometimes it's
hard to tell if you're actually
pressing them because of how mushy they
feel if you're wondering where the
speaker is it's actually the earpiece so
this phone does have a front facing
speaker but you're not getting stereo
sound here since it's only one speaker
it does sound pretty good though and is
capable of getting decently loud without
sounding tinny or distorted also on the
front that's specific to the g4 plus is
a fingerprint sensor but unlike most
front-facing fingerprint sensors this
one does not double as a home button
it's not a deal breaker that it doesn't
work as a home button but I kind of wish
that it did because I found myself
trying to use it like one and most
people that get this phone will probably
end up doing the same I know this may
sound nitpicky but I don't think it's
the most attractive looking fingerprint
sensor I think the square shape really
clashes with the rounded and curved
design of the g4 plus but as a
fingerprint sensor it works extremely
well it's fast its accurate the setup
process is pretty quick so it works
about as well as many other fingerprint
sensors on the market there's still no
NFC which is unfortunate which means you
can't do things like tap your phone to
connect to a Bluetooth speaker transfer
content or use a mobile payment platform
like Android pay another thing to note
about these new Moto G's is that they
aren't water-resistant anymore they can
still survive a simple splash or a
sprinkle in the rain but since they no
longer carry that IP certification don't
go dunking these things in water the g4
plus is a little bit thinner than
previous Moto G's but it's grown quite a
bit in every other dimension mostly
thanks to that larger display not only
is it larger but it's also higher
resolution which I think the Moto G line
desperately needed it's a 5.5 inch 1080p
IPS LCD and the increase in size and
resolution makes games web browsing and
YouTube videos much more enjoyable it's
not the best 1080p screen that I've ever
seen on a smart phone but it does the
job just fine it looks sharp viewing
angles are pretty good and the colors
are just the right amount of vibrancy
that it doesn't look washed out as far
as the specs go this is going to vary
slightly depending on which storage
options you pick the 16 gigabyte model
comes with two gigs of RAM and it
effectively goes up from there with
three gigs on the 32 gigabyte version
and four gigs on the 64 gigabyte version
but they all run on the same Snapdragon
617 processor the model that I've been
testing is the 32 gigabyte version so I
can't really comment on the
two models but I haven't ran into any
performance issues at all it's not
exactly a benchmarking beast but it's
been very fast and responsive apps
launched quickly games run smoothly and
it's capable of multitasking without
much of a hitch you can thank the
software for a lot of this motor roll
has been doing a really good job of
keeping things as close to stock as
possible and the Moto G 4 plus is no
exception it's running plain-jane
Android marshmallow and there's
virtually no bloatware to slow things
down it doesn't come with all of
Motorola's features that you would find
on something like the Moto X but you do
get most of them you've got moto actions
which lets you do things like turn on
the flashlight with a chopping motion
flipping the phone over to silence
notifications or launching the camera
with the twist of your wrist
Motorola's ambient display features also
still here but on the g4 plus it's
completely contingent on motion
there's no sensors on the front so you
can't wave your hand over it to wake it
and it also doesn't continuously pulsate
when you have a notification the only
time it lights up is when you pull your
phone out of your pocket or off of a
table or when you initially receive the
notification aside from the few Motorola
features there's really not much else to
it it's a simple and clean stock Android
experience and sometimes that's all you
really need the g4 plus is packing a
3000 milliamp hour battery inside which
is becoming a fairly standard size and a
lot of smartphones these days and when
you pair that with a 1080p display and
stock Android it sounds like a recipe
for good battery life and the battery
life on the g4 plus is pretty good it
gets me through a full day with regular
usage like checking Twitter Facebook
texting and browsing the web without
much of an issue it's only on days where
I hammer on it with several hours of
gaming and picture-taking that it won't
make it but it's got fast charging so
it's pretty easy to get some juice back
into it in a short amount of time the
camera on the g4 plus is a new improved
16 megapixel f 2.0 aperture lens with
both phase detection and laser autofocus
but there's no optical image
stabilization here the camera app has
also been improved there's actually a
shutter button now making it easier to
take photos with one hand and the app
itself is generally pretty clean and
simple swiping in from the left opens up
a menu for basic camera settings and the
button in the upper right lets you
switch between photo video and a few
other basic
shows like panorama and slow motion
video the most notable change in
motorless new camera app is we finally
have a manual mode now for controlling
white balance ISO shutter speed and
focus and this was something that was
definitely long overdue picture quality
is surprisingly really good it's not
going to stack up to the Samsungs and
LG's of the world but for such an
inexpensive smartphone the camera is
capable of taking some very nice-looking
shots in good lighting you can capture
plenty of detail with vibrant colors and
the images are sharp without looking
over sharpened for a close-up shot you
can also get some pretty good looking
depth of field it doesn't have the best
dynamic range as it tends to cross the
shadows a little too much but HDR can
solve that problem pretty quickly it
tones down the shadows and highlights
and add some extra vibrancy without
making the shots look unnatural or fake
it's only in low-light where this camera
falls apart extremely quickly we sort of
expect shots to always show some noise
in low light but there's a significant
amount of it on the g4 plus highlights
are also typically overexposed there's
not a whole lot of detail to be had and
it also has trouble focusing in
low-light if you're looking for a great
low-light camera the g4 plus is not
going to do it for you but in most
situations it gets the job done the
front-facing camera can take some pretty
decent shots as well it's a 5 megapixel
wide-angle lens so it's nothing too
crazy but it's more than adequate for
all your selfie taking needs if the
standard black and white color options
don't quite do it for you the g4 plus
will be available on moto maker for you
to customize to your heart's content
with different colored back plates
accent colors and engravings to truly
make it your own now as far as how much
all of this is going to cost motorola
hasn't provided exact pricing or
availability for the u.s. just yet but
if the pricing in india is any
indication you can probably expect the
g4 plus to be anywhere between 200 to
250 dollars if it does end up costing
that much that's actually a pretty good
deal it's a big enough of a price
difference from phones like the Nexus 5x
on the oneplus 3 to make it worth
considering especially if you're looking
for a smartphone that offers some nice
specs and features while staying below
that $300 price tag the Moto G has
always been one of the best bang for
your buck smartphones on the market but
it was sorely in need of some upgrades
and the g4 plus makes all the right
changes to make a compelling option in
2016 as always thank you guys so much
