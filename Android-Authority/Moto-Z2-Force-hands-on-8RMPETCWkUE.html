authority and we're here in New York
where Motorola has just announced its
new Moto z2 horse flagship Motorola was
hoping this will be your next smartphone
but what's new and should you buy it
let's take a look like last year's Moto
G Force there's a 5.5 inch quad HD Super
AMOLED panel that offers deep blacks and
vibrant rich colors and as the false
name suggests the z2 Force comes with
Motorola's patented shatterproof display
technology essentially this means you've
struggled to break the screen no matter
what you try and do which is great if
you're clumsy and always tired of fixing
your broken display under the hood the
Moto G 2 force is powered by a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 835 CPU with 4 gigabytes of
RAM and 64 gigabytes of expandable
storage which is rather standard fare
for a 2017 flagship the z2 force also
comes with gigabit LTE support on all
the major carriers but given the need
for very specific antenna to make this
work
motorola won't be selling a single
unlocked variant in the u.s. instead
there'll be individual SKUs for each
carrier and while the handset will be
unlocked if bought from Motorola comm
you'll have to click a carrier for
gigabit LTE support on the back is wrote
the same old as well as all change with
Motorola sticking to its motor modes
promise which is the launch of two new
modes as well as an all-new dual camera
array the new dual camera features two
12 megapixel sensors one monochrome in
one color both of which have F 2.0
aperture unlike last year's Motors
equals however there's no optical image
stabilization and an F 2.0 there's
definitely a compromise in the cameras
low-light capabilities at least on paper
the new dual camera comes paired with
what Motorola is calling next-gen laser
autofocus
that can focus at distances of up to
five meters even in low light and the
camera is also able to capture true
black and white photos which essentially
just uses the monochrome sensor for
shooting as Motorola's promised
previously it's motor mods will be
compatible with any other Moto G rage
which means the two most popular mods
from last year the battery pack and the
JBL speaker will also work with the moto
z2 force which is a good thing
as you'll probably want to buy a battery
pack mod given the batteries taking a
hit from 3500 milliamp hours last year
to 27 30 milliamp hours this year of
course Motorola is hoping you won't just
stop at the battery mode on the speaker
and if you're a gamer the new gaming pad
mod could be for you mobile gaming can
be at all especially for racing and
action games where there's a lot of
controls and this mod brings back the
controls you'd normally find on a
traditional games console controller as
well as a large battery to boot the
other new mod is a 360-degree camera
that allows you to capture 360-degree
video 150 degrees still images and
selfies and all of this can be edited
directly on the phone and you're also
able to live stream directly from your
phones to various social networks the
Moto G to force is definitely nice in
the hand and at 6 millimeters thin it's
one of the lightest flagships on the
market yet the battery and the camera
both feels like compromises at least on
paper especially as there's no moto z2
just the force this year
interestingly the handset will also be
known as a moto g2 force everywhere
which means there will be no Droid
branded various city are either the moto
g2 force is available to pre-order now
from $30 per month and will be available
in saw on August 10th at all major
carriers Best Buy and Motorola comm the
buy outright will cost between $700 and
$150 depending on the carrier you choose
while pre-orders and those who order
before september 10 will get last year's
projector mod included for free the
360-degree camera will also be available
in-store gnorga sent at a cost of $299
in the US and for other markets pricing
for the z2 force and the mods will be
announced in due course so what do you
think of the moto z2 force and is a dual
camera and motor mods enough to make
this your next smartphone let us know
