is Clayton representing Android
authority comm your number one source
for all things Android now anyways today
I've got a brief overlook of the Samsung
Galaxy s3 running the Android 4.1
jellybean operating system and I was
able to flash a custom ROM to my Rubin
Samsung Galaxy s3 GTI 9,300
international version and this custom
ROM actually is the jellybean operating
system now mind you there are a lot of
things that aren't working including the
radios you're not gonna have any service
you will have Wi-Fi and then a lot of
the native features of the Android
jellybean operating system don't work
but it is cool to see this operating
system getting ported over to many
devices already the Galaxy Nexus
received it the HTC One X received it
and the galaxy s3 did as well ok so
right when we open her up we have our
jelly bean lockscreen we can touch our
lock e to bring it up to the Google now
to the left to our camera or we can
unlock it we have our cool little
animation with the bursts coming out
like that well just unlock it regularly
for now as you see we have our soft keys
on screen even though the capacitive
buttons are still present because this
is right from a Galaxy Nexus dump
anyways the soft keys are functional we
can hold and drag up for the Google now
we can go back and then we can actually
access our recent apps by clicking the
recent window now anyways as we scroll
through we can see it's pre-loaded
exactly like the Galaxy Nexus is when
it's running jelly bean we have our less
transparent Google search bar up here
our time is displayed in the top right
with our battery and our data there is
no data mind you we have our folders
that are the exact same as the Galaxy
Nexus for jelly bean and go to our app
tray within the app tray we do have all
of the apps that come pre-loaded on the
jelly bean operating system and this is
still rooted we do have our Super User
with updated binaries anyways we go into
the settings here you can see that it's
themed exactly like the AOSP jelly bean
absolutely no TouchWiz now we can't add
any accounts or anything because there
is no Wi-Fi that is just not functional
can't even turn it on of course that
also means that we're not going to be
able to have
see or the Android Beam functionality
but we can manage our apps we can
disable which apps actually show us
notification in the notification bar but
a lot of these native features for
jellybean are just kind of going to be
redundant unless we get the radios
working
anyways we go down to the about phone we
will verify we're in fact running the
4.1 jellybean and I will go back really
quick you can see here we have the GTI
and 9300 model but we will just access
our Easter egg we have the jellybean and
with all of our little beans sweep them
away and whatnot go back now we can
still use the physical buttons the home
button still works and when you hold it
it still does bring up the recent apps
but I will just show you here how the
Google now does not work you drag it up
like that and then unfortunately Google
search has stopped we can't access the
voice control if we go to the voice
search here you see it and began to
initialize but then it quit so that
doesn't work our Wi-Fi doesn't work we
will test our camera really quick
we don't have camera as you can see
there from the lockscreen will try the
Google now and it stopped so a lot of
the functionality is missing but it's
really awesome if you guys want to just
give it a try on your Galaxy s3 it is
jellybean you can impress your friends
you can actually check out how the
interface is set up because this does
nothing bad your device you can flash it
then you can actually just you know
flash it right back to another ROM or to
the stock firmware and stay tuned with
Android authority calm guys we're going
to be bringing you everything you want
