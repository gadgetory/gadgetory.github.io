weekly my name is Jason this is where we
cover the week's Android news like how
Samsung is refusing to be outdone by
apples silly fingerprint scanning or
Google's silly Google glass that
requires blinking no Samsung is seeking
a cooler more sophisticated route with
user identification with its new
patented biometric iris scanning
technology head can you unlock your
phone three please sure ready dad yeah
okay dad what do you see I see dead
pixels now of course Samsung's iris
scanner won't work quite like that but
it does combine a proximity sensor with
a light emitting source for fast and
accurate biometric identification the
goal is to develop a secure easy to use
method for securing mobile devices that
users would prefer over pins passwords
and fingerprint scanners now all this
came coupled with the news from the
Korean site ZDNet that samsung is now
ready to start mass-producing the w qhd
display that crazy crazy big display for
a mobile phone as early as february2014
does that mean that's when we can see
the flagship Galaxy s5 launch we don't
know but those high resolution displays
are confirmed and I have to echo the
complaint that many of you have that you
know we have this crazy ever increasing
high resolution screens on small mobile
devices and yet so little innovation
when it comes to practical things like
battery lights
whoo but from a marketing perspective
you can see how easier and sexier it is
to sell that big 2k display and a little
device than it is battery life
schmaderer life I mean come on look at
the benefits with that kind of display
you could zoom in painfully close to see
my nose hairs see if you look over here
you can see a mix and red and brown and
over here there's some chunky stuff I
can never get out no matter how well I
clean it moving on to some great news
with regards to the granddaddy of custom
roms cyanogenmod opal has announced via
their Google+ page that the opal and one
version running cyanogenmod will ship as
early as December 24th but if that
wasn't wonderful news enough the senate
mod team announced a huge milestone in
their history just last Thursday the
Oppo n1 will be the first google
certified santa gen mod fun do you know
what that means puppies well this means
that this google certified phone will be
able to access the google play store
play google apps without having to
sideload anything that my friends
deserves a happy dance for every freedom
lover out there
daddy boo don't jump again I'll go get
mom okay okay I should just really move
on to pebble smartwatch news though the
company behind the pebble smartwatch has
launched what's called the pebble
education project whereby they are
donating more than 4,000 smartwatches to
engineering and computer science
students across the u.s. why well not
only to teach them about SmartWatch
technology but to increase the
possibility that those engineers will
they go on to create new apps for the
new pebble appstore not to feel left out
if your university has not been included
in this program you can go to the pebble
website and submit an application on
behalf of your university but if you're
older like me and out of school and you
