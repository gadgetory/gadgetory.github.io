has now been officially unveiled is it
here to stay
or will it soon be lost in the sea of
other phones coming up find out in our
review hi everybody I'm Chris wook ever
since Google acquired Motorola Mobility
we've all been waiting to see what would
come of it sure there was that new
lineup of droid phones but the Moto X is
the first phone that Google actually had
a hand in so how is it let's take a look
taking it out of the box there isn't a
whole lot to see just the phone charger
and sim removal tool okay so how about
those specs the Moto X features a 4.7
inch 720p display and Motorola's x8
mobile computing system which is
comprised of a 1.7 gigahertz dual-core
Snapdragon s4 pro CPU quad-core Adreno
320 GPU and two other low-power chips
that provide extra functionality it has
two gigs of RAM and 16 gigs of internal
storage no microSD slot here the Moto X
features a 10 megapixel rear facing
clear pixel camera and 2 megapixel
front-facing camera power is provided by
a 2,200 milliamp hour battery at the
press event I attended in New York
Motorola made a point of mentioning that
they started with the shape of the phone
and Bill everything else around that
from the display to the battery they
wanted to make sure they built a phone
that was easy to use and comfortable to
hold I'd say they succeeded as the phone
feels very natural buttons are at a
minimum here on the right side you have
the power button and volume rocker
that's it
the left side of the phone holds the SIM
slot while the top is where the
headphone jack is located and the USB
port is found on the bottom the Moto X
is constructed out of PE T composite and
has a rugged feel despite its fairly
lightweight
I wouldn't toss it at a wall but it
feels like it will survive an accidental
drop the 4.7 inch 720p AMOLED display in
the Moto X has made a lot of people
angry specifically those who would
prefer a 1080p display it's true we've
gotten spoiled and I'll admit even I
cringe
a little bit when I see anything lower
but this is a very nice display
nonetheless around 70% of the phone
surface is screen and the display here
is both very sharp and very vivid
especially given the somewhat
comparatively low pixel density as we'll
see later this has the side effect of
being very good for performance and I
would say that anyone who is
disappointed in the display should take
a look at the phone in person before
they make up their mind for good of
course the major story when it comes to
the display is the new active display
technology which lights up only a
portion of the pixels to show you
notifications this happens when you flip
the phone over take it out of your
pocket or even when you walk up to it in
some cases it's definitely a major
improvement on the now old-fashioned
notification LED in a world where worth
is measured by cores and gigahertz it's
tough to gauge the Moto X's performance
simply by looking at the specs luckily
we have benchmarks for that we started
with our usual weapon of choice and to
to benchmark we ran the benchmark a
total of ten times in different
situations and recorded the results
scores range from just over 18,000 to
just over 19,000 our final average score
was eighteen thousand six hundred and
seventy six it seems that Motorola is
doing something right with their x8
system the combination of the Adreno 320
GPU and the 720p resolution led to
similarly impressive performance in Epic
Citadel
we ran the benchmark in all three
quality modes ultra-high quality ran in
an average frame rate of 50 8.8 frames
per second while high quality ran at 50
8.9 frames per second finally and
unsurprisingly the high performance mode
ran at 59 point 4 frames per second real
world use proved to be similar scrolling
through home screens in the app drawer
was always smooth while viewers of our
first impression video were quick to
catch the lag while using the Google
Play Music app others pointed out that
this happens on pretty much any phone
out there even those with higher specs
gaming performance was excellent I tried
a few titles like Real Racing 3 and
Shadowgun deadzone and both ran without
a sing
Hetch the modal X runs Android 4.2.2 and
plenty of our viewers will be very
pleased to know that this is stock
Android just with interface enhancements
from Motorola what interface
enhancements you asked
well there's active display which we
already talked about and touchless
control which a lot of you probably
already know as Google now it may not
sound like a big deal and I didn't think
it was at first but being able to say
okay Google now and have the phone light
up from across the room can be very
handy between active display
notifications and touchless control I'm
already beginning to hate having to use
the power button on other phones whether
or not there's any bloatware installed
will depend on which carrier you use my
review unit uses Verizon so my Verizon
mobile verizon tones and VZ Navigator
are installed alongside Quickoffice no
matter which carrier you use Motorola's
assist app is included which includes
modes and settings for if you're driving
sleeping or currently in a meeting I'm
not sure I'd use it very often but it
certainly doesn't get in the way and I'm
sure a lot of people will like it
there's been a lot of talk surrounding
the clear pixel camera in the Moto X and
the fact that it uses an RGB C sensor
that adds additional light information
not present in a standard RGB bayer
sensor in practice
well it's hit and miss the RGB C sensor
is supposed to improve low-light
photography and I notice that photos
taken in low-light situations were
definitely brighter than expected that
said there was still noticeable visual
noise in a lot of the shots I took to
the point where it looked like somebody
took a dark photo and just cranked up
the brightness on the other hand the 10
megapixel camera in the Moto X can take
some very nice photos many of the shots
I took at very crisp detail without that
/ sharp look that many modern smartphone
cameras can have the camera UI is
definitely worth mentioning as well
there really isn't one most of the time
and it's great you can use a twisting
gesture to launch the camera app taking
a photo is done by topping anywhere on
the screen to access finer controls
swipe to the right to access the
galleries
to the left very nice like any modern
smartphone worth its salt the motox
shoots 1080p video it's usable but both
the auto brightness and autofocus are
way too aggressive and the artifacting
present in still photos is noticeable
here as well
I was skeptical at first when Motorola
claim that the Moto X could get up to 24
hours of use given the 2200 milliamp
hour battery but from what I've seen
they could even have been playing it
safe I have the phone on without
charging at all for two days and though
this included standby time I was heavily
benchmarking testing gaming performance
and generally putting the phone through
its paces quite a bit during that time
it's a good thing the battery life is so
good as the battery isn't replaceable in
order to keep the size down while
maintaining the rounded shape on the
back of the Moto X Motorola needed to
use a specially shaped battery luckily
you shouldn't have to worry about
carrying a spare over all the Moto X is
a very solid release that focuses more
on what the phone actually does than
just providing the specs in focusing on
what it could do at $1.99 with the
two-year contract isn't worth the price
absolutely is everyone going to agree
with that statement
not a chance we've got a written
companion to this video in Android
authority comm you can find the link
down in the description now we're not
even close to done with the Moto X so if
you want to see more on its features or
how it stacks up against other phones
make sure to stay tuned I am Chris wok
for Android authority and as always
thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
