authority and today we're taking a look
at some of our favorite tech under fifty
dollars so let's not waste any time and
get right into it kicking off the list
is this pretty killer led desk lamp by
moco it's got this really sleek angler
look to it that's simple clean and
should blend in with most desk setups or
even a nightstand it's also made of
aluminum which not only makes it feel
really sturdy but also keeps it light
weight there's also a rubber or silicon
like material on the bottom side so if
you're worried about this thing's
sliding around this helps keep it in
place since the bulb is an LED it should
last a really long time without having
to worry about it burning out and it's a
nice bright white that's perfect for
when you need that extra light to help
you get some work done or do a little
bit of bedside reading this isn't just
your ordinary desk lamp so on the base
of the lamp you'll find two USB ports
that both deliver a maximum output of
2.4 amps which is perfect for charging
your phone tablet or both simultaneously
there's also a dedicated slot next two
USB ports that can create your phone or
tablet as it charges or just as a nice
resting spot for your device next up is
a smart light bulb from magic light
brands like Philips you and lifx are
great but they can get pretty expensive
rather quickly and if you're looking to
get into the smart bulb game without
spending a fortune this might be the
perfect option what makes us both a
little bit different from some other
brands on the market is that it connects
to your phone or tablet via bluetooth
instead of Wi-Fi but the pairing process
is still really simple once you have the
bulb installed in your location of
choice just turn on Bluetooth download
the magic light app from the Play Store
or App Store if you're on iOS open it
and it will automatically find and
connect to the bowl the app itself I
will admit it's not the cleanest looking
app that I've ever seen and could use an
update or two but it gets the job done
and offers a lot of controls you can
easily change the color within the color
wheel adjust the brightness or create up
to five of your own presets you could
even make the bulb cycle through colors
and a bunch of other really cool stuff
like strobe effects or have the bulb
pulse to the sound of your music or
voice it's a boat that gets nice and
bright works well and since it's
relatively inexpensive you can buy
several of these to spruce up your home
without breaking the bank coming in at
number three is a 12,000
our power bank by action pie I know the
brand may sound a little bit weird and
that power banks are pretty much a dime
a dozen at this point but this one is
one of the coolest power banks that I
have ever used at 12,000 milliamp hours
you've got enough juice to charge your
device multiple times and it comes
included with a standard microUSB cable
and another cable with USB on one end
that splits into micro USB and lightning
on the other so if you're an Apple user
you're completely covered and if you're
an Android user you're mostly covered
unless you have an Android device with
USB type-c in which case you'll have to
supply your own cable it doesn't have
quick charge technology which may be a
deal-breaker for some people but it has
some other features built-in that I
personally think make up for it on the
top side of the power bank you'll find
two USB ports for charging your device
with one rated at 2.1 amps and the other
app one amp but right in between those
two USB ports is a single LED that lets
you turn this power bank into a
makeshift flashlight by double pressing
the power button my favorite feature of
this battery pack cover is the LCD
readout most battery packs typically
give you an arbitrary light bar or LEDs
to tell you the remaining battery life
but this tiny LCD display will tell you
exactly how much charge is left in the
tank another cool thing about this power
bank is that it also works as a Qi
wireless charging pad so if you have
something like the galaxy s7 that can
take advantage of that you can charge
your phone without needing a cable and
just in case you're wondering yes you
absolutely can charge two devices
through the USB ports and another one
wirelessly at the same time if you're
looking for a compact bluetooth speaker
they can deliver some high quality sound
and looks good while doing it this next
item is for you this is the
color-changing bluetooth speaker from I
home and for the most part it's a lot
like many other Bluetooth speakers on
the market but what makes it unique is
that can really light up a room or an
area outdoors when you're listening to
music the speaker is not that large and
can easily fit in one hand and it also
comes with a lanyard to make it even
easier to carry on the bottom side of
the speaker r plus and minus buttons for
controlling volume a micro USB port for
charging a button for cycling through
the six different color modes and a
button for using the bluetooth speaker
as a speakerphone for phone calls this
is also the same button that you use to
put the speaker into bluetooth pairing
mode by long pressing on it and if you
want to check the speakers remaining
battery life you can easily do
by long pressing on the color cycle
button for such a compact Bluetooth
speaker I was pretty surprised by how
loud it gets and since the upward firing
speaker it's pretty easy to hear from
any direction it's a very solid
bluetooth speaker for the price and the
fact that you can light up to the beat
of your music makes it that much more
awesome and fun to use our next and
final item on the list is a piece of
text that have actually been using for
the last three or four years so I can
absolutely vouch for this one one
hundred percent it's Dumont's our car
mount from winter gear and it doesn't
have any fancy bells and whistles but it
does what it's supposed to do extremely
well it's a pretty simple mount with a
suction cup on the bottom that lets you
easily attach it to a windshield or dash
of your car and the clamp rotates 360
degrees in any direction so you can
mount the phone however you want you'll
also notice a soft red rubber lining on
the inside of the clamp to prevent your
phone from getting damaged when attached
to the mount now when this mount first
came out winter gear actually stated
that could fit phones as large as the
original galaxy note which came out a
pretty long time ago but the reason why
this mount is still relevant is because
of the transition that phone is made
from a 4 by 3 aspect ratio to 16 by 9
this essentially breathe new life into
this car mount which i think is the
reason why winter gear still sells this
car mount to this day even the most
recent flagship like the s7 s7 edge HTC
10 LG g5 and the nexus 6p all fit
perfectly in this car mount and that's
the reason why I've been using this
mount for so long it fits pretty much
any phone on the market and if you're
looking for a simple and reliable car
mount it's one that I definitely
recommend as far as pricing and
availability for all these awesome tech
items make sure to check the links down
