thority now if you've ever heard terms
like Bitcoin or cryptocurrency I'm sure
you've also heard the term blockchain
now blockchain technology is something
we're gonna hear more and more about
over the next few years so what is a
blockchain how does it work and what
does it mean to people like you and me
well let me explain put most simply a
blockchain is a list of transactions
that is distributed publicly so they can
be verified and a level of trust can be
created that those transactions actually
occurred now the reason why it's called
a blockchain is because it is a series
of blocks of data and inside those
blocks are transactions and they are
chained together and it's the chaining
of them together that gives the strength
of blockchain now before we go on more
about how they chain together let's talk
about a thing called hashing now hashing
is a technology that you find in
computers from from way way back now
basically there are two types of hashes
in computer science you've basically got
a non-unique hash and a unique hash now
a unique hash is really really
interesting what it basically means or
whatever data you give the hashing
function the hashing algorithm this
little machine that creates the hash
whatever day to give it the hash that
comes out will be guaranteed unique now
that's quite amazing because it means if
you give it a string or you give it a
photo you can get a video file or you
give it transactions then it will say
this hash is unique and you can compare
to hashes very very quickly and if
they're the same you know that the
transactions are talking about the same
block of data to about the same
transactions and if they're different
then you know they're not the same so
you might have let's say you know a
gigabyte of data and then you get a hash
you might have another gigabyte of data
it gives you the hash now rather than
trying to compare every single byte in
that file if you look at the hashes you
can say oh okay these are the same these
are not the same so passing the hashes
around storing the hashes using the
hashes for computations and much much
faster than dealing with the actual data
itself
now the key about hashes is that they
have to produce a different unique
answer even if one little bit of that
day to it difference so if you have a
sentence okay and then the sentence
changes even by one character then the
hash has to be very different now in the
blockchain what happens is that there is
a particular hash which is called
sha-256 which belongs to the secure
hashing algorithm family of hashes and
sha-1 used to be the darling of the
internet there are some weaknesses in it
now where you can maybe find paths with
the same data different data so we can
give you the same hash so now they've
moved up to sha-256 which is a form of
the sha to hash and basically what
happens is is that when you have a block
of data you produce a hash for that
block you say here's a block give me the
hash for that and that hash is unique
and then what you do is you embed that
hash in the next block so where long
comes the next block of translations
transactions and inside that block is
actually the hash for the one before it
and then comes on the next block of
transactions and inside that block is
the hash for the one before it now what
does that mean well first of all it
means it produces a chain because you
can jump from one block to the next
block to the next block to the next
block by following the hashes but also
what it means is that if you want to
change your block remember it if we just
change one bit let's say I want to
change it to say he sent two bitcoins
rather than one Bitcoin okay by changing
that it changes the hash which means
when you look at the next transaction
and it says well the hash of the block
before was this when it looks at the
block before it goes no it's not it's
different it's changed and so what that
means is that to actually change any one
block inside of the blockchain you have
to change the whole chain so do change
while even from a two to one
inside that transaction you have to
change the whole chain now of course the
thing about hashes is they're not that
difficult to calculate
in fact on on a raspberry pi you know
which is a tiny tiny little single core
computer it calculates one hash in just
a fraction of a second so what you
actually need to do is you need to make
it harder to generate the hash otherwise
even if you had a million blocks
recoding them wouldn't
take very long for a modern computer
very tall UV they know here's the real
blockchain and actually it's got fraud
you know block sins that you have
manufactured yourself and then the whole
system of trust and transactions and
financial transactions just completely
falls apart so when you look at these
hashes as I've shown you they there's
big long sequence of numbers you can
actually say well can I have a hash that
starts with two zeros please now when I
did this on my Raspberry Pi it does take
it a bit longer to generate a hash with
two zeros on it now hold on a second how
can it generate one with two zeros if
the hash is always unique for a
particular set of data well what you do
is you add on the end of the data this
thing could announce and what that is is
basically you start a counter one two
three and you add it onto the end of the
string on the end of the data and you
keep changing it you keep turning it
around until the hacks that you get out
follows a particular format now even on
my raspberry pi I could actually
generate one with sort of three four
five leading zeros in just a few seconds
so what you have to do on the Bitcoin is
actually want one that takes 17 zeros to
get it going which means it takes
minutes of high-powered computing time
to generate that hash to have a hash
that's got 17 zeros at the beginning
that's or today in 2017 and then and
then the data for the transaction and
what that means if you wanted to recode
the entire block now for a fraudulent
transaction then now you have to do kind
of ten minutes of work for absolutely
every single block in the chain and of
course if the chain is thousands and
thousands along well that's a lot of
minutes okay just to generate one
Portland transaction and therefore it
becomes computing lis infeasible to do
that now we've talked about block chains
because they to do with Bitcoin and
other cryptocurrencies and the idea is a
transaction is sent out there on the
internet and the second important thing
is that is what they call distributed
it's using a peer-to-peer network which
means there isn't a centralized server
owned by you know a u.s. financial
institution or you owned by
a financial institution alone by Visa or
MasterCard it's transmitted to everybody
that's part of the Bitcoin network which
means that there are thousands and
thousands of copies of the chain or
fragments of the chain throughout the
entire world and that means that if a
part of the Internet becomes unavailable
with a server is unavailable if a
particular institution is unavailable
the the transactions can still keep
going on they can still be verified they
can still still a level of trust because
it's now distributed this is a
decentralized view of doing final
transaction very different to what we
have today where the banks are the
centralized authority and Trust source
for doing transactions now of course
block chains are much more than just
what can be done with bitcoins it can be
applied to anything where there is a
list of transactions for example maybe
in most countries I assume the Land
Registry is a public record if you want
to find out who owns a piece of land you
might go to the write-off which you
might fill out the right form you submit
it and then it comes back maybe days
weeks later this is the person that owns
this piece of land very important when
you're buying property or when you're
buying land of course now imagine a
world where the Land Registry was Ain a
blockchain so it's out there it's
distributed it's across anywhere across
the internet and when you want to verify
who owns a particular piece of land what
the last transaction was on a piece of
land then of course you just look at the
blockchain and it tells you and you know
it's secure and you know it's been
verified because of that blockchain
technology now that would be a great way
of having public records available for
anybody to verify and check that the
transactions are as they say but there
is a downside to blockchain technology
because those transactions that are put
onto the blockchain need to be verified
themselves and the way you do that is
using private public key cryptography
now I've got two videos on one on
cryptography in general and one on
public key cryptography and I suggest
you both you go watch those if you're
interested in this kind of thing I'll
leave the links in the description here
below and basically with public key
cryptography I'm able to sign a
transaction as the private party I then
broadcast that out
then using the public part of my key it
can be verified that I did in fact sign
that transaction I'm agreeing with that
transaction and that it is a valid
transaction when the key don't match up
in this private public setup then you
say well hold on this is a false
transaction now the problem is is if you
ever lose your private key you lose
everything so for example if I had a
disaster in my house let's say there was
a flood and all my documents got
destroyed even my Land Registry
documents okay I can still get a new
driving license I can get a new passport
I can get copies of my birth difficut I
can go back to the Land Registry and I
can get again a copy all those documents
to prove that it's me
that owns a particular piece of land but
if I lose my private key that's it it's
gone I've got no way at that point to
prove that actually I am the owner of
that land and this is what happens in
the Bitcoin world when people lose their
private key they lose their wallet then
of course they can't get those bitcoins
back they are gone forever because the
key is no longer available now that's a
real weakness because at the level we
are all used to living in terms of you
know identification and how we process
things and and when we lose our keys
it's weights it's a pain but it's not
the end of the world if you lose a key
for something like Land Registry or for
bitcoins or who owns a house or your
medical records or or anything like that
then now we're in real trouble because
everything is focus on that one point of
weakness and that is a problem with the
blockchain now there are lots of
companies out there that are developing
blockchain technology as a general
technology and I'm sure we're going to
see more and more of it and I hope this
video has kind of given you an overview
of how it works and how that level of
trust in the transactions is developed
inside of the blockchain
well my name's Gary sim trying to
authority I hope you enjoyed this video
if you did please do give it a thumbs up
