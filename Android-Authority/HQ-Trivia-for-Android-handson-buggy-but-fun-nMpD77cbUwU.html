handy the Android a thority app guy and
this is HQ trivia on Android for those
who don't know HQ trivia is a hit quiz
show game from the original creators of
vine it launched on iOS back in August
2017 and quickly became super popular
games often have well over a hundred
thousand people and the New Year's Eve
game had over half a million
participants at one point that's fairly
impressive for a live game show game
that is less than six months old games
seem to take place everyday at 9 p.m.
Eastern Standard Time along with extra
games at 3 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on
weekdays that means there are a total of
12 games per week that you can play
there may be the additional special
edition like the New Year's Eve game but
that means there aren't a ton of
opportunities to play however given that
it's completely live it's really not
that big of a deal for the uninitiated
here's how the game works you
essentially participate in a live game
show along with up to hundreds of
thousands of other people the host asks
12 questions and each question has a
timer for 10 seconds those who answer
the question correctly get to continue
while the others are eliminated at the
end the remaining participants split the
winnings and the pot can range from
$1,000 to the $18,000 pot from the New
Year's Eve game winning the game gets
you actual money that money is
automatically transferred into your
PayPal account
a few minutes after you win of course
you do need to link your PayPal account
to get the winnings and that's basically
it it's simple you log in for a few
minutes before the game you play the
game for about 15 to 20 minutes you
collect your winnings if you have any
and then you turn it off and wait for
the next game there is nothing to do
between the actual show times there is
no Settings menu there's nothing like
that you just stop and then come back
later there is a way you can stay in the
game after you've been eliminated if you
send out your referral code and people
join with your referral code you do get
the opportunity to stay in the game
after an elimination however this does
not happen frequently there is a lot to
like about this game it doesn't force
you to sign into anything really it
doesn't have the kinds of mechanics that
usually make mobile games suck there's
no energy counter there's no upgrades
there are no boosts or anything like
that you can't buy your way to victory
through
purchases and it feels pretty much like
a game show when playing it it totally
felt like I was sitting on my couch
watching jeopardy trying to guess the
answers along with the participants
except in this case I am a participant
and I get money if I'm right 12 times in
a row that's a neat experience and one
that is totally unique to this game in
comparison to other mobile games it has
no menus no screens nothing to look at
like I said earlier you just open the
app at the right time watch it do talk
for a little bit answer some questions
and Co about your day there is no BS and
frankly that's refreshing no mobile game
is perfect and that does include this
one as per the norm people can and will
find a way to make this game not so fun
it is possible to cheat the game with a
second device with Google assistant it
does take a bit of creativity but you
can get Google to answer these questions
for you before the timer runs out when
you include that BOTS and all kinds of
other stuff it does kill the spirit of
the game a little bit that said it's not
against the rules to play with multiple
people in the room with you and most
games have fewer than a couple hundred
winners anyway thus the problem isn't so
widespread about the only other issue or
the bugs the company is less than six
months old so that's to be expected
games with tons of participants are
going to lag or lower the video quality
even on the iOS version some have even
complained about being kicked out mid
game due to connection issues the
Android version is an early access beta
right now and that means there are
probably going to be some extra bugs in
that version however these problems
should clear up in the future at least
for the most part there really isn't
that much more to say the game is just
that simple some have tried to extend
the narrative of the game beyond its
natural bounds or slam it for various
philosophical reasons however at the end
of the day this is just a fun simple
little live quiz show game with cash
prizes and that's it there's no reason
to read any further into it because it's
really not that big of a deal the live
host is a great touch and the promise of
real money gives the game tension the
lack of menus or any complicated
mechanics gives the game an almost
universal accessibility the occasional
connection issues and the Google
assistant hacks aren't great but it
doesn't seem to affect anything that
much if you do want to watch a full game
I've linked a YouTube channel in the
video description below that archives
old age to trivia games you can see the
entire game from start to finish for
yourself I don't know if it's an
official channel or an enterprising
individual but the videos are clean and
you can see what it's like we'd
recommend you try it at least one time
it's something a little bit different
that you don't see every day and that
about does it for this one folks we have
the game linked up in the video
description below if you want to try it
out for yourself don't forget to
subscribe and ring the bell to get more
android authority videos as soon as they
come out thanks again for watching
everybody and have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
