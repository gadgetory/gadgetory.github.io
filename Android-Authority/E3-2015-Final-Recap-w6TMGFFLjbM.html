authority what's going on everybody and
as you can see behind us with this
ladder right here let's see completely
out of place III is coming to a close
and if our experience at pretty much any
other trade show is any indication
they're really quick and tearing it down
so what was once a wonderful spectacle
behind us in other videos we cap support
not what what once was a spectacle is
now going to become just the LA
Convention Center so and as always it's
our time to sort of just kind of think
back and reminisce a little bit and talk
about what the experience was at v3 this
is our first one and I think a good
place to start is for me to tell you
guys that we're going to have a full
podcast especially what we're doing
right now but the first five to maybe
seven minutes of this podcast is being
recorded and it's your final recap video
on the YouTube channel but if you want
to hear even more of us elaborating on
how we felt about III make sure you tune
in to the fdp this week I listened to
Android authorities podcast so that you
can get even more about our experiences
at you three that being said andrew
grush brushy and lon
on my left thoughts quick thoughts on
easily
a lot of we are they are video yeah we
do w got to so that there's a lot of
waiting in line to play games but
totally worth it absolutely it was since
I was really young this he's been like a
drunk sure all of us to an excessive and
you know this has been a big dream for
me when I was a kid and it's been
amazing to be here yes the mobile space
is still new I mean it's still growing
it's just small here but you know just I
following coverage from past years to
now it's amazing how much it's brought
up and you know it's just it's grown a
lot yeah and the same thing for VR VR
had very little presents last year
compared to this year which could talk
about you know more thoroughly in other
videos but yeah I enjoyed everything
right Nintendo which we grew and do a
little more viet depth a little later
why should i want to talk a little bit
about your nintendo experience sure
actually we're not doing a day to recap
this is actually kind of our final one
we're just going to lump day two and
three together yeah yeah and day two was
mostly VR for these guys I was with him
and we did a couple of the VR
accessories i should say but then after
that like I got to periscope and film
this guy just going nuts in the intendo
booth yeah I admitted defend I'm
actually all gaming fanboy but Nintendo
has a special place in my heart you know
I and especially like nostalgic stuff so
I checked out a couple things but the
biggest thing that really made an
impression of me was Mario maker which
is basically a little big planet but
with Mario it goes through us you have
basically different worlds and you have
a super mario brothers yep super mario
three you have world super mario world
and then you have the newest one which
is super mario brothers
we you and basically what you make
levels and you can play levels that
people make and you can do them any of
those styles that I mentioned and so you
can switch back and forth between the
mario 3 style what's really cool about
it it's like a break smart like
convention that you ever play with these
old school mario games like you can like
jump on a block at out pops of goombahs
that have a mushroom for example or you
know another bad guy and you get herself
as a link oh yeah there's even like
special like there are special levels
that I can tell them it specifically we
have special power up so you can like
come different characters in fact uh
Nintendo has this thing called amiibos
or at least publicly that we've only was
it and what it is is just like a toy
tech thing but on this on the wii u and
it's uh skansen well they're going to be
using that like allow you to put skins
on your Mario character in this game to
become different attend oh you know
doesn't do anything in reality when it
comes to like functionality but it's
still kind of cool especially if you're
really into like certain characters like
salmon you know yeah there's but yeah it
was great i also finally I didn't get a
little time with Star Fox and that was
pretty cool too ok we'll go more in
depth with that with a podcast yeah stay
tuned to the ftp for even more of and
you could just see just how enthusiastic
grocery was talking about nintendo in
particular I want to pass it over the
lawn for this final recap now today we
did do more VR with the oculus rift in
the morning but while you
or while I was taking care of YouTube
gaming we decide to split up to get
double time dumb you were able to head
over to Matt finger and play a game that
is really close to being released I
think it's been the next couple weeks
they said a bottom are all about a
monster okay guess all of their
madfinger for unkilled yeah and she also
it's coming out this summer and unkilled
is title but it's it's essentially if
you play dead trigger or dead trigger 2
this is essentially a sort of a rehash I
hate to say that but it's kind of a
rehab fact that the games it's the same
concept here in a post-apocalyptic world
and you're basically going around with a
bunch of weapons and fighting off
zombies to try and complete different
missions very similar missions to the
ones that you'd find and dead trigger
and there's a lot of different things
that you can do as we added a few new
things to the game where you can
actually kick the zombies and you can
also shoot missiles at them you actually
have a perk that actually shoots these
missiles and it will actually auto
regenerate so you never run out of them
and basically use that whenever you're
in a big areas I just just completely
bombarded with zombies that's where you
use those type of her excites I think
add a few nifty different things so it's
a little bit cooler than dead trigger
and graphically it does look a lot
better as well but it'll be very
familiar for many people have played
madfinger games before so it was a
really cool game and obviously it's a
free game and then you're going to have
to in app purchases as well and on top
of that of
there's tons of different missions I
believe it's over three hundred missions
and a bunch of different weapons like 50
or 60 different weapons i can use so
there's a lot of things that you can do
this game but it's a really fun game a
good time waster and if you love you
know zombie-type games this is going to
be a really good name to check out the
summer so yeah he while he was to
checking that out I was over at YouTube
gaming now we Andrew authority has been
toying with the idea of creating some
sort of a streaming channel already and
I think YouTube they kicked off this
week I think you know could be a judge
very close but YouTube gaming probably
came at the exact perfect time not only
for android authority but also for me I
have been one again to console streaming
for quite a while what better incentive
to play or video games than to you know
share it and potentially you know you
never know you might get paid to do
before but YouTube gaming has what I
think YouTube gaming does really well is
it puts it consolidates all of the
YouTube content for a particular game
there's a search bar at the top and you
put in the name of the game boom you
have everything you have not only what
has been really good over the last week
forever we also have a section there
where you can just swipe over and it's
all of the Let's Plays in playlist form
so perfectly annotated and everything
perfectly put together and easy for you
to use and then of course there's a
section just for reviews and then on the
main page you have a bunch of feeds if
you have if you follow certain games and
you star certain games and it will give
you feat of live foods that are
happening right now I think YouTube
gaming is pretty great and we're going
to get to even more than that but it
sounds like you guys like we sound tired
because it's we've been working but I
think all in all we had a really good
time invited we got to play star wars
battlefront for God's sake and it was so
awesome I have a little jealous I had
some other things I had to do well
getting things we're gonna talk about
even more and you're noticing that I
didn't cut away from there because
there's no footage press the show if
star wars battlefront because we
couldn't take any I might have a couple
pictures of like us like selfie photos
with or to do too but that's about it
but yeah like I'm guessing Gras she had
a great time I mean you were getting
related on your nintendo oh yeah well
I'm there's some things that i wish i
could see which we'll talk about the
podcast yeah and also we're just really
difficult
