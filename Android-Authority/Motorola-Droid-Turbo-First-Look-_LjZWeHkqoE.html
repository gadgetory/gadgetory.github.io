name is Kevin the tech ninja and today
we're taking a first look at the droid
turbo almost five years to the date of
the original droid motorola and Verizon
rekindles the flame with the Droid turbo
the turbo is running Android 4.4.4
kitkat but will be on Android L in the
near future you can find the turbo in
three different colors metallic red
which is the flashes of the bunch in my
opinion the black ballistic nylon which
is my review unit and it's also a fan
favorite due to the materials and a
subtle red underline metallic black
which is the standard appearance and
historically shows the most fingerprints
the screen is 5.2 inches quad HD at 565
PPI with Corning Gorilla Glass 2 inside
you'll find the Snapdragon 805 and the
andrina
420 GPU you also find NFC cheat charging
and also a water-resistant coating with
a twist of the wrist you are taken to
the 21 megapixel camera at F 2.0 4k
recording is onboard as well you simply
tap on the screen and it focuses to take
your shot to do a burst fire you press
and hold on the screen as well at first
glance the camera software is what
you'll find on the Moto X but during my
review I'll dig into it a little bit
further some of the new software
features includes a modal command center
which is a widget on your home screen at
a glance you can see your weather time
and location if you press on the edges
it expands out so you can see your dates
alarms and also your option to view the
weather by our droids app is a
multi-platform photo sharing application
this allows you to flame photos to
anyone that uses the app yes there's
even an iOS version as well it connects
via a Wi-Fi Bluetooth or even cellular
data you can also zap two TV on
chromecast or even zap your screen as a
screen shot the latest version of active
notifications is onboard and this
version can actually show you more than
one notification at a time and also we
have the modal assist the droid turbo
promises 48 hours of real work
battery life also is bundled in with the
turbocharger which is a 15 minute charge
time from 0 to 100% this phone is for
Verizon only it could be found for $1.99
for 32 gigabytes and 249 for 64
gigabytes on contract this phone feels
pretty good and it looks good but we'll
see how it holds up over the next few
days as this the phone you've been
waiting for

while you're at it and keep it locked to

ninja reporting live from New York and
