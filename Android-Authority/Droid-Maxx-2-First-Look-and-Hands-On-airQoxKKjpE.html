Authority and I'm here in New York City
at the Motorola and Verizon event where
the new Droid turbo 2 and new Droid Maxx
- were announced the droid turbo 2
hands-on is live on this channel so make
sure you head on over there to check
that out but first let's take a look at
the more affordable new Droid Maxx - so
the Droid Maxx - is looking to be pretty
much the same phone as a Moto X play
that has been available in other
countries for a couple of months but
finally it appears this is a Moto X play
rebranded for the US but you will have
to be a Verizon customer as this is a
Verizon exclusive we've got the metal
around the sides along with this rubbery
material that feels similar to that on
the Moto X pure maybe a little soft to
the touch and has more of a scaly
pattern to it now this droid Maxx
unfortunately is not able to customize
your modem maker but this back panel can
be swapped out for another including for
other colors so at least you won't have
to be locked into one color now the
original Droid Maxx had fantastic
battery life and once again on the Droid
Maxx - it seems that we can expect the
same motorola claims the phone can last
for 48 hours of moderate use with this
3630
milliamp hour battery so that's not 48
hours of having the phone on standby
that's 48 hours of actually using the
phone which sounds very impressive and
so far it seems to make sense as not
only does it Joe max to have a huge 3630
milliamp hour battery but it packs a 5.5
inch HD display so this display probably
won't be as power-hungry as some quad HD
screens out there so this mix with his
huge battery makes the phone look very
promising the screen is not shatterproof
like the phone it was announced
alongside with the droid turbo 2 but the
panel is covered in Gorilla Glass 3 so
very minor drops and bumps should be
able to hold up the 5.5 inch HD IPS
screen itself looks very good so far
colours look good and by just taking a
stroll through settings with its white
background they look very accurate
without much of a weird tint or hue to
them it doesn't seem to get too bright
but we'll have to test it further in
different lighting conditions inside the
Droid Maxx - we have a Snapdragon 615
processor 2 gigs of RAM and 16 gigs of
storage
but you do have access to a micro SD
card slot up to 128 gigs basically the
droid maxx 2 is identical to the Moto X
play which we actually found to be great
in performance even with this lure and
aspects with this being a Motorola phone
you can expect near stock Android
although unfortunately instead of
running Android 6.0 marshmallow out of
the box we have android 5.1.1 lollipop
so hopefully we'll see this update soon
along with this near stock android
experience
Motorola's nice features are here like
motor display that alerts you of missed
notifications when the phone is slightly
moved and the twisting gesture to launch
a camera app remains here although it's
the only gesture available it's a very
easy and fun
barely skinned version of Android the
Motorola phone owners have come to love
and surely the Droid Maxx too will be no
different the camera sensors seem to be
the same found on the droid turbo 2 and
the other 2015 Moto X pure phones with
the 21 megapixel sensor on the back and
a 5 megapixel sensor on the front we do
have a front facing speaker on the
bottom of the droid maxx 2 so even
though it may look like these are two
stereo speakers it's really only at the
bottom that plays sound the speaker
sounds alright in the few moments that
we've had with the phone not the loudest
but loud enough
overall the droid maxx 2 is turning out
to be a great smartphone with its
biggest feature being its very
impressive 2 day battery life we'll have
to test it out over the next several
days to see exactly where we stand with
it but we can't see how you could go
wrong with the Droid Maxx 2 given its
price now if no official announcement
yet on full price of the phone we do
have confirmed monthly payments for the
Droid Maxx 2 as 16 dollars per month if
this is based on 2 years we can see the
Droid Maxx 2 costing around 384 dollars
when we have had enough time with this
phone to put out an in-depth review
we'll let you know here on Android
authority along with our website at
Android authority calm as we are your
