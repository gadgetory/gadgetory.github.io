name is Jace and today is all about the
Nexus 5 and I know what some of you are
thinking Jase you're not funny and
you're hella late on the Nexus 5 that
may be true but I'm going to talk about
things that have not been talked about
before and i must confess i think i
found man's new best friend ah i mean i
love you and everything but you know the
drooling and and the shedding and she's
just smarter than you are your dog is
due for a vet appointment see yes i have
found the phone that i have been the
most happy out of all smartphones that
i've ever used and i've used a number of
them that doesn't mean that it doesn't
have its downsides so let's start with
the downsides first at least from my
perspective number one battery life now
it's better than the iphone and it's
even better than ipad mini but it's not
great in fact if i were to be out and
about away from home in my car and i was
using it just moderately it would not
make it through a full day i'm pretty
sure that but on a you know real world
case-by-case basis I'm not away from a
charger the entire day when I'm at home
at my desk it's charging when I'm in my
car it's charging so it's not a deal
breaker so the next up is sighs it's too
big now I know some of you are like too
big what are you talking about well I
think it's not just my personal
preference i think that the 4.5 to 4.7
inch sized phone is going to be the
future in 18 to 22 18 months to two
years most flagship phones are going to
be you know sub 4.7 inches not the five
inches which is currently now the bigger
and better craze is going to end and
let's talk about why nomos we're going
to say Jace what are you talking about
the Nexus 5 is a great one handed device
well consider how most people use it if
i'm texting i'm not holding the phone up
here with my thumb up here on the side
and texting down here I'm holding it
like this do you see how when I do that
I have to change the way to the phone
right so if i'm texting down here and I
got to go up top now I have to change
the weight of the phone
I have to change where the weight is in
my hand and that changes things on a 4.7
inch phone I can hold it here in this
manner and reach pretty much everything
without major finger gymnastics now I
know some of you might be thinking I'm
exaggerating but unless you are David
Ortiz with gorillas form it's this
applies to you you see how do you use
your phone most people use their phone
when I have my hand in my phone the
other hand is holding a drink keys to
get in my car the dog leash I'm
separating twins were fighting that kind
of thing and I want to be able to use a
one-handed device to get done what I
need to get done this keeps my life
organized it keeps my phone calls going
I text I keep connected that way this is
not a media device when I have a tablet
and most of the world is going to have a
tablet and a phone least that's my
educated prediction so again these are
the reasons why I think most phones are
going to be smaller than 5 inches well
technically this is four point nine five
inches but it's going to be sub 4.7
inches to be a true one-headed device
and the minute a you know oppo one comes
up with a phone for example that's a
flagship power than it's under 4.7
inches or Nexus comes out with a 4.7
inch foam I'm going to sell this and go
for that because it's that important it
is a deal breaker it will change your
life on a daily basis how you interact
with your device now let's talk about
the things I love about this phone when
you buy an electronic device whether
it's a phone tablet or a laptop for the
most part the value or usefulness of
that device is slowly decreasing over
time especially from a hardware
perspective but also true in a software
perspective but with the nexus 5 because
Google always has improvements in the
pipe the software is improving over time
it's able to maximize battery management
over time it manages resources better
over time and each time Google puts out
a big marketing push about a new camera
app for example I get it right away I
don't have to wait like the rest you
have to wait for 18 months or two years
to get an update when I had the galaxy
note I got two updates the Ice Cream
Sandwich and jelly bean and it took four
BRR I had it for three years and I only
got two updates I love it now next up is
power and it comes in spades with the
Snapdragon 800 and the Adreno 330 the
phone can do just about anything you can
throw at it now and for the foreseeable
future it's about future proofing your
phone and I'm very happy with it now
let's talk about price and it is pretty
sweet because other than the one plus
one this is the most powerful affordable
phone you can possibly by the 16
gigabyte version is 349 and the 32
gigabyte version is 399 and although I
got this as a gift this is a fantastic
phone for the price you simply can't
beat it if you look at other phones of
comparable power and function there you
know almost double the price it's a
fantastic deal now the last big bonus I
wanted to talk about what many people
don't talk about when it comes to Nexus
5 is the huge developer community that
supports the Nexus 5 if you go to XDA
developers com there is a plethora of
developers out there who love to make
wonderful toys software toys so you can
customize your Nexus 5 experience it's
fantastic go check it out XDA developers
com so last up I just want to talk about
the experience with the Nexus 5 that's
really allowed me to fall in love with
Android again to remind me why I loved
it to begin with the last two android
phones that i had weren't the best user
experience but this is fantastic so
androids incremental improvements over
time are really paying off the the speed
with which it works and Google now is so
intuitive I mean it actually works now
on the galaxy note it just didn't work
very well at all it's helpful i was at
my my son's archery practice and it told
me that there was increased traffic and
you know it was going to take me x
number of minutes longer to get home
than it normally was like crazy
practical stuffer reminds me when my
next appointment is when the other app
crashed it's fantastic love it but it
should be said to get all those benefits
of android you really need flagship
power or at least close to it so that's
something to consider and you can't get
better flagship power for
this price than a Nexus device let's
hope pray to God that they kept in they
keep the Nexus line alive because this
is a fantastic deal thanks for watching
android army my name is Jace I'd love to
connect with you here on Google+ or
Twitter you also may want to check out
the video i did regarding the top five
or top four questions that people have
regarding the nexus 5 these are
technical questions you can also check
out my brothers in android Josh Joe and
the tech ninja Kevin Chris and lon is
now with us he's doing a great job if
you have any other questions put them in
the comments below I read all of them
answer them all but I will read them all
talk to you next week on Android QA</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
