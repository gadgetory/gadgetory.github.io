thority what's going on everybody and
here we are at the huawei ascend mate 7
press event where we are going to take a
look at the brand new 6 inch phone here
from Huawei the president was a very
large one and really it kind of
coincides with just how large and great
this phone is potentially going to be
you're going to take a look at the
design as we start off here and you can
see here that is of a metal construction
it actually looks really nice very sleek
all around you do have the lines that
really give it a nice profile what
you're seeing underneath that camera
right there is a fingerprint scanner
which is one of the marquee features of
this particular phone but as we continue
with the design we have a metal frame
all around that provides a very thin
profile this is 7.9 millimeters that
really gives it a very nice feel in the
hand as I will go ahead and show you
right now I have it in my hand right
here and it just feels really nice for a
6 inch screen it is still pretty easy to
grip the large size of the screen might
make it a little tough to use in one
hand but that's something that we would
probably expect from a large device
anyway coming over to the other side we
do have the thin profile once again
right here with the microUSB port right
here on the bottom and the head
headphone jack right here on the top and
once again we're looking at a metal
frame right here and it does look really
nice but what we're going to get into is
the screen right here but first what I
need to have our representative over
here unlock the phone by using the
fingerprint scanner
there you go well there you go what you
saw there was the fingerprint scanner in
action and you saw that it really just
unlocked the phone straight from the
prone position easily right in in like
just a matter of us maybe a second maybe
even a fraction of a second and that
really is when the marquee features of
this particular phone when you'll be
able to register up to five fingerprints
on here and all of them will be able to
unlock the phone from the prone position
in a very very fast time but now we are
inside of the actual display itself and
inside of the operating system we do
have the emotion UI right here which
will show the nice colors especially
really just this theme right here will
show the brown and darker tones but you
will have a lot of freedom to create to
have the experience that you want with
themes that you can find in the Play
Store and in also the emotion UI theme
app that they have here as well as we're
going through the emotion UI I'll show
you some of the elements from there like
for example pointing down the
notification dropped and you'll see the
elements of the quick settings right
here kind of going up and down on the
brightness and also an area for some of
your appointments that are coming up in
the other area right here along with the
other actual notifications but the quick
settings menu is really easy to use and
we have the brightness right here here's
the recent apps screen which looks
really nice you have a lot of different
transitions going in and out of all of
the different applications in one app
that really make it seem very fluid and
it's a very nice-looking operating
system but powering all of this is an
in-house processing package is the
Huawei Kiran nine-to-five that comes
with a octa-core architecture you do
have four large processors and then for
smaller processors that will be used for
lower power consumption and with a 4100
milliamp hour battery built inside of
here usually could be pretty sure that
you're going to get all-day battery life
and even beyond maybe close to two days
or even more if you have moderate usage
taking a look at some of the settings
over here we do have this is obviously
in German text but it's okay we're just
gonna go through the elements and take a
look at what we have here all of the
different types of connectivity are
available in the huawei ascend mate 7
and like I said before it really does
come in a very nice package but as far
as the price and availability goes we're
going to have this particular phone and
a 2 gigabyte of RAM and 16 gigabytes of
memory version that is available for
$4.99 but a premium version that comes
a gold color will come with three
gigabytes of RAM and 32 gigabytes of
storage now the final portion that we'll
talk about here is in regards to the
camera now we do have a Sony constructed
camera as the Exmor RS sensor and what
we have here is the camera interface it
does have a pretty simplistic look about
it and it will allow you to get
everything from photo to video to a
couple of extra modes that are available
and we're taking a look at some of the
settings right here and as you can see
from the interface it's actually a
pretty nice-looking one already you have
HDR mode panorama and a couple of things
that I can't really read in German but
that's perfectly fine but what I do like
about the viewfinder here in the
interface of the cameras that's nice and
minimalistic if we take a look at the
there you go if we take a look at the
front-facing camera what we actually
have here is a five megapixel
front-facing camera that again uses the
same simplistic interface on here we
also have the usual beautify mode that
is something that is usually found
inside of Chinese phones but we have the
same here with a regular photo mode a
video mode and the ability to change the
settings up to whatever we need
including a panorama here which will
help you get a wider selfie so that's a
look at the camera the GIMP is a 13
megapixel rear camera as we're going to
see right there and the front-facing
camera has 5 megapixels
now the huawei ascend made 7 is going to
be one of the phones upcoming in our
review cycle so you can stay tuned for
that particular review but let's take
one last look around the actual device
itself you have the emotion UI like I
said already that has a lot of new
features to make the user experience
even better for those of you out there
this phone will be available in a number
of different markets so plenty of people
will get their hands on it and it brings
a pretty interesting take to Android
especially with the fact that Huawei is
continuing to really update their their
design language to really make devices
that are very attractive and you can see
it right there on the back you have this
wonderful metal frame and metal
construction that really gives it a
sleek look one that we do really like
and we really are looking forward to
handling ourselves with our review units
but of course we also have the
fingerprint scanner back here which is a
further add-on to the security but also
adds a much faster way of unlocking the
phone which is something we always think
that fingerprint scanners were supposed
to do in the first place but that is the
huawei ascend mate 7 this is the newest
smartphone flagship from Huawei and
we're here at the launch event here at
Eva
Berlin and we're taking a look at this
phone make sure you stay tuned to
Android thority for all of the best
coverage and make sure that you keep it
here for all of our future coverage of
this great-looking phone right here
coming in at 6 inches we have the full
HD display and it will bring quite a bit
of power with that in-house processing
package that has the octa-core
architecture so keep it tuned here and
we'll learn more about this phone once
again our review unit so stay tuned for
that because we are your source for all
things FIFA 2014</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
