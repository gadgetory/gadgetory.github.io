Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly once
again Google will be dominating our
headlines Samsung has released an
application that allows people to demo
note3 software and nova launcher is
getting a makeover so without further
ado let's get started in our first bit
of news this week nova launcher
developer Kevin Barry has announced that
Nova Launcher will be getting a brand
new makeover to make it look more like
Google's latest offerings there has been
some screenshots posted but it's still
very unstable and no release date has
been given yet if you've seen the Google
Experience launchers and you know that
look nova launcher is going for some
things like transparent status bars will
only be available on devices that can't
support it and the always on Google now
will have to be done a different way
despite the challenges and limitations
we're looking forward to seeing the new
product after a few months of waiting
google hangouts is finally being updated
in the Google Play Store to bring SMS
support for the last week or so people
have been using the leaked apk that was
pulled from the Nexus 5 and we actually
need a review with it so if you want to
see that it's on our YouTube channel
along with SMS integration you'll also
get more emojis the ability to send your
location to anyone anytime gifs support
and the ability to set your mood SMS has
been a highly requested feature and now
that it's here hangouts users can wave
goodbye to their stock messaging app
again if you want to see our review you
can find it in our YouTube channel if
you've been on the fence about
purchasing a galaxy note 3 Samsung wants
to help you out they've recently
released an application to the google
play store that will let you demo no 3
software before you buy it so you can
see what it's all about notable features
you can demo include air command pen
window action memo and s finder there
are some galaxy gear features you can
also check out alongside those are a
number of videos that will show you how
the note 3 works it's not as good as
releasing no three apps to the Google
Play Store but if you wanted to try it
out this is your chance a couple of
weeks ago we did a review on swiftkey
4.3 beta the new features allow you to
reshape move and resize the keyboard to
fit your needs the update is now out of
beta and rolling out to the Google Play
Store now it's actually a pretty big
update with this swiftkey has combined
the tablet keyboard and the phone
keyboard experience and it gives you a
plethora of options to resize and move
your keyboard to your liking we reviewed
these changes a while back and you can
see the full details in our review on
our youtube channel and our last bit of
news
Android Kit Kats photo editor was
showing off in a video that's been
circulating around the internet
essentially the video shows all of the
new features and improvements of the
photo editor watching the video actually
makes the editor look really fun and we
can't wait to get our hands on it you
can apply a number of filters and tweaks
to a photo to make it look like how you
want it to look obviously it's no
desktop Photoshop but it's still pretty
powerful once you get it down it's about
that time to check out some trending
applications as usual if you want them
the links are in the video description
first up this week as the helpouts app
Google has finally launched help out so
people who need help can find it by
people who can actually help the app is
launched so far with great reviews and
if you haven't checked out the service
yet now is a great time to do so root
users who have the galaxy note 3 have
been pining for titanium backup to fix a
problem with restoring backups for a
while now with the latest update that
issue is now fixed and you can now
restore apps freely without using the
restore con command in the terminal
emulator also it's just a nice root app
to have asphalt 8 airborne gameloft
latest racing game is now free in the
Google Play Store the game has
transitioned to an in-app purchase model
which will probably condemn it in the
eyes of some people but if you want a
fairly decent racing game for free than
this is a good pick up google keyboard
has been updated so now you can get the
Android KitKat version the biggest and
most noticeable feature is the blue
being replaced by white you'll also have
better access to emojis and improved
space aware gesture typing last up on
our trending apps list this week is the
popular MMORPG aim clash of clans this
game has been consistently updated since
it was released on android a short time
ago and the most recent one has added
some new stuff these include rearming
bombs instead of replacing them and
being able to upgrade explosive traps
once again I'm Joe Hindy the android
authority app guy and this has been
