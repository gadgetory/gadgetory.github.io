thinner design and availability on all
US carriers Motorola's 2017 flagship is
primed to compete with the big dogs
is it a force to be reckoned with or
will it simply fall flat on its face
this is the Moto v2 4th so this year
Motorola consolidated their moto Z
lineup there's the V to play which came
out not that long ago but instead of
offering two flagships like they did
last year we only get one now with the
z2 force the v2 force brings all the
latest and greatest specs for a 2017
flagship phone it's being powered by a
Snapdragon 835 and 4 gigabytes of RAM
which provides for a blazing fast
experience it handles all the mundane
stuff like launching applications
checking emails browsing the web and
watching videos extremely well and with
4 gigabytes of RAM multitasking is a
smooth experience and so is playing
graphically intensive games the phone
comes with 64 gigabytes of internal
storage which is probably plenty for
most people but there's a micro SD card
slot that supports up to 2 terabytes if
you need more so z2 Force has motorola
standard nano coating that makes the
phone resistant to the occasional splash
but it doesn't officially carry any sort
of IP certification so it's not going to
survive submersion like many other
flagships that we've seen in 2017 and
that just feels like an oversight on
motorola part to not make this phone
water-resistant on the outside of the z2
force not a whole lot has changed from
last year's models since it pretty much
had to stay relatively the same to
maintain compatibility with the Moto
Maude's but for better or worse there
are some significant changes to the
phone's design it's an all metal unibody
design so there's no more rear glass
inserts and it's constructed from 7000
series aluminum making it pretty strong
and durable the rear panel has a
hairline finish which doesn't add any
sort of texture but it does look a lot
nicer than the rear panel of last year's
Moto Z and does a much better job of
hiding fingerprints there's still no
headphone jacks which can be pretty
annoying but motorola does give you an
adapter in the box so you're still able
to use your favorite set of earbuds or
over the ear cans audio from the
external speaker also isn't all that
amazing there's only
speaker that's embedded in the earpiece
and it sounds fine without any
distortion and the fact that it's
front-facing is definitely a bonus but
because there's only one the audio
sounds lopsided when you have the phone
in landscape the other big change to the
phone's design is that it's even thinner
than last year's model which gives a
really sleek feel in the hand but the
thinner body has stirred up quite a bit
of controversy because the phone's
battery took a huge hit the original
z-force had a 3,500 milliamp hour
battery but on the z2 forces has dropped
down significantly to 27 30 milliamp
hours I honestly thought we were beyond
the point of seeing flagship phones with
a battery capacity less than 3000
milliamp hours but apparently we're not
at least not according to Motorola and
Lenovo it's easy to say that there's a
moto mod for that if you want better
battery life but a phone should be able
to stand on its own without relying on
extra accessories and this just feels
like a ploy for Motorola to sell more
moto mods and it'll probably work
because the v2 forces battery life isn't
all that great just as most people have
feared I've gotten around four hours of
screen on time max but normally it's
anywhere around 2 to 3 which is well
below average of other competing
flagships in the v2 forces price range
with the release of the z2 force
Motorola has introduced a couple of new
moto mods there's a new 360 degree
camera if you're into that sort of thing
and a moto gamepad that will be
available later the summer that turns
your phone into a handheld gaming
console with physical buttons and
joysticks one of the z2 forces most
attractive features is the display the
screen is a fairly standard 5.5 inch
quad HD AMOLED screen and it's
everything that you would typically
expect from an AMOLED panel the colors
are vibrant
it has great viewing angles and
excellent contrast with those deep dark
blacks but it is a little difficult to
see in direct sunlight even with a
brightness cranked all the way up what
makes the screen special is that it's
shatterproof which means you can drop it
a bunch of times and it's not going to
shatter on you but the secret behind all
of this isn't really anything magical
it's made of several layers of plastic
and it's great that the screen will
never shatter but the drawback here is
that it gets scratched up and dinged up
super easily I've only had this phone
for a week and it's already filled with
imperfections so I could only imagine
what it's going to look like for someone
who use
this bone for a year or more and the
other downside is Motorola is no longer
offering replacement screens so you
either have to live with the scratches
or get a screen protector so you either
have to put a piece of plastic on top of
plastic to protect the plastic or put a
glass screen protector to protect the
plastic and make the screen feel more
like glass huh
below the screen you have the
fingerprint sensor and it's very fast
and very accurate and I love that you
can use it to put the phone to sleep the
fingerprint sensor can also be used as
your main source of Android navigation
with various different swipe gestures
which will get rid of the on-screen
navigation keys and give you more screen
real estate it's a feature that Motorola
started implementing with the g5 Plus
and it's nice but it definitely takes a
little bit of time to get used to dual
cameras are becoming increasingly more
common especially among flagships and
Motorola is the latest OEM to jump on
the bandwagon it's more than likely
going to be a standard feature on
flagship phones at this point both
cameras are 12 megapixels and one shoot
standard RGB or color and the other is a
monochrome sensor that can shoot true
black-and-white photos the second sensor
is also leverage for a depth effect for
portrait mode like the iPhone Huawei p10
or more recently the one plus five it
doesn't really work any better than any
other phone that has done it before it
can look pretty convincing when the
objects have sharp and clear cut edges
but when you're shooting something like
a flower that's a little bit more
complex you can start to see the
imperfections and it just looks
artificial black and white photography
isn't really my thing but the option is
there if you want it and in the right
situation it can make your shot look
more dramatic if there's one thing I
wish this camera had its optical image
stabilization because without it this
phone really struggles in low-light it's
very slow to capture which causes a love
shot to be out of focus and when you do
get a shot in focus they lack detail and
just aren't as sharp as they could be if
the phone had OAS on the flip side
daytime shots do turn out quite good
there's a lot more detail color
reproduction is nice and accurate and
there's just enough saturation to make
the images pop shadows and highlights
are handled surprisingly well leading to
overall good dynamic range
overall the camera is a step in the
right direction for Motorola and the
results are pretty good in most
situations but there's still room for
improvement my favorite part about any
phone from Motorola is the software
experience because of how close it is to
stock Android it's as close to pure
Android as you're going to get outside
of using a pixel or a oneplus bone the
z2 force is running Android 7.1.1 and
comes with Motorola's entire suite of
features like the wrist twist to launch
the camera double chop for the
flashlight and the ever so useful
battery friendly notifications with the
Moto display the only thing you'll run
into with the software is all the
carrier bloatware which will vary from
carrier to carrier and as of right now
Motorola is not selling an unlocked
version if you were looking to avoid
carrier bloat the z2 force was announced
as a starting price of $800 but that has
already dropped to 720 bucks if you get
it directly from Motorola that's a
little bit cheaper than carrier prices
and for a limited time you can get last
year's modal mod projector included for
free but is this phone worth its price
tag there's no doubt that the z2 force
checks a lot of the right boxes for a
flagship phone and the modal mods are
just as awesome as ever but there's just
one too many shortcomings and
compromises that prevents it from being
an even better phone there's still no
headphone jack but for some reason the
more mid-range the tube play has one
it's not water-resistant like most
flagships and the phone's battery was
sacrificed in favor of a thinner design
it's clear that Motorola wants to
compete with the best of the best but if
you're going to do that you need to
deliver a great smartphone and the motor
z2 force is a good phone but it isn't
great as always thank you guys so much
