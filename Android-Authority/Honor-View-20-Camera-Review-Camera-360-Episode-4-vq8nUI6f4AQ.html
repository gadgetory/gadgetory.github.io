Authority and welcome back to another
episode of camera 360 on this show we
attempt to break down a smartphone
camera in about three minutes time we're
gonna give you the gist of everything
that you need to know while keeping
everything short and sweet we're gonna
talk about the camera app its features
and of course the image quality
today's smartphone is the honor view 20
so let's go ahead and dive right in
alright so as a quick refresher let's go
over the camera specs the honor view
Tony has a 48 megapixel primary rear
sensor that's paired with a 3d
time-of-flight sensor the front facing
shooter is 25 megapixels and has an
aperture of f2
now that we've gotten that out of the
way let's take a look at the camera app
and see what it has to offer
if you've used any other recent honor or
huawei device you'll know exactly what
to expect here
the camera app is very straight forward
which makes it super simple and easy to
get around the shutter button is dead
center along the bottom and is flanked
by a camera rotation and image preview
button on either side switching between
the different modes such as portrait
photo video night mode or AR lens can be
done by simply swiping across the
viewfinder like you can on most other
smartphone camera apps there's also a
more section for many other specialized
features including a manual pro mode
slow motion panorama light painting HDR
and more like most smartphone cameras
the honor of u-20 performs very well in
bright conditions images are very well
balanced with good detail in the shadows
and pretty uniform exposure across the
board photos are sometimes a tad on the
underexposed side but nothing too major
colors overall are punchy but not
oversaturated and skies have a nice
bright blue to them to make the images
really pop the view 20 does an excellent
job of enhancing the image without
making the colors look unnatural or fake
the level of detail that the view 20 is
able to capture is also quite sharp
there's no smudging or clarity loss when
you take a closer look in this example
if you zoom in on the wood you can still
see the texture between the
cracks this next image here there's no
motion blur from the movement of the
airplane and the plane itself retains a
lot of its own detail there's a lot
going on in this image here but you can
still easily zoom in and make out plenty
of detail including being able to still
read these small price tags on the items
in terms of HDR the view Tonys HDR
processing is not very aggressive but
that isn't necessarily a bad thing
the view 20 has good dynamic range
already that it doesn't need much help
and it's more natural HDR image
processing means photos don't look over
processed you still get plenty of detail
in shadowy areas as you can see in this
image here and you can still see a lot
of the texture that's on this wooden
Wells Fargo box the honor 320 is an
equally fantastic shooter in low light
especially if you lean on its built in
night mode which works incredibly well
with night mode enabled you're gonna be
able to get shots that have more detail
better exposure and a heck of a lot less
noise despite some of these shots being
taken in extremely dark conditions the
results were very clean and impressively
sharp the front-facing camera is great
in terms of its resolution giving you
plenty of room to zoom crop and reframe
your images but these selfies don't
necessarily go above and beyond you get
nice exposure and good color but details
aren't super sharp due to the skin
softening it isn't super aggressive and
there are some worst offenders out there
but it is noticeable as for video the
view 20 doesn't do much to blow you away
frame rate is capped at 30fps when
you're shooting at 1080p or 4k which
means you won't be able to slow the
footage down without it getting choppy
but it does do well in terms of image
stabilization even when shooting at 4k
it's also pretty good at making colors
pop and does fairly well with balancing
exposure although it can be a little
spotty at times overall we gave the
honor view xx a score of 8.4 8 out of 10
if you want to find out why make sure to
check out the written version linked in
the description below which covers the
camera much more in depth and provides a
more detailed breakdown of the overall
score if you want to see the full
resolution images for yourself we'll
also have that link below as well
all thanks for watching and we'll see
you guys in the next episode of camera
