watching the Android Authority channel
on YouTube Android runs on mobile
smartphones and is also quite popular on
tablet you've heard it power netbooks
media players smart TVs and watches -
today we're going to see this mobile OS
in action powering another common
electronic device
the point-and-shoot camera specifically
the Samsung Galaxy camera EKG c100 at
the outset this is a camera that you can
play Angry Birds on it is a camera that
you can use to post to Facebook Twitter
or Instagram
not many point-and-shoot cameras allow
you to do those it is practically a
thick Samsung Android smartphone with a
16 megapixel camera but without the
ability for phone calls the camera is
portable enough but it's not something
you'd like to bulge out of your pocket
it is heavy - about three times as heavy
as the galaxy s2 it is heavier than many
compact cameras like these ones here but
it is definitely not as bulky or as
heavy as a DSLR such as this one the
overall design is elegant and stylish
with its all-white front and sides this
bluish black trimming here the textured
rubber grip here and the phone light
touch panel at the back it looks simple
yet has a stylish appeal personally I'd
prefer black gray silver or even deep
blue or deep bread for a camera but for
those who prefer flashy and bright
colors there are this white variant and
two other color variant orange and pink
the Galaxy camera has everything that
you'd ever need an appointment shoot
camera and more here you have an optical
zoom lens an auto focus assist lamp
flash which you can open with this
button the zoom lever doubling has
volume rocker the shutter button power
button a microUSB port headphone jack
strap mount and tripod socket on the
underside the battery compartment is
right here along with slots for a micro
SIM card and micro HDMI cable this one's
for micro SD card expansion up to 64
gigabytes at the back of the camera it's
all touch-panel no physical buttons here
like these on my other
point-and-shoot camera interestingly
this back panel looks like the front of
the Samsung Galaxy s2 without its
buttons even their sizes are similar the
rounded corners to the bezel on this
side is thicker to prevent accidental
screen touches by the right hand though
if I hold it like this the base of my
thumb easily touches the Menu button
this touchscreen display has a diagonal
of 4.8 inches and uses HD Super Clear
LCD technology protected by Corning
Gorilla Glass 2 as you can see here the
display is very sharp and clear colors
appear less saturated and more realistic
thanks to the LCD screen and it's 1280
by 720 pixel resolution for a quick
comparison here's the HD Super AMOLED
display on the samsung galaxy s3 the
colors are vibrant and rather saturated
it would be awesome to play HD games on
a display this nice can you yes you can
this camera uses the same processing
hardware as a samsung galaxy s3 Samsung
Exynos for 412 chipset quad-core cortex
a9 CPU at 1.4 gigahertz mali-400 MP GPU
one gigabyte of RAM and eight gigabytes
of internal storage although only half
of it is usable storage it's a very
smooth and fluid experience transitions
and animations are very buttery this is
Android 4.1.1 jelly bean and Samsung
TouchWiz 5 in action here navigation
shows no noticeable lag not even when
zooming in or out of photos or webpages
let's now take a look at the Samsung
Galaxy cameras main attraction the
camera hardware specs are practically
borrowed although in a slightly improved
version from the Samsung wb800f camera
both cameras have 16 megapixels of
effective pixels 1 over 2.3 inches
backside illuminated CMOS sensor optical
zooming capacity up to 21 times maximum
of 3200 ISO sensitivity 1080p full HD
resolution video recording maximum
shutter speed of 1 over 2000 and nearly
the same focal length the galaxy camera
works best under bright lighting
captured photos and videos are clean
clear and sharp the colors are almost
true to life
autofocus however is not as snappy as I
expected it takes a few seconds for it
to autofocus their shutter lag of about
two seconds - after clicking the shutter
in low-light conditions there's the
xenon flash which actually amazed me
it emits very bright light and spreads
it evenly resulting in better and
brighter images as for video the camera
can capture 1080p full HD videos without
choking it can also capture in slow
motion at maximum rate of 120 frames per
second another amazing feature on this
camera is its optical zoom capable of
magnification up to 21 times this sample
footage was taken from our office
entrance the water tanks are on the roof
of a three-story building about 70
meters away you can operate the camera
in three different modes according to
your desired level of photography
expertise
there's auto mode which allows you to
not worry much about various settings so
you can just focus on pressing that
shutter button there's also smart mode
which provides predefined camera
settings for various environments and
occasions and for those who want to be
in full control
there's the expert mode which lets you
manually set the ISO exposure value
aperture and shutter speed the three
operation modes are great because it
makes the camera easy and quick to use
while providing flexibility at the same
time as for software everything that you
get to enjoy in any stock Android 4.1
jelly bean phone you also get to enjoy
on the galaxy camera the user interface
is essentially similar to that on the
galaxy note 2 or the galaxy s3 one
striking difference is that the dock bar
only allows two shortcuts one for the
camera and the other for the app drawer
the Galaxy camera also comes with photo
editing and sharing apps such as paper
artists for applying photo filters and
effects on your photos photo wizard for
basic photo editing
Instagram for sprucing up your photos
before sharing them to your social
network video editor for making mini
movies from your video clips group cast
for sharing your files to multiple
devices and all share play for cloud
storage and HD media streaming if
particular note is the 50 gigabytes of
free cloud storage courtesy of Dropbox
how many hours of photography fun can
you enjoy on this camera just enough I'd
say the camera uses a lithium-ion
battery with capacity of 1650 mAh this
can easily last up to 280 hours on
standby while connected to 3G but I'd
like to actually use my camera rather
than always place it on standby we
subjected the camera to heavy use one
hour of non-stop 1080p video recording
and another hour of non-stop photo
stamping two hours after we had only 11%
of power left
I suppose that with casual or moderate
use you can probably get three to four
hours of battery power over all the
Samsung Galaxy camera EKG c100 is a
fascinating Android device it is a
powerful point-and-shoot camera that
produces photos and videos with great
quality more than that you can easily
share those captured moments to your
friends and family or to the world at
large without having to use a computer
Samsung wasn't lying about this camera
shoot while share now tagline its price
tag of about 650 US dollars also made me
go WOW but if that price range doesn't
make you blink I highly recommend this
camera what do you think of Samsung's
newest camera share your thoughts in the
