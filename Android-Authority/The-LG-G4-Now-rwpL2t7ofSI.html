falling behind in the competition the g4
is surely an example that they haven't
lost their touch but that was then and
this is the LG g4 now with Mobile World
Congress just around the corner we also
have the LG g5 just around the corner
and with that we wanted to bring you a
look back at the LG g4 after all we've
had this phone for a little bit over a
year now the LG g4 at the time of its
release was boasting certain features
that other flagships just weren't
providing and that's of course removable
battery and expandable storage and it
was going to do so in some style after
all we have this curved device due to a
curved slightly curved to display that
was adopted from the G flex line and of
course you have the back button layout
that originated from the LG g2 and there
was some extra style injected into this
phone as the backings some of them
rather were made of vegetable tanned
leather but unfortunately for me I still
had to just have this gray plastic
backing but overall the design aesthetic
has really paid dividends because the
slightly curved device itself rests so
nicely in the hand that it's one of the
most comfortable phones to use and even
then it looks just that little bit
different from a lot pretty much every
other Android phone out there that
doesn't have this kind of aesthetic but
there is one little issue when it comes
to the sides and the grip because the
slightly curved sides and also the very
thin profile of the phone make it so
that this phone is actually a little bit
tough to actually pinch and grip and I
thought of one main situation where that
actually became a problem now I did want
to harp on the design aspect just a
little bit more because with the LG g5
if the rumors are to be confirmed when
the g5 comes out we might actually see
the back button layout go away and also
the curved phone itself
now the g5 might actually have a
radically different design language this
year and honestly that might be a bit of
a shame because I personally really like
the g4s design language because it makes
it just that little bit different from
every other phone out there without
actually needing to try all that hard
not to mention how comfortable it is to
use even in one hand getting underneath
the surface however we get everything
that a flagship by LG should be a quad
HD display IPS
play has pretty much the coloration that
you would expect and the good brightness
in broad daylight and it continues the
tradition that was started by the g3 the
Snapdragon 808 is what powers everything
and yes that is a slight step down from
more powerful devices that use the
Snapdragon 810 or anything comparable
but overall I've been able to have a
really good time throughout my usage of
the g4 getting everything done from GPS
navigation to playing music YouTube even
Netflix and doing all my messaging and
my emails on the g4 has been nothing
short of reliable the only time that it
actually had some slowdown was in gaming
and in this case I'm using Star Wars
Galaxies of Heroes as my example and you
can already see that there is some
slowdown not only in the menus but in
the gameplay itself which has that
little bit of stutter going along but of
course hardware is the main draw the
main claim to fame for the g4 after all
it has the replaceable battery and the
expandable storage but I have to make
one little confession I actually have
not used a replaceable battery since the
Galaxy Nexus and that was quite a bit a
while ago after that expandable storage
is not something that I feel like I have
to use until I actually run out of space
on the device and the 32 gigabytes that
I had in the LG g4 were more than enough
for me in terms of actually getting
everything that I need done as far as
battery life goes it is still kind of
par for the course to have one full
day's worth of battery life in my case I
had about three and a half hours on
average of screen on time but I was able
to make it to the very end of the day
the 16 megapixel F 1.8 aperture camera
proved to be pretty reliable and it
comes with laser autofocus so it is able
to pinpoint exactly where the focus
should be and when using the simple mode
I actually found this to be the most fun
you just have to tap on the screen in
order to get the shot off and most of
the time the shot is actually pretty
good but when it is not quite where you
want it to be that's when the manual
mode came into play now 2015 was the
year of the manual mode and the LG g4
showed us what it could be like with
real minut details even the Kelvin
readings inside of the white balance
were available so if the auto mode was
unable to get the shot that I wanted I
was able to tweak it inside of the
manual mode my only qualm with it
however is that your while using a
touchscreen in order to change all the
settings and that can be a little bit
cumbersome
not to mention take up some of the time
if you actually need to get a shot off
quick but that's pretty much what you
expect out of a camera like this overall
however picture quality has been really
good all the photos are nice and
detailed even if the coloration could
use that little bit extra punch that I'm
used to from other phones and finally in
software you probably saw already in the
earlier clip that I put the Google now
launcher on this phone now that might
not come as much of a surprise because
LG's GUI unfortunately just didn't have
that many useful features and have quite
a few too many of them that I never did
use for example the smart widget that
went on the home screen which pretty
much just reminded me to put on a jacket
when it was raining outside there's also
the smart cleaner which I only used
maybe once or twice and of course the
multitasking capabilities like the
qslide which thankfully I've been able
to hide in the notification drop-down
even though I already put Google now
launcher on here so overall the
experience of the LG g4 has been very
good this is still a reliable device to
have and if you are able to leverage the
replaceable batteries and expandable
storage you could very well go the
distance that said the design aspect is
what I enjoy the most about this phone
and I really hope that even if in the g5
we don't necessarily see the curved
display or the back buttons that much
anymore that we still get to see it in
other parts of LG's lineup and hopefully
the g5 will actually give us some real
compelling features moving forward so
that the g4 can be a very very nice and
positive memory back so as always keep
it tuned to android authority and you
can see the full review of the LG g4 the
one that I did a little while back here
at the Android Authority YouTube channel
and if you head on over to Android or
decom you'll see all of the coverage of
the g5 and everything from MWC 2016
after that make sure you watch even more
content from my brothers and sister and
Android and you can download the Android
or the application on your Android
device so you can get even better access
to all of the stuff that we put out for
you including the Android or a podcast
once you're done with all of that drop
us some likes and videos and subscribe
to the channel if you haven't already
and then once you're done with all that
head on over to Android re calm because
we are your source for all things
