a Chevy event looking in new Chevy tech
innovations i'm here with phil abram and
they have a big role of for android
autos what are we looking at here today
sir what we're looking at today is
introduction by Chevrolet on what we're
doing with innovation and we our tagline
is find new roads which means leading in
innovating in areas that are relevant to
our customers and so one of those areas
obviously is Android auto and we're
announcing that we're putting that in
over 14 models this year on a global
basis so other car companies are
introducing on one model there are two
companies the power of Chevrolet is its
ability to take and deploy technology on
a grand scale for everybody from a
thirteen thousand dollar vehicle up two
hundred thousand dollar Corvette they're
both going to have Android auto built
into them this year and in terms of
market adoption do you think consumers
obviously want these features but how
quickly do you think we're going to see
these actually available for sale well
the first Corvette with this capability
is rolling off the assembly line this
week and so we're going to be rolling
this out on cars now through the
remainder of the summer as our new model
years are introduced so the adoptions
now I mean the introduction is now we
we're not talking about something that's
a year out or two years out of it it's
it's happening now in now cool and does
it come standard or is it sort of a pack
this is with with the right trim if it
has a 7-inch 18 inch screen in it it was
going to have Android auto wonderful
stuff cool well I mean I guess it's
pretty self-explanatory in terms of the
safety aspect of it and working with
regulators is that something Google's
handle is that something you work with
well actually we've collaborated a lot
with Google on the drive distraction
elements both of us has worked with
knits about it and actually if you get
in and I encourage you to get in one of
these cars to loot liya that the
experience is really draw moisture iffen
ya all right it defaults to a voice
interface because it's in a car and it's
not your Android's phone screen scraped
into the car it's a different experience
it's one that's going to be familiar to
use an Android user but relevant and
contextually appropriate for a car
driving so that
it's two seconds plants that's you know
so make sure anything you can do can do
with less than two seconds eyes off road
most with your hands on the wheels using
the voice commands the microphones in
the vehicle to voice interact and do
your searches and things that need
yourself is very much a car experience
that's good and in terms of about the
OnStar 4G LTE what are we looking at for
a 5 gigabyte I mean Netflix and our
netflix is about a gig and a half yeah
kids are going to go through that well
we have a variety of plans for people
that are very we're very competitive
with what the market rates are for that
and if you answer subscriber you can get
a gig a month for starting at fifteen
dollars very good and then we have a
three gig in of live gig plan that are
above that a personal question now sure
if you could choose carplay or android
auto which one do you think is a
superior interface I'd looked at what's
in my pocket and that's the superior
interface because it's going to be it's
a it's what's relevant to that customer
a clean I don't I don't get to choose
that's not my choice that's why we have
both in all of our vehicles I the winner
is what the customer wants I hear you on
that well I mean globally we're looking
at around eighty percent market share
for Android and so moving bringing
Android auto its global right and
actually we're going to have that the
car is equipped in markets before Google
actually goes to that market because the
cars are a little bit longer lead and
then when google says yeah we're going
to turn it on in a particular market car
already in the market will be ready to
go android auto and China that's a
different question yeah we'll talk about
the net-net next yes you're gonna have
to talk to somebody other than me about
that one alright real pleasure to talk
with you sir you got it thanks darcel a
