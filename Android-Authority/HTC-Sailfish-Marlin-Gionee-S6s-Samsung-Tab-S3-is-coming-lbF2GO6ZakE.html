amania my goodness the dams gonna break
let's start off with two HTC Nexus
phones that just passed the FCC a
blurred close-up image claiming to be
that of the 2016 HTC Nexus featuring a
glass and fingerprint sensor on the rear
was posted by an anonymous Twitter
account now more new images of the
device have surfaced online courtesy of
Android police confirming its previously
leaked metal and glass design suggesting
that it could be the smaller of the two
devices the Sailfish slated to launch
this year the image of the purported
2016 Nexus that appeared on Twitter
matched its previous descriptions and
mock-ups showing the device with a glass
and metal body and a rear fingerprint
sensor in the image a camera and flash
were visible on the top left-hand corner
along with a headphone port right at the
top edge of the handset now when we come
to the FCC listings they don't contain
much in the way of hardware
specifications but we do know that the
phones will come sporting LTE bands
along with Wi-Fi 802.11 band Bluetooth
le and NFC capabilities previous rumors
suggest that Marlin will be the larger
handset with a 5.5 inch qHD display a
Snapdragon 820 4 gigabytes of RAM a 13
and eight megapixel cameras combination
and sailfish is expected to be the
smaller handset with a 5.2 inch 1080p
display and the same processing package
it seems that the two phones will have a
much closer specifications than last
year's Nexus 5x and 6p now there is no
official word yet on when the 2016 Nexus
devices will arrive but rumors point to
a possible October 4th launch now let's
talk gionee Joanie teases its s6 s's
selfie centric smartphone ahead of the
August 22nd launch will all use selfie
aficionados in my beloved India get
ready to change your definition of a
premium selfie Chinese tech giant Gianni
has just posted a teaser image on its
official Twitter account showing off its
upcoming s6
asses smartphone which claims will quote
redefine what a premium selfie is now
not a whole lot is known about this
phone though we can confirm that it will
feature a front-facing LED flash as
suggested by the invite for the launch
event other than that the S 6s is
expected to share the same design and
specifications with the s6 Pro which
comes with a mid-range mediatek helio
p10 chipset 4 gigabytes ram and 64
gigabytes of expandable storage the SX
pro packs a 13 megapixel primary camera
and an 8 megapixel front-facing camera
with a 3130 milliamp hour battery it's
also rumoured to support a full metal
body and a fingerprint scanner next up
is news that Samsung confirmed the
Galaxy Tab s3 debut for the September
last month we caught wind that the tab
s3 was set for an ephah 2016
announcement but that was just a rumor
now it's official directly from
Samsung's website although they did post
it on the columbian website now we don't
know a whole lot about this tablet other
than the fact that it will be launched
in September Samsung is being very
cryptic and will only say that quote it
will have similar qualities to its
predecessor the Galaxy Tab s2 well duh
hey guys Jace here I am back from
vacation the last few shows you've seen
all had to be recorded a couple weeks in
advance but I am back I hope you're all
doing well follow me on Twitter I'll be
sure to watch what's going on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
