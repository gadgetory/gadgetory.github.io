is clay humor coming at you from the
number one website for all things
android android authority calm now i
know a lot of you guys have been itching
for more case reviews for the samsung
galaxy s3 so we're here to deliver okay
so we've got four more cases coming at
you today we'll start off by just
introducing all of them this one
actually came from samsung with one of
the devices i'm going to be using it on
the white model this is this replacement
backing with a little off flip cover
that you can put over the front if
you're not using the device we've got a
cruiser light case with a nice little
Andy on the back got two unbranded cases
but will have their names and links in
the description this one's got to stand
and then here's a little flip pouch
holster somewhat leather and it's pretty
cool so let's get into reviewing these
cases of course as always we're going to
be looking for ease of button
accessibility protection and of course
physique so let's start off with our
white model galaxy s3 this is our sprint
version I'm just going to take the
backing off of this one and apply the
new backing so we'll just peel this off
awesome that the galaxy s3's all have
interchangeable backings and will simply
pop this one on goes on just like the
other backings as you can see nice tight
fit nice along the edges and then we
cannot flip the cover closed just like
that so it's pretty cool the cover does
tend to kind of sit a little bit off the
body like that but that's alright we've
got nice protection we have access to
our speaker up here can easily hit our
power button and then when this is
folded open we can have access to our
volume buttons now I'm a little worried
about how strong this might be if you
just pull on this a little but it is
nice and it's a you know it's a
replacement backing so if you want to
keep the nice physique of your uncased
galaxy s3 with a nice white backing but
still have protection for your screen I
suggest checking this one out go ahead
and take this one off reapply our
backing and try some other cases now of
course you can put this on the pebble
blue and you'll have a blue and white
version which you know might appeal to
some but you know that's not really what
we're going for go to pop the backing on
this again next we'll try out our white
stand case here as you can see this is
somewhat of a rigid material that kind
of just pops back into place and then
you can bend it out for a nice standout
utility but we'll slide this one on our
white galaxy s3 first off you can see it
fits nice it does provide a raised edge
case the galaxy s3 false face down and
we do have a raised edge here on the
back for the stand we have all our
cutouts perfect cut out for our volume
or mikes and our micro USB power buttons
are pretty easy to hit on this one and
same with the volume and then we can
just grab this little portion pull it
out whoop and we have a stand for a
galaxy s3 and we can set it up this way
as well for watching media or a nice
desk clock application will try this one
out on our pebble blue version as well
just to show you what it would look like
in case you own the pebble blue version
pop it on here and i'll leave the stand
out so the pebble blue does still look
nice with a white case on there and we
can see our galaxy s3 if we're really
looking right there again our stand both
ways and then we can retract the stand
and have a nice regular case with some
added protection in the back in case it
were to fall so anyways we'll go on to
our next one this here is our leather
pouch case it's kind of woven like uh
some carbon fiber on there of course we
have our cutouts we have some leather on
the inside this one's going to provide
some nice protection we'll put our
pebble blue in there just because it
matches a little better and we can flip
the top latch it on we've got our LED
speaker and camera access our power
buttons and volume buttons are uncovered
so we have ease of access pressing those
we have access to our 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack our micro USB is covered
on the bottom but that could be a
benefit for some just so dust and bear
doesn't get in there flip this open and
unlike some of the previous cases we've
reviewed this does just hurry up and fit
nicely right there it's not a hindering
your mobility or your use of the galaxy
s3 by bending and not really fitting on
there nicely
is back to back it's nice and flat and
then we can use our galaxy s3 show you
how this looks on the white case as well
white phone excuse me here we go it's on
a white phone looks nice on there of
course the cutouts are all the same and
it does provide some protection of
course if it were to fall face down more
back down so we'll take this one off on
a failed to previously mention all these
cases are very easy to take off and put
on all right so last up we've got our
cruzerlite case for the galaxy s3 this
one's one of our most popular brands
that one seems to like the cruiser light
I know I do it's got our nice and you
design on the back and it isn't in green
color so I don't know how many people
will take to the fact that it's green on
white or green on blue but we'll pop
down on a white one first just to show
it fits on nicely you can see that it's
kind of having a little bit of trouble
trouble getting over this edge but it
still fits nice and the cutouts aren't
necessarily in the correct place as you
can see the little speaker is someone in
the upper left and so so is the LED and
then the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
is a little bit to the left as well we
do have some air bubbles in there too
but it's still a really nice case it's
going to protect a facedown damage and
everything has a nice access to our
power buttons and our volume buttons
micro USB and the microphones as well
and it looks pretty cool especially a
little android on the back and I love
that next we'll pop our pebble blue in
there so it looks a little better with
the green ma SE just because they're
both darker colors and this has less air
bubbles in the back it also seems to 50
cutouts just a little bit better as well
now keep in mind guys I have a zagg
invisible shield installed on one of my
other galaxy s3's and when I pop this
case on it sort of lifts the corners of
the of the invisible shield so be aware
of that you guys you know I know it's a
hefty investment to get that invisible
shield and it's a shame that a lot of
these manufacturers are making their
case is compatible but hey they all want
your competition they'll want your money
and you got to just choose one anyways
you can install this nicely with the
zagg invisible shield and it does look
fine on both of the galaxy s3's so that
was our four cases you guys go ahead and
pick one up if you're looking for
protection for your samsung galaxy s3
also
sure to check out our other case reviews
that we got two other videos regarding
cases for the galaxy s3 and stay tuned
for further videos regarding everything
android right here on android authority
