by Toyota hey it's josh regard from
Angela 30 what's going on everybody it
is the final day of CES 2014 and as you
can see behind us everyone is leaving we
are here right under the grand lobby
sign of international CES as you can see
right there and everyone's trying to
kind of go around us we're kind of
create a little set here our guy Derek
is holding the light up above his head
and actually as CES goes along a lot of
stuff happens and it gets really tiring
and actually sometimes sort of your
production and your equipment can kind
of become a little bit of collateral
damage as you can see we're using the
lapel mic here because it's one of the
few audio sources we have that still
reliable we don't drop just phones but
we're here I'm you know with our
obviously it's me and Darcy lack of a
over here and we have been at CES 2014
for the past week we've been in Las
Vegas for 47 days I'm gonna be here for
a couple more days ah we do have recap
videos ready for you including the one
that you're watching right now but in
this final one we're gonna talk about
CES 2014 and what we thought about it so
Darcy want you to take it off what are
some of the things that what were the
highlights of the show for you outside I
mean walking around CES is amazing the
amount of investment they put into all
the incredible displays sensory overload
you're really really like in a candy
store if you love anything remotely
technical mm-hmm and so this year I
think we were looking at for k-8 k they
obviously increasing the color spectrum
curb displays are huge yeah wearable
tech human tech you know tech that's
designed to augment life and make it
more bad dog meditation yes that's
definitely the one wearable tech has a
very big presence here at 2014 CES 2014
and we looked at a lot of devices mostly
the main ones i we know that some of you
are gonna say there's a lot of
accessories out that we probably didn't
cover but that's the thing about ces
there's just so much to cover that you
can't possibly get through all of it oh
we had an interview with the great
tricia from SourceFed and she said we
probably only get about forty percent of
everything that's here I'd say ten even
yeah ten yeah and we have an Android
focus obviously you button I would say
my highlights are definitely you know
all the android stuff that was here even
though we didn't have any super new
announcements happening at CES we did
get improvements to what is already
great about android
and that is valuable in and of itself we
had the tab pro line of tablets for
samsung we also had some great cheap
phones that are coming out and it became
a great it became a it became a big
topic for us here because we awarded
seuss it our best android phone award
because of their affordable and really
great zenfone lion you're really
incredible specs incredible device is
that sub 200 all our price points yeah I
mean we're really seeing the beginning
of a whole new generation of technology
that's not only really affordable but
actually really awesome too we saw we
actually met a lot of people here at the
show who were wearing we're like fitness
tracking device it's pretty cool last
time augmented stuff exactly it is it is
definitely becoming the future whether
or not it's going to become absolutely
ubiquitous is still something that we're
debating on personally me I do love my
wearable tech like my pebble right here
coupled with these LG tone headphones
that I have I I called I called somebody
earlier without even having to touch my
phone I just want me to move it put on
the earphone and started talking so the
applications are what we have to look at
and yes wearable tech is probably what
I'm looking forward to the most when it
comes to accessories they could do a lot
of things and maybe not do them you know
perfectly more they could focus on one
specific function or one specific type
of let's say genre function and if they
do it really well that's always a great
that's always great news for us I think
really like where we get where we're
going is we're not actually gonna see
technology probably within the next 20
years 30 years it's just gonna be simple
cameras in our glasses nice heads-up
displays even perhaps contact lenses you
know with the heads-up display that we
can read on a ring that has notification
of vibrates that mountain make
automotive enhancements as well I mean
it's it's amazing technology is really
permeating it's all of our lives and we
get to see it at a place like CES and
this is really the intersection of the
minds of consumers and producers and
technology and it's actually really
great so you know coming to you live
