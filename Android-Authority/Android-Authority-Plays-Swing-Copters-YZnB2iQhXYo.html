spiritual sequel to flappy birds from
Gears and naturally I told the YouTube
guys that we were going to do in a place
of it and I think only Joe was the one
who kind of took up the challenge so
Josh burger hit up my inbox the other
day and said hey Joe
let's do an Android authority plays with
swing copters I said hey Josh you know I
gotta be honest with you bud I'd rather
drink paint but you know what fine
whatever well I did hear basically the
collective groans coming from my
hangouts with all of the guys there and
it looks like Joe and I are gonna be the
ones that are going to try and conquer
this game okay so let's let's play this
stupid game
get ready
oh okay this is really stupid
let's do this now I have this strategy
where I use two thumbs of course all
corresponding to where I want the little
guys to go now one of the worst parts
about this game is actually the fact
that when you want to replay it you
gotta wait for the little guy
you have to tap first onto the screen
and then you gotta wait for the little
guy to get himself revved up and it's
it's it's it's that little bit of
anticipation that really gets to you oh
here the background changes that's cute
boo
dad yeah I got one I got one
what kind of deprived ass game are you
playing or you were happy to get a score
of one and then those mallets those
freaking mallets on the south see like
that so the thing about flappy birds was
there really wasn't there really weren't
any moving parts when it came to the
scenery well in this case there are and
a lot of the times they're just going to
screw you over there's there's no
there's no doubt about it the three
before my I didn't hit anything
what kind of pixel detection is that oh
I have to do this for five minutes I
told Joe just do five minutes five
minutes of this game oh but I'm sure oh
boy I gotta stop talking for a second
but I'm sure even though I don't want to
do this for five minutes I got four you
know that's oh come on
Oh got tapped pretty fast just to get
past everything those mallets are always
in your face I really hope Josh does bad
I hope Josh does terrible at this game
so that way he doesn't ask me to play
anymore dot gears games from from this
hahaha double-digit jizz yes most of the
time you're just trying to beat yourself
like that's that's the point of
excruciating ly hard games like this
it's like you just want to beat the last
score you did or else do you feel like a
worthless piece of trash come on come on
come on ya freakin and the worst part is
the moment you get past where you were
last you end up dying right away this
game is so slow that you know that's
that's the number one reason I don't
like it it's not like flappy bird we're
like as soon as you fail you can start
again it's like you know look at your
lickety-split you have to sit there and
wait for the dude's dunce cap to start
spinning before you can actually do
anything else I remember when I was
first playing this game just just for a
little bit just to try to get what two
or five in the case that I got back then
that sound of him dying was like the
worst thing ever
hmm okay so things I would rather be
doing than playing swing copters I would
rather be drinking paint I would rather
be drinking Drano I would rather be
kissing a toilet seat I would rather be
working I would rather be not working I
would rather be let's see here I would
rather be sick with the flu
oh those those mallets don't even make
any sense to have platforms with things
on the end that's swing back and forth
what is this well what construction firm
allowed this to happen I would rather be
out in the middle of the night drunk I
would rather be drinking I think it's
even sadder that I figured out how to
play this game I'm actually pretty good
at it now it's all awesome probably the
worst thing about this game in terms of
my experience was the fact that when I
put it on my girlfriend's phone when she
hit two that was probably the happiest
I've ever seen her that's how horrible
this game can be not even gonna talk not
even gonna talk
ah 15 Oh 16 best I can do
well I guess the key to this game is
just short clicks just try to keep it as
straight as possible
and hey Josh I really hope I really
really hope really really really really
really hope that the the next fad game
that we play you do why do a quiz up was
awesome we you know what quiz up was
awesome this was not awesome
so Josh you are one for two on these
stay tuned for more and tell us what
games you might want us to play
generally we tried to keep them to new
or trendy games but if we see one that
we really enjoy maybe we'll be able to
get the guys to get in on it as well so
until then keep it tuned to Android
authority check out another video by Joe
