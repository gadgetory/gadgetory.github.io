you're automatically narrowing down your
choices one of the new kids on the block
in the dual sim world is the Sony Xperia
e dual how does it hold up find out in
our review hey everybody I'm Chris book
while everybody's going nuts for Sony's
new high-end phones they're quietly
releasing low-end phones on the side as
well like the recently released Xperia e
dual now it's got dual Sims and a pretty
low price but it's also got some pretty
low-end specs
how low let's find out the Sony Xperia
dual runs a 1 gigahertz single core
Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and has a
3.5 inch hvga display 512 Meg's of RAM
and four gigs of internal storage
expandable via the microSD slot it
features a 3.2 megapixel rear facing
camera and is powered by a 1500 milliamp
hour battery the Xperia e dual has a
classy look that is more inline with
older Xperia devices than the new
high-end models everybody's talking
about the angular design glossy finish
and color changing illumination bar all
add up to a phone that has an
interesting look the phone feels pretty
solid if a little weighty and has a
short chunky look all the hardware
buttons which are the volume power and
dedicated camera buttons are located on
the right side while the headphone jack
is on top and the microUSB port is on
the left side the display is definitely
the lowest quality feature of the Xperia
e dual
even at three and a half inches the 480
by 320 resolution and pixel density of
165 PPI just doesn't look nice
pixelation is apparent in a lot of
places and leaves text a little
difficult to read video and images fare
better but you're probably not going to
be doing a lot of reading or watching on
this phone
performance isn't super but is better
than you might expect there is
occasionally a little stuttering when
scrolling through home screens or the
app drawer but absalon's fairly quickly
and to to benchmarks averaged a score of
around 5500 an epic Citadel averaged 29
fps but keep in mind it wasn't pushing
to any pixels unlike the standard Xperia
e which runs jellybean the dual runs Ice
Cream Sandwich a jellybean update could
be on the way but considering I could
have shipped with it I wouldn't hold my
breath for an update
sony has skinned the interface with a
Thema below overlay which you may or may
not like besides the usual Google Apps
Sony has included a few other apps like
Walkman it's music player other apps
include office suite 6 &amp;amp; Track ID the
3.2 megapixel camera isn't very
impressive even in broad daylight photos
I took on the default settings ended up
looking fairly dark there was noticeable
artifacting and visual noise present as
well no front facing cameras included
video was even worse with the resolution
topping out at VGA resolution or 640 by
480 it's alright for a quick clip but
the video won't look great on a computer
while the battery capacity is only 1500
milliamp hours battery life wasn't bad
it's possible to run it down fairly
quickly but during testing I got over 6
hours of heavy use normal use should
allow the Xperia e dual to last a full
day without a charge the battery is
removable so you can replace the battery
or carry an extra if you need it
basically if you're looking for an
inexpensive dual SIM phone you'll be
hard-pressed to find a better deal than
the Sony Xperia e dual now if you don't
need dual Sims there are plenty of
better options of that price why don't
