information taking down notes and
keeping track of stuff but information
can suddenly vanish data can suddenly
become unusable records can suddenly
become scrambled that's why we keep
duplicate triplicate even quadruplicate
copies that's why we keep backups hi I'm
mark welcome to Android Authority many
years ago carbon paper was the vogue way
for creating backup copies of paper
documents backing up data digitally is
essentially similar in this video I'm
going to show you how to use an Android
app that works just like the carbon
paper of the yesteryears in fact it's
aptly named Carbon app sync and backup
in a nutshell Carbon app sync and backup
creates digital carbon copies of your
messages call logs device settings apps
app data and app settings with carbon
you can sync apps among different
devices backup directly from mobile
device to computer and even scheduled
backups it works on both rooted or non
rooted devices running Android 4.0 and
higher except according to the developer
Motorola devices and certain experience
in this guide I'll be demonstrating the
premium version of the app on an
unrooted nexus 4 carbon is a truly
helpful and useful app let me show you
how to enable and set up carbon before
starting download and install the app
from the Google Play Store unless your
phone is rooted you'll need to enable
and set it up so you can start using it
here's how to do it on your computer
download the Carbon desktop installer
and if needed install it there are
versions for Windows Linux and Mac on
your Android device and able USB
debugging this is usually found in
settings developer options then set the
USB connection mode to PTP instead of
MTP Carbon requires this the procedure
for switching between MTP and PTP may
vary from phone to phone on the nexus 4
for instance go to settings storage and
tap the menu button then toggle camera
mode or PTP then you also need to make
the Android debug bridge
or ADB recognize your device when it's
plugged into the PC this means that you
may need to install device drivers for
Windows or add you dev rules and Linux
now run carbon on your device connect
your non-rooted Android to your PC via
USB cable then run Carbon desktop
installer on your computer and follow
the prompts on your Android device
you'll get a confirmation on your
Android device saying that carbon has
been successfully enabled also if your
phone is non rooted you'll need to run
Carbon desktop installer every time you
reboot your phone now you're all set
first let's take a quick look at the
interface this is a very clean and
straightforward UI the main screen has
two tabs the backup tab and the restore
and sync tab on the backup tab you'll
see this pull up pane which has backup
options and settings this one's the
schedule button which will be useful to
you only if you have the paid version
now let me show you the basics of
backing up your apps and data using
carbon on the backup tab check off those
items that you want to backup on the
rooted device you'll also be able to
backup certain items such as Wi-Fi
settings if you want to backup
everything just pull up the bottom pane
and tap the select all button if you
want to save app data only check this
option here this will also create
smaller backup files as the apps
themselves won't be saved you can also
group your backup items just select the
items you want to include in the group
then type a name for the group here
grouped items can come in handy if you
just want to restore a subset of your
backups later
finally tap the backup button to start
backing up pick a location for your
backup files you can choose internal or
external storage which in my experience
is faster you can also choose cloud
storage such as Google Drive Dropbox or
box just log in to your cloud accounts
when prompted you should see progress
indicators when done Carbon confirms
that backing up has completed remember
that the more apps and files you select
the longer the backup process may take
you can also automate backups according
to a schedule so your backups
stay always up-to-date and fresh here's
how to do it go to the backup tab select
items that you want to backup decide
whether to backup only app data or to
include the apps themselves tap the
backup button from the pop up dialog
select scheduled backup you'll see the
scheduler dialog like this tap the time
to change the scheduled time for running
the task let's change this to 11 a.m.
check off each day of the week on which
you want the backup to run this task for
example will run every 11:00 in the
morning on Mondays Wednesdays and
Fridays if you want to use only a Wi-Fi
connection when backing up enable this
this other option causes carbon to run
the task only when your device is
charging down here are icons of the
items included in this scheduled backup
if you tap this rightmost icon you can
select the destination for the scheduled
backup tap ok to save the schedule there
you can view your list of scheduled
backups by going to the main screen then
tapping this clock icon tap on an item
to edit it or long tap to delete it now
you know how the backup I'll now show
you how to restore it's very easy to do
with a carbon app go to the restore and
sync tab tap on the location of your
backup files you should be able to see a
list of your saved groups and your
backed up items select which apps or AB
group you want to restore then tap the
restore button to begin the process you
should be able to see a confirmation at
the end to restore from the cloud your
device needs to be connected to the
Internet just connect to your cloud
storage service select items to be
restored and tap the restore button
again you'll get confirmation when the
restore is finished it's that easy apps
syncing I believe is one of the most
powerful features of the carbon app
through this feature you can sing apps
on two or more devices just as long as
carbon is installed and enabled on the
devices they are logged into the same
Google account and they are connected to
the same wireless network here's how the
sing apps and their settings and data
from one device to another either
receiving device launched carbon and
open the restore and sync tab you should
see all your linked devices under my
devices if not try tapping refresh
device list tap on the device name to
see the list of installed apps on that
device then select those that you want
to sync or restore from the other device
if you sync an app that doesn't exist on
your device yet it will be installed
straight from the other device after
data and settings will be synced to if
the app already exists on your device
only the settings and data will be
synced once you've made your selections
tap the restore button and watch carbon
do its magic you'll be notified once
restoration or syncing is done have
limited internal or external storage
space can't trust cloud storage services
with your data don't fret Carbon app
sync and backup let's see save backups
to your computer over a Wi-Fi connection
the Carbon feature to use is called PC
download neatly tucked away in the menu
here's how to use it tap the Menu button
on Carbon screen and select PC download
you'll see a screen similar to this if
this huge button is green and you see
your IP address it means you're good to
go if it's not green tap on the big
button to start the Carbon server on
your computer launch a web browser open
the IP address and port number provided
by Carbon server you'll see a web
interface similar to this these are the
apps installed on your device to backup
apps select the apps by clicking on them
you can also opt to backup only app data
by enabling this option tap this button
to begin your browser will download a
zip file containing the backed up files
save them to a convenient place on your
computer to restore from a backup zip
just click this button select your
backup file or drag and drop the backup
file to this gray zone here Carbon will
ask for confirmation before proceeding
with restoration click on the blue
restore button to start restoring the
backup to your device generally your web
browser will tell you when restoration
has finished although sometimes
but if you monitor your device you will
see a small notification on the screen
saying that the restoration process has
finished if you want a reliable way to
back up your apps or to synched app data
and settings among your various Android
without having to root your device
Carbon app sync and backup may be the
solution you're looking for in the last
few minutes I've shown you the wonders
of carbon and steps on how to use the
app I hope you find this video helpful
