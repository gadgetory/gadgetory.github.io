name is Kevin detect inja wait a minute
why didn't hack that as a bow where have
I seen that before
ah The Karate Kid with Will Smith son
that's where the guy bowels at anyways
today is the tips and tricks for the
Nexus 5 the month of October has been a
very exciting month for Android users
first the announcement of KitKat and
then the highly anticipated Nexus 5 as
expected
the Nexus 5 and KitKat both bring
enhancements and provides a quicker way
to get things done and because the Nexus
5 runs a somewhat stock version of
KitKat some of these tips you can use on
a different device that runs KitKat as
well let's start at the lockscreen this
is going to be the easiest tip that I
have for you today put your finger over
the icon of the camera and then swipe
your finger that is going to bring you
into your camera now that we're in the
camera let's talk about a few things to
get a better image just like the Moto X
the Nexus 5 camera is good in situations
with decent lighting like outdoors but
to get better quality of dim images try
adjusting the camera to HDR for non
motion shots HDR takes and combines two
images with one of lower and higher
exposure if you need more information on
HDR photography Elven you Banias wrote a
great article on it the link is in the
description below so make sure you check
that out
Kit Kat comes with hangouts
pre-configured for SMS I personally
think it's a great way to unify
communications but some people prefer to
have a separate app well this is
possible go to settings tap more under
Wireless and networks select default SMS
app now pick the option that you wish to
use this is a common tip that was
announced with jellybean but majority of
Android users forget about this one so
here's a quick reminder slide the
notification shade with two fingers to
go directly into quick settings now
remember one finger is notifications and
two fingers is your quick toggles or
settings
built in a KitKat there is a nifty
business lookup feature just head over
to your dialer and use the top search
bar to search for a business this is a
quick and easy way to find some pizza or
even a local home depot so you can build
that burden as you've been dreaming of
this is also cross-reference with your
Carl ID when you receive a phone call
Google does the same thing it looks up
the phone numbers and tries to match it
with a business and when I test it out
it actually works pretty good so you all
know how to access ok Google now feature
from the home screen well this only
works if your device voice settings is
on US English to enable this go to
settings language and input voice speech
and select the language options tap
English and then press English US so now
go back to your home screen and say the
phrase ok Google now and voice search
will activate automatically you know it
really seems that more and more
applications require GPS to function
properly well as we all know pulling the
location data can really drain your
battery battery saving GPS mode
minimizes the number of reference points
used to obtain your exact location
go to settings location mode and enable
battery saving you can also access this
from the quick toggles and if you don't
know to access to quick toggles you are
not paying attention when the phone is
locked and you are listening to google
play music play movies or even
chromecast you can press and hold the
pause button to skip ahead or whine the
media there's an experimental feature
that is built into KitKat it's called
art it stands for Android runtime this
changes the way applications are
compiled thus making them run faster on
a phone with the Nexus 5 you may not see
a big difference but it does increase
the speed of slower applications and
overall smoothness of scrolling this is
a developmental feature and will
continue to get work done with other
versions of Android but right now you
can enable it go to settings about phone
and tap the bill number two says you're
a developer now go back into your
settings developer options select run
time and choose art there's also video
that I happen to create back in November
that shows you the difference of a
device running art and not
and you can find that video below in the
description there's also a process stats
section built into KitKat now this is
under the exact same developmental
options it will show you background
applications and background processes
it's a tool to really dig into your
devices see what's actually running that
was my tips and tricks for the Nexus 5
as I said in the intro this does run a
unique version of KitKat it's not pure
KitKat because this phone does a few
things that normal phones on KitKat does
not do like the okay google now from the
home screen now if you have any
questions please let me know below also
tell me your favorite tip for the Nexus
5 once again guys my name is Kevin the
tech ninja you can find me on youtube
and on Google+ the links are below and
