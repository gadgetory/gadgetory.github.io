ways with the g6 leaving behind the
modular design and going with a more
conventional approach but the g6 still
has a lot going for it so like any other
top-end smartphone owner many of you are
looking to add that extra layer
protection what's up guys I'm Mike with
Android authority and today we're taking
a look at some of the top cases for the
LG G six the first case we're taking a
look at today is the ua g Featherlite
rugged now there's no mistaking you AG's
design their unique styling and vibrant
color options make for a great-looking
case with its invitation rivets and hex
bolts it has that I'm here to protect
your phone at all costs and I'm built
for it kind of look and it works the
hard outer shell in rubber bumpers that
wrap around the top bottom and face do a
great job of protecting your g6 now the
phone actually rests on top of five over
pads keeping the finish from getting
scratched up from dust and other fine
particles that can find their way inside
the case on the outside we find covered
buttons that are nice and responsive
along with some additional textured
padding for better grip the oversized
cutouts mean you should have no trouble
using most headphones or charging cables
and on the back there's plenty of room
for getting to the fingerprint scanner a
closer look show that the glossy areas
on the back give way to a more scratch
resistant frosted matte finish in places
where the case makes contact when set
down
now you AG's attention to detail is
apparent the feather-light rugged
interior design looks as good as it
feels to hold it offers military great
job protection that UAG case owners are
accustomed to and surprisingly thin and
lightweight package it's a little on the
high side as far as price coming in at
just under 40 bucks but if you're a fan
of UE GZ make styling then there really
is no substitute this next case is one
from incipio now these guys have been in
a mobile phone case biz for as long as
they were in mobile phones that have
needed protection I'd say they fall
somewhere in the middle of the pack when
it comes to quality and design their
dual pro series of cases have always
been a popular choice and as the name
suggests it uses a two-part design
incipio uses its own blend of plastics
which is noticeable right away because
the case doesn't feel like that normal
PC and TPU combo the exterior has a very
fine speckled finish that almost
glistens in the light and is super soft
to the touch but unlike the average
stuff touch coating like so many cases
use this one does a really good
resisting fingerprints normal soft touch
material ends up looking greasy and
nasty after just a few days of use but
not so with whatever incipio is using
here so they definitely get a thumbs up
for that
looking around the case the cutout for
the fingerprint scanner is neatly
trimmed by the underlying lighter color
giving it a nice two-tone look the
volume buttons are fully covered and
provides solid feedback and the case has
a nice Lane a table designed with raised
trim around the entire face now we'll
add a bit of bulky OG 6 but nothing too
serious and the drop protection you're
getting from the thicker than average
inner layer is well worth it
overall the dual pro from incipio is a
solid choice that retains that classic
case design which really does complement
this year's LG flagship next up is an
ultra thin option for those of you who
are fighting the urge to use a case at
all the minimal case is just 0.35
millimeters thick yet durable enough to
protect your g6 is glass on glass
construction from everyday wear and tear
the matte finish is both scratch and
fingerprint resistant and the material
used isn't as brittle as other cases
I've tried we have individual cutouts of
your vine buttons and around back the
dual camera module has some extra
protection thanks to the raised trim on
the phone the case is practically
unnoticeable which is why the Styles
become so popular it offers just enough
added security for sure handed phone
owners who don't like to cover up their
attractive devices behind bulky cases so
if you're a no case kind of person then
a minimal case just might be the case
for you
next up the cruiser light bug droid
circuit case is a fun and unique way to
rock your android-powered g6 this
flexible TPU gel case is both super slim
and lightweight popping your g6 in
couldn't be easier the back of the case
has a matte finish fare to grip along
with the circuit inspired engraving
behind our favorite Android mascot you
can layer g6 face down and show some
Android love thanks it a slightly raised
lip around the screen now cutouts are
precision cut with clean edges and
provide plenty of room for accessing all
those vital areas of the phone the case
will only run you $9.99 and it comes in
eight color options now this guy isn't
gonna win any awards for drop protection
and it's not the sexiest case out there
but if you want to rock your Android
phone with pride then the cruiser Lite
bug droid circuit case is a good way to
do it
moving on we have three cases from
spigen we'll start off by taking a look
at the folio style wallet case s and
this super handy full-coverage case has
three easy to access card sleeves along
with a larger pocket underneath to hold
your cash the fine grain faux leather in
black on black stitching gives a wallet
case a premium look and a great feeling
hand taking a look around we have a
small speaker cutout in the front so you
can make calls with the cover closed and
along the bottom you can see the g6 is
aluminum frame is mostly exposed for
easy access to the charging port now
obviously there's no direct access to
your volume buttons with the case closed
but what's nice is the soft leather
material it allows you to easily control
things through the side of the case
around back we've got a single large
cutout in the leather with the
underlying hardshell using two in a row
to separate the camera module and
fingerprint scanner which i think is a
pretty sweet look the case makes use of
two magnets one in the clasp to keep the
cover closed and if you look closely
you'll see there's also one smartly
placed along the back giving you a way
to secure the cover in the open position
you can also flip the clasp around and
snap it to the back so it doesn't get in
a way while viewing content overall the
wallet S provides solid all-around
protection along with some really nice
features that aren't always found in
similar style cases best of all it's
currently just $15.99 these guys are -
in the most popular cases in speakings
lineup the Neo Hybrid and rugged armor
are always a great way to go if you're
looking for an attractive case that
works as well as it looks
the - part in your hybrid is the
best-selling case spigen makes around
back we have a really nice herringbone
pattern imprinted on the TPU that helps
with hiding fingerprints surrounded by a
hard bumper style frame that comes in
gold silver or gunmetal color options
the case feels great in the hand with
just enough bulk to give you that
reassuring feeling that your phone is
secure we've got a healthy size lip
around the entire display giving you
plenty of face time protection the
buttons for your bind controller super
responsive and perfectly aligned cutouts
are a given reasonably priced at $14.99
with an attractive design and durable
construction the Neo Hybrid is a great
way to go if you own a g6 now the rugged
armor takes a slightly more basic
approach it's single layer TPU
construction may be simple but it's
still effective as the case has the same
military-grade drop protection rating as
the Neo Hybrid it has an anti
fingerprint matte finish covering the
majority of the case which feels great
and holds up well against scuffs and
scratches and the carbon-fiber accents
are a nice addition giving the otherwise
simple case a bit of flair
cutouts for the headphone jack and
charging for it are plenty big and
around back the camera module has a bit
of added protection thanks to the
slightly raised lip along the top the
front of the case is also raised for
protect on the screen and a tight fit
means it should hold up well in the
event of a fall if you're looking for a
simple but effective way to shield your
g6 from everyday wear and tear the
rugged armor is a solid choice
next up the ring key fusion is durable
clearcase that lists the glory of your
g6 literally shine through designed to
highlight the beauty of your phone
apparently after you get past all the
packaging this fully transparent TPU
shell has a hard coating applied to
resist scratches that would otherwise
deter from the g6 is attractive exterior
the case fits well and substantially
improves your grip on the device
now the g6 is ip68 certified against
dust and water but it doesn't mean it's
impervious so the fusion has flaps that
cover the charging port and headphone
jack to help keep dirt and dust out that
could otherwise damage the phone the
corners of the case offer extra
cushioning on the inside four-headed
drop protection and on the outside are
small tabs that raise the back ever so
slightly off whatever surface it sits on
to prevent scratching on the case itself
which is a nice touch so if you like to
look your g6 too much to hide it but
still want protection a clear case is a
good option and the Ricci fusion at just
$10.99 really is one of the best if you
want that completely clear design
finally I like to leave the big boys to
last and I mean big as in bulk if you're
looking for that super heavy-duty type
of protection then you want to check out
these last two cases each is built for
heavy use and put protection above all
else they wouldn't be here if they
couldn't do it with a little style
first up the unicorn beetle pro by sub
case now big box means a big case but
that isn't always a bad thing as the
unicorn beetle proves I was pleasantly
surprised at how much I actually enjoyed
this case what we've got is a two-part
case consisting of a thick polycarbonate
back and faceplate the backplate is
wrapped in soft TPU giving your g6 a
nice surface to rest on as the faceplate
which houses the built-in screen
protector locks it in place the
polycarbonate backplate has a matte
texture that's gonna hold up well the
scratches and additionally there are six
small TPU inserts that act as feet and
do an excellent job of providing
traction so you don't have to worry
about your phone sliding off the table
along the front we have cutouts for the
speakers light and proximity sensors as
well as the camera
now the sides of the case feel really
nice to hold with a soft textured TPU
and the slightly thicker corners taper
off in a perfect place actually adding
to the ergonomics of the case we have
port covers of top and bottom for extra
protection leaving enough space to still
allow for most headphone and charging
cables sub cases also included a
360-degree belt clip holster to hold
your phone while you're on the job now
it's obvious the case is gonna add a lot
of bulk to your g6 but if you're looking
for heavy-duty protection you have one
of the best options here the case looks
and feels great so much so that I had a
hard time putting it down build with
smart design and nice attention to
detail the unicorn beetle pro by sub
case puts a lot of the little things
you'll appreciate with day in and day
out use all on one package the case is
available in four color options white
black blue and pink and we'll run you
only $16.99 finally the poetic
revolution shares many of the features
of the beetle pro as it's built with the
same all-around protection in mind but
manages to do it in a slightly slimmer
package we have the same two-piece back
and faceplate design and the same PC and
TPU construction the back of the case is
hard but soft flexible sides until the
front frame is added and the case
becomes very rigid again the durable
matte finish resists scratches as well
as fingerprints and the high gloss
accents add a little style to the
function besides the revolution offer
excellent grip with this perforated
pattern and buttons that are responsive
and easy to find we again have
protective tabs over the charging port
and headphone jack to shield against
dust another small debris and the camera
module a fingerprint scanner are nicely
recessed but still easy to get to the
revolution is another very sturdy super
productive option for the g6 that still
manages to fit comfortably in your hand
the two-piece strategy for ultimate
protection is tried and true and Poetics
design keeps things looking fresh you
can pick up the poetic revolution and
any of the three colours available for
just 14.95 well guys it's about that
time again I hope you enjoyed our
in-depth look at some of the top cases
for the LG G six til next time
