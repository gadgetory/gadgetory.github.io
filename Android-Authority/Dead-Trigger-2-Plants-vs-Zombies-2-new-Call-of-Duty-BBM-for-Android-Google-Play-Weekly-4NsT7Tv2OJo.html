brought to you by netflix head to
netflix.com / android to start your
30-day free trial hello again ladies and
gentlemen I'm Joe Hindy the android
authority app guy and welcome back to
Google Play weekly we had a lot of new
releases this week blackberry messenger
came out along with plants vs. zombies 2
dead trigger 2 and the latest call of
duty we're going to talk about that and
a lot more so let's get started and our
first bit of news this week we'll be
talking about Aereo Aereo is a new
television service available in select
US cities that lets you stream live
television and record to a remote DVR
you can pick up the app for free but the
monthly charges eight to twelve dollars
depending on which package you want for
cord cutters this app is going to be
awesome but it is a brand-new service so
it isn't perfect yet for instance is
only available in a few cities and it
doesn't have all that many channels
hopefully the service grows but if you
just need the equivalent of basic cable
this is definitely worth checking out
unless you've been living in a closet
for the last couple of weeks you've no
doubt heard that blackberry messenger
has finally been released aside from
some released j jitters people are
reporting that the app works fairly well
and people seem to be enjoying it when I
say release day jitters I mean the
release was totally broken there are
people still waiting just to get in and
start using the application also many
reviews were totally faked so
blackberries once again off to a rough
start it was bad enough that many blogs
let it affect their reviews even if you
want to check out ours it's on our
YouTube channel a new lock screen app
for Android has been announced and it's
called cover for Android cover for
Android is a contextually aware
lockscreen that puts your apps where you
need them when you need them for now it
is invite only so here's how the app
works the apps that the lock screen will
show changes depending on where you are
if you're at home it'll show the apps
you access most at home if you're in the
car it'll show those apps etc it will
also change your ringtone volume
depending on the time day along with the
host of other features it's going to be
pretty nice when it comes out the
long-awaited sequel to dead trigger is
finally out and guess what it's awesome
among other things there is better guns
better zombies a new storyline better
graphics and a whole lot more there
really are a lot of improvements better
graphics better controls an actual for
real story line instead of just
completing missions and of course new
weapons and new zombies dead trigger is
still considered one of the best zombie
shooters of all time and dead trigger 2
will no doubt
share that classification the official
YouTube app has been updated and
unfortunately it's a rather boring
update because it does not include the
offline mode that we've all been waiting
for however there are some clothes in
the code that hint to some awesome
features coming to YouTube in the coming
months according to the apk teardown
there are bits of code in the app that
show YouTube will support background
audio soon this means you can start a
video actually leave the application and
the video will continue to play in the
background this will be great for music
and podcasts videos also don't forget
the offline viewing is coming eventually
it's time for some more trending
applications if at any point you want to
check these out the links as usual or in
the video description first up this week
is final fantasy 5 a slew of updates
over the last few weeks have increased
stability and squashed a few bugs Square
Enix is currently selling the game for
thirty three percent off which usually
isn't a big deal but this game costs
fifteen bucks on its own so if you want
it for five dollars off now is a great
time to get it plants vs. zombies 2 was
officially released a while back but
only in two countries now the rollout
has begun to release it everywhere if
you've been waiting for this one it's
finally available to almost everyone
also it's free and we love free things
it's kind of hard for this game not to
be an hour trending apps list this week
dead trigger was a game that helped
revolutionize the shooter genre on
Android and dead trigger 2 will only
continue that strong tradition we
already talked about it a lot earlier so
just go download it yes blackberry
messenger is in fact an app you cannot
miss this week the ones popular
messaging platform is now on Android and
it's worth checking out if you haven't
already people say the platform will
never last but the line to join is so
long that people are still waiting for
their email invites so it'll be
interesting to see how it actually turns
out a last-moment addition to our Google
Play weekly show is the latest call of
duty game called strike force the game
features a whole new first and third
person experience where you can switch
between the two modes on the fly couple
that with a bunch of other new stuff and
that makes the game worth checking out
even with that seven dollar price tag
once again I'm Joe Hindy the android
authority app guy feel free to subscribe

this show check out some of our other
ones you can find the written companion
