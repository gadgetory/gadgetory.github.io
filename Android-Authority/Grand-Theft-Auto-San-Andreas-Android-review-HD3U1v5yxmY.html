handy the Android authority app guy
grand theft auto san andreas is finally
out per Android there were a few bugs on
release day which was kind of a pain but
it's all over now and it's time for us
to take a closer look if you've played
Grand Theft Auto before then you know
what kind of gameplay you're in for for
those unfamiliar with San Andreas
it's an open-world game where you play
as an ex gangbanger named Carl who
returns home after the death of his mom
to get some vengeance on the people who
killed her
the game is mission based and it is
open-world so you essentially just
cruise around until you're ready to do
things and then you go do them you'll
have cars bicycles motorcycles guns and
sometimes some NPCs at your disposal as
you go through the game you can also buy
houses visit businesses pick up hookers
and all the other things that give GTA
hits unique charm in the Android version
nothing has really changed the graphics
were given a slight bump to suit the
resolution of newer displays and of
course the controls have been adapted
for touch screens but we'll touch more
on that here momentarily aside from the
adaptation to mobile this is the same
game everyone enjoyed back in 2004 the
touchscreen controls take a little while
to get used to and they are a tad clunky
you could choose between analog flick
controls and on-screen buttons if you so
choose eventually you get used to the
touchscreen controls but it never quite
losses that clunky feel in the game the
left side of the screen is typically
dedicated to movement while the right
side is dedicated to action buttons you
can also control the camera with the
right side if you need to according to
the support page any Bluetooth or HIC
complaint controller including the mogul
controller should also work fine if you
end up experiencing framerate issues or
if you want to really push your device
you can also tweak things like
resolution frame limiter targeting mode
visual effects draw distance shadows
reflections and a lot more to either
help boost the performance or make the
game look better it's your call
so here's what we liked the game itself
is long and huge it is open-world with a
lot of side missions along with the
regular story so there is a whole bunch
to do way more than your average Android
game we really like the flexibility with
the game controls and settings having
three kinds of on-screen controls plus
full controller support is nice and
giving the gamer the ability to tweak
the settings to their taste is always
preferable the mobile specific tweaks
really help make the game more enjoyable
things like updated graphics and cloud
save support hit most of the required
marks for what makes a mobile game good
there are no actual in
purchases in this title some speculate
that the reason it carries the tag in
the Google Playstore is because it takes
you to rockstars website freak and then
buy merchandise but we assure you there
are no in-app purchases in this game and
here's what we didn't like so much there
are no play games achievements or any
play game support at all it doesn't
hinder the game all that much but it is
a big-name Android game and we would
have liked to have seen it more
integrated with the growing Android
gaming culture there are points where
the game loses framerate even on the
latest flagship devices so you will
likely have to play this game on
something other than mac settings to
keep it running smooth all the time
lastly the on-screen controls are clunky
and y-you do eventually get used to them
there's never that 100% totally
comfortable feeling if you have a
controller we highly recommend that you
using Rockstar really put a lot of work
into this port with the graphical
settings all the various control
settings the updated graphics and more
they've done pretty much everything a
developer can do to make a console game
look and play great on mobile it has a
few problems sure but nothing we would
consider to be a deal-breaker we've seen
some people balk at the idea of spending
$7 but you have to remember that this
isn't 200 levels of Angry Birds it's a
full console title with side missions a
long campaign and a full open world for
you to explore it's the kind of stuff
we've been asking for since gaming
started being a thing on Android this
game was won $60 brand-new and all
they're asking for it now is $7 and we
simply can't imagine a scenario where
that isn't a good deal once again i'm
