with Android authority and you're
watching our hands-on video of the honor
7x in red so we're here in Las Vegas for
CES 2018 and honor has just unveiled the
honor 7x and a new color option now that
new color option is red so this red
model is actually the same internal
hardware as the original on our 7x so if
you're interested in learning about the
honor 7x in general and the value that
it provides definitely check out a
review which came out about a month ago
just think of this is sort of like a new
color option rather than a new phone now
this red model is absolutely stunning
and if you look closely you can see on a
really paid attention to the details the
antenna lines have this reddish hue the
circular rings around the cameras are
like the shiny red which make them stand
out among the matte red aluminum finish
that is covering the rest of the phone
and of course on the front we have a
black bezel which also looks really good
with the red so if you already on the
fence on the honor 7x and red is just
really like your color this is probably
going to be like a great option for you
it is going to be a little bit difficult
to get though as it's only going to be
the unsaleable 14th it's going to be
sold on honors website in the US Russia
India and many Western European
countries we do expect it to sell out
quite quickly though as has told us that
they only produced 20,000 units and they
are also offering co-branded honor
monster and 15 headphones for the first
100 buyers in each country so if you'd
like to try your luck hey you never know
you might get a free pair of headphones
and that will be all for this quick
hands-on video of the Honor 7x in red
