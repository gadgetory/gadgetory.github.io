Andhra Authority what is going on
everybody and we are taking a look at
there we go we're taking a look at the
Samsung Galaxy s4 and comparing it to
pretty much any phone that we can get
our hands on at the moment so what we're
looking at here we're just gonna go
ahead and get back to the home screens
on the s4 here there we go so what we're
looking at here is a comparison between
the samsung galaxy s4 and v well-known
apple iphone 5 now one thing you're
going to know is that even though it's
called the iPhone 5 it has a 4-inch
screen so over on the galaxy s4 on the
other hand you have a 5 inch screen so
naming nomenclatures inside what we're
going to be talking about is the fact
that the samsung galaxy s4 is indeed a
very powerful device that pretty much
blows away the iPhone 5 I was getting
confused there that blows the iPhone 5
out of the water you're going to see
real quick inside of the Geekbench go
and geek bench benchmark that there is
your performance right there Geekbench
does tell us that there is a Qualcomm
ARM version 7 in here
that's clocked in at 1.9 gigahertz while
the a6 made by Apple in here only clocks
in at 1.3 so the Apple iPhone does have
a lap 11 law of catching up to do if the
Samsung Galaxy s4 is any indication of
what Android is possible and it really
is what you're also looking at here as
far as the field goes is you have the 4
inch screen on the iPhone 5 that is big
that makes it pretty easy to grip but at
the same time it's also lacking in a way
if any of you are used to your 5-inch
pins at this point that phone 5 is
really not going to be a great companion
for you on the other hand companion is
the word that they're using for the
Samsung Galaxy s4 because it is supposed
to be able to enhance so many parts of
your life that includes being able to
take your memories and put them in a
photo book that also includes even
calorie counting and a lot of other
features that Samsung has decided to put
into the Samsung Galaxy s4 that is
really just making it far and beyond
more of a phone than less of a phone and
more of really a personal assistant a
lot of ways as far as the field on this
one goes though it is a 5-inch screen
but what you will realize is that when
you put it in your hand it is very easy
to grip and hold at 130 grams it is
certainly a very nimble phone it's a
very nimble device to put in the hand
it's very easy to handle and it's
actually quite light it was also a
pretty thin at 7.9 millimeters and as
far as the interface goes you are going
to get Android jelly bean 4.2.2 on here
so it is fully updated but you do get
TouchWiz on top of it which does have
some enhancements on top of it as well
for example the screen itself is now
able whoops you get back over here the
screen itself is now able to register
not just touches but also the fact that
your finger is close to the screen so as
you can see I was able to swipe in and
if you go over here to the gallery
be able to hover over I think an album
you know see all the pictures underneath
some really really great functionality
inside the Galaxy s4 that quite honestly
the iPhone 5 is not able to match at
least not yet we'll see what they have
as an answer to this incredible phone
the stem cell galaxy s4 alright so it is
Joshua Carr from Android authority and
we are here live at the launch event for
the Galaxy s4 so we're going to continue
comparing this phone to all of the other
top devices on the market so stay tuned
because we are your source for all
things Andrew</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
