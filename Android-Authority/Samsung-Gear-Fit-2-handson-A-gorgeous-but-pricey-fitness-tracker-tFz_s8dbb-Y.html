authority so Samsung held a huge event
in New York City and by the looks of it
you'd think that they were announcing a
brand new phone or something close like
that not only was there a press
conference I like to think that we are
shaped by culture and Samsung our
mission is really to create technology
that powers people's had a performance
bike when Stefani
and an insane crowd outside
but they finally released the successor
to its aging 2014 fitness tracker so
this is our hands-on look with the
Samsung gear fit - can you believe it
took Samsung almost two whole years
before finally coming out with this one
well either way the Samsung gear fit -
is finally here to bring the attention
back to Fitness first and foremost we
will certainly say that the gear fit -
is a significantly better designed
fitness tracker than its predecessor the
time in between the two seem to help
Samsung fashion together a beautiful
looking wrist strap fitness tracker
there's not that bulkiness anymore
because the gear fit - has been slimmed
down tremendously and there's no more
confusion about its operation
orientation just because it's all
vertical here the curved design allows
it to contour a wrist nicely making it
feel comfortable and ergonomic it's the
one the better looking fitness trackers
out there especially when you compare it
to things like the Fitbit Alta jawbone
up 3 or UA band
but let us chunky as those SmartWatch
like ones like the Fitbit surge - the
Microsoft band - or even the basis peak
now part of the reason why it's larger
than some of those other fitness
trackers is because it features a larger
1.5 inch to 16 by 432 curved Super
AMOLED display and what does it look
pretty good colors are super potent and
punchy and the high resolution display
makes it exquisitely sharp in detail
trust us this screen is by far the
biggest attention grabber with the gear
fit to nearly every aspect has been
improved they've added an IP 68 grading
built-in GPS a barometer 512 megabytes
of RAM and 4 gigabytes of internal
storage and as usual it comes with a
heart rate sensor on its underside to
measure your pulse
now the addition of GPS is key
here since you can now track the runs
independently the bands are replaceable
similar to the implementation used by
the gear s2 which simply relies on this
latch for quick and easy removal two
sizes will be made available small or
large
so you'll want size up beforehand to
know which ones right for you indeed the
design and feature set of the gear fit
two are incredible to say Talese but
it's worth amongst users will most
likely lie in its ability to focus on
fitness you leverage the s health app
and its Galaxy smartphones to go over
all the tracking information it accrues
during use and with a price tag of $180
it's clearly grazing into SmartWatch
territory
it's going to compete head-on with the
likes of the Fitbit blaze and Microsoft
band 2 so be interesting see what kind
of option we'll see come June 10th
what officially goes on sale so if you
guys want to learn more about the
Samsung gear fit - you could check out
