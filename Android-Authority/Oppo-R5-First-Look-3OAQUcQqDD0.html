event in Singapore has one very distinct
and wonderful feature and in order to
see that you have to put it on its side
hey it's Josh magar from Android
authority what's going on everybody and
this is our first look at the Oppo r5
yes what you're looking at here is one
of the if not the thinnest phone
available in the market today the r5 by
Oppo has a four point eight five
millimeters thickness which is pretty
incredible and it also allows for a very
nice aesthetic that is provided by a
metallic alloy that goes all around the
phone now as far as the elements on the
phone goes you can see here that the
microUSB charging port actually doesn't
have a whole lot of room left around it
and then the power button on the right
side with the volume rocker though they
do feel quite nice still have no room
around them you're pretty much just
hitting the limits when it comes to what
you're able to put on the size of the
phone when you make it this thin as far
as the handling goes metal is always
nice to feel in the hand but with the
thinness of this phone you would think
that with very little real estate on the
sides to grip with your fingers it would
slip about very easily but I 155 grams
and it's a weighed there's actually
quite a bit of heft and girth to this
phone that will allow it to sit very
nicely in the palm and thus it doesn't
move around too much just but certainly
not as much as you would expect a very
thin device like this to do so after
that the 5.2 inch Super AMOLED display
allows for easy handling around the
actual screen itself whether it's from
side to side or even to the top looking
at the screen it is a 5.2 inch screen an
AMOLED screen actually that comes in at
1080p resolution and 423 pixels per inch
well you'll notice here in the color OS
that has been updated to KitKat there
are now some darker elements involved
possibly to take better advantage of the
AMOLED screen but nonetheless it does
look quite nice and the update to KitKat
does allow it have to have a little bit
more optimization and certainly better
transitions in and out of the different
elements and color OS despite looking
essentially the same as a date in
previous iterations is powered quite
well and it's very smooth especially
with the Snapdragon 615 that is an
octa-core construction underneath the
surface that brings 2.1 gigahertz backed
by two gigabytes of RAM and 16 gigabytes
of on-board storage with no expansion
available now the battery underneath is
a 2000 milliamp hour
but the vogue fast-charging is available
and that actual charger has been
shrunken down so you're not going to get
the huge break like you did with the
Oppo find 7 nonetheless I really do like
the screen here with the AMOLED
construction that does work quite well
outside as you can see me looking at it
right here going through color OS as we
move into the camera there is a little
bit of a concern here because the
thinness of the phone means that the
camera does have to protrude out a
little bit if you're the kind of person
that likes to slide your phone around
all the time it's possible that the
optics might get scratch or even damaged
but nonetheless if you're careful with
that we can move on into the actual
interface itself and it looks very
similar to previous iterations of the
Oppo flagship system and it has a lot of
options underneath as far as the specs
go this camera is a 13 megapixel Sony
Exmor AMX to 14 sensor and the
front-facing camera is a 5 megapixel
shooter with an 80 degree wide angle
sensor an F 2.0 aperture is available
for both of these cameras so you should
be able to get quite a few good shots on
the rear camera as well as
self-portraits up front you will have
all of the different options available
underneath including all of these modes
that you're seeing right here as I slide
out the small menu and there will be
more modes available here as developers
will be able to create even more
experiences in order to make the
smartphone photography experience even
more robust as far as the camera quality
goes we do expect it to be quite nice
Sony Exmor sensors do tend to to do a
good job and we have seen some nice
pictures from previous iterations of
opus flagships like to find seven and
once again my review unit I will see if
this camera is actually up to snuff when
it compared to plenty of the other let's
say flagship devices out in the market
today on the hardware side of things
there aren't really any extra bells and
whistles that are available and actually
the thinness is it's a main claims of
fame which is a great and beautiful
feature of this device but it does pose
one particular problem the fact that
there's no headphone jack on the sides
you probably noticed in the beginning
clip of this video that there wasn't one
there's just no space to have it there
and what will happen instead is you'll
get an adapter in the package that you
can connect into the microUSB port and
then you can connect your headphones it
might be a problem for a plenty of users
out there but if you do listen to music
and audio from your phones via bluetooth
already anyway then that might be your
work around but for plenty of users out
there I could see where this might be a
bit of an issue you might be a little
bit worried about heating when it come
to a phone so packed in like this but
Oppo says that a cool element inside of
the device will allow it to have a phase
shifting material that changes when heat
is generated and thus the phone should
be cooler as a result it's something
that we're going to have to really test
in our daily usage when I get my hands
on the review units and I'll let you
know what happens when to this phone
when I use it especially for long
periods of time to me what's so
interesting about the r5 is that it kind
of proves a particular point that a very
specific design choice can change the
way you feel about a device underneath
the surface we have all of the fixings
for a very solid device maybe mid to
upper mid-range and essentially we have
a very good experience underneath that
you could find in a lot of other devices
but then once you pack it into a very
slim four point eight five millimeter
profile and have a very nice metallic
alloy aesthetic as you see here it
really makes the entire package even
more attractive than you would expect
and that's exactly what the r5 has done
and thus it is one of the more exciting
releases that we've seen especially in
this latter half of 2014 so keep it
tuned to Android authority for even more
coverage of the r5 and more coverage
from us here at the Opel event in
Singapore don't forget to check back
here for our full review of the r5 once
we get our hands on a review unit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
