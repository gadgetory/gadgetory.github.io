traditionally had poor specs but the
Vodafone smart ultra six definitely
bucks this trend by offering the best
specs at a reasonable price on paper it
definitely hits the mark on this one but
just how good is Vodafone's latest
smartphone hey what's up guys to narrow
here 400 Authority and this is my
Vodafone smart ultra 6 review on the
outside the smart ultra 6 has a rather
uninspiring and boring design the ZT
made smartphone is a tweaked love child
of the ZTE Blade s6 and s6 plus with a
few moderate changes not least in the
display beneath the display we've got
the SOL positive unique feature in the
capacitive buttons and the middle home
button which act like a notification
light by flashing when you have an
unread item the back of the smart ultra
6 is a metallic plastic finish that
sends no chance of ever passing is metal
but despite the matte plastic finish it
doesn't scratch that easily the handset
also has a contoured edge which is
definitely strange as its unibody device
and that goes against the unibody design
also on the back of the handset is the
13 megapixel camera which we'll touch on
later a single LED flash Vodafone logo
and the design by Vodafone tag moving to
the front the smart ultra 6 has a 5
megapixel front-facing camera sitting
just to the left of the e piece at eight
point four millimeters thick
smart otro 6 is certainly not the
thinnest smartphone in the world but the
extra thickness results in reassuring
build quality the size of the handset
doesn't lend itself to comfortable
one-handed use so you're definitely de
likely to use both hands when using this
phone the buttons on the right side
offer good tactile feedback and the
design makes it easy to find even when
you're not looking at the handset from
the design to the impress respects lifts
and despite its low price tag Vodafone
and managed to use a full HD resolution
the 5.5 inch IPS display looks good but
has average sunlight legibility viewing
angles are pretty good but the handset
screen certainly won't win you any
awards the choice of 1080p resolution is
what really sets the smart ultra 6 apart
from all of the competition as it
delivers an impressive 401 pixels per
inch density and the downside however
the handset is definitely a fingerprint
magnet
despite cleaning the screen frequently
it still manages to collect fingerprints
but given the price is definitely not a
major drawback the smart altra 6 is
powered by a
to cost snapdragon 615 processor clocked
at 1.5 gigahertz and while the
performance isn't marking leading is
certainly more than good enough for the
price point I had very few actual issues
with performance which is also possibly
due to the optimized software the phone
does slow down when running lots of
intensive tasks at the same time
alongside the Qualcomm processor the
smart altar 6 also has two gigabytes RAM
and 16 gigabytes of internal expandable
storage the RAM especially is fantastic
for a low cost mid-range device and the
handset manages run rather well with an
average of one gigabyte free one no APUs
are running considering that other
devices based on Android lollipop
struggle with RAM management the smart
halter 6 does extremely well here
processor is paired with an Adreno 405
GPU enhance it can definitely run most
games with ease throughout testing we
notice very little issues with graphics
rendering and slow load times overall
point of the smart logistics is
definitely on par with most flagships
and completely surprising given the
incredible price tag which I'll touch on
later on the connectivity side the smart
6 has all you'd expect including a toe
2.11 and Wi-Fi GPS Bluetooth 4.0 and 4g
LTE the handset offers LT cat 4 which
means it can download a speeds of up to
150 megabytes and upload at speeds of up
to 50 megabytes on the move the speaker
on the rear of the handset does get
muffled sometimes when it's in your hand
and often sounds distorted when sat on a
table but this is to be expected from
the somewhat uninspiring design I'd have
liked to have seen the speakers at the
bottom or the front of the handset that
this would have increased the price and
given the price tag we can definitely
forgive the speaker placement the non
removable back cover and 8.4 millimeter
thickness means Vodafone have managed
put a three thousand milliamp hour
battery inside the smarter six the
capacity is definitely on par with a
flagship smartphone nothing cost four
times amount and smart logistics
definitely deserves credit for its
battery capacity the large capacity is
reflected in the battery life with the
handset standby time easily approaching
three to four days with low usage with
actual usage the battery life does vary
but on most days I start Monday at 8
a.m. and still have 30% left around 10
p.m. at night like most smartphones
display brightness has a large effect on
the battery life you should be able to
get at least four hours screen on time
from a full charge 13 megapixel camera
on the back of the smart ultra 6
definitely fits the saying that a good
camera is about more than just
megapixels colour reproduction is good
but the lack of any form of stable
means that most images seem to come out
a little bit blurry the camera itself
has a clean interface that's akin to
stock Android and has a few useful
features a swipe beneath the viewfinder
lets you switch between manual auto and
the preloaded modes which include
panorama HDR filters multi exposure
interval capture and smile detection
from the viewfinder itself you can also
switch the camcorder toggle flash
settings set a time up or switch to
selfie mode while under the settings
menu you'll find easy access to toggle
settings including image / video quality
geolocation and review mode which lets
you view a picture straight after
capturing it overall while a camera
software is intuitive to use and offers
enough features to keep most users happy
the plumage quality is definitely
something of a concern that being said
this may be an issue relating solely to
this particular review unit and we'll
definitely try and figure this one out
so stay tuned to android authority comm
the small ultra 6 won't just appeal to
those looking for a budget handset as
the Vodafone ROM is one of the simplest
and cleanest on the market previously
carriers have spent vast amounts of
resources developing interfaces to make
the handset truly unique but this
usually leads to blood wear and portal
performance with the smart ultra 6
Vodafone have kept the cost to a bare
minimum
and as a result we have a mostly stock
Android experience with a few preloaded
apps those preloaded apps can all be
disabled or uninstalled leaving you with
a pretty much stock like experience not
all of the software is perfect there was
a couple of things really stood out
first the app drawer is a complete mess
while it does display acts in
alphabetical order there's apparently no
easy way to customize the order or move
apps into folders secondly the
homescreen management is very basic
allowing you to just add wallpapers or
widgets and it's accessed by a long
press of an empty area which a lot of
users may not find intuitive that being
said the rest of the software is pretty
standard and Vodafone has actually added
a few cool tweaks first a swipe to the
right on the homescreen let you up in a
predetermined favorite app which can be
customized in the settings menu
second the handset sports double tap to
wake which means you don't need to
fumble around looking for the power
button and can easily unlock the handset
even in one handed mode overall the
software is definitely interesting and
it's another example of the smart ultra
stick straying from the carrier branded
device norm
while other carrier devices often
preloaded with loads of bloatware
the smart hold receipts is clean and
simple and the lack of resources
invested in pointless software have also
helped keep the
cost of the handset down to a minimum
now to the price and throughout this
review I've touched on the price tag of
the smarter six as a justification for
certain decisions but there's a very
very very good reason for that the smart
ultra six costs just 125 pounds which is
roughly one hundred and ninety five US
dollars on pay-as-you-go yes a hundred
and twenty five pounds and while it is
locked over the phone it can be unlocked
for as little as five pounds let's put
the pricing context aspects are vastly
superior to the Motorola MOTO G 4G and
the smart altro six makes the moto g m--
seemed pretty overpriced the specs are
also on par with the experience offered
by hands it's like the oneplus one and
Huawei on a six plus but the super low
price tag again makes these handsets
seem really overpriced in fact there is
no other device that can match the smart
ultra sixes features unless you double
the price minimum and this is where
Vodafone has set a new benchmark not
only for carrier devices but for all
entry-level mid-range handsets overall
the smart ultra six is definitely not a
perfect device but all of these somewhat
minor faults can be forgiven once you
consider its incredibly low price tag
far too often a handset shows a lot of
promise on paper only for it to be a
disappointment in actual use the smart
ultra six is the opposite to this
initially I expected the handset to
offer a somewhat good experience with
lots of issues but aside from the
uninspiring design and somewhat suspect
camera I've been completely blown away
if you've not yet decided what your next
entry level or mid-range smartphones
should be look no further than the smart
ultra 6 compared to everything else at
the entry level and the mid-range price
point you'd be foolish not to buy it
