have renders we have rumoured specs do
you remember the Nexus 7 from like five
years ago
the Nexus Android tablet was 7 inches
hence the Nexus 7 well this phone is
only a little bit smaller this tena
leaked handset is delivering a six point
nine inch full HD display and a fifty
four hundred million power battery a
huge screen and large battery but par
for the course when it comes to the me
Mac series now because Xiaomi has
recently announced an event for June
25th you'd think the device would be
debuted there but it won't instead the
company is reserving that event for the
meet pad for tablet and redmi 6 pro
device now you haven't forgotten
motorola have you well we found a leak
on the motorola one power the image is
seemingly confirmed several key aspects
of the one power such as its wide
display knotch based on previous reports
motorola might announce the one power
during the summer tech info bit
reportedly went hands-on with a
prototype unit and managed to take a few
pictures the images seemingly confirmed
several key aspects of the upcoming one
power such as the vertically aligned
dual rear camera the rear mounted
fingerprint sensor that sports the
Motorola logo and the controversial
display knotch
the two grills on the bottom might serve
as dual speakers though it could be that
only one serves as a speaker the images
also show off the one powers Android one
branding which is also alleged in
previous reports we don't know yet if
the Motorola will sell a separate non
Android one version as it did with the
Motorola X 4 based on previous reports
the one power features a 6.2 inch full
HD Plus that's 20 to 80 by 1080 display
with a 19-9 aspect ratio 12 megapixel
and five megapixel dual camera combo
with an 8 megapixel selfie camera
Snapdragon 636 chipset 4 gigabytes of
RAM and a 3,780 milliamp hour battery
the phone also reported lacks a
headphone jack though there might be an
adapter included so you remember when
Mark Zuckerberg was called before the US
authorities
we're senator hatch asked mr. Zuckerberg
how a business sustains a model where
users don't pay for the service and Zuck
said senator we've run out us yes
Facebook does run ads in fact soon
they're going to run video ads inside
your messenger app Facebook did not say
where the autoplay video ads will be or
whether there will be an option to turn
off autoplay to save data reported
recode but with a limited amount of
space in the main Facebook app however
this was an inevitable move that
Facebook foreshadowed about a year and a
half ago Facebook tested static ads
inside of messenger in a handful of
countries the static ads appear as a
newsfeed style carousel though users
need to scroll down to see them but in
response to the article a messenger
spokesperson said this we will be
rolling out video ads gradually and
thoughtfully people that use messenger
each month are our top priority and they
will remain in control of their
experience suggesting that US users will
have some measure of control over how
those ads are displayed the lesson here
is that when a company is worth over a
hundred billion dollars you still gotta
make more billions of dollars and to do
that they gotta do stuff like this let
me know what you think in the comments
below or on Twitter
do you like ultra-thin bong cases if so
you just need protection against
everyday wear and tear and our sponsor
has super-thin cases price just right
