30 what's going on everybody I'm here
with Harris here at the Android Auto
section of Google i/o we got a bunch of
cars behind us and I'm gonna get a quick
demo of what Android auto looks like now
I'm actually really excited about this
because about a month or two ago I was
actually planning on buying a new car
I'm glad I held out because now we have
Android in our cars you know and in my
current car right now I use a tape deck
to be able to get my music and
everything like that but it looks like
what we have here is almost not really
of maybe maybe full integration is the
wrong way to put it but we have a lot of
integration between Android and the car
right yes so what we have done is we
have kind of started come to the
realization that a lot of people using
their phones in a vehicle for a lot of
different things so what we wanted to do
was make sure that we bring power of the
phone and applications on the phone into
the car so the way we have done this is
with Android auto so Android auto what
it does is once you kind of connect it
to the vehicle it will actually project
quote-unquote applications from your
phone into your actual screen in the
vehicle so what you get is all the
applications are running on your phone
you're using the network connection on
your phone but have made to be ran in
easier and safer we're in the vehicle
while you're actually driving toward
your destination so the point is you
have the phone you have everything on
there and actually you can use it in the
safer needs you matter in the car
all right cool well we're gonna go ahead
and take a look at it stay tuned for the
demo and let's go and do this all right
and what we have in here is the Android
auto actually interface so we've made
the whole system actually very easy to
use so the user has very simple and easy
access to applications such as maps and
navigation communication our music
applications so for example here you're
going to have Spotify as well as the
bunch of other applications that we've
announced earlier today such as songs a
stitcher Spa Spotify Joyride podcast etc
etc etc as well as Google Play Music ah
the whole point is that all of these
applications are very easily accessible
as soon as you get into the car without
having to necessarily spends too much
time kind of digging for what you're
looking for
the other thing that we've done is kind
of as soon as you plug in as you see the
screen over here which is called
overview and overview pulls the things
such as destinations from like Google
now our recent phone calls and etc and
the goal is really to kind of give you
the contextual information that you're
looking for right away as soon as you
kind of plug in so this way you can just
simply for example click on the card and
what it's going to do is going to load
up the route in Google Maps and start
navigating the voice navigation starts
coming through the speakers are you
commuter for a second or you start
getting other information such as for
example next turn lane by link a lane
guidance are you going to get for
example the time to destination the
traffic and etc can also do other things
like alternate routes so you can quickly
see if there's a different way you can
get there you can see traffic along the
route and another thing that we kind of
wanted to do was to make sure that if
you're running in a different
application we know people want to
listen to music and other things is that
they don't necessarily miss on the
things that are important around
navigation so in this case what you see
is the heads-up notification which comes
as a part of the L preview which will
tell you for example the other
applications things such as next up for
example next turn so let's quickly stop
the navigation is show a little bit of
rest of the system we also talked about
contextual information so under
suggestions for example all the things
that you've searched on the Google Maps
on the web or Google Maps on mobile are
going to show up in the suggestions you
can quickly for example just scroll down
find things that you were looking for so
for example if you're navigated to very
building and we're looking forward you
can just one tap and you're going to get
going um and this is really critical
it's all about contextual information
that is available to you when you need
it in order to start driving there
quickly
um I've talked a little bit about music
so maybe let's start playing the music
and as you can see the music is actually
playing through the radio or through the
speakers in the car up the other thing
to kind of keep in mind while we're
doing this is that the interface itself
is very easy to use the primary action
is available right front and center to
the user the user also has other
controls to them that are available
quickly such as forward backward button
and they can also use steering wheel
buttons for example to simply move to
the next song if they choose to so again
this assures that the user can focus on
the primary task of driving and their
hands on a steering wheel at all times
you have my playlist on uh I mean if you
actually like yes it's like if you were
to log in you actually do get your
access to your playlist and to the radio
stations that you created so they just
put two of my favorite songs I'm just oh
nice oh I'm sorry it's like yeah I guess
we agree on some so uh I mean the key of
this is though that this is very very
simple to use right and up if you click
again you're going to kind of see all
the other applications in here we were
to pick your ride I don't if you listen
to TED talks but for example Jory gives
you access to TED talks and again
interface with remains very very similar
but you'll see some things that we have
done to allow the actual applications to
differentiate so for example Jerrod uses
a blue UI accent all to kind of
differentiate their app they also use
different buttons for example they have
functions such as you know skip 30 they
also for example are using different
iconography as well as the some of the
lists in the menu so and all the lists
are simply scrollable or you can just
basic tab buttons and again lists are
very easy to use in the car so this is
one of the reasons what we were going
for this quickly just looking at for
example Spotify again kind of going to
see that you see functionality change a
little bit again very simple but
interface stays the same so all of these
applications are downloaded from google
play store and they're all already
installed on your phone so all they have
been done is enabled for Android auto
what this means is you don't have to
keep in downloading any other
application than you would normally the
apps get updated to store they're on
your phone you plug in and everything
works the way you would expect it
normally exactly so the last thing that
I haven't talked too much about is for
example our voice controls and voice
controls a critical part of driving
because with voice controls you can
control the system and focus your eyes
on the road
so for example if I just wanted to
navigate somewhere again all I have to
do is press the steering wheel button
and the mic in the car is going to
actually pick up everything so navigate
to Alamo Square
again Maps loads up the route starts and
we start basically navigating there if
you wanted to play a song for example
all you have to do is say play music
play music and the voice commands we're
going to actually allow also third-party
app so it's not that you can just invoke
google play music but you can also
invoke third-party applications on this
is this one of your favorite songs as
well I want my players to nice so I mean
if you wanted to call somebody it's a
simple task of just simply saying call
Sally and again what you're going to see
is it just starts calling Sally and
again the phone calls just starts coming
through and things get going so we're
not gonna call Sally I've been calling
her too much today ah but I mean again
idea is that really everything is
contextual available to you you can
access it through voice you can have
easy access to all the functionality
right in the front and the voice is not
just about controlling the system it's
access to your full Google I would say
power backhand so if I just want to
check out what's the weather here all I
have to do is ask what is the weather
here
it knows that here it knows that here is
actually San Francisco this is where we
are and he knows actually how to answer
it I can also check out what's my next
appointment what's my next appointment
so yes lunchtime at noon so again it's
like that we really made sure that user
can access anything and everything that
they want
via voice so that way they can actually
focus on their eyes on the road and
their hands on a steering wheel and the
primary task of driving so in this case
we're using USB and there's a Android
auto protocol that's running over USB to
basically do the display so what you
have is you have the video basically
piping from the phone to the primary
screen as well as audio and then the
touch controls are fundamentally coming
back as well as the audio from the
microphone okay all right so thank you
for that demo it looks really great and
Android ala looks like it's going to be
a great addition to a bunch of cars but
here are my questions we have four
different cars here and obviously these
are going to be I guess newer models of
these particular vehicles over the next
year so we're going to see a lot of new
cars that have this functionality in
them is it is it a API put on top of
what the car would already have
installed in well with its own - yes so
we're not changing the original
functionality that's coming with a
vehicle there's the only small library
that's being added on top of the
existing head-unit software that's
allowing it to communicate on the phone
so the beauty of the system is really
that you're able to bring your phone and
everything is running off of your phone
and the small library is there just to
basically kind of push the video the
messaging etc through while everything
is on your phone okay and of course it's
an application that you would put on the
phone so any Android phone would be able
to do this kind of functionality so I
mean we're definitely shooting more
toward than your phone's primarily
because of various things coming out of
part of the owl and everything else
that's coming forward so ah but it's
coming as because we have to change few
things in the Android itself actually to
make this work it's the actual Android
update so they would have to upgrade
actually to L and then it would kind of
start getting the functionality Oh - L
yeah that makes sense yeah as far as the
third-party applications go we saw a lot
of media typed but are there going to be
any third-party applications like say
textually based or anything any other
third parties are going to be creating
their apparatus is for Android auto so
originally we're just focusing on media
and
text messaging because those are the two
kind of big pieces that people want in
the vehicles but we're always open to a
lot of different ideas we feel that in
the vehicle there's a lot of new
applications that can be developed so it
really comes down to what do users want
are what is safer in the vehicle than it
would be to use in their phone and kind
of what is the automotive industry as a
whole is actually looking forward to
implementing the vehicles okay my final
question is with these cars coming out
that will have this functionality it
would be possible because look for
example when I was looking to buy my car
I wanted the Mazda 3 the new one but
obviously if I go for the current model
it won't have Android auto is it
possible to retrofit cars do you know if
that would be a possibility or dvd we're
working obviously if you've seen a lot
of the lists on the list yesterday
represented of all the different
partners that we're working with some of
these partners are also working on the
aftermarket units ah it's TBD we're
working with everybody and yeah stay
tuned all right sounds good all right
well Harris I thank you very much no
problem yes there's a great demo all
right keep it tuned to Android authority
that was Android auto for all of you
guys stay tuned for all of the best
coverage here at Android com of Google
