authority now as you probably know
Android uses the leanest kernel it has
done since the very beginning for that
poses the question is Android just Linux
on a mobile phone on a smartphone and of
course the answer is yes well actually
no maybe let me explain okay so at the
heart of every operating system there is
a kernel and the kernel is responsible
for managing the resources of the
hardware the memory the files and so on
now I've got a whole video what is a
kernel and I really recommend you go and
watch that if you need to know more
details about the role of Linux on
mobile on the desktop and in the servers
now androids need a kernel and the
kernel it uses is a Linux kernel now the
problem is when it comes to asking the
question is Android just Linux is that
Linux actually means different things to
different people are at this point I'm
going to just interrupt and say about
the pronunciation Linux Linux I say
Linux deal with it now basically if you
say oh my laptop running Linux what you
probably mean is running a Linux
distribution which means it's a Linux
kernel and then a whole bunch of other
tools on top of it including the command
line stuff including compilers including
a desktop including applications that
come bundled with that distribution of
Linux if we're talking in the purest
term Linux is just the Colonel Burton
Linux kernel and that's the thing that
Linus tour build wrote and that is why
it has that name Linus Linux that's
where it comes from and there's also
this idea of this thing called GNU Linux
because Linux as a kernel is great but
it's actually completely useless unless
there are some tools on top of it even a
simple shell that you can actually just
type in a few things requires some of
these other external tools that Linus
didn't write at the C compiler which you
need to compile Linux and so on and they
are all part of what's called the new
tool chain so some people like to call
it good news flash Linux personally I
don't like that idea because actually on
desktop
we also use a desktop environment KDE or
gnome where you think like web browsers
so should it be called good news slash
Chrome slash
gnome / Cadiz lettuce that doesn't make
any sense but the understanding is that
Linux is just the kernel and a kernel
needs user space tools to make it usable
by everyday users so if you're wondering
is Android just Linux well it depends on
what you mean by Linux so here's a
couple of reasons why we could say yes
it is Linux first of all cause it uses
the Linux kernel so when you boot up an
Android phone is booting up the Linux
kernel a same or very similar kernel as
what you would get on desktops or on
servers now to say something is Linux
would mean it would be compatible with
Linux on other systems and to do a test
what I actually did was I took a
Raspberry Pi one and I wrote some C code
and I statically linked it and I copied
that binary it ran on the Raspberry Pi
one printed out what it meant to print
out I then took exactly the same binary
I copied it over to an Android phone and
I ran it via the ADB tools and the same
binary ran on my Android phone with no
alteration then gave me the correct
output in fact was even able to take the
golang programming language from google
compiler program of golang on a
Raspberry Pi one on v6 architecture
copying exactly the same binary over to
an arm v8 64 bit Android smartphone and
the same binary ran so in that way is
Linux is certainly not win the who's
it's certainly not iOS and certainly not
the kernel you find in in Mac OS and it
ran but everything you need to do
printing things out and everything
finding out system information it ran on
whatever so in that case Android is
Linux but by the same argument Android
isn't Linux because for example I did a
special thing when I compile those
programs I use static linking now static
linking basically means that when
everything that's need for that program
running is built inside of the binary
itself now normally on most modern
operating systems that you
dynamic link which means the same code
doesn't need to be copied again in the
game Gators the code to concatenate two
strings together doesn't need to be
included in every single binary but on
our system is a library that contains
that information in fact it contains
loads and loads of functions and
functionality that a program might need
to do with files and do with your
printing system and to do with threads
and to do with everything memory
allocation everything you could possibly
want and basically when a program runs
up it starts it has AI li dis library
this library need this library for me to
run that's what the DLL czar in kind of
the windows area now basically if you
run own or if you compile a normal
program or a Raspberry Pi and copy over
to an Android phone won't run because
all those deals or that runtime isn't
there in fact standard Linux
distributions use the GNU C library for
its runtime and basically on Android
Google write with own C library called
Bionic and they're not compatible with
each other you binary compatible you
can't take an executable from one and
copy it onto the other and expect
bionics to do the same thing as Dipsy
and actually it screwed the other way
around you can't take an app from a
Android smartphone and copy it over to
your desktop and run it and it just
works that doesn't happen but having
said that of course if you've got Chrome
OS which is basically limit with the web
browsers stuff built on top you've got a
modern version of Chrome OS but of
course it can run angular applications
so you can actually take a nap down in
from the place where in fact and run it
on your your Chromebook and I've done
that recently on my my Chromebook cause
it just became available for it so in
that sense you can run android apps on
linux and you can run Linux binaries on
auto but the point of course here is
that Android has its own stack its own
functions all that stuff to do with the
Java and the java virtual machine and
how windows are opened and how
applications work and fragments and
intents and all the things that make up
you know android apps has to be built
into Linux distributions somehow
including Chrome OS or using some
emulator to get to work so at that level
a Linux and Android are actually two
separate operating systems based on the
same core technology which of course is
the Linux kernel so what does that all
mean well it depends on how you are
defined in it yes they both Linux a
desktop and Linux server and an Android
phone use the Linux kernel the new
libraries that are there are not
available on Android but they are
available on Linux vionic the C runtime
library for Android is not what you get
standard on Linux see that the desktop
chromium the Firefox the browser's
everything you want or you don't get on
on Android of course Android had its own
stuff it has well in frameworks at own
operating system it has own way of doing
things as a java virtual machine it has
all the stuff that we use to build apps
and that isn't included in a standard
Linux distribution but if you're running
Chrome OS then you can have that stuff
because they've brought it over from
Android over to a Linux distribution so
what can we say here's my kind of my
definitive opinion yes they both use
Linux as a user Linux kernel no they're
not both GNU Linux in any sense
whatsoever because Android is certainly
not good news Linux and thirdly you
could continue to be a Linux
distribution if it means an operating
system that is created with Linux of the
core and then a whole bunch of other
stuff built on top well that is what
Android is and that is what anything
like red hat or CentOS or Ubuntu or
whatever that's what that is but their
aims and their goals and what they're
doing are different at some point you
lose compatibility between the two
personally I think is great that our
Android smartphones are using the open
source Linux kernel I've been a follower
of Linux for since before version 1 of
Linux and I think it's great that we can
run this technology on our modern-day
smartphones so I'm going to try and aura
tea I hope you enjoyed this video if you
did please do give it a thumbs up I'd
love to hear from you in the comments is
Android Linux yes or no don't start
flame wars but let's just talk about it
because that will be really interesting
please don't forget to subscribe to
Android
YouTube channel and do go over to
