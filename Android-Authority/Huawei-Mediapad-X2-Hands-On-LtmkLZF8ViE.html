Android authority and we are here at
Mobile World Congress taking a look at
the huawei media pad x2 the successor to
the media pad x1 and the x2 maintains
the same form factor of the original
with its 7 inch display but in a more
compact iteration borrowing from the
design cues of the ascend mate 7 with
its 80% screen to body ratio the
aluminum design gives this device and
elegant premium look and great feel in
the hand it is also surprisingly thin
for a device of this size at just 7.3
millimeters thick contributing to the
handling experience we always focus on a
great design and build quality shines
though once again with the media pad x2
and is a wonderful device regardless of
whether you choose to use this as a
phone or tablet or both the x2 comes
with a laminated IPS LCD display with a
resolution of 1920 by 1200 resulting in
a pixel density of 323 PPI which
promises fantastic viewing angles up to
a hundred and 78 degrees in the short
time we got to spend with it the colored
production looks accurate and brightness
isn't an issue helped by the content
adaptive LCD brightness control that
automatically adjusts the brightness for
a better viewing experience as well as
more efficient battery management Huawei
is certainly not pulling any punches on
the hardware side of things with the x2
packing a 64-bit 2 gigahertz Kieron 930
octa-core CPU backed by 2 or 3 gigabytes
of RAM depending on which version you
choose internal storage of 16 or 32
gigabytes is available that also
determines how much RAM you get which is
further expandable up to a hundred and
twenty eight gigabytes via microSD the
Kieron 930 chipset supports LTE cat6
connectivity with a theoretical download
speed of up to 300 megabytes per second
aside from the full suite of general
connectivity options that are available
the x2 also comes with dual SIM support
on the audio front there is just a
single speaker at the bottom-right but
it comes with DTS surround sound
technology for an immersive sound
experience
Aryans and finally we come to another
highlight of any Kwame device in recent
times and that is the battery the large
size of the x2 allowed Huawei to pack
the device with a five thousand milliamp
hour battery which should provide great
longevity in any circumstance but there
are built-in power saving features
available as well to get a little extra
battery life the media Pad x2 comes with
a 13 megapixel rear camera that Huawei
claims to be very good in low light
shooting the camera features a post
shooting focus adjustment metering mode
focus and exposure metering and off
screen snapping functionality as well
the five megapixel front-facing camera
has an aperture of f28 4 and a 22
millimeter wide angle lens which is
ideal for selfie lovers standard
features like beauty and panorama can be
found in the camera applications and
more unique features like time-lapse
will allow for a more unique and fun
camera experience the software has been
updated to Android 5.0 lollipop with
Huawei's of motion UI on top the
interface is largely identical to what
was found on the ascend mate 7 and there
isn't a lot of lollipop influence in
this particular software package what
you will find though is a very bright
and colourful interface that provides
just enough features and customizations
to keep it interesting and that about
wraps it up for our quick hands-on look
of the Huawei media pad x2 the successor
to the original media pad x1 and it's
shaping up to be another solid device
from Huawei we've got a lot more to come
here in Barcelona so stay tuned for the
rest of our MWC 2015 coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
