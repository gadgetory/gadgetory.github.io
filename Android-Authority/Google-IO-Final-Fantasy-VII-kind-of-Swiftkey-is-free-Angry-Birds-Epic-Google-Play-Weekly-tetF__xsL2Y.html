hindy here and what a weekly show we
have lined up for you this week we're
going to be talking about Final Fantasy
7 a new angry birds game swiftkey going
free and a whole lot more you've got a
great weekend to get to so let's get
started first up this week Square Enix
is bringing final fantasy 7 to Android
kind of it's not the full game but it
has been announced that Square Enix will
be bringing an endless runner to Android
called final fantasy 7 g bike if you
played the game you no doubt remember
the mini game where you ride the bike
around to fend off bad guys and protect
your teammates imagine that game in a
mobile endless runner format and you
essentially have what this game is it
looks like it'll be a lot of fun and
Final Fantasy fans will probably love it
but I think I might have been more
excited if they've done a snowboarding
game instead one of the bigger pieces of
news this week is swiftkey going free so
we did a video about this and that will
be linked at the end of the video and in
the video description below so we won't
go into too much detail about it here
suffice it to say that swiftkey is now a
free application that has in-app
purchases the in-app purchases consist
solely of themes so you get the core
functionality of swiftkey for nothing
and if you want to make it look pretty
it'll cost you just a buck or two some
people who bought swiftkey back when it
was a paid application aren't happy
about the transition but the app was
never really more expensive than a big
mac meal at McDonald's and it's better
for your cardiovascular health so
frankly I don't see what the big deal is
word around the internet grapevine is
that Google is working to unify all of
their app designs for all of their
google apps across all platforms the
initiative which is being called quantum
paper by bloggers is an effort by Google
to make all of their applications look
and perform exactly the same way across
web iOS and Android this would be a huge
step for Google because a common
complaint is the inconsistencies of the
applications from one another as well as
inconsistencies from mobile to web
quantum paper would fix all of that it's
expected that all of the apps would
receive a major redesign on all
platforms similar to what Google Plus
went through a few weeks ago this
includes new designs new icons and a new
design standard of course this is all
speculation at this point that is based
on rumors and things that we've already
seen if it is real we'll probably see
more about it at Google i/o enter last
bit of news this week amazon has a new
streaming service for amazon prime
custom
in an effort to make their prime
subscription service look more awesome
than it already is amazon has now added
amazon prime music to the list of
features that prime customers get for
the ninety nine dollars a year on top of
the free two-day shipping and Amazon
Instant Video among other things
currently it's only available in the
United States the service comes with
over a million songs which beats out
Pandora but pales in comparison to
larger competitors like Google Play all
access Spotify and others the good news
is that there is no skip restrictions no
advertisements and you can download any
song for offline listening it's
available on PC Mac in the amazon
appstore and the google play store and
iOS be wary though because there are a
few release day bugs to deal with who
wants to see some trending applications
as usual if you want to check any of
these applications out you can find the
links in the written companion which is
in the video description below first up
in our trending applications this week
is Ariel you may already know this
application for its ability to stream
live television straight to your device
without prior cable service being
required the app got a huge update this
last week that added chromecast supports
there were also some bug fixes and
performance improvements if you're
interested in what's going on at Google
i/o and frankly everybody should be you
can find everything you're looking for
in the official google i/o application
using this app you can watch the keynote
and sessions on livestream get reminders
about events look at prior years and it
even comes with widget supports what i
like about this app is how useful it is
even if you aren't going to Google i/o
so if you want to be there but you
actually can't be there then this is the
application to get the last big update
to action launcher was actually a couple
of months ago but there are some big
things brewing in the beta version that
includes awesome features like the ok
Google hot word and a new feature that
lets you double tap your screen to put
it to sleep it's estimated that these
features will reach the stable released
sometime in the relatively near future
so why not try it out now amazon kindle
is already a popular application and
it's had a huge update this last week
some of the new features include
switching between reading and listening
modes on the fly some copy and paste
features improved cross-device syncing
and notifications and a whole lot more
if you have it the update should have
been available in the Google Play Store
for a few days now so just check there
to get it last up this week is Rovio's
attempt to turn Angry Birds into an RPG
dubbed Angry Birds epic the application
was released just yesterday and so far
the reviews are
prising Lee good and the reading is
surprisingly high the gameplay seems
pretty good and so far there aren't any
really egregious complaints it's free
with in-app purchases but we knew that
going into this so there's no real
reason not to try it out if you like
Angry Birds RPGs or both once again I'm
