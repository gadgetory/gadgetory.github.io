the things that you guys probably out
there would really be excited about is
the software experience and obviously
it's because of the name that's behind
it hey it's Josh reguar from Android
Authority what's going on everybody and
we're taking a look at the software of
the 1+1 CyanogenMod 11s let's start from
the top and make our way down so here is
the lockscreen oops here is the
lockscreen and it is a little bit
different from ones that you've seen
before where you probably have the
circle in the middle that can go into a
bunch of different shortcuts that you're
probably seeing right now on the footage
but in this case it's just a simple
swipe down you do get a preview of the
background but this area up top is
replaced by various widgets like the
google play music widget or any music
playing rather and it will be populated
accordingly to whatever apps you have
running in the background other than
that it just swipe down to get into the
interface but as you can see down here
you have the camera icon and you can
just swipe from the right in any
situation on the lockscreen and there
you go we have the camera all right so
let's go ahead and move along with the
notification drop-down so I'll swipe
from the left and come down and you can
see the notification drop-down right
there it's pretty much what you would
expect it to be already when you get a
notification you can always hit with two
fingers and drag down in order to expand
it and you'll see more information after
that we have the button right here that
brings you right to the power widgets
and again it's a largely what you would
expect it to be but of course being
CyanogenMod you are able to customize it
so let's go ahead and add a couple
buttons on there so here are a couple
that I actually thought were really cool
or rather let me just show you one in
general the orientation and after that
the camera so I'll head back swipe down
there you go and then of course the
rotation locked is right there that's
the orientation button and I always love
having that there in case I really don't
want my phone to go back and forth
between landscape and portrait when I'm
trying to do something but then then
coolant is this camera one where it's
not just a shortcut to the camera it is
actually the camera itself so you are
able to actually take pictures with it
you just tap on there and you can see
that's taking the pictures so that's a
really cool little added one if you just
wanted to take a quick snapshot of
something is just one nice way of being
able to get to it right away now the
gallery application sort of takes on a
bit of an htc vibe in that it groups
together all of your pictures that
you've taken whether they're camera
shots or even in some cases screen shots
and they'll group them together in
various in various iterations like let's
say here are the ones from today there's
one from yesterday I have a picture from
quote-unquote last week but that's more
like a couple days ago and then here is
some more from this week this week and
if you saw my camera shoot out here are
some pictures from my day out in Venice
Beach all right so the next application
that I'll show you is one that you
usually only find or the capability at
least when you are in a rooted phone and
that is the screen cast it is built into
Saanich and model 11s that you are able
to open the screen cast and just start a
screen cast I literally just hit here
and then everything that you are seeing
right now on the right side is what I'm
doing on the phone right now
and I do think that is really cool it is
a built-in feature of here so if you
ever wanted to just at least for me I
come from a tech support background so
if I really wanted to show somebody how
to do something in Android this would be
an easy way for me to sort of guide them
through it but nonetheless it's just a
really cool feature to have in here that
Santa was able to build into the
operating system rather than require you
to have a rooted system and the last app
that I'll show you is one that I was
actually told by the guys over at cm
that they're really excited about and
that's the new theme engine again this
is a feature that you would normally
find and that's a a rooted version of a
phone but it's built into the
CyanogenMod
on the oneplus one and here's the theme
showcase right here we'll go and click
on that and here we are in the actual
theme store that's built by cyanogen so
I've already installed a couple not all
of them are free which is to be expected
but I've already installed a couple of
them and if you head on over to the pull
over and hit the gear down there for
settings you'll be able to see which
ones you have available in your phone
and those are these right here so let's
jump over to right now I have the holo
on but if I were to change it to flux
now in order for me to even use any of
it it requires me to install the entire
style first and then I can tweak ones
later so I'll go ahead and just apply
that right now and as you can see the
buttons changed
if I head back to holo if I just wanted
to change a few things like let's say
the icons and I could do that and took
away notifications and there you go
but I'm not going to do that for now
because I want to show you how things
have changed so the icons are largely
the same as you can see there but what
is interesting about this particular
theme is there are circle circle buttons
in the power widgets in the toggles so
it's a it's a nice a bit it's a bit of a
nice change it's a way of really
tweaking the phone to your liking and
there are going to be a lot of themes
available in the theme store for you to
be able to play around with and that is
just one example of how that looks if
you click on privacy you'll get a couple
of things here you are able to blacklist
phone numbers so they won't be able to
get to your phone you are also able to
send encrypted SMS messages but anybody
who has used a sounder mod in the past
will be familiar with that in more
recent iterations you have the privacy
guard which will prevent applications
from having access to any of the private
data that is inside of your phone but
for the sake of just showing you an
example of what it does what will happen
is when I select one of these it will
continuously ask me if I really want the
phone to access certain pieces of
information like what mines current
location is so that's one thing that
I'll do right here with the WWE app look
and I actually have it on my home
screens so if I were to open up WWE the
first thing that will come up is it
would like to know my location this is
one of those features of the privacy
guard is that it always tells you what
the app is trying to do if it's trying
to access particular parts of the phone
or if it's trying to do something like
access your location
I could always deny it or allow it but
the problem is in this case I guess the
app really does just need that
information in order to sort of tag me
or something like that I can continue to
go and hit deny or allow or deny or
allow but it might keep me from actually
using the application so finally I kind
of get in and I can watch the network
but aside from that it's just a it's
just kind of a way for you to really get
a glimpse into what it is that your
application is trying to do and if it's
not kosher with you then you can always
have the privacy guard on for you to
always deny that kind of thing and then
the final thing that I'll show you was a
feature that a lot of you were really
excited about and that had to do with
the on screen or the capacitive keys and
the fact that you can switch between the
so if I was to head over to settings we
would find that under buttons and there
you go you can change the on-screen nav
to be on or off if I turn it off there
you go just slides away and now I have
the capacitive keys down here and there
we go
double tap the home button in order to
go to the recent apps screen but that is
tweakable because you are able to change
what the behaviors are of each and every
one of the buttons down there but one
thing I did throw me for a loop a little
bit was the fact that the home via the
back button rather is on the right side
rather than on the other side which is
what I'm used to using say a nexus 5
because with the on-screen buttons there
on the left or it is on the left but
let's go ahead and tweak that a little
bit I'll go and hit the back button
there and in order to change the or a
customized rather the various buttons
that are on the bottom we have to head
back over to interface so there's some
jumping back and forth between the menus
in order to find what you need to find
but here it is the buttons and layouts
there you go so if we look at this here
there is a lock over there on the top
and you will be able to unlock it and
there you'll be able to see that you can
add buttons on here so nerve a couple to
add let's say if I add a menu button
then I really wanted a dedicated menu
button because that's my thing
it really isn't I'm just showing it for
effect there you go so we hit the menu
button and there you go it's an easy way
of getting to the menu of various
applications let's show one more
application of it let's go to Chrome and
there you go so that's just a level of
customization that is really only
available in usually you have to route
and then flash a ROM onto your phone but
in this case I'm sure mod is what is
built into the oneplus one and all of
those features from the screencasting to
the privacy guard to even just tweaking
the general interface itself is
available out of the box and that is
something that the oneplus one really
gets to boast because Symington is a
great partner to have in your corner
when it comes to the software experience
and so there you have it for this
feature focus on satin mod 11s as found
on the oneplus one
now having satin in their corner really
makes oneplus kind of fulfill that that
little phrase that they keep throwing
around of
that's never settle and that's because
Sandra Mott 11s provides you so much
freedom to really change the experience
to just the way that you want it whether
it's through the settings or through the
fact that you can use a different set of
buttons if you wanted to or even through
the theme engine which is incredibly
powerful and is something that is built
into the operating system rather than
something you have to root it for if you
have a new sandwich and mod in the past
well this is probably one of the best
ways to get started because the one plus
one comes in at that great price and it
comes with a drama already built in so
you don't have to worry about routing or
flashing a ROM on here just to get that
experience so keep it tuned - and Rhoni
for my oneplus one coverage the full
review is coming very soon so keep it
tuned here hit that like button because
we'd love to see that thumbs up and also
hit the subscribe button if you haven't
subscribed already
