can watch TV on YouTube even some sports
so can you finally cut the cable maybe
the idea of YouTube TV is a dream come
true for many having access to your
favorite live and recorded content
anywhere you want is absolutely
fantastic since it can be viewed
anywhere as long as you're signed in to
your Google account however if you're
not the techie is type of person and not
used to using Google services and the
idea of casting your content you may be
left wondering why you have to watch
your shows on such a small screen you
don't of course but Google doesn't
exactly advertise the existence of TV
support when you open the app you are
greeted with popular live TV that you
can watch locally on your device or send
it to your compatible smart TV or
chromecast for easy streaming the
service also showcases local television
specific to your area so you get the
added benefit of being able to watch
your favorite local content if that's
the kind of thing you're into as you
scroll down the app your grid with
popular shows available for recording
once they air as well as a selection of
movies included with service swiping to
the left from the home menu brings you
to your library detailing all the
content you've starred or recorded while
swiping right narrows your view to
selection of live TV available for
streaming the latter function is
arguably the biggest selling point of
Google's new service the design of the
section is also pretty fantastic as it
shows you a variety of live channels
available for streaming while showcasing
a live feed at the top option you're
currently viewing but of course you want
to know what can you watch
well not Game of Thrones at least not
yet
the live channels available for
streaming on YouTube TV essentially
mirrors the content you would have
available on any major cable network
giving you access to things like NBC
ESPN Disney Channel and sci-fi there are
a total of 39 channels currently
available for watching on the basic plan
though you have the option to purchase
showtime and fox soccer plus
with an additional monthly fee Showtime
will cost you an additional 11 dollars
per month while fox soccer plus will set
you back an additional 15 dollars per
billing cycle
that being said purchasing the Showtime
network gives you access to all seven of
their channels including Showtime West
East to showcase Xtreme beyond next and
women-- fox soccer plus will also give
you access to that one channel but if
you're a die-hard soccer fan that may be
worthwhile for you now if you've been
one of those people who've been
reluctant to cut the cord because you
really want to watch your live sports
you should know that there are a
surprising number of sports channels you
can watch basketball football and soccer
as well live now let's talk about the
ugly and there's sort of a big one
YouTube TV content is only available at
720p resolution now before you blame
mother Google that's an issue with the
cable companies I'm sure that's a
restriction they've added to Google
because they at least want some
incentive for some people to keep their
table subscriptions it's kind of a big
one for some people now another issue
that many of you are going to find
annoying is that this paid subscription
also had ads and we're not talking
little ads we're talking full-on
YouTube style ads in the paid service
now that's going to be a big issue for
many of you but keep in mind that you
know for decades people paid for their
cable service or their network cable
service and they also paid extra for
specialty cable channels that also had
ads and that's why TV was such a big
business for so long we were trained and
conditioned that ads came with the
service this is going to happen again
the reality is we got to start making
real money and it's really hard to make
money on online video I can attest to
that many of you guys think we're loaded
we're not it's not happening the
billions and billions of dollars like 70
billion dollars a year in advertising
still predominantly goes to television
it's moving over but really really slow
and it's crazy that you know they don't
know who watches their tea
the ads but we know who watch our ads we
know who they are we know where they
live how old they were how long they
watched it everything if they did take
an action they click on the link and go
to the sponsored ad or the opt-in or
whatever but they still don't value our
content as much as they value television
content Shan Shan Smith the founder of
one of the cofounders of vice news many
of you know him he's famous for saying
that he created a vice news segment and
got a sponsor that paid them ten million
dollars and this was like a milestone in
digital marketing and that advertiser
told them that if the content was for
television they would have paid them
five times that so what do they do they
created HBO vice they put it on
television because there's a lot more
money to be made there there's just so
much more infrastructure in the ad
network industry for broadcast
television than there is for online
media at least for now it's a
frustrating thing we thought you know 10
years ago this issue would be solved but
it's just not it's not and if you think
I'm kidding just keep in mind you know
how many hosts our producers run this
channel well the money that this YouTube
channel makes doesn't even pay for all
of the hosts it doesn't it has to be
subsidized from other ads coming from
other sources that are in the YouTube
channel and saying crazy so the reality
is is that we are going to move to a
place where you're paying a subscription
for premium content and you're getting
act hopefully as time goes on and money
gets into that system the ads will
become better and more relevant because
that's what Google did right they gave
us lots of ads but they gave us really
relevant ads that you would care about
and was relevant to you in your life so
let's hope that that happens because
it's just better for everybody when it
does happen you're going to see content
quality go way up because people can pay
for it what do you think let me know in
the comments below are any of you
getting YouTube TV have you tried it do
you like it let me know and I want to
know is it simple enough that my mother
can
passed from her tablet or her phone to
her big screen Smart TV is it easy let
me know now if you are a developer or an
aspiring developer code is your world

obsess over it so picking the right
repository management tool is super
important that's why our sponsor at
