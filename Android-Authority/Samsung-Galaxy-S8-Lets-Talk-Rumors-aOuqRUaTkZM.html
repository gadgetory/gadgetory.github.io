World Congress just around the corner
Sammy is working real hard to help us
forget the debacle of the note 7 and
they're going to do that with the
flagship of flagships the Samsung Galaxy
s8
first let's talk about a possible launch
date
traditionally Samsung has launched this
device just before the Mobile World
Congress so for this year that would be
February 26 the most logical prediction
however more than a few rumors have
claimed that the Galaxy S 8 launch might
be pushed back as far as April this came
from The Wall Street Journal and
Bloomberg it's no secret that Samsung
wants the s8 launch to go off without a
hitch so delayed launch is quite
possible yada yada yada yada
Dooku specs well I gotcha and the
current crop of s8 spec rumors include a
5.5 inch and 5.1 inch Super AMOLED
display it's also expected to have 7.1
nougat and 6 gigabytes of RAM recent
leaks have the qualcomm x' next gen
snapdragon 835 powering the s8 or it
could be the Exynos 88-90 5 chipset
depending on the region in which you buy
the phone most reports claim that the
base model storage will be bumped up to
64 gigabytes and some claim they'll be a
128 gigabyte and even a 250 gigabyte
model available it seems safe to assume
that the s8 will feature the new hybrid
slot that supports both microSD
expansion and Samsung's new ufs memory
cards stereo speakers are also expected
to arrive in the s8 but Samsung has
publicly stated that Harman audio won't
appear on a Galaxy device until 2018 as
far as display resolution goes it will
most likely have qHD it's expected to
have an ip68 water-resistant and
dustproof rating and it's also expected
to ditch the 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack and add USB type-c now the iris
scanner and software layer found on the
galaxy note 7 is reportedly bound for
the s8 and will officially support
Google's daydream VR platform many of
you will also be very happy to know that
it's expected to have three coil
wireless charging which will provide
more efficient wireless charging and
require less precision when placing the
device on a wireless charger
now if the s8 does support welcomes 835
chipset it will also support quick
charge for which claims to offer five
hours of battery-life for just five
minutes of charging geeks are going to
freak but you may not like this because
it is rumoured that the home button is
going bye-bye you see the front of the
galaxy s 8 is reported to be one sheet
of glass with no home button
due to the fingerprint sensor being
located underneath the display long time
Samsung component partner synaptics
recently announced its natural ID FS 90
100 line of optical finger sensors which
sound an awful lot like what's being
rumored on the s8 now it's also rumored
to have a dedicated AI button but that
rumor came from a prototype so what may
never make it to the final product
speaking about AI Samsung's VP of mobile
communications went on record a while
back promising a quote enhanced
artificial intelligence service for the
Galaxy s8 following Samsung's recent
acquisition of AI firm viv labs the
company admitted that it was bringing a
new AI digital assistant to the s8 and
other Samsung products now this may be
an allusion to Samsung Bigsby which will
reportedly also be able to handle your
mobile payments using voice commands
alone courtesy of a feature called
Bigsby pay Samsung has also commented
previously on being able to use its new
voice assistant to order pizza or
request an uber all of this will be
achievable through Bigsby alone without
needing to launch your pizza app or uber
now this was all based on the article by
my brother an Android Chris Carlin you
can check it out in the link below he
talks about a lot more rumors a lot more
features I wanted to talk about the most
interesting ones which one is most
appealing to you let me know in the
comments below will you be saving up to
buy an s8 I'm sort of leaning that way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
