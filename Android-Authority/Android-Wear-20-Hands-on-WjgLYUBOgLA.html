Android Authority and I have a new jewel
version of the Huawei watch with me so
you can expect a full review of it
coming within the next couple of days
but for now let's focus on what Google
just announced today at Google i/o
Android wear 2.0 so that's running here
on my Huawei watch and Google's main
focus is to make the watch more of a
standalone device although it's an
extension of your phone they want you to
be able to interact with the
notifications even more instead of
having to resort back to the phone to do
things so first off you'll notice
different looking cards here
they almost fill up the entire screen
and have a nice colored background with
a color changing depending on the app
and if you take notice to the right side
of the display as I scroll through we
have a scroll bar that curves around the
side which is very helpful for knowing
just how many notifications you have
left when you receive things like text
messages you'll notice that your
contacts profile picture doesn't take up
the entire background and now instead it
shows us a little Avatar on the top now
if you want to interact with a
notification card it used to be that you
would swipe to the left to bring up an
action and continue sleeping for more
but now it's a little simpler you just
need to tap on the card and it will
bring up a main option so for this text
I have here I can click reply and if I
want to bring up even more options I can
swipe up on the screen and I'll be shown
other ways to interact so if I want to
reply I'll tap reply and I have my
normal options but on the right we have
a new option where we can actually
respond however we want in silent by
typing on a keyboard this seems a little
ridiculous at first to type on a full
QWERTY keyboard on a one inch screen but
it works quite well and it's definitely
a feature I wish was an Android wear for
a while but if this is a little too hard
you can always change the keyboard by
long pressing on the keyboard icon to
change it to handwriting where you can
draw large letters and the screen will
actually shift to make room for your
next letter which is a little more watch
friendly so Google is introducing a more
material design friendly interface with
Android wear 2.0 which includes a darker
UI which makes much more sense on a
wearable when we pull down from the top
we have all of our system toggles on one
screen which is nice because no more
swiping with one toggle on each page now
if you tap the crown we have a new
animation that brings up all your apps
and as you can see we don't have that
bright
background anymore which blends in a
little nicer with the theme of the watch
and when we scroll up and down the list
of apps we have another new animation
where the apps kind of curve around the
display and this definitely makes a lot
more sense especially on this round
display like the Huawei watch one of the
biggest new features is an introduction
to complications API where any watch
face can show data from any app you can
choose a position and then the app
itself it's kind of like adding little
widgets to your watch face but once
again they'll work with any watch face
and of course you can click these
complications to bring up apps
themselves and as cool as this is is
definitely not the biggest feature here
the main story is standalone apps so now
apps can run on your watch even when
your phone isn't with you whether that
be on Android or iOS the apps now have
direct access to the cloud via bluetooth
Wi-Fi or cellular if you happen to I
have a watch like the LG watch urbane
this pretty much means you'll be able to
interact no matter how far away you are
from your phone even if your phone dies
if you use your watch for fitness a lot
this last feature will cause some
excitement because Android wear 2.0 has
some improvements involving google fit
where certain apps now have the option
to automatically recognize when you're
running walking or biking or even things
like push-ups or other strength training
exercises google says Android wear 2.0
is the biggest update to ever hit the
wearable scene and so far these new
features definitely look promising
Android wear 2.0 is going to be
available sometime this fall but if
you're a developer you're in luck
because you can start using Android wear
2.0 today for testing let us know what
you think about Android wear 2.0 in the
