this is Clayton Youngberg once again
representing the number one website for
all things Android Android earth or
t.com so today we're going to be doing a
head-to-head comparison between the
Tegra 3 quad-core processor in the
cortex a9 quad-core processor now our
technical three is clocked at 1.5
gigahertz and it's found in our lg
optimus 4x HD and our cortex a9
processor is found in our samsung galaxy
s3 and has clocked at 1.4 gigahertz
anyways our gonna be playing the dead
trigger game now this game has a lot of
optimizations specifically made for the
Tegra 3 quad-core processor including
some awesome ragdoll animations live
water rendering water animations stuff
like that new steam features coming out
of the walls it's a fairly new games
we're just gonna be checking it out
anyways let's just go ahead and check
these games out we'll boot it up on each
device we're basically at the same spot
we'll just press the dead trigger do
some display comparisons as well you can
see we're paused in the exact same state
I actually might go back and increase
the screen brightness on the lg optimus
4x HD momentarily just so we can see
exactly what it looks like in all its
glory
we're running a HD IPS display on the lg
optimus 4x HD and then of course we have
our Super AMOLED display on the Samsung
Galaxy s3 so anyways you can see we're
in the exact same spot on each game and
if you notice already we do have some
steam coming out of the walls and stuff
on the Tegra 3 and we also have water
right here in this hallway as opposed to
the cortex 89 where there's no added
Steam animations here and there's no
water in this hallway but let's just
pick it up here really quick on the
cortex a9 and do a quick little play and
we're going to turn our volumes down as
well but as you can see we walked
through this hallway no water no steam
coming
then we'll shoot that guy but no I like
no scoping these guys in this game
anyway so just go into some of the
settings really quick because I want to
maneuver the keypad or the joysticks to
my liking and customize up that's
customized gamepad save a next date
we're going to be customizing our
layouts whoops well customize it just
like that so we have room to move our
finger around there we go anyways we'll
resume we can take a look at the ceiling
like I said earlier no steam coming out
of these vents no water and let's see
what the animation looks like when we
shoot a zombie
oh no ragdoll effects on the zombies
here another ragdoll effects are gonna
be seen when you shoot a zombie and he
kind of just blows backwards or his arms
fly off and stuff like that and I'm
getting screwed you can punch these guys
break his neck
grab our power-ups here anyways we'll
set it down on the cortex a9 we'll pick
up our lg optimus 4x HD which is running
the Tegra 3 processor we'll see if we
have some enhanced gameplay on that and
we'll resume so as you can see I'll turn
down the volume but as you can see we do
have water down here where we didn't on
the cortex a9 and we have steam coming
from our vents let's just see if we get
our ragdoll physics so we blew their
heads off just like that and it will
noscope a few bees and see the
difference to kind of blow them back a
little I kind of find it easier to play
on the lg optimus 4x HD just because of
the square profile of the phone makes a
little easier to hold during gameplay
anyways this game is really awesome you
can upgrade to a bunch of different
weapons lasers that just take the limbs
right off the zombies and stuff like
that now you can also purchase with your
actual money via the Play Store some
gain money to buy upgraded guns which is
really gonna help you out if you're
stuck on levels and stuff like that
anyways you can see the graphics are
somewhat the same between the cortex a9
and the Tegra 3 I mean practically the
exact same or basically pause at the
same spot here it's a little darker on
the display of the Super AMOLED screen
here but let's see
both are just as fast let's see here
both are pretty responsive just as
responsive as each other I'd say so as
you can see here there's some rain
falling from the ceiling now once we
walk through the rain our character kind
of gets covered in this water starts
dripping down the screen like that now
that's not the case on the Samsung
Galaxy s3 if it's non Tegra 3 processor
we'll walk down that area in the game
here we'll see that's not there's no
water dripping from up there and as we
walk through there is no water anyways
guys that was basically a quick rundown
we can do a full review on the dead
trigger game if you guys want us to go
ahead and drop a comment tell us what
you want to see also there's a tweak you
can do to any non Tegra 3 device to
actually get the graphics displayed we
can also cover that it's a mod you have
to have a rooted phone for but if you
guys want to see that drop us a comment
we can make a video anyways guys we got
a lot more videos coming your way stay

Android news and everything else
