authority now system-on-a-chip designers
have a problem main memory the RAM on
your mobile phone is actually quite slow
now to solve this problem is a thing
called cache memory if you don't know
what cache memory is please let me
explain you're probably quite surprised
that I've said that main memory is slow
of course this is all relative a hard
disk is slow a cd-rom is slow but let me
give an illustration the average mobile
CPU is clocked at somewhere between 1.5
gigahertz and 2.2 gigahertz now the
average Ram module in your mobile phone
is clocked at just 200 megahertz so you
can see a big difference in 1.5
gigahertz and 200 megahertz whenever the
CPU wants something it has to talk to a
device that's running ten times slower
than it is before it can get the
information back now in CPU terms that's
an absolute age as to sit around waiting
for something and therefore that affects
the performance okay I'll admit that as
an oversimplified view of the problem
however that is basically the issue that
every system of a chip designer has to
cope with now because of things like
double data rate memory which can send
to lots of data per clock 200 megahertz
suddenly now equals 400 megahertz and in
fact the latest low-power ddr3 is
actually about eight times the base rate
clock speed that can push the data out
to the CPU in fact the low-power data
rate for memory motors are working
effectively the same CPU frequency is
1.8 gigahertz so if the CPU is running
at 1.8 gigahertz and the memory
effectively is running at 1.8 gigahertz
there shouldn't be any problem or should
there well in fact we don't remember
that modern day CPUs have four or even
eight cores on them so those eight cores
are all accessing the same one set of
memory banks and therefore there is a
contention here on who can get the data
and when they can get it so fact even
though that's running at 1.8 gigahertz
because there are eight CPU trying to
get hold of the data actually it's still
a lot lot
a lot lot slower now this is actually a
very well known problem in computer
science and it's what's known as the von
Neumann bottleneck now if you watch my
video on assembly language and machine
code you'll remember the von Neumann was
one of the key players in developing and
designing what is a modern-day computer
now the von Neumann bottleneck is
basically when the CPU is waiting for
data in a resource that's slower than it
that creates a performance bottleneck
where in fact the system is running at
the speed of the slowest device which in
this case would be the RAM now the
several ways around this problem and the
most popular is cache memory now cache
memory what is it well basically it's a
small amount of memory that's actually
on the CPU itself or right next to it
and what that means is that when it
wants data you can go and get this
memory at the same speeds while it's
operating so if it's operating at 1.8
gigahertz you can get it at one point a
Giga it's running at 2.2 gigahertz it
can get it at 2.2 gigahertz and not only
that every CPU core has its own cache
memory so there's no contention about
who can get access to it because they
all have their own little cache memory
now I can see you thinking well if
that's the case then Gary why isn't all
memory at cache memory on the CPU at the
same speed as the CPU well the basic
answer is price cache memory is very
expensive the fabrication process is
very difficult very complicated and to
get large amounts of memory onto a chip
is very very expensive
so therefore when we're talking about
cache memory we're talking about just
maybe 64 K or 80 K or 128 K very very
small amount of memory per core on the
CPU so how does cache memory work well
basically it stores a copy of
information that's in the main memory
when the CPU wants a particular piece of
memory it says hey cache do you have
that he goes yes I've got it and
therefore you can get it at a great
speed and that's called a cache hit
however sometimes it will say do have a
copy of that memory goes no sorry I
don't have that you have to get a main
memory to go and get it and that's
called a cache miss now the greater the
cache hits the greater the performance
the more cache misses then the lower the
performance now if you imagine there are
a whole bunch of different ways of
Phil English cash to make sure it has
the optimum memory in it the optimum
information in it now one of the systems
they use to get that optimum information
is to split the cash in two they split
it into data cache and instruction cache
now they do that because the instruction
cache is actually easier to fill because
normally a computer program excuse one
instruction then the next one then the
next one so you pretty well know that
the next instructor could be the one
after this one now there are things
called branching which means the program
jumps to another place and that will be
a whole different set of cache but it's
actually pretty easy to work out what
the next instruction can be needed so
for example on the cortex a 72 core from
arm there is 48 K of instruction cache
and 32 k of data cache and that is for
every one of the four calls on the chip
now another technique that cache
designers use is to use multiple levels
of cache so this cache right next to the
CPU running at the best speed ever just
maybe thirty to forty eight K of memory
is called a level one cache now after
level one you can have level two cache
now level two cache can be measured
maybe in megabytes four megabytes let's
say now that is shared across all the
CPU cores however it's a bigger pool of
memory and therefore again there is a
greater chance of having a cache hit but
because four megabytes is expensive to
build it's actually slightly slower
memory it's slightly cheaper memory
making it more feasible in fact on some
systems for example the ARM architecture
chips that are put into servers an AMD
make server chip forearm and Qualcomm
make chips for arm now those chips
actually use a level three cache and
that may be even as much as 32 megabytes
there's one other piece of this jigsaw
we need to talk about how does the CPU
know where in the cache memory is the
data that it needs from main memory the
way it does this is basically using
what's called a hashing function it
takes the address and it wanting main
memory applies a hash to it and that
gives it a location in that 32 K every
time you put in the same address you get
the same answer and what happens is is
that each address will give you
location 1 cache location 2 lat cache
location 3 and then that will go through
when it gets the end of its 32k or 48k
whatever it's got it has to loop round
again and so therefore for many many Ram
locations you have one cache location
and of course the problem comes about
when you want to cache two things in the
same cache location
you can't put two things in there at
once so there's another thing which is
called a two-way cache 2-way associative
cache and what that does is it gives you
two slots for every memory address and
now when the CPU goes to look there it
has to look between is it in the first
one no is it in the second one okay I'll
use that now obviously that's much
quicker than looking through 32 K's
worth in fact you can actually get
four-way and 8-way and even 16 Way
associative cache caches but of course
the problem is there is the balance
between the complexity of the chip the
amount of power that takes because we're
running on mobile phones in the amount
of power that takes and the performance
gains so let me quickly sum up for you a
cache is a small amount of memory that
runs at the same speed of the CPU and
it's there so the CPU has a local copy
of the most important bits of
information the next instructions to
execute or the next bit of data that it
wants and it's much faster than going
out to the main memory now the bigger
the cache the better well organize the
cache the greater the performance a
smaller cache no cache even will mean
lower performance and caches can come in
three levels level 1 l1 here's a small
one on board the chip may be 30 to 48 K
level 2 may be 4 megabytes and level 3
may be 32 megabytes so next time you
look at which chip you're going to
choose for your smartphone maybe you
should look too much cache it's got
because that's going to affect its
performance well my name is Gary Sims
from Android authority and I hope you
enjoyed this video if you did please do
give it a thumbs up also please don't
forget to follow me on social media you
can use a little comments here below to
tell me what you know about cache memory
is important to you have you even looked
about the cache memory of the CPU in
your smartphone also don't forget to use
this link here over at the android
authority forums where you can talk to
me about cache memory we can have a
discussion there if you want to and of
course don't forget to stay tuned to
