Weekly my name is Jason this is where we
cover the week's Android news and talk
about what it means for you the Android
user and so far what it means for you is
that you can now download KitKat 4.4.2
to your Android device at least some of
us can others are left waiting patiently
for hours stop checking or we will play
bad Christmas music until your battery
dies so let's get started on that KitKat
update that you may be lucky enough to
get 4.4.2 so far this update seems
pretty basic he deals with clearing the
VM indicator fixing the delivery for the
VM indicator various additional software
fixes and security enhancements but the
bigger question must be is why oh why
are there so many frequent updates that
so few people can take advantage of good
question and I've done with the first
part of the question in a show about
three weeks ago titled why Android
updates take so long you can go and
check that out if you haven't already
but the second part of that question
deals with the kind of company that
Google really is they are an engineering
company now I know some of you may be
thinking Microsoft and Apple and
numerous other technological companies
are engineering companies well they're
all tech companies but they're not
engineering focused in the same manner
that Google is you see Google loves to
make incremental improvements and
whereas you know Apple for example in
contrast is more design focused although
they're you know engineering and tech
company they're more design focused so
when they push on a product they want it
to be much more polished to be user
friendly they they make a huge marketing
push about that launch whereas Google
will just quietly push these things out
just like they're very iterative
approach right and some of the booths
little approaches may not be the best
for the average user but they're really
good for Google because that's how they
operate hopefully over time Google what
better Google will get better
and communicating about why these
changes are important so earlier this
week friend of mine bought a nexus 5 I
got my hand on it wow it was a lot
better phone that I had expected very
elegant premium but I noticed that he
asked me about the newest update and
what was this question would it screw up
my phone that's what he was concerned
about I hope that in time Google gets
better at these launches and
communicating it better to the audience
you know they're more engineering focus
not people focused I hope that changes
over time
let those trumpets sound because it is
official the Google Play Store has the
LG pad 8.3 and the Sony Z ultra yes
that's correct the LG G pad 8.3 and the
Sony Z ultra has officially arrived at
the Google Play Store and the G pad is
now available for 349 and the Z ultra is
sold for a hefty 649 but for a limited
time it includes free ground shipping
all good news for sure but the question
remains why why would these OEMs
original equipment manufacturers buy
into a deal that would put them in
direct competition with their own
devices doesn't seem to be a very sound
business decision does it well in fact
it's actually a very good business
decision although Google does not give
out sales stats of their Google Play
Store devices it is believed that those
devices that those you know goo play
editions like the Samsung Galaxy s4 HTC
One all that stuff have very few sales
on the Google Play Store almost
insignificant and that's not Google's
ultimate goal is to make money off
selling OAM devices like new Play Store
their goal is to make Android developers
happy and you do that by giving them
easy access affordable access to phones
that are unlocked and have recent
Android updates and we'll always get
recent Android updates because for them
to do their job they need to be able to
optimize on phones and different screen
sizes of different hardware specs this
is a play to help developers and early
adopters like us not to ultimately make
money selling hardware off the Google
Play Store so as many of you may have
guessed most of the time I'm a pretty
happy man I love my work and I love my
gadgets sometimes a little too much oh
oh but sadly I'm not always smart about
how I go about it you see this is me
when after many hours of work my laptop
died and I realized I forgot to backup
my data hmm now I know what you're
thinking you're thinking Jase hand over
those geek credentials right now because

just backup your data - and it's sort of
hard drive no you back it up to the

excited that Carbonite agreed to be a

Android so when Microsoft recently made
a bid to buy out Nokia's unit and
Services Division it was thought that
that would be the end of any possibility
that you'd ever see Android on a Nokia
device but we have learned that that is
not the case there is something called
Normandy which is an entry level Android
device manufactured by you guessed it
Nokia earlier last week the verge
reported and All Things D confirmed that
yes there is an Android Nokia device
called Normandy now there's no guarantee
that Microsoft will ever let Normandy
see the light of day but reportedly
within Nokia there is a sense that
Redmond may be willing to pursue the
project now what is happening here you
ask is this just a project that Nokia
had in the pipe before the Microsoft
takeover or is this some sort of weird
evil plan by Microsoft I don't think so
I cannot see Microsoft pulling away in
any way from its Windows mobile platform
but we shall see tell me what you think
in the comments below thanks for
watching Android peeps you should know
that on this channel whether it's Josh
Joe with a tech ninja Kevin there's lots
of great content for Android lovers and
