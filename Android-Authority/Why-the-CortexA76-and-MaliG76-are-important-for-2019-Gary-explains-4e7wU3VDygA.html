Android authority now arm recently made
three important announcements the first
was for a new CPU design which the
cortex a 76 the second was for a new GPU
design which is the Molly G 76 and the
third was for a new video processor
which is the Marley V 76 now these three
designs will actually have an impact on
products that we're going to see in 2019
and beyond
so as consumers if you want to
understand what these three
announcements mean for you and for me
well please let me explain
now until you have notice that all three
of these devices carry the 76 labeling
at the end of them and that is to
demonstrate something that a fad we
already knew and that is that all arm
components work well one with each other
they are designed to be tightly
integrated together now during this
video I'm also going to show you some
clips from the launch event with Rene
has one of the senior armed executives
so let's listen to what Rene said about
how these components work well together
so this is not only a set of IP at CPU a
GPU and display control at cetera et
cetera but it's really a cohesive
platform it's a seven devices that are
intended to be used together deliver the
best performance together deliver the
best experience to the end-user together
so let's have a look at the cortex a 76
now the key takeaway here is that armor
saying that for laptops for these always
connected Windows PCs we're going to see
double the performance that we see with
today's devices now today's devices are
using processes based on the cortex a 73
and they have phenomenal battery life I
mean the reports that are coming out
about The Bachelor life on these things
is amazing however not everybody has
been happy with a level of performance
but with the cortex a 76 we're going to
see a doubling of that performance in
laptop devices so with that you see that
starting with a 73 onto a 75 and the new
product and I'll talk with a 76 we've
had a tremendous performance increase
and there's certainly lots of interest
in this idea of an always connected PC
so it's running Windows 10 it's got an
ARM processor at its core and an
incorporated 4G and later 5g modem which
gives us this always 50 device with
all-day battery life well the battery
life is out
compelling the fact you can truly leave
your power supply in your backpack for
the entire day is a reality now and will
only get better this is what Matt Barlow
from Microsoft had to say about this and
devices of this type are our base PCs
like you always get in PC that I'll
definitely talk more about today that
running did a nice job pitch I think are
gonna create this new thin light always
connected incredibly long battery life
and all the benefits you would expect
from Windows PC is going to be the thing
people prefer it worked at school at
home I just think we're setting
ourselves up the technology for a large
pivot in this industry mobile phone but
frankly that the PC only devices - now
our Mo's also share some technical
details about how the cortex a76
can be incorporated in processors
designed specifically for laptops and as
you can see the idea is we're gonna have
cortex 876 processor clocked at over 3
gigahertz and built on the seven
nanometer process I'm also suggest that
there should be a greater levels of l2
cache for the cortex a 55 processes that
accompany the court is a 76 there should
be large amounts of level 3 cache and
there should be an optimized memory
system that allows the processor to get
access to that memory in the laptop as
fast as possible now along with the new
CPU design there is a new GPU design
called the mali g76 and the g76 is
offering 1.5 better performance compared
to the mali g72 at 10 nanometers
you're barely looking at better battery
life and you're looking at
cross-platform experience and by
cross-platform here we mean the g76 can
be used just as much in your smartphone
as it can be in this always connected
Windows 10 PC so if you look at the
figures individually that's a 30% better
performance density a 30% better energy
efficiency and a 2.7 X uplift in machine
learning performance now one of the
things we all do on both our smart
phones and on our laptops is watch video
now video decoding when done in software
is very inefficient and will drain the
battery however when it's done in
hardware it's incredibly efficient and
incredibly fast and to that end arm of
release their latest generation
video protests sir the Mali v76
now the v76 is aimed at doing 8k 60
frame the second video decode that means
it's got a two times performance decode
increase it's 40% smaller and there's a
25% encode quality uplift now I'm also
showed this amazing diagram which I
think really talks about the power of
the video processor the great thing
about the Mali v76 is you can mix and
match the things that it's doing so you
could decode one 8k stream at 60 frames
a second or you could decode two 8k
streams at 30k a second or for 4k
streams at 60 frames a second or 16 Full
HD streams at 60 frames a second to talk
about picture-in-picture here we've got
for 4k streams being decoded at 60
frames a second all in the hardware
without taxing too much of your battery
life what I really like about this slide
is this last entry which shows the video
process is capable of decoding an 8k
stream a 4k stream and for full HD
streams simultaneously so here arm
really are paving the way for future
devices and for multiple streams of
video on both smartphones and on laptops
and of course on other devices like
televisions and and other display
equipment so in summary these three
announcements are key for the devices
that we're going to be using in 2019 and
beyond not only are we going to see
smartphones with better performance
better GPU better video decoding we're
gonna see Windows arm-based laptops with
better performance but brilliant battery
life and again better GPU better video
decoding so it looks like the neck sort
of 18 months to two years and they'll be
very exciting in the mobile area and
again making sure that we have
synchronized products that are out at
the same time same time the GPU is
available the CPUs available is really
quite important so you'll see platforms
coming out in 2019 they'll be using
the a76 cpu along with this GPU well my
name is Gary Sims and this is Andrew
authority I really hope you enjoyed this
video if you did please do give it a
thumbs up please subscribe please share
this video on social media and don't
forget to go over to Andrew authority
