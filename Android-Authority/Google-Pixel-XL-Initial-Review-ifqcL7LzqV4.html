device is here but we've only had it for
a few days total while we are able to
draw a few conclusions about this device
by now we want to continue testing it
for a full review coming very soon but
for now it's Joshua regard from Android
authority what's going on everybody and
this is our initial review of the Google
pixel XL
Google brings their own design
sensibilities to the Android world and a
phone that was built by them from the
ground up the results are unfortunately
pretty polarizing and we here at Android
Authority are about a split as all of
you are personally I have become kind of
accustomed to what the Nexus brought to
the table some pretty bare-bones looking
phones that had particular quirks that
really differentiated them there's one
quark on the pixel and that's a panel of
glass on the top third of the backing
and while this does differentiate the
pixel from other phones it also feels a
little bit let's say safe and it's also
not all that flashy and it just adds to
what is overall an understated look that
said the phone feels really sturdy and
has a very significant heft to it and
the sides have a very aggressive chamfer
that add texture to the sides now with
the smooth metal backing thankfully that
chamfer will keep the phone from
slipping around even though it does
quite a bit already and there is a
little bit more heft on the top and
bottom portions of the device making it
feel taller than it probably should have
been that said however it still feels
solid and with one hand you will have to
perform some gymnastics to really get
around
now Google opted for AMOLED screens for
the pixel phones and the smaller pixel
comes in at 1080p resolution this one is
a XL with 5.5 inches in the screen a
quad HD resolution and everything looks
pretty damn good on it a lot of YouTube
videos were viewed in the last few days
everything from animated shorts to daily
vlogs and they all look wonderful at
720p resolution and above now this is
the first phone to support the
snapdragon 801 and it comes as no
surprise that the pixel XL performs
beautifully consider also that this is
pure Android the streamlined and fully
put together version by Google that is
supposed to provide the pure experience
now that's not to say that other Android
devices lack in the speed Department
there just seems to be a great deal of
attention to detail that Google put into
this phone in terms of the user
experience transitions all look so
smooth and going around all the elements
is just a breeze and it feels like this
is definitely the poster child for what
Android should feel like we will be
playing with more games and performing
more tasks in the coming days especially
with multitasking features but so far
the pixel excel is a good poster child
for the Snapdragon 820 1 now hardware
might actually be a bit of a sore point
for the Google
so phones mostly because of storage now
you're ready paying a hefty price for
these phones and if you want 128
gigabytes for either of them you're
going to pay even more now this case I
have a 32 gigabyte device and with Final
Fantasy games installed on here I only
had half of that available for all the
4k recording I wanted to do now it is
true that pixel owners will be able to
upload at full resolution all photos and
videos but having to find Wi-Fi and then
allow the Google Photos app to clean up
the camera folder these are steps that I
just I'm not used to just yet
sound is a welcome highlight for the
pixel a phone that is supposed to take
voice inputs at any time and as long as
it's near enough to hear my voice it
will pick it up and I can do any query
or question for the Google assistant
pretty easily so to that end this bottom
mounted speaker which obviously won't be
as good as let's say dual front-facing
speakers actually does a really good job
it just might be the best one of its
kind and like I said it does a really
good job of having you hear the Google
assistant clearly for example ok Google
how are you doing today I've had a great
day I was just looking up some fun
things to do a 30 450 million power
battery and here actually does a pretty
average to above-average job so far I've
only had it for a few days but I have
done some pretty aggressive use over the
last couple of days in particular using
GPS navigation a lot of music playing
and of course using the Google assistant
and to that end I was able to get about
16 hours with three and a half to four
hours of screen on time definitely
making it to the end of the day which
brings me to an interesting change I
noticed in my battery usage of course
screen on time is really important but I
found myself using audio more often
simply because of the Google assistants
after all when using the Google
assistant you can get what's called a
daily briefing now the daily briefing
will have Google assistant just say good
morning to you tell you the weather any
calendar entries you have and then from
there it can move straight into a
somewhat podcast like player that plays
a curated list of different news
briefings from NPR or The Wall Street
Journal on any given morning so far in
the last three to four days I have been
able to listen to NPR Wall Street
Journal and tech news for about an hour
to two hours so if you end up using the
Google assistant especially for features
like that you will see that
Trick show up in your battery stats
which brings us to the cameras now we
have a rear-facing main camera with 12
point 3 megapixels @f 2.0 aperture any 4
facing unit shooting 8 megapixels now
the cameras on here will look similar to
that of the Nexus 6p but there are a few
key enhancements here first of all the
Google camera looks very similar to what
you would pretty much expect from the
Nexus from before and it has all of the
different features you would expect
panoramas along with photosphere lens
blur and slow motion of 120 frames per
second if at 1080p resolution HDR is now
HDR plus a version of it that is
actually pretty much always on if you
have hdr+ on auto it will attempt to add
some of those enhancements and pretty
much every photo that you take and to
that end hdr+ does a pretty good job of
adding vibrance to the color while
bringing down the highlights in
particularly blown out areas which
brings us to the main feature of the
pixel XL that I at least am really
excited for video stabilization
essentially there's no optical image
stabilization on this camera and it uses
a software based stabilization that uses
information from the gyroscope and
you'll be able to see the change from
stabilization off to stabilization on
now one of the best parts about this is
that the video stabilization can be used
one recording in 4k which is not that
common when it comes to Android devices
the best part is that there's a lack of
a jello effect that you will usually get
with other software based stabilizations
and even if the movements feel a little
bit robotic they are much better than
the alternative
overall the camera has already been very
impressive and I would say even at this
early outset that it's better than most
shooters out there we will continue to
do testing and comparisons with other
Android devices so we can really see
where the pixel stands among the rest
now unfortunately it is unclear whether
this version of Android will make it to
other non Google branded devices and
that might be a shame because 7.1 is a
delight to use mostly due to the Google
assistant and if you've never used it
before you should definitely check out
Google a low and see if you enjoy it if
you do imagine having that functionality
baked into the very core of your
smartphone now we will score this phone
on its own merits but I have to bring
you a thought I've had plenty of times
over the last three to four days if the
rest of Android didn't exist this phone
would be one of the best thing
to ever come out unfortunately the rest
of the Android world does exist and
there are plenty of devices out there
that provide more for much lower price
points but the other thought that keeps
nagging at me is that the pixels so far
seems to have damn near perfected the
basics of an Android device something
that plenty of other Android phones have
inexplicably faltered at as always thank
you guys very much for watching and I
hope you enjoyed this initial review of
the Google pixel excel this is our first
review of this mostly because we only
had a short time with it thus far and we
wanted to do further testing on it to
make sure that our conclusions
definitely hold weight we will also do
some comparisons so you might see some
of those in our full review and you
might get some second opinions because
I'm not the only one here at AAA that
has one of these phones stay tuned for
that and even more about the Google
pixel line of phones including this
excel in my hand right here and you can
stay tuned here by subscribing to our
channel if you haven't already and
remember to drop us some likes on these
videos because we love to see those
thumbs up from there stick around for
even more about this and beyond in the
world of Android because we are of
course your source for all things
