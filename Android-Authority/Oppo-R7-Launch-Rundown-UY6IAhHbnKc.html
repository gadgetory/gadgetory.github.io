authority what's going on everybody and
Darcy and I are here in Beijing China
for the launch of the brand-new Oppo r7
now we might hesitate to call it a
flagship device but it certainly feels
like one and it's a nice trend that's
been happening this year in 2015
phones that may not necessarily hit the
high mark and like let's say the
snapdragons of the world and whatnot but
still provide really great performance
and in the little testing that we've had
with the r7 and the r7 + mind you we
really do think that this might be a
pretty good contender for a great
affordable mid-range device but when we
talk about the event first for a little
bit how did you feel about the
presentation and everything we did have
working translators around that used to
be a problem but we were able to hear
what everyone was saying and had a lot
of showy interviews and everything like
how'd you feel about the well you know
obviously we're dealing with a very
different culture but it's a culture
that you know produces some of the best
technology in the world you know the
specs and everything that we're looking
at I think it's pretty impressive the
inclusions are gbbw sensor you know the
ISO cell
from my experience testing it you know
the photos that took we're really fast
and we're really really bright punchy
colors yeah thing is we're also dealing
with an AMOLED screen response which I
think was a very nice touch but you know
if you got the punch in the photos but
you also get a punch in the screen
itself so double punch you know you're
gonna get a pretty good-looking photo
and that's what we kind of saw on there
other specifications the r7 + has the
same specs mostly but there are a couple
of mean editions on it and what were
those it has the the laser sort of
similar to what LG is doing so it's
going to have that salsa kind of a
fingerprint sensor a nice 4100 milliamp
battery with rapid charging the Boop you
know and 6 inch so 10 MP panel also as
well with the Snapdragon 615 3 gigs of
ram the price point is pretty aggressive
- it's gonna be enough for 30 US dollars
so the r7 + though like you know we'll
go ahead and address this right now you
probably saw our first look videos
already and you saw the r7 plus it looks
kind of familiar don't you think it does
it's like if you you know basically made
it an iPhone 6 plus and a now a 77
yeah it's like the two phones kind of
like how to love like the the
fingerprint sensor on the back if it's
anything like the one that's on the maid
said it's going to be a very nice
performer just put your finger on there
and really just sort of comes up really
nice had a pretty good one in the end
three and yeah but the thing is it's not
a button on the back so that might be
just one little setback on there but for
the most part if it's anything like the
mate7
fingerprint reader not scanner but
reader then yeah I think it'll work
technology behind that's pretty mature
at this point so I'm sure it'll be
excellent I mean for me the r7 plus you
know definitely the more beautiful at
the - I really love that you know the
bezel to display body size ratio is
really aggressive it I think is probably
gonna be in the high 70s so definitely
up there yeah about our location while
we talk about us being here further
before the most by me actually in a
place where it's not bearing down on us
we're actually had this event that I
have some memories that because this was
the first Chinese event that I actually
went to yeah uh yeah it was the n1 and
this was this venue was the one to use
for the n1 also is the first time I I
think I traveled across the pond for for
any of the stuff that I cover and you
know coming back here it's a little bit
surreal the bird's nest is like right
over there you could just barely see the
Olympic Stadium that was out there man
it's just fantastic job I mean you know
to organize events like this you know
what it takes in terms of the amount of
investment of energy and the people and
logistics I mean what they've done in
there it's like it looks like kind of
like a royal gala you know then they
have all the panning booms and speakers
and you know they have the smoke kind of
cascading and glowing and I mean it
really looks pretty impressive stuff
actually yeah the person they have maybe
even have someone like a beautiful
presenter yeah exactly yeah the host
right yeah exactly and she was
interviewing all of the people and you
know this is obviously you know we're
dealing with an event that is supposed
to commemorate the 10 years that opals
been around and it was it was a lot of
what's the term that I could use here
the algae
looking back you know because although
you know they're a legacy company based
on California I'll put digital they
produce best-in-class blue air players D
ACS you know they're just pretty
fantastic audio equipment and and audio
products so a lot of that legacy
technology goes into the products today
so it was just kind of a look back you
know had their first little mp3 player
ten years ago like the first one was a
ten to fifteen minutes was just about
their history and actually right across
of the way right here you have the
history of Oppo and you'll see a couple
shots of that right now so you know we
did feel like we were let's say
privileged to be a part a part of this
what is his historical event for OPA but
you know really of course the focus was
the two phones and they look like
they're working pretty well thus far
even if even if the software's gonna be
updated even if this isn't necessarily
final we do like what we see so far
absolutely yeah
and we're also hearing a little bit
murmuring surround the fine nine so
unfortunate we can't really divulge
anything around that but it sounds like
it'll be a pretty exciting device yeah
well we're always like sort of probing I
mean like every every second every
second that we have available is I go
what about that next one alright well
coming to you from the yeah coming you
coming you from the Oppo event here in
Beijing China just a stone's throw away
from the bird's nest the Olympic Village
here in Beijing China we are here Darcy
and Josh here for the Oppo r7 launch
