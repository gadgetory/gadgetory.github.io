what's going on everybody and Darcy
night are here in Beijing China for the
launch of the brand new Oppo r7 now we
might hesitate to call it a flagship
device but it certainly feels like one
and it's a nice trend that's been
happening this year in 2015 phones that
may not necessarily hit the high mark
and like let's say the snapdragons of
the world and whatnot but still provide
really great performance and in the
little testing that we've had with the
r7 and the r7 plus mind you we really do
think that this might be a pretty good
contender for a great affordable
mid-range device but when we talk about
the event first for a little bit how did
you feel about the presentation and
everything we did have working
translators this time around I bet used
to be a problem but we were able to hear
what everyone was saying and had a lot
of showy interviews and everything like
how did you feel about the well you know
obviously we're doing with a very
different culture but it's a culture
that you know producing some of the best
technology in the world you know the
specs and everything that we're looking
at i think is pretty impressive the
inclusions RGBW sensor you know the ice
is hell from my experience testing it
you know the photos that took really
fast and we're really really bright
pottery colors yeah and but the thing is
we're also dealing with an AMOLED screen
against phones which I think was a very
nice touch but you know if you got a
punch in the photos but you also get a
punch in the screen itself so double
punch you know you're going to get a
pretty good looking photo and that's
what we kind of saw on their other
specifications the r7 plus has the same
specs mostly but there are a couple of
mean additions on it what were those it
has the the laser sort of similar to
what LG's doing so it's going to have
that salsa kind of a fingerprint sensor
a nice 40 100 million battery with rapid
charging the poop you know and 6 inch so
1080p panel also as well with the
Snapdragon 615 three gigs of ram the
price point is pretty aggressive too
it's going to be around for 30 US
dollars so there are 7 plus though like
you know we'll go ahead and address this
right now you probably saw our first
look videos already and you saw the r7
plus it looks kind of familiar don't you
think it does it's like if you you know
basically made it an iphone 6 plus and a
homeboy 77 yeah so good
yeah it's like the two phones kind of
like had a love child like the the
fingerprint sensor on the back if it's
anything like the one that's on the made
seven is going to be a very nice
performer just put your finger on there
and really just sort of comes up really
nice opal we had a pretty good one in
the end three and yeah but the thing is
it's not a button on the back so that
might be just one little setback on
there but for the most part if it's
anything like the made seven fingerprint
reader not scanner but reader then yeah
I think it'll work really well
technology behind that's pretty mature
at this point so I'm sure it'll be
excellent I mean for me the r7 plus you
know definitely the more beautiful at
the two I really love that you know the
bessel to display your body size ratio
is really aggressive it i think is
probably gonna be in the high 70 so
definitely up there yeah about our
location when we talk about us being
here for the reform for the most by me
like hot lucky that the phone is like
actually in a place where it's not
bearing down on us we're actually at
this event that i have some memories at
because this was the first Chinese event
that I actually went to the yeah uh yeah
the unwind by one it was the m1 and this
was this venue was the one to use for
the n1 also is the first time I I think
I traveled across the pond for for any
of the stuff that back cover and you
know coming back here it's a little bit
surreal the bird's nest is like right
over there you could just barely see the
Olympic Stadium that was out there man
it's just uh that's really nice
fantastic job I mean you know to
organize events like this you know what
it takes in terms of the amount of
investment of energy and people and
logistics I mean what they've done in
there it's like it looks like kind of
like a royal gala you know the end they
have all the panning booms and speakers
and you know they have the smoke kind of
cascading and glowing and he's really
looks pretty impressive stuff actually
yeah the person and they have they even
have someone like the beautiful
presenter I guess yeah exactly yeah the
host right look and personality yeah
exactly and she was interviewing all of
the people and you know this is
obviously you know we're dealing with an
event that supposed to commemorate the
ten years I'd always been around and so
you know Dan it was it was a lot of was
the term that I could use here the algin
of yeah
looking back you know because oppo you
know their legacy company based on
California I'll put digital they produce
best-in-class blu-ray players d ACS you
know they just pretty fantastic audio
equipment and and audio products so a
lot of that legacy technology goes into
the products today so it was just kind
of a look back you know other first
little mp3 player 10 years ago like the
first one was a 10 to 15 minutes was
just about their history and actually
right across of the way right here you
have the history of elbow and you'll see
a couple shots of that right now so you
know we did feel like we were let's say
privileged to be a part a part of this
what is his historical event for oppo
but you know really of course the focus
was the two phones and they look like
they're working pretty well thus far
even if even if the software is going to
be updated even if this isn't
necessarily final we do like what we see
so far absolutely yeah and we are also
hearing a little bit of a murmuring
surround the fine nine so unfortunate we
can't really divulge anything around
that but it sounds like it'll be a
pretty exciting device yeah well we're
always like sort of probing I mean like
every every second every second that we
have available is I go what about that
next one I know that's what we do you
know we want to dig deep for the people
and you know deliver the very best all
right well coming to you from the I
don't even know what the name of those
choices yeah coming you coming you from
the Oppo event here in Beijing China
just a stone's throw away from the birds
nests the Olympic Village here in
Beijing China we are here Darcy and Josh
