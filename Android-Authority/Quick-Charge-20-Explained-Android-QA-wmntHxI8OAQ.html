to you by HipChat plus so for both the
casual user and the certified Android
geek battery life has become the new
battleground when it comes to a mobile
device innovation so the question is
what is quick charge 2.0 how does it
work and is it worth it now the reality
is current mobile battery capacity often
cannot meet the needs of power users
like you and me so the next best thing
is to shorten the time it takes to
charge those batteries and that's where
quick charge 2.0 comes in before we get
into that into detail let's talk about
just exactly how charging works to begin
with
essentially batteries are charged by the
current delivered to them by the power
source applying additional current at a
set battery voltage results in more
power which can result in faster
charging but also requires sturdier
charging components that can withstand
those higher power levels different amp
specifications on different charging
adapters alter the time it takes to
charge your phone but there's a maximum
limit to how much current can be pushed
through so quick charge 2.0 is supported
by all of Qualcomm latest system on a
chips and the bottom line is that
they're designed to charge your phone at
a faster rate than previous versions but
how well does it work with battery life
still struggling to accommodate the
needs of the heaviest smartphone users
reducing charging times is the next best
thing
Qualcomm quick charge technology aims to
do just that
the latest 2.0 version boasts up to 75%
faster charging times than standard
devices and HTC stats that are using the
rapid charge 2.0 adapter states that you
can charge your smartphone 60 percent in
just 30 minutes now the obvious question
is do you need a new power adapter and
in short yes if you check the current
rating of the mains adapter that came
with your smartphone you'll probably
find that it's rated anywhere between
one and two amps depending on its age
quick charge 2.0 can juice up from a
maximum of 3 amps so you'll need a mains
plug source capable of outputting a
higher amount of current than your
typical phone charger to make full use
of the technology now the good news is
you don't have to worry about branding
even though most manufacturers make
their own adaptors most of them are
cross compatible so how do you know if
your device is quick charge 2.0
compatible well we can start here this
Snapdragon 200 400 410 615 800 801 805
and a 10 our quick charge 2.0 compatible
so guys I'm curious what matters to you
most when it comes to battery life would
you just prefer that manufacturers give
you a removable battery so you can have
multiple batteries to backup or would
you like more technologies and
innovations like quick charge 2.0 which
charges your device quicker or just
bigger batteries which is gonna mean
slightly thicker phones let me know what
you think so many of you will know that
I've been with Android authority well
over a year now and I've worked very
closely with the team of 22 22 people
and yet I've never met any of them
personally ever how do we do that
well we need great collaboration tools
and boy do we need a tool like this one
HipChat plus is an instant messaging
video chat document sharing screen
sharing code sharing all integrated into
one simple platform and the best part is
that HipChat integrates with the top
developer tools like github JIRA Zendesk
and check out the fifty-seven services
that HipChat plays nice with HipChat
allows your team to be productive now
now HipChat has a great deal for all of
you if you go to HipChat comm forward
slash
android authority right now you can sign
up for a free 30-day trial but it gets
even better if you're quick for the
first hundred signups
hip chats willing to extend their 30-day
trial to 90 days but move quickly
because those hundred signups are gonna
go really fast
check out HipChat com forward slash
Android authority thanks for watching
Android army my name is Jace I'd love to
connect with you right here on Google+

brethren in Android Jos Jo in the tech
ninja Kevin Vaughn and Chris Gary and
ash all working real hard to deliver the
best Android content on the web you
don't want to miss our CES coverage
there's a lot of it and it's a lot of
great stuff I should see you next week
