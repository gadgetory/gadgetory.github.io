revised edition of the me for intended
for india it's being marketed as an
affordable flagship but is it really any
different from other mid-range devices
this is Bailey Stein with Android
authority and this is my full review of
the Xiaomi me for I the me 4i is
different from the me for in a few ways
most visibly InDesign gone is the
aluminum frame and glossy plastic rear
instead Xiaomi has opted for a matte
polycarbonate unibody design me Fry's
design definitely feels familiar
but it still manages to both look and
feel great the side edges make the phone
easy to grip and the compact size makes
one-handed use very comfortable the
phone is both thinner and lighter than
the me for at 7.8 millimeters and 130
grams the power and volume buttons which
are on the right side of the device are
both clicky and positioned nicely the
three capacitive keys at the bottom
recent apps home and back are each
illuminated white on the top there's a
five megapixel front facing camera and
to the right of that there's a
notification LED as is the case with all
Xiaomi devices you can choose between
seven different LED colors based on the
notification type in the system settings
the me four eyes 5-inch 1080p display
looks excellent and has great viewing
angles color reproduction is excellent
color temperature is neutral and the
display just looks really good overall
sunlight readability is also very good
thanks to SHINee's technology that makes
Hardware level adjustments to improve
visibility while in bright environments
powered by the second generation
octa-core 64-bit Snapdragon 615 the me
4i performs well enough for most use
cases four of the cores are collect at
1.7 gigahertz and the other four cores
are clocked at one gigahertz it does
feel a tad sluggish when compared to
flagship phones which is to be expected
since the 615 is Qualcomm's mid-range
chip still the device's performance is
in disagreement with Xiaomi's flagship
marketing xiaomi did say that they
worked closely with Qualcomm to ensure
that the device would not overheat and
while there have been a few complaints I
haven't had any issues with my unit it
did get a bit warm after
a few benchmark tests but it wasn't
enough for me to consider it as an issue
there's also two gigabytes of RAM which
should be enough for most users me why
six is pretty memory intensive however
so you're left with just over one
gigabyte of memory on boot the best we
can do is hope that Xiaomi will improve
memory management in future versions of
me UI coupled with the audrina four or
five GPU the me four I was able to play
games without any issues
the me 4i supports Bluetooth 4.1 802 11
AC Wi-Fi and GPS call quality was very
good on the me 4i and I could hear
callers loud and clear there is dual SIM
card support and you can use 4G with
either of these slots well it does
support 4G LTE in India and a few other
markets you are limited to HSPA+ on
either AT&amp;amp;T or t-mobile within the
United States please be sure to check
the frequency list to verify carrier
compatibility before purchasing the me
Fry's rear speaker is on the bottom
below the xiaomi logo and some
regulatory information unfortunately the
speaker isn't as large as the grill may
lead you to believe but it still sounds
pretty good
unlike most budget devices the audio
output doesn't sound distorted at full
volume and the small bump keeps
distortion to a minimum when set on a
flat surface
the 13 megapixel rear camera is
according to xiaomi sourced from either
sony or samsung regardless the me 4i
takes great photos for the price shots
appeared to be sharp and crisp
especially those taken using sharm ease
advanced HDR mode the me UI camera app
hasn't changed from other Xiaomi devices
and I think it offers just the right
amount of control without feeling
overwhelming for example the focus ring
actually allows you to adjust exposure
even while in automatic mode the Xiaomi
me fries 31 20 milliamp internal battery
was able to get me from about 7 a.m. to
about 11:30 p.m. with just over 4 hours
of screen on time during that time I was
using 18 t had Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on
and the brightness was set to about 90%
battery life is definitely solid it
should get virtually all users through a
full day of use if you do manage to
drain the battery completely Xiaomi says
that you can use quick charging to get
the device from zero to 40 percent
within an hour the Xiaomi me for I
shipped with me I six on top of Android
5.0 point 2 lollipop Mui is one of the
heavier Android skins but it does add
quite a bit to the Android experience it
has received some criticism for looking
too much like iOS but I still think it
offers an excellent software experience
meai gives you a greater level of
control and customization throughout
which you can't really find in other
android skins features like lockscreen
notifications heads-up notifications do
not disturb and card style multitasking
we're all present in me--why 6 before
android 5.0 lollipop was released in
addition to me you eyes unique take on
each of those it also offers a themed
store more powerful data usage
management tools battery saving profiles
which can be automatically activated
based on the time app permissions in
call recording in so much more all of
the system apps are high quality and
consistent with shell means design
language while the launcher is great at
helping organize apps it does not
include an app drawer the Settings app
also feels a bit overwhelming when
compared to stock Android and quite
frankly unorganized there isn't a search
function making finding
stock setting menu is very difficult at
times Xiaomi has been very slow at
releasing Android version updates
recently as well so if we do see an
Android M update it likely won't be
until mid to late 2016
hopefully xiaomi can find a way to
update their large portfolio devices
more promptly with android m the xiaomi
mi4i is currently available in white for
13,000 rupees within india or about two
hundred and forty dollars on import
other color options including gray pink
blue and yellow should become available
soon each model ships with 16 gigabytes
of on-board storage which cannot be
expanded that's not a whole lot and may
be a problem for some users who use a
lot of apps or want to store large files
the Xiaomi me 4i is a really good phone
for a great price but it's definitely
not a flagship and it shouldn't be
marketed as one either although it does
have an excellent design great display
and a good software experience it does
have a couple of things that hold it
back from the flagship status the
Snapdragon 615 only offers mid-range
performance and the sixteen gigabytes of
internal storage may not be enough for
some users so should you buy the me 4i
instead of the zenfone 2 or Idol three
after all each phone offers similar
specifications so which one is the best
the answer to that question is going to
depend on your personal preferences in
my opinion the me 4i is the best choice
for users wanting the best overall
experience rather than just a few really
strong points if you're willing to give
me UI a shot the me 4i is an excellent
choice for the price thank you for
