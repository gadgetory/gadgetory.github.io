by Nokia with great build quality and an
operating system that utilizes tiles and
on the other hand you have an Android
phone by HTC with great build quality
and an operating system that utilizes
tiles hey it's Josh McArthur manager
authority what's going on everybody and
this is the HTC One versus the Nokia
Lumia 928 this just might be the closest
battle I've ever done when it comes to
design it's no secret that the HTC One
is an incredibly well put together phone
whether it's aluminum chassis and unique
form factor the sides are flat and
despite being a little ankle do they
help with the grip the aluminum adds to
the phone handling and even though it's
not really fingerprint prone it can be
quite slippery to the touch two
capacitive keys lie under the screen up
front while the power button is up top
with the volume rockers on the right the
opinion that HTC hit a homerun with
design here is pretty unanimous I even
got the stealth black version which to
me makes it even better the only
complaint would have to be the rounded
thickness the back is very opulent it
rock back and forth if you use it on the
table from the aluminum we go to plastic
and for the Nokia Lumia 928 this
actually isn't a bad thing
the 928 is a glossy plastic covered
device that is thicker than the one and
less rounded this rectangular form
factor brings quite thick flat sides
that make it very easy to grip three
capacitive keys are on the front while
the HTC One has the screen slightly
larger the 928 brings a very accessible
screen size of four and a half inches
there is a simplicity here similar to
the HTC One as you can see on the back
it is all white only with the camera
optics atop a black line down the middle
glossy plastic makes this phone pretty
fingerprint prone and the gloss does
give it that potential to slip around
just as much as the one obviously this
comes down to a question of materials
plastic or metal both phones benefit
from smaller screen sizes and the reform
factors are easy in the hand there is an
elegant simplicity to both of these
devices that make them very attractive
so it's a matter of what you actually
want your phone to look like and how you
want it to feel we might not be working
with five inch screens here but these
displays do very well well start with
the smaller one the 928 has a four and a
half inch Super AMOLED screen
capable of 1024 by 768 resolution at 332
PPI coming in at around 720 resolution
makes this a good performer it greatly
complements the high contrast colorful
motif of Windows Phone 8 with its high
saturation a lower pixel density doesn't
hurt text viewing too much so this
screen is an easy handler made for work
in play and then we upped the ante with
the 4.7 inch Super LCD screen of the HTC
One has pretty much the only screen
under 5 inches capable of 1080p
resolution this display is also rated at
a whopping 469 PPI as such you get great
resolution in a very accessible size it
isn't as saturated as usual AMOLED
screens but it handles the darker tones
of sense 5 greatly Media looks great due
to the resolution but that pixel density
also makes text razor sharp how much do
you want out of your smart phone screen
those wanting super high performance can
look to the HTC One for all their needs
just don't count the 928 out as its
specs are more than adequate for
everyday use performance might widen the
gap between these two phones starting
with the HTC One it was one of the first
phones to support the snapdragon 600
power processor that clocks in at 1.7
gigahertz it is an incredibly fast
processing package that is backed by the
tried and true
Adrina 320 and 2 gigabytes of ram scores
put the HTC One squarely among the best
phones in the android market and through
blinkfeed and sense 5 it's easy to see
the speed Lumia 928 sports a package
that would consider more mid-range in
the Android space with its dual-core
Snapdragon s4 plus clocked in at 1.5
gigahertz backed by the audrina two to
five and one gigabyte of RAM while US
Android users might lament this package
in current android experiences it works
perfectly for the definitely less
demanding Windows Phone 8 ultimately
despite the big gap on paper these are
top performers for their respective
ecosystems fast will be on the agenda no
matter which one you go for the hardware
situation starts off simple enough both
of these phones don't sport expandable
memory and have non removable batteries
both come with 32 gigabytes of on-board
storage though the HTC One can also be
found with 64 gigabytes that's where the
similarities end
we'll start with the HTC One which comes
with the usual bevy of connections
Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS and NFC the editions
include Beats Audio which is not
customizable but does a good job of
adding more richness and volume to music
and IR blaster enhances your TV
experience the phone speaker is good if
not exceptional speaking of speakers
boom sound obviously these are getting a
big mention as they are exemplary
front-facing speakers there are light
years better than anything else for
sharing media with others
the 928 on the other hand comes with the
same usual bits of hardware including
NFC as a verizon exclusive phone it
connects to the carrier's great and fast
LTE networks something that the HTC One
can only currently boast on the smaller
Sprint network both speakers suffer from
the same problem while they're adequate
get too loud and it starts to get fuzzy
and drown out details let's relieve the
story here
there isn't much truly separating the
928 from the HTC One which is a bit of a
detriment but rest assured that
everything you do get on the 928 is
reliable just not as exciting in the
battery department we're dealing with a
2,300 milliamp hour performer in the HTC
One and a 2,000 milliamp hour unit in
the Lumia 928 the difference isn't all
that huge between the two and it mostly
shows and usage impressively the HTC One
has been reported to get up to ten hours
of web browsing and video playback I got
to around 8 hours the 928 got right
above 6 hours but where it shines is in
standby time
I've kept it sitting for hours on end
without a big change to battery life
power saving options are available on
both devices so while the HTC One will
let you play for longer you'll get a
good days of work done easily either way
now both cameras take on special
features to bring out the best quality
pictures in lowering the megapixel count
so for HTC focused these ultra pixels to
get the best possible photos the app
benefits from HTC Zoe a program that can
put together your photos and videos into
lovely montages other scenes include HDR
and panorama picture quality really is
very good especially in low-light
situations these for ultra pixels really
flood in a lot of light to make indoor
shots pop even if the pictures are
smaller in size HTC did a fine job with
their new unique shooter the Lumia 928
instead takes the common 8 megapixel
camera and throws a lot of enhancing
features in this carl zeiss powered
shooter ads in PureView technology and
even a xenon flash to achieve good
results the app is pretty standard but
can be enhanced with downloaded add-ons
called lenses over all the pictures are
good the Carl Zeiss optics do well while
the peer reviews
helps with indoor and low light shots of
course if you need it you have that
xenon flash as well now if the size of
the picture really matters to you the
choice is a little simpler here but with
the same spirit for picture quality
either way you'll ultimately end up with
good results and here comes the software
we're looking at two exceptional mobile
operating systems in Windows Phone 8 and
HTC Sense 5 version of Android we'll
start with the 928 and Windows Phone 8
it is an incredibly simple user
interface that manages to be simply
elegant and highly intuitive at the same
time what you get is a black or white
background with primary colors on top
the live tiles are your shortcuts but in
the new version they give you extra
information when you resize them it
gives you exactly what you need nothing
too much more as far as apps go the
Windows Phone ecosystem obviously has
quite a ways to go before it rivals
Android but what you do get baked into
Lumias wp8 works pretty well now on the
other end
HTC took their love it or hate it Sense
UI and give it a major overhaul in the
HTC One well used to look bloated and
somewhat too spaced out has been a bit
flattened it's still a little spaced out
but cleaning things up really helped the
real addition here is blinkfeed which
pretty effectively replaces your home
screens it is a tiled amalgamation of
your news and social networks if you
have a ton of sources it might be a
little overwhelming but it isn't too
hard to narrow it down it also isn't
hard to get back to a more familiar
looking Android if this was an earlier
version of sense I honestly think the
HTC One wouldn't get quite as much
praise but with version 5 it brings a
fresh look and feel that is a good leap
forward so it's a battle of the tiles
while Windows Phone 8 takes the
simplistic style to the max you get the
same idea in blinkfeed which is on top
of an already powerful Android platform
as ecosystems go Android still offers
much more than Windows Phone but if you
just want to get back to basics the 928
is still a fine choice and finally price
unlocked the HTC One takes on the
premium price of six hundred and ninety
nine dollars quite a bit over the $500
price tag of the Lumia 928 on two-year
contracts however the HTC One generally
gets around the 199 dollar price point
while the Lumia 928 can actually be
found for much less $49 a fish
though it just dropped to $29.99 on
Amazon Wireless and so there you have it
when it's all said and done we find that
both of these phones share some
philosophies good build quality uniquely
feature-packed cameras and tiled
operating systems both excel at what
they set out to do if you want a bigger
ecosystem the HTC One is backed by
Android while the Lumia 928 packs
reliable built-in software with an
ecosystem that is still growing
ultimately Windows Phone does have its
place in the mobile space but the HTC
One would sense five is a great example
of how diverse the Android Market is
which means it's also a great example of
why us Android users don't easily
