Android
an application review for you this one
is called tasks and to do's well a few
background information on this is
actually it is made by handy apps
incorporated and make a few other apps
including easy money build reminder
stuff like that this is a simple task
management app it's not the ones that
wipe your applications but it is the app
that definitely keeps your life
organized no matter when it comes to
work school or any other tests I think
it does a really good job of doing this
it's pretty simple in design I think and
the scrolling of course is a little
lucky because i'm using adapter cord but
it's it's nice what's really easy you
have different tasks lists you can also
make a task this by pressing the add
button and say if i wanted to add a task
within the list i would go into the
added list and then add a task from
their title test and i have it in say
american studies and said the due date
would be tomorrow said it save it simple
really i think that in you so so getting
into it if you want to if you complete a
simon or job or whatever you would click
the checkmark and complains down here
and you can also delete it if you want I
just recommend deleting up because
what's the sense of keeping it around
anyway and this is also compatible with
Google Tasks Google Tasks is a great
management add-on for your google
account you can access it through your
gmail calendar as well as I google which
is a widget home page just sink you
basically just sign in with your account
which i already did it will give you an
option to sign them with the different
gmail account so you have depending on
which one you'd like to use with google
tasks i already have mine set up so to
basically enable it I just click the
sync button it's syncing with the Google
Tasks server and it's just about
completed now what ever will
sink there will also sync with the
widget the widget comes in a variety of
sizes so I were to go in here I can
scroll and see tasks into dues 2 by 4 3
by 4 4 by 3 4 by 4 yes very fast there
and honeycomb version for tablets as
well as compatibility for ice cream
sandwich you're welcome Galaxy Nexus I
don't know what that message is still
there I think some of the messages on my
phone keep their longer than they're
supposed to that shouldn't happen with
you though so the whatever sinks here
usually you have to sync it autumn
annually depending on your sync settings
so I should get a little thing that
comes up it takes a while to refresh but
because i'm running a bunch of died of
running a screencast we're just taking
up all the cpu right now and yeah so
this is what happens but basically it's
super simple to just set it and forget
on this app something you have problems
I've had was actually real deal sync
issues it's not really thinking at all
sometimes but you can also change the
what it is to go back into again you can
also change it throwing one tme
bloatware apps you can also change it to
you know i'm so if i go into settings
here i'm sorry i'm sedona go to settings
sync sync automatically manually i think
only manually is appropriate for this
because honestly if you to sync
automatically it's not really a jeep at
an email lack of application and you
know when you're gonna do tasks cuz
you're actually probably doing it
yourself so oops i think manually would
be the idea and that's about it this app
also comes in a paid version of 499 what
you get with that is pretty much two
simple things you get restricted in how
many lists and tasks you're allowed to
carry on time with the 499 paid version
you can do unlimited tax and unlimited
lists as well as a bad free bottom so
what that curves it up for you this is
probably
of the best applications for test
management on the marker right now as it
connects with your computer without any
problems like against such an
application just Wunderlist I found
wonderless to be a pain in my butt
because honestly that app it's just it
doesn't work because I had certain list
that I'd want to show on my widget and
it would never show that so I hope this
clarifies this a little bit this is
tasks into dues by haydee a pink right
app try it out we'll hear from android
authority thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
