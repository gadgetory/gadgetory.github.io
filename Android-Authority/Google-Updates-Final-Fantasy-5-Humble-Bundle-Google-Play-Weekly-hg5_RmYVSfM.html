code Android 9 hello again ladies and
gentleman I'm Joe handy the Android
authority app guy and welcome back to
Google Play weekly episode 7 we have a
lot of great things to talk about this
week Google has updated all the things
the latest Humble Bundle is awesome and
Final Fantasy 5 has been released by
square-enix
we have that and a lot more so let's get
started
if Google updating their applications
dominated our headlines this week so
we're gonna talk about them first the
two big applications to get updated were
Gmail and hangouts both brought the
boilerplate bug fixes and performance
enhancements but they also brought a few
new functions as well on the Gmail side
of things email conversations have been
redone in the style of the popular card
UI like you find in Google now this is a
welcome improvement that helps you keep
track of your email conversations for
hangouts among other things new
indicators will let you know when people
are on an offline the other two Google
Apps to get updated this week for Google
Play movies &amp;amp; TV and Google Play Books
Google Play Books is now available in 8
Asian countries including Taiwan
Indonesia and Hong Kong among others for
play movies and TV the update was
focused primarily on the TV side of
things there is a new on device option
for easier access to shows you've
downloaded for offline viewing the TV
interface has been improved including
smaller cards so you can see more stuff
on the screen episodes are now listed in
sequential order and everything just
seems to be more organized so where Enix
has been slowly releasing my childhood
over the last year and a half some
notable examples include Chrono Trigger
Final Fantasy 3 and Final Fantasy 4 this
last week they released final fantasy 5
and aside from losing an entire day of
work to play the game I'm happy to
report that aside from some graphical
enhancements everything else is the same
as the original Square Enix is doing a
rolling release with this one so it's
not available for all devices yet right
now it's mostly for tablets and a few
smartphones reports are that they are
working out compatibility issues before
releasing to all devices it's a little
pricey at 16 dollars but for final
fantasy fan boys like me it's well worth
it will you've started creating our
Android authority behind the scenes blog
using Squarespace it's our first time
making a blog using Squarespace and it
was actually quite easy
everything is drag-and-drop you can use
drag-and-drop to add content from your
desktop and even rearrange elements of
content within a page even though we
didn't need any support it was
comforting knowing that we had a 24/7
support team in New York City that we
could live chat with during the week and
get extremely fast email support
throughout the day and night tune in
next week as we've showcased the
Squarespace blog that we created you can
get your own blog started right now for
free no credit card required at
Squarespace with a free trial we need to
decide to sign up you can use the promo
code Android 9 to get 20% off Android
device manager got an update of its own
this lie
week and it seems like Google wants
their Device Manager to compete more
favorably against other device managers
the newest update now gives you the
opportunity to password lock your phone
remotely as per the norm for ADM using
the new feature is dead simple you just
have to activate the service on your
device go to the website and you can
lock it down with just a couple of
clicks this is a wildly useful feature
if you lose your phone and we're glad to
see it available with Android device
manager the last item on our list this
week is Humble Bundle the latest Humble
Bundle is out now and it includes six
Android games
this includes the highly anticipated
debut of the game Star Command it's a
real-time strategy that everyone seems
to love also making its debut on Android
with this bundle is time surfer so far
the average price for all six games is
about four dollars and 50 cents which is
far less than it would cost to buy all
of these games separately as anyone can
tell you these bundles are done in the
name of charity so go drop a few bucks
to help those in need and pick up a few
really awesome games for Android while
you're at it so who wants to see some
trending applications this week as usual
if you want any of these applications
the links are in the video description
so who wants to make some gifs our first
app this week is called fix egypt camera
and as the name implies it's a camera
app that turns short videos into gifs
it's very easy to use just point shoot
for a couple of seconds and you have a
jiff that's ready to share anywhere it's
football season we're a few weeks into
the season and it's no surprise that an
NFL game is topping the charts in the
Google Play Store
this one is Madden NFL 25 by EA Sports
and it's actually fairly good the
graphics are decent and the gameplay is
easy which makes it a great football
title for mobile devices if you're a fan
of Jackthreads and you need to do some
clothes shopping Jackthreads has
released an application that will help
you browse their selection better it's
actually a fairly well designed app and
you should have no problem moving around
and finding what you need with autumn
being here they couldn't have picked a
better time to advertise their fall
clothing line if you are not yet aware
focal the camera app was removed from
CyanogenMod for reasons I won't go into
here however if you're a fan of the
open-source camera app you can now find
it in the Google Play Store and it's a
trending app this week it's a great
alternative to the stock camera app and
definitely worth checking out last up
this week is a set of good-looking
Calendar widgets called today calendar
widgets these are neutral colored so
they fit with almost any theme you can
get
full month for you are a number of other
customizable views it is just a widget
so it will open whatever calendar app
you actually use once again I'm Joe
