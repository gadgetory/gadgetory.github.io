authority and I'm coming to you live
from CES 2016 and I'm with a group of a
bunch of very young guys but they're all
very talented very knowledgeable and
they know a lot about the tech space so
we thought we'd have them all here on
the show and since there's so many of
them here I figured maybe we just have
them all introduce themselves
individually and then we'll sort of just
have a little conversation and talk a
little bit about CES and how they all
got started so let's start over here
with you miles all right hi I'm miles
Somerville I've been making youtube
videos for about a little over a year
now and it's really cool to meet all
these guys here at Android Authority and
all these guys finally meeting them in
person for the first time so yeah that's
basically it you can check out my
channel miles Somerville my name is Paul
Bradford I have a youtube channel called
Pole and tech pretty simple thanks for
having this on guys my name is Anton I
have a YouTube channel called ants on a
log and yeah it's been cool to meet all
the people behind the scenes at Android
Authority oh hey guys
ty here and uh I also do a YouTube
channel tied Fujiyama
everywhere Instagram social Twitter and
all that like Fukuyama and it's great to
have it's good to be here
hi guys my name is Kevin Ramsey and you
can find me everywhere using that name
is Kevin Rios basically everywhere hey
guys my name is Victor also known as
everything technology my chose focus on
consumer electronics and you can find me
on Twitter Instagram everywhere at
everything Tech five hi I'm Eric people
also know me as blabber head you can
just search up Eric Anthony and I'm
there first thing I want to ask you guys
is how did you like what made you guys
get started
like making YouTube videos what inspired
you to want to talk about tech because
you're all so young and you know YouTube
is just there's so many different
generations of YouTube youtubers out
there what made you guys want to get
started and how did you all like sort of
meet did you all know each other outside
of YouTube before that or did you all
meet through YouTube yeah I met through
YouTube basically I started making tech
videos simply because I just like taking
my dad you know he's a big nerd too so
he had he had a large influence on me so
I started making videos around December
of last year and we all found each
other's channels and they went on from
there yeah so I actually had a really
old channel when I was like 9 years old
and I made a video about the top 5
Android games and it actually got over
200,000 views but got a lot of hate I
was really young only nine years old
didn't do a very good job so I have that
unlisted now but I remembered how fun it
was to make that video so I started up a
new channel about two years ago called
Poland Tech and I've been making videos
ever since I'm really glad I got to meet
all these people through my youtube
channel and it's been a lot of fun
my my youtube basically started my dad
brought home the Nexus 7
one and I fled with it for a while and I
was like dude this is so cool and then I
just started making like unboxings I
thought I was really cool on YouTube I
was following a bunch of people and just
started trying on my own and then that's
how my youtube channel came along so
yeah I've always been like tech guy and
my family if there wasn't computer
problems like rental cars
I'll be the one that I'll be the go-to
guy and also I was thinking I'm starting
our YouTube channel but at first I
always thought that you need bunch of
new equipments like like DSLRs and all
that but then I saw Danny Wiggy he did
like all his old videos were like taking
on a smartphone and they were really
great so I was like I realized that you
don't need good equipment to make good
content and that's why I started so I
initially started my channel when I was
13 and kind of the incentive to do that
was when all my school friends were
asking me like what do you think about
this tech and this this item I initially
started to realize that like a lot of
people have the same questions and in my
school a lot of my friends were asking
me like you like this tech item and I
just decided to like going out and buy
and return it and just make a review and
post it online and I found a lot of the
same people that had the same interests
at first when I used one of my parents
used to get a lot of different types of
electronics I just like you know just
check him out look up I'm a whole bunch
of how-to videos and reviews and then I
was like why don't I start one day so it
first developed into a hobby then it
became a passion and ever since I've
been doing YouTube for two years so
unlike a lot of other people who like
grew up with tech in their house for a
long time I didn't have internet in my
house until I was 10
but until then like I saw my friends
with you know their fancy new Blackberry
or whatever and I was just so excited by
it so I did everything in my power to
convince my parents to let me buy
something so I ended up like researching
the Samsung Galaxy player and all this
stuff I ended up writing essays so like
from the beginning I love just like
researching and learning about tech just
so that I could get it yeah all right so
the next question I'm gonna keep it real
simple because I know the audience is
probably curious what what phone are you
guys currently using and why alright yes
next is next interview Nexus 5x Nexus 6p
Nexus 6p Nexus 6 feet and
I was originally gonna buy the 5x but
then the the no I was gonna buy the 6p
but then the 5x went on sale for 300 so
I just picked it up and I've been happy
with it ever since but I did get a 6p si
yes
I just haven't opened it yet for me I
had a Moto X 2013 I was sick one night I
came back to my room after I spent the
night downstairs
my brother had taken my phone and threw
it in the toilet two lakes two weeks
later I got the Moto X 2014 I was sick
one night I came back up to my room I
woke up and the phone disappeared so I
got on my hands and knees begged Alcatel
for a unit and that was history for me I
was I've been always using Nexus phones
for a couple of years now I've been
rocking with v for like the past month
and a half so yeah I just picked this up
yesterday wow it was so kind enough to
send these out so shout out to them yeah
I really think the 6p and I think we can
all agree on this it's one of those fun
it's one of the first phones I think
that really doesn't have any major
drawbacks it's just a really
well-rounded device so it's a good daily
driver
yeah I agree with all of you guys that
mean basically the same thing it's an
all-around good phone it doesn't have a
lot of fun negative feedback or anything
like that so yeah you've all been here
at CES for like several days now so
there and there's a ton of stuff to see
I'm pretty sure you guys have had a
chance to sort of cruise around through
all the different halls and and boots
and stuff like that like what is one of
the coolest things that you have seen so
far at the show here for me is a lot of
the stuff they were showing at the Intel
booth there are really a lot of really
cool gaming tech well one of the coolest
things I saw from a small company not
one of the big guys like Samsung or
something
this one little booth had a giant NES
controller probably about the size of
half a table it's pretty cool and I got
to play Mario on it so that was pretty
awesome so my favorite is probably the
Samsung booth they had a giant clear
like OLED display it was clear
transparent and it was probably there
and they said that was their first OLED
like clear display and it was pretty
awesome my favorite was the HTC vive and
I actually got to try it out with the
controllers and the tracking is really
good like I would pick up the
controllers and I would see guns on my
headset and if I moved it around it
would track exactly how the gun would
move and I thought that was really cool
and I got she was on me and so that's
plus
so my parrot booth at CES was definitely
the Razr booth we saw the new blade
stealth the core and like I always like
the the whole like idea of having a
really thin in light like ultrabook like
the MacBook but like when you want to go
home and like edit video and game I
never really found the MacBook appealing
but razors really kicking in some
innovation and making the core like a
desktop docking station for your laptop
so that like I'm gonna check that up for
sure later this year
my favorite booth was an LG booth they
showed off their on their new TV
it's like extremely thin it's actually
the size of four credit cards and it's
in the college was extremely good so I
liked the new blink board from a company
called Acton they made something called
the Rockets case which are essentially
Healy's on steroids with motors so this
year they have an electric skateboard
and it's the smallest and lightest
electric skateboard out there I
definitely couldn't write it and I may
or may not have wrecked a bit of their
booth but it's an awesome product and
I'm excited to check it out this year
being as young as you guys are and being
at like a show like this is this sort of
like a dream come true for you guys and
like how supportive are like their
parents with doing all this stuff like
sort of checking out tech and doing
YouTube sort of as like not necessarily
a job per se but as your passion yeah
for me I'm really I'm really glad to
have made it this year honestly I mean
looking back at around January of last
year I honestly didn't expect to have
gone this far in such a little time or
at least it seems like it hasn't been
that much about long and time at all and
my parents are really supportive my dad
is putting a lot of work to make this
trip happen for me and him and he we've
been enjoying ourselves so far
yes so it's kind of weird for the past
few years watching all the videos from
the big guys like mkbhd Austin Evans
watching their videos here at CES and so
yeah it's kind of weird to finally be
here for myself see some of these guys
in person it's been a lot of fun and
yeah it's interesting my parents were
kind of actually fighting over which one
got to go they wanted to pretty much get
a little vacation in so my dad won that
fight I guess I wanted to go to sea yes
since like two years ago when I just
started doing my YouTube channel
and now it's finally like a dream come
true I got to see all the big youtubers
I guess see all the cool products meet
all the cool companies and yeah it's
just I've been having a really fun time
here and Zoop and true and my parents
have been really supportive taking me
dropping me off helping me get tickets
and everything so yeah shout out to my
parents this is actually my second time
going last year I was by myself it was
really fun but it's just that with with
my girlfriends now it's much more cooler
it's a much better experience and my
parents were pretty support about it
sponsorships having me support the ships
oh yeah
I think all of our parents were really
supportive in this and they really
understand that like this meant a lot to
us to like get together we all kind of
met up online as a group of friends on
YouTube just checking each other's
videos out and that kind of led to us
talking on different social media
platforms and to actually like meet each
other on or in in real life in a text
show it's just a really cool thing and
I've wanted to go for like two or three
years now so it really was a dream come
true my parents have been extremely
supportive since day one since the very
first video I started
I'm very um they actually paid for most
of my trip to get here as well as my
sponsors which was really awesome and
just see us as an experience has opened
up so many opportunities such as this
one well I've known these guys I met
Victor and Tyga in July of 2014
I've known these guys for a long time I
talked to them almost every day you know
on Google Hangouts and stuff and so when
the opportunity came to us that we we
could meet up that we could you know
meet up and go to like one of the
coolest places you could possibly go if
you're a tech youtuber I mean like the
second that I was approved as press my
parents were like all right let's go cuz
they knew how much it meant last year
was actually my first CES ever and that
was a dream come true for me as well and
so what advice you guys have for other
aspiring youtubers that want to be here
that want to come to this show just as
sort of like a final final wrap-up
question what do you what can you tell
other people that want to do this and
what they can do to sort of get
themselves in this position and and be
here at the show I'd say definitely have
a network it's always like like Tyga
said it's always great to have like a
group of friends around you because
we've also brought a lot of
opportunities upon each other that we
wouldn't have had if we weren't together
so definitely have a network and I say
definitely strive to go as press if
you're looking you know to get in touch
with companies because I don't really
help
yeah kinda what miles said it really
helps to have connections on YouTube
trying to make some friends it's a lot
of fun
yeah just make a lot of connections and
it should help you get here I could say
oh do your best and always try hard but
I'm just gonna say that if you just just
make your videos if you don't like them
then don't upload them only do the ones
that you're really proud of and then
eventually people will find you if it's
really good you'll grow big and then you
can finally make your dreams come true
and go to CES me just for YouTube you
need to start now or you don't start at
all because YouTube is getting saturated
every single day there's new youtubers
and new youtubers it's gonna be harder
to get noticed you have to start now or
never and try to make your video as if
it was your last video you ever make I
guess - the younger guys the younger
audience watching this if you really
want to get into CES and you're like
going through like the whole parent
issue because you obviously have to have
an adult with you if you're under 18 I
would explain it to your parents is kind
of like this is an it's an experience
for like you're gonna carry on
throughout your life you're gonna meet
people here that will be like potential
business partners and it's it's an
experience they will carry out
throughout your entire life and that's
what you have to kind of explain to them
and hopefully they'll understand well if
you're gonna tell it to your parents you
you have to like play it smart and know
what you're doing here and you can't
make a fool out of yourself so you know
it's just kind of a basic but play it
smart for me I say find it if you don't
know if you don't already have a tech
community because you find a community
who have like this same around of
sub-base because that will truly help a
lot because you guys could share
information to help each other I would
actually grow yeah and I just say um you
know ask you I mean ask your parents I
mean and just you know they'll probably
support you the best all right so thank
you guys for coming on this show and
joining us this has been a lot of fun
and you should check all these guys out
they make really awesome content really
great high quality videos very
knowledgeable kids
and they're gonna grow up to do some
really great things so we're gonna leave
their links down below so subscribe to
their channel and check them out on
Twitter as well but that's really it
