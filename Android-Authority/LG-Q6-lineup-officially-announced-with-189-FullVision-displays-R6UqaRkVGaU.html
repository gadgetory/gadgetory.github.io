not so much of a fan of the price tag
well that's why LG came up with the LG
q6 now where the most compelling aspects
of the LG G six is its display sporting
unique 89 aspect ratio and a resolution
of 1440 by 2880 the problem is to get
one of these high-end screens you need
to buy into the high-end price
thankfully LG is focused on bringing its
wonderful full vision display technology
to lower end devices enter the LG q6 the
LG q 6 plus and the LG q 6 a yes and as
you've probably guessed the standout
feature of the new Q 6 series are their
displays each one has a 5.5 inch 89 Full
HD display with a resolution of 2160 by
1080 and a pixel density of 442 PPI and
like the g6 these phones also have
curved edges on the screens which are
further accentuated by the sub curves on
the devices chassis all phones and
acoustics lineup support metallic frames
made of 7000 series aluminum as well
surrounding these 89 displays are
minimal bezels which were mentioned in
our LG g6 review and it will certainly
help with one-handed use under the hood
the entire q6 lineup features Qualcomm's
mid-range snapdragon 435 mobile platform
the Q 6 plus comes with 4 gigabytes of
RAM 64 gigabytes of storage while the
standard Q 6 comes with 3 gigabytes of
RAM and 32 gigabytes of storage and the
Q 6 a sports 2 and 16 gigabyte setups
they will all come with non-removable
3000 milliamp hour batteries also in
terms of optics all three devices share
the same 13 megapixel standard angle
rear-facing sensor along with a 5
megapixel 100 degree wide-angle front
camera the selfie shooters on these
devices will come along with LG's face
recognition feature now that's a nice
touch too because these devices do not
come with fingerprint sensors now when
can you get your hands on these devices
well LG is remaining silent on a release
date right now the company says that the
Q 6 will go on sale in Asia starting
sometime in August followed by
availability in Europe
Latin America and North America pricing
has not yet been revealed also LG didn't
give us anything on pricing just yet but
as a mid-tier device we can be hopeful
that it will be priced competitively so
what do you guys think let me know in
the comments below I am kind of hopeful
it looks pretty good the battery power
is a little lower than I would like but
hey if it's priced right it could be a
sweet deal meet Jeremy shoemaker
otherwise known as shoe money and he
became famous for this photo where he
showed off a cheque that he made from
Google Adsense and he's become so good
at making online businesses that he made
an announcement that he does not start a
new business unless he can secure the
businesses name in a dot-com now why is
that exactly
well no domain name extension tells your
story with the same degree of trust as
of calm or dotnet domain name.com and
dotnet domain name extensions and jet
