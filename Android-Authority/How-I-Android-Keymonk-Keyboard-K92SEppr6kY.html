the comments in our YouTube videos and I
noticed in my previous one that you guys
asked a particular question more than
anyone else and secondly in order to
reply to those comments instead of
actually literally answering those
comments I decided to resurrect an old
segment that I did a long time ago here
at Android Authority so with that in
mind it's Josh regard from Android
authority what's going on everybody and
this is how I Android with the key monk
keyboard okay so what you're looking at
right now is the splash screen on Google
Play at the Google Play Store for the
key monkey board key monkey is one word
put together and then keyboard and it's
really easy to find in the Google Play
Store if you're wondering why you
haven't heard of this keyboard in recent
months or however so long it's because
the developer has stopped updating it
now that is a bit of a bummer and
honestly I really wish that this
keyboard had a lot more attraction
because when it first came out I was a
bit of an early adopter and I've been
using it ever since so even though the
current official Google keyboard is
actually quite good in its own right and
it's one that I use especially if it's
built into the phones that I'm using I
tend to put key monk on my daily drivers
because it's really just the one that
I've really fallen loved it and here's
why to give you a full illustration of
key monk I decided to uninstall it from
my Nexus 5 and then I'm gonna install it
again now here is the key monk keyboard
Pro that you're looking at here the full
version that costs a little bit I think
it's $2.99 I believe I'll confirm then
you'll see the text over on the left
there but first thing that I want to do
actually is head over to the free
version and you'll see that a hundred
thousand downloads have been done with
it and only 1300 reviews are available
and the date here is way back in
December 23rd of 2012 so that means that
this has been over a year without any
updates but if you look at some of the
reviews here that are really recent like
for example there were a couple at least
on the pro version that I was looking at
that were from just very recently 2014
like this one right here they say that
it's very different from other swipe
debase keyboards and there's one
particular reason why it's because key
monk is used with both of your thumbs
rather than just one you can use it with
one thumb but it is supposed to be used
with two in order to maximize your speed
and that's something that really made it
unique and is something that I
personally love accept the EULA enable
key monkey language and input as always
and then go back and select it and there
you go
so just kind of make sure that it's
selected and there you go
once I take a look at key monkey it will
tell you that you can swipe up from the
dot in order to look at all of the
punctuation marks which is a great
gesture and shortcut that you have there
and then you can also hold it to see all
of your options so if we hold it in a
little bit you'll see what it looks like
you can also sweep up from the Delete
key in order to resize the keyboard and
another one thing that it does very well
is it allows you to swipe to the left
from the Delete key in order to delete
whole words which is something that I've
really gotten used to and whenever I use
another keyboard and I don't have that
functionality it really kind of bums me
out and then finally you can sweep up
from the symbol from the symbol area
here to any of the symbols that appear
in the layout in order to quickly put
symbols in and when you take your finger
off it'll go back to the main keyboard
which is yet another gesture it can do
you should be able to swipe among all of
the letters in order to get your word so
touch type but when it comes to the key
monkey board you should be able to swipe
with two fingers to all of the letters
that you need for your word and it will
intuitively find the word for you so you
have touch so as you can see there I did
T o U and then I put my finger on C
brought my other finger down to H and it
found that for type it be typ e and
there you go it's not the it's not
always perfect but when you're on a roll
it's just a absolute breeze like for
example if I'm going to type here what
would you like to remember like it says
there what would you like to and you can
I touch type there and the predictive
text is there so I'll hit too remember
question mark you see how fast that was
once you get the hang of this keyboard
it's one of the fastest keyboards
available at least in my estimation now
given that this app has not been updated
for over a year there are a couple
quirks and you don't see it right now
but where the predictive text bar is
there's that little 3 dot right there
because I'm not typing anything
sometimes this right bar right here will
be completely white while I'm typing I
see it on pretty much every phone that
use right now it's not showing up but at
times it does show up at that white bars
on the side but as far as a design goes
that's really the only hole that I see
and as far as functionality goes this is
definitely still the one that I like to
use the most because it is quick because
it is what I've gotten used to and
because of some of those gesture-based
actions that you can do that I got
really used to so in the end my
favourites keyboard is the Keelung
keyboard and and there you go compared
to other ones like let's say SwiftKey
out there I will not deny that SwiftKey
is a very fast keyboard and if anything
being able to swipe with two fingers on
key monk is just as good in my opinion
as the predictive text that is available
in Swift key when it learns how you
particularly write so in that way I kind
of look at though the both of them and I
can say you know why both of them are
really fast but for me I just prefer the
one that I've been using for quite some
time and so as always thank you guys
very much for watching and I hope you
