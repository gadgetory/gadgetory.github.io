for those of you who have used the
original HTC One you probably know about
blinkfeed and you're wondering what is
new about it but for the rest of you who
are looking at the m8 as a possible
entry point into HTC or even the Android
game which we think it is a great entry
point you're probably wondering what
blinkfeed is all about and that is
exactly what we're going to show you
because it's Josh regard from Android 30
what's going on everybody
and this is your future focus on the HTC
One m8 regarding blinkfeed alright and
so here we are we're just taking a look
at the HTC One m8 with its brand-new
blinkfeed
in sense 6 or as they were calling it at
the show Sixth Sense and that's
primarily because of the contextual
basis that it has now with new
applications and the new ones that are
coming out because the SDK has been
opened up to developers so just go ahead
and jump right in here is blinkfeed
right here but what I will tell you is I
have been using this one for a little
while now and what I've done is I have
removed all of my sources here to kind
of give you a look at what a fresh start
up looks like for blinkfeed when you
first turn on your phone you're going to
have two tiles one that is shown right
here that says get the latest news that
matters to you and tap here to start and
you're going to get another one for your
social media feeds so that's the way
you're going to get started and we're
just going to use that tile in order to
get going so here it is the ad content
area where you'll see all of the sources
now there's a very big plethora of
sources available on blinkfeed that is
more or less curated by HTC we're gonna
go ahead and just add content from a
bunch of different places there are all
these categories here and we'll start
off I'll just kind of go through the
typical ones I'll go for gaming gaming
highlights is just sort of a hodgepodge
of the best ones that are out there so
we'll add that I'm also a fan of these
other sources and polygons there we go
also do life style and you can see there
it is a curated list you can't really
add your own which is a bit of a bummer
when it comes to blinkfeed
if there's some sources out there that I
would love to put into blink feed and
have it aggregate there but it's ok
that's not there all right there you go
so those are the new sources that I've
added into blink feed so we'll go and
head back and what's gonna happen is it
will update right away and you will get
a blink feed full of all of those source
and you can see here already we have a
lot of nice ones and they're all in this
tiled interface the original blinkfeed
was paginated with a bunch of tiles that
sort of lift it all up at the same time
but now it's just a perfect scroll one
that just sort of comes up with all
these tiles and it's not paginated
anymore and you can see all of the
different sources that I have here
there's something for titanfall from the
gaming highlights
there's also Lifehacker right there for
the design and lifestyle area oh and
also when you hit the menu button or
swipe from the left you will find that
you can actually sort of hunker down
into the sources which is always great
so if you wanted to just look at let's
say Core 77 you can click on that and
you will only get stories from there
this is one of my favorite features of
blinkfeed that allows you to really just
if you only want to see news news
stories from one particular source
because you just want to see what they
were up to then you can do that as well
we can always do the same for let's say
al Jazeera and there you go those
highlights categories that you saw just
a second ago are also available for that
so you can also you can always hunker
down into just a particular genre of
highlights if you want to so from there
we will go ahead and just go back to the
highlights and then we'll give us the
highlights and then we'll head over to
services and apps and this is where you
can put in all of your information for
this is the various social media feeds
and whatnot you can have Google+
Instagram you can even have the calendar
but it will use the built-in calendar
for that now there are other ones that
are available like the restaurant
recommendations that will tap into your
Foursquare account and you'll get
recommendations as to what nearby would
be very good in terms of eating and
going out for let's say a drink or
something and those will all be added in
again it will update again and there you
go you can already see that I have some
sources that were put in from the
services and apps this first one right
over here a nice place nearby called
Rudy's Mexican food is the first
suggestion or the first tile in the
highlights area and if we keep coming
down I have something from Google+
another mealtime idea the habit great
burger place and more pictures from
Instagram because I added that in and
also for further consolidation of all of
your sources you are actually able
to post to certain social media outlets
including Google+ and Facebook which I
don't have set up on here at the moment
but depending on which ones are set up
with your blinkfeed you should be able
to post to those that way even from
blinkfeed you will be able to update all
of your friends as to what you're doing
so that's just a look at blinkfeed and
like I said that is one of my favorite
features of link feeds the fact that you
can hunker down and really just see the
sources that you want if you really want
to just see one particular one and after
that it's just a companion to the
homescreen that you already have inside
of the Sam cui so that's one of the
reasons why you could take a look at the
HTC One m8 as a possible entry point if
you haven't already used an HTC one
before or if you are coming from a
different platform other than Android
but nonetheless this is a great update
to the original HTC One and blinkfeed
definitely shows how it has evolved over
the years so keep it tuned to Android
authority for all of the best coverage
especially our coverage of the HTC One
m8 now we have a lot of videos coming up
for a lot of coverage including a
feature focus on the camera and of
course my full review so keep it tuned
