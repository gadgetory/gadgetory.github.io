the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly
let's get right into those headlines it
was revealed at CES 2016 that YouTube
will soon support HDR video which is
following trend started by big names
such as Netflix Amazon and others the
only downside is that you can only
consume this on devices that have HDR
compatibility which are pretty much
limited to only televisions for right
now for various reasons another big
announcement at CES 2016 was from
netflix the video streaming giant
announced that it was going to open its
doors to 130 new countries which
increases the number of compatible
countries by over two hundred percent on
top of that they added a few more
supported languages bringing their total
up to 21 this is a huge move and lots of
people will be signing up for netflix
over the next few weeks over the last
week Google quietly band 13 applications
that were secretly downloading other
malware applications and potentially
giving themselves root access so they
could install themselves on the system
partition to survive a factory reset
they have been removed from the google
play store and if you downloaded them
prepare to reflash the stock software to
get rid of them Adult Swim announced a
new mobile game this week that will
revolve around the increasingly popular
cartoon show Rick and Morty the game
will be called pocket more days and
we'll play much like a Pokemon game we
know it will be free-to-play and it'll
be released on january fourteenth which
means we'll be talking about this again
on next week's show on top of that the
room 3 is arriving monday january 11th
we were huge fans of the first two
titles here at Android Authority and
we're really looking forward to the
third title it'll follow the same basic
premise and gameplay mechanics of the
prior two titles with a new storyline
thrown in it'll cost four dollars and
ninety-nine cents with no in-app
purchases for even more Android apps and
games news releases and updates don't
forget to check out this week's
newsletter which is linked in the video
description below there you'll find all
the stuff we didn't have time for here
and if you're so inclined you can sign
up using the form that's in the written
companion which is also linked in the
video description below and we'll send
that newsletter to your inbox every
Sunday afternoon okay folks are gonna
take a look at the apps and games that
made a big splash this week as usual if
you want to check any of these apps or
games out we'll have those linked
for you in the video description below
defenders 2 is the spiritual successor
to the highly popular defenders game for
those who don't know defenders to is a
tower defense game where you must build
towers summon spells and collect runes
in order to create a good defense the
title contains 40 towers 20 spells and
more than 20 monster types and 29 boss
fights you can also fight with other
players and there are even environmental
obstacles there are some bugs since this
is brand new but aside from that the
game is actually pretty good cave or not
is a minimalistic maze game where you
play as a little spaceship searching for
resources and treasures using the
controls you must avoid obstacles as
well as the sides of the map in order to
avoid being destroyed it features
randomly generated caves that change
each time that you play five areas you
can play through and there are upgrades
for your ship to make stuff a little bit
easier it's a dollar 99 with no in-app
purchases and it's a fun little game the
metal gear rising revengeance is a game
that was originally available on the
xbox 360 ps3 and pc and it has now made
its way to android simply put this title
has some of the best graphics that we've
ever seen on a mobile game and it's
reflected in its gigantic price tag and
5.5 gigabytes storage requirements it is
an Nvidia shield exclusive which kind of
sucks but it does come with some useful
features including Google Play games
achievements and cloud saves if you have
a shield and fifteen dollars to spend
consider picking this one up worms 4 is
the latest game in the worm series to
hit android this one comes with slightly
improved graphics brand new weapons new
locations and 80 single-player missions
to enjoy you can also play multiplayer
online against real people and the
developers have redone the game a bit to
make matches shorter for faster play
it's two dollars and 49 cents with
in-app purchases which isn't the best
pricing model but the game is enjoyable
and there is a lot of stuff to do apps
is a new application with a fun little
story a little while back someone found
a link to Google play's top charts that
showed only the top apps without a bunch
of games thrown in an enterprising
developer turn this into an application
where you can view the real top apps
charts without being assaulted by a ton
of games that you would only see a
second time in the top charts for the
games it's a great application I'll be
using it every day and you should too
because it's entirely free once again
