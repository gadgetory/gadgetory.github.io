sits in my driveway and likely yours too
is the second-highest expense that we
have and most of the time just sits
there not being used I hope that this
partnership between Google and Ford will
help fix that a trio of anonymous
internal sources are claiming Google and
Ford have a partnership to announce in
Las Vegas next month at CES 2016 this is
said to be a joint venture to work on
self-driving cars and will come in the
form of an independent company Google is
great at creating smart systems but
people have been worried about the
company's ability to manufacture of
vehicles after all you would be trusting
your life to Google every time you hop
in one of their automobiles as cute as
their little cars are we would rather
have a renowned car maker in the labs
this gives you a certain level of
reassurance in addition companies like
Google mercedes-benz and Volvo have
promised to take responsibility for
actions caused by their self-driving
systems
Google has also pledged to release
information on whatever accidents their
driverless cars get into it's important
to keep people informed and Google is
certainly not falling behind in this
sense this deal is also said to be
non-exclusive which makes us wonder what
the plan really is we'll other companies
be able to jump in on the deal would
they have to go through both Google and
Ford to join the fun we aren't sure just
yet but we will find out all the details
at CES 2016 now what I'm really excited
about is the so-called taxi like or uber
like service with driverless cars
imagine for a moment if you just press a
button on an app and a driverless car
comes to your door and takes you and
your family wherever you want to go my
question is would that be some sort of
monthly or yearly subscription service
or do you pay a la carte like you
currently do with uber pretty exciting
stuff because the whole car thing is
just outrageously expensive for the
value that it gives there's an
opportunity there to be disrupted and
let's hope is the one to do it
what do you guys think let me know in
the comments below thanks for watching
Android army my name is Jase and I'd
love to connect with you right here on
Google Blas or Twitter and you don't
want to forget about my brothers and
sister and Android we're working super
hard
super-hard to be your source for all
things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
