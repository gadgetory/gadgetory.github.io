the corner with MWC we're revisiting the
Nexus 6 to see where it lands in the
Android flagship space but what better
battle to wage right now then against
the main competitor to Android itself
it's Josh reguar from Android authority
what's going on everybody and this is
the Nexus 6 versus the iPhone 6 plus the
so-called sixth iteration of both of
these phones centered around one basic
premise going big the iPhone 6 brought a
rounded look to its design language but
in the larger Plus Edition the screen
was bumped up to 5.5 inches the result
is an attractive phone of apples typical
design cues made a little bit harder to
handle because of its size typical
buttons include the volume rocker on the
left side with the silence toggle and
the power button has been brought to the
right side from the top for better
access alone tactile home button up
front also includes a fingerprint
scanner underneath and it lies somewhat
concave to the front panel and 2.5 D
glass adds to the more rounded look a
metallic construction automatically ups
the phone's attraction with lines
denoting where the separations are in
the parts and of course the Apple logo
on the back is under the camera optics
in the top corner the Nexus 6 on the
other hand blew itself up - rather mixed
reactions mostly because of its handling
Motorola's design language took center
stage here as the phone looks like a
large Moto X except the backings are
always made of plastic with the Nexus 6
no buttons on the front mean that the
inputs are made with soft keys and a
curve on the back does help with the
phone's feel in the hand the camera
optics are up top on the back of this
wide edition with the now iconic
Motorola dimple underneath and the Nexus
logo in landscape under that a metallic
frame also helps the Nexus 6 adding to
what is one of the most exquisite Nexus
devices yet the main story in the design
department is handling because aesthetic
remains an opinionated matter the iPhone
is thinner and it's rounded sides make
it a little bit more comfortable to grip
but the larger bezels of the iPhone make
it similar in size to the Nexus 6
nonetheless thickness makes the Nexus 6
a little harder to handle in one hand
though it's curved does what it can to
help you're always going to perform hand
gymnastics to go from side to side or to
reach the top but in the end both of
these phones manage to be really easy on
the eyes despite not always being easy
in the
at large displays are par for the course
here as the trend continues to pick up
steam but in the case of the Nexus 6 you
get a little bit more power in its
display that might make you choose it
over the Apple phone
that being said Apple's display
technology gets a bump up to 5.5 inches
and a full HD resolution rocking 401
pixels per inch what I always notice
about iPhone screens however is that
their color output is just a little bit
more subdued compared to say the AMOLED
displays of common Android flagships and
that's exactly what the Nexus 6 sports
an AMOLED screen at just under six
inches the big story with the Nexus 6 is
its super high resolution going beyond
Full HD
Google and Motorola decided to meet the
trend of quad HD with a display that is
2560 by 1440 supporting 493 pixels per
inch
the result is a display that is
outputting some intense power and for
work and play you will be able to read
sharp text and enjoy any media in a
large fashion there may have been some
issues with burnin reported but on my
particular unit it hasn't been an issue
at all the colors on the iPhone 6 plus
are not bad at all but they just seem to
pop out a little bit more on the Nexus 6
this can be owed to the highly colorful
motif of Android lollipop though
nonetheless we have an evolution in both
of these devices surely a welcome change
for any veterans in either camp but if
you want a higher resolution to eke out
that much more enjoyment from your
smartphone usage the larger and more
powerful screen with the Nexus 6 is the
obvious choice performance on a vs. like
this is always a bit of an odd situation
because we're talking about two
completely different architectures the
Nexus 6 sports the usual type of
processing package created by Qualcomm
and in the Snapdragon 805 it enjoys the
kind of high level performance that
you'd expect multitasking is an easy
affair with three gigabytes of RAM and I
could run just about any application
without any slowdowns and while I may
have seen a few hiccups and transitions
here and there it has more to do with
the occasional bugs and lollipop that
are sure to be fixed in updated versions
and undal s gaming is still a breeze
with the audrina 420 apple likes to put
together their own processing packages
and any iOS user can tell you that their
architecture works well for their needs
the a8 is the processor choice for this
iPhone and it's dual-core 1.4 gigahertz
cyclone chip is backed by quad-core
graphics in the power VR GX
6450 iOS has gradually become more
on flashiness in its interface but all
in all the simplicity of the operating
system can still be felt
moving along applications is pretty
seamless and even if one gigabyte of RAM
is available you're still able to keep a
good number of apps running
simultaneously Gaming is also standard
affair with games moving along well
without much incident comparing Android
and iOS has already tough on its own but
obviously there are a lot of users on
both sides that report very good
experiences iOS runs really well on
Apple's architecture on the iPhone 6
plus and even though lollipop could use
just a little bit more polish it still
runs really great on the Nexus 6
hardware offerings on either of these
phones take on mostly the typical fare
with the iPhone 6 plus boasting one
specific addition over the Nexus 6 yes
the fingerprint reader on the iPhone is
a press version meaning that you can
easily unlock the phone by pressing the
home button to wake it and then you can
just leave your finger there aside from
that however you get mostly the standard
bells and whistles with various
connectivity options and even NFC this
time though it is rather restricted to
Apple pay for the time being the bottom
mounted speaker performs as expected
with a pretty good sound stage and few
thrills after that a 2915 milliamp hour
battery powers the 6 plus bringing a
fair amount of battery life though with
enough power usage it will struggle to
get past the 1 day mark previous
versions of the iPhone did have famously
problems with longevity and the larger
and higher resolution screen on this
edition does bring down the bigger
battery to size a bit on the Nexus 6
however the lack of a fingerprint reader
is helped by its media consumption
features the main enhancement on the
Nexus 6 is right on the front the dual
front-facing speakers whose placement
simply trump the bottom mounted unit on
the iPhone 6 plus
and as far as connectivity goes the
Nexus 6 is the first of the line to get
access across the board with a version
on Sprint and then one possibly coming
to Verizon very soon in battery life the
Nexus 6 actually suffers from the same
issues as the iPhone 6 plus a much
larger display and a big bump in
resolution bring the 30 to 20 million
power unit battery to size making this
phone get close to the day and a half
mark but never really getting past it
unless you really want a fingerprint
scanner on the iPhone 6 plus the
front-facing speakers on the Nexus 6 are
a compelling notch in its belt
especially when you consider that
gorgeous screen for media consumption
the camera situation in this vs. is
influenced by the devices ecosystem
histories while the iPhone has a
pedigree of good performing cameras the
Nexus line has been well a bit uneven
the app on the iPhone 6 plus is about as
simple as you can get swiping on the
viewfinder changes the various modes and
the different options for your pictures
are accessed via buttons on the side you
get modes for regular photos for video
for slow-mo video and even a square
interface that makes instagramming easy
panorama and time-lapse modes are also
available for anyone that wants to get
fancy with their smartphone photography
now compare that to the Nexus 6 whose
interface in the now Google camera has
gotten simpler over time swiping from
the left side of the viewfinder brings
up the photo and video modes but adds
photosphere and lens blur the latter of
which is more useful due to its stylish
T focusing accessing hdr+ is done in the
small button on the opposite corner
which also allows for switching to the
front facing camera and adding a few
elements to the viewfinder picture
quality here perhaps more so than in any
other comparison between Android and iOS
shows that the evolution and either
system has gone in the right direction
I'm quite familiar already with the good
quality of the iPhone cameras so the way
that the pictures turned out were not
much of a surprise the Nexus 6 on the
other hand has really stepped up its
game with pictures that have a higher
color saturation and good detail in the
13 megapixel photos the metering at
times was a little bit different in both
devices in the cases when the next
six would get a good exposure the iPhone
would underexpose and vice versa but
where the iPhone does get a step ahead
is in its low-light performance the
details were simply better captured in
it then the granular results of the
Nexus 6 HDR modes on both of these
cameras are at their best when used in
the right situations and while the
iPhone opts to have an HDR auto mode to
take out the guesswork the Nexus 6
requires you to put a little bit of
thought into your shots to activate the
mode video modes also fall under a
similarly even scope because both
cameras now benefit from optical image
stabilization the Nexus 6 however can
record in 4k resolution putting it over
the full HD capabilities of what is
already a pretty good performer in the
iPhones camera if this were last year's
competition the iPhone 5s would have
trumped the Nexus 5 and you know what it
did but this year we have a more even
playing field because Google and
Motorola have stepped up their game in
the Nexus 6 even though the iPhone 6
plus gets a little bit further ahead
with its low-light performance the Nexus
6 is really not all that far behind and
that's saying something
and now the age-old question of Android
versus iOS truth be told if this was a
comparison being made a couple years ago
there would be a far gap between the two
ecosystems but now not so much
iOS was a pioneer in app development
getting many now essential applications
far before Android did but now Android
has matured and even with a few niche
holes here and there the difference has
become mostly negligible in the newest
version of the operating system iOS has
been able to bring a number of features
that Android pioneered like the
notification drop-down a Quick Settings
panel called control center and a holo
light design that has refreshed the iOS
look quite well however functionally iOS
remains about the same no app drawer
means organization requires folders and
despite the additions of the
notification drop-down and control
center
much of what veteran Apple users call
home remains as such that being said
there are still few limits on what you
can do on iOS and choosing is purely
based on how you feel about its
aesthetic Android on the other hand has
become rather ubiquitous outside of the
Apple space and its limits are just as
far and few between now the newest
version of Android lollipop brought with
it a much starker aesthetic change
taking what already worked before and
finding ways of presenting them in even
better fashion
Google now is now a launcher that comes
with a second home screen for quick news
and contextual cues from your Google
history and the notification drop-down
has been made easier on the eyes hiding
an equally attractive quick settings
panel
the only real hole I've ever seen what
the lollipop changes is in the recent
apps screen it's like got nice rolodex
style way of looking through your apps
but putting all of the chrome tabs there
makes it a little bit unwieldy
thankfully you can turn this function
off in chrome to clean things up a bit
so despite a few bugs here and there
with this earlier version of lollipop it
is a still a step forward for Android
whose forward movement over the last
number of years has been readily
apparent are you actually going to find
many applications that work on one over
the other I bet not so choosing between
these two depends on which interface you
want to look at in order to access the
ecosystem that you support the iPhone 6
plus and the Nexus 6 are the premium
editions of their respective lines and
come with price tags that fit that
notion the iPhone 6 plus can be found on
all networks for the premium price for
smart phone plans or the full unlocked
price of around $800 in just the base 16
gigabyte edition the Nexus 6 on the
other hand can be found on most of the
networks for plans or comes with the
unlock price of 649 dollars putting it
in a more affordable space for those who
don't want tethers to their cellular
plans and so there you have it the Nexus
6 and the iPhone 6 plus the best that
both of these lines have to offer in
their own big ways those who are already
loyal to their ecosystems will make
their obvious choices here but for
everyone else the matter comes down to
what you want out of your phone media
consumption with front-facing speakers
and a gorgeously powerful screen make
the Nexus 6 a pretty compelling choice
but the iPhone 6 plus has a pretty
tried-and-true design language that has
been thrust into the now of smartphone
trends no matter which one of these you
choose it really matters how you want to
be presented what you're going to use on
your daily as always thank you guys very
much for watching and I hope you enjoyed
this versus pitting the Nexus 6 versus
the iPhone 6 plus these are definitely
the best phones that both of these lines
have to offer and in the case of the
iPhone 6 plus you get the Apple design
that a lot of people love along with a
camera that's still a tiny cut above
that of the Android iteration but the
Nexus 6 is the pure Android experience
with a
gorgeous screen and front-facing
speakers to boot for your media
consumption nonetheless we have a great
year ahead of us and the Nexus 6 will be
pitted against the other flagships that
are coming out in the coming months with
MWC happening in just a couple weeks we
have a lot of comparisons to go through
