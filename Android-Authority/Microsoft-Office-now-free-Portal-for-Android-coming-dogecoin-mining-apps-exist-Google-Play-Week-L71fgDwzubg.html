Hindy the android authority app guy it's
Friday and welcome back to the Google
Play weekly show this week we're going
to talk about a couple of Android
applications that were mining dogecoins
the freedom of microsoft office and a
whole lot more so let's get started as
most of you are aware the new HTC One
was announced this last week and with it
came a couple of applications from HTC
in the google play store along with
announcing and releasing the new HTC one
HTC also put their service pack and the
HTC blinkfeed launcher on the Google
Play Store this is very encouraging for
two reasons it means that HTC is
lightening up on their OEM skin
customizations into standalone
applications which will make a lot of
stock android fans happy and it means
that other HTC devices may be able to
download the launcher themselves from
what we can ascertain the apps are in
the google play store so that HTC can
update their devices without being
required to push out a system update as
i'm sure everyone knows by now pushing
out system updates can take a lot of
time thanks to things like carrier
approval so if you have the new HTC One
or even one of their older devices that
slated to get sent six prepare to see
your updates for a lot in the google
play store instead of your typical
over-the-air updates so how refreshing
has microsoft been lately since Steve
Ballmer finally called it quits this
last week they continue to unravel the
mistakes of the ball moreira by making
Microsoft Office free for home users I
actually covered the release of
microsoft office to the google play
store in my very first episode of google
play weekly it was about eight months
ago and the app itself has always been
free however to really use it it
required an office 365 subscription with
this new update it is now free for use
for home users while business users
still get to pay for it this is kind of
a big deal microsoft office is one of
those software suites that has owned its
category for more than a decade and it's
practically ubiquitous with this new
move in place microsoft now has an
accessible free office platform on
android along with an equally accessible
and integrated cloud storage service
after months of speculation it appears
as though Microsoft finally does have a
somewhat competitive response to google
drive good for them after all
competition inspires innovation if
you're a student in the United States
and you subscribe to Spotify or you want
to subscribe to Spotify that our next
is going to make you a happy camper
Spotify appears to be doing what it can
to help the everyday broke students in
the United States by giving up to fifty
percent off of service for 12 months
just for being a student so instead of
this still very reasonable 999 per month
Spotify will make students pay only four
dollars and ninety-nine cents per month
and it's still the same ad free
experience that the regular people get
there are a few catches though you'll
have to reapply after 12 months to get
the discount again and you can only get
the discount for a maximum of three
years also it's kind of lame that it's
limited to United States students only
because most students around the world
are broke not just the ones here in the
States that said if you do qualify it's
a spectacular deal and one that you're
likely not going to find anywhere else
so check out Spotify his official
website for more details on that so one
of the more interesting pieces to hit
the news this week was an announcement
by the security firm Trend Micro which
revealed that a couple of Android
applications were using user devices to
mind dogecoins the apps were called
songs and prized and what is surprising
is that songs had over 1 million
downloads while prized was sitting
pretty between 50 and 100 thousand
according to trend micro the apps
created both doge and litecoins and the
developers have cashed in a few times
already so they have been making money
off of these apps as you can imagine
Trend Micro has reported both
applications and they are now gone from
the google play store well it is a very
interesting idea it's also against
pretty much all of the rules and does
constitute as malware so to summarize
Wow much crypto such currency very no
Play Store our next story is a triumph
i'm making a note here it's hard to
understate my satisfaction with this
next story okay i'm sorry i'm done now
yes i get to talk about portal this week
because nvidia has announced that
they'll be porting the game to android
with valves permission this is pretty
awesome because one of the major
complaints about mobile gaming is the
lack of top to your games even though
portal really isn't a top-tier game
anymore it's still a cult classic and a
name no one would mind being associated
with Android the bad news is that the
portal port will only be available for
tegra 4 devices like the Nvidia shield
this has had mixed reactions because
people seem to be getting angry that
Nvidia is developing a game for their
own gaming platforms I don't
stand why because it's not like Nintendo
didn't do the same thing with Mario for
more than two decades I for one am
excited to see a good pc game getting
ported and i hope this begins a trend
that lets us see more the who wants to
see some trending applications as usual
if you want to check any of these
applications out you can find the links
in the written companion which is in the
video description below we reviewed link
bubble and we'll have a link to that
here at the end of the video link bubble
is a floating window based browser that
opens links in the background when the
site is loaded it'll pop back out or
remain in the background until you bring
it forward the decision is yours there
is a free version to kind of try it out
but the full version is four dollars and
ninety-nine cents to see more details
you should really check out our full
review last pass is a password manager
and frankly it's one of the best ones
available for any platform android or
otherwise it recently got updated and it
now supports android apps and the chrome
browser so you can auto log into
applications and websites using chrome
much like you can on the computer
variant it's free for a couple of weeks
but then it requires a subscription for
twelve dollars per year this can be an
amazing way to help you manage and
improve your passwords we first talked
about Star Wars assault team when it was
just an image and a vague announcement
and now the whole game is out it's a
card based strategy game that takes
place in the Star Wars world it's free
to play with in-app purchases so it's a
paradigm everyone is familiar with the
premise is you get character cards and
then level them up through fighting
there is even PvP if you're into that
kind of stuff scramble with friends is
on our list of the best multiplayer
games because it's quick and easy to
play it was recently updated with a
whole new interface that better
correlates with the android design
standard and Google Play game services
the game mechanics remain unchanged so
there is nothing new to learn but it
does look a whole lot nicer and the play
games achievements is a really nice
touch last up this week is Captain
America the Winter Soldier it was
released by gameloft be sort of the
official mobile game for the movie you
get to play as Captain America in an
action game and lead teams around in
level based gameplay to kill bad guys
it's playable only in portrait mode
which is kind of lame but it's not all
that bad also the game is a demo you'll
have to pay two dollars and ninety-nine
cents for the full version if you want
all the levels this apparently took some
people by surprise so don't let the
lower Google Play rating scare you away
