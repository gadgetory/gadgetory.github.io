Android authority and we're still here
at CES 2015 it is the last day and we're
hanging out at the blue booth taking a
look at the brand new vivo air and
starting with the design of this phone
you can see it's really thin it's only
5.1 millimeters so it's a super thin
phone and it's also made of metal and
glass so the build quality is really
awesome and it just feels great in the
hand it has a very compact feeling and
the thinness of this phone just gives it
a very attractive look in the screen on
this phone here you're looking at a 4.8
inch Super AMOLED display it comes in at
720p resolution and it looks quite nice
even though it's not you know it's not
quad HD is not 1080p but at the 4.8 inch
screen size the 720p resolution works
just fine with the operating system
you're looking at Android 4.4 KitKat
with blues own custom skin on top here
and it's pretty simple very easy to use
very colorful as well so looks quite
nice just to run through the rest of the
specs real quick you're looking at a 1.7
gigahertz octa-core processor it's a
mediatek 65 92 and the battery you're
looking at a 2100 milliamp hour battery
so a pretty decent sized battery for a
phone this size should be enough to get
you through a full day you're looking at
Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on the front
you're also going to get HSPA+ 21
megabits down and it comes with 16
gigabytes of internal memory and one
gigabyte of ram there's an 8 megapixel
camera on the back and a 5 megapixel
camera which you can see right up front
here and it also comes with all of your
usual stuff like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi but
this phone will be available pretty soon
it actually will be available available
next week on January 13th for the price
of one $99.99 so it's very
budget-friendly very inexpensive and you
can get it get it directly from Amazon
so this has just been a quick look of
the vivo air it's the last day of CES
2015 we're hanging out at the blue booth
but this is it stay tuned for the rest
of our CES 2015 coverage and as always
keep it locked on Android authorities
because we are your source for all
things Android and see
