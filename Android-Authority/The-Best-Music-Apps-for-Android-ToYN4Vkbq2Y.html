Joe handy the Android authority app guy
like music I know I do and after the
intro we'll show you some of the best
non cloud-based music players for
Android first on our list is fusion
player this is an effective and fun
music player that comes with an easy and
organized interface and a popular holo
theme if you're looking for something a
little more simple but still highly
rated in the Google Play Store you found
it with Fusion Player
it also features a music streaming
service where you can listen to the
current chart toppers or shoutcast radio
so if you don't have a lot of music on
your device streaming options can be a
nice supplement to your local content
10:7 player takes an alternative
approach to music players it still
functions the same as all these other
ones but it comes with a more modernized
interface for those who want a better
looking music experience while holo fans
may not like it people looking for
something different may very well like
it it otherwise comes with all the bells
and whistles there is an equaliser album
art downloading and some customization
via the settings menu to help make your
music experience the best it can be
it's definitely a unique application
that any music fan can enjoy flavor Pro
is another music player whose strength
lies in its simplicity everything in the
app is accessible using the tabs at the
top if you want to browse by song artist
album or your current playlist it's all
there for you there are a lot more
options under the menu button like sleep
timer and the ability to change your
theme player pro skin czar available in
the Google Play Store so you can make it
look and feel however you want that's
always nice for a music player the
proverbial champion of the music genre
power amp is among the most powerful
music players for Android you can access
most of the features from its
wonderfully laid out interface including
song lists equalizers sound effects and
a whole lot more there are parts of
power amp that may be a little confusing
to a brand-new user but once you get the
gist of how everything works you don't
fly through the app very quickly it runs
well it looks good and it's among the
most popular and trusted music players
for Android if all the apps on this list
sensor is likely the most unique while
it comes with all the stuff you'd find
in these other music apps like the
equalizer and the customize settings the
wheelhouse of sensor is the ability to
control your music with your device
sensors for instance you can set it to
pocket mode and put the phone in your
pocket if you want to skip a track just
give your pocket a smack and it'll
change there are options for waving your
hand across the screen and even one
where you can punch your table and it'll
switch tracks for you if you
you can look at our leaderboard you can
see how these apps stack up against one
another of course all these music apps
brings something unique to the table so
really it's about finding the one that
suits your needs and tastes as always
this is based on download numbers and
Google Play Store ratings there is no
bias on our part also we know that there
are hundreds upon hundreds of music
player apps some very popular ones
didn't make it onto the list so if you

favorite music player is once again I'm
