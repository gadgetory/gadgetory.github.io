LG's flagship is finally here and we can
definitely say that we are excited with
what we see hey it's Josh of the car
from android authority what's going on
everybody and this is your first
hands-on with the LG g3 now obviously
the hero of this device is right on the
front which is the 5.5 inch display that
has 2560 x 1440 resolution making it a
2k or quad HD display but before we get
to that let's take a look at the general
design LG's signature button layout
returns once again as the volume rockers
and the power button on the back now
this is pretty much the main reason why
the sides happened to be so thin and if
you're not really that used to the back
button layouts from the LG g2 then it
will take a little bit of time to get
used to but on the g3 they do feel even
better with a much meteor feel and
they're a little more pronounced as well
you will notice one other thing on the
back as there's another little area that
has appeared next to the camera this is
the auto focus laser which we will talk
about more later but aside from that to
the entire backing which is removable in
this international version of the phone
is made not necessarily of a metallic
material but it is a hybrid of sorts
where the polycarbonate has been given a
brushed finish to make it feel a lot
sturdier than the glossy plastic of the
LG g2 it almost has a matted feel but
it's more brush to the best way we can
put it as I it's brushed plastic and it
is a great upgrade from the original no
matter how you slice it 5.5 inches in
the screen does make for a large device
and that's the reason why the ultra thin
bezels are really the main draw here
aside from the resolution of the screen
after having a move away from the glossy
plastic the feel is great in the hand in
that curve allows it to rest comfortably
you will be able to do more on this
phone with one hand and you can with
most other devices out there of this
size and that is a feat that LG can be
very proud of all right so let's jump
into that display which is the defining
feature of the g3 and of course it is
the beautiful 5.5 inch display that has
a resolution of 2560 x 1440 resulting in
a massive pixel density of about 534 PPI
now there was a claim that the human eye
is unable to see pixel densities of over
three
ppi as was being presented at least in
the launch event but apparently that is
not the case in LG wants to prove that
by providing a massive pixel density in
this screen granted this may not be the
first quad HD display on the market as
the Oppo find 7 kind of beat LG to the
punch but everyone is still waiting for
it so LG has a feather in their cap now
as being the first company to provide a
widely available 2k or quad HD display
and as expected it is as handsome as you
would want it to be as it brings great
brightness viewing angles and of course
crisp and clear texts and images as far
as performance goes the LG g3 keeps up
with the current trends as it packs the
best processing package currently
available with the Qualcomm Snapdragon
801 processor now looking at the
performance aspect of every other
flagship with this processing package is
a good indication of what you could
expect out of the g3 despite that higher
resolution display we don't expect any
slowdown in this particular device and
in the little time that I had with it I
did not experience that on the hardware
front you will be able to expand the
built-in memory with microSD cards of up
to 128 gigabytes so storage shouldn't be
a problem and the full range of
connectivity options are available here
including NFC and 4G LTE and all
applicable markets the LG g3 also packs
a large 3,000 milliamp hour battery
which was removable and replaceable in
this international version of dg3 that I
was using and in my short time with it I
would not be able to tell you what the
battery life is obviously but it will be
interesting to see how much of a drain
that quad HD display may cause hopefully
the power saving features found in the
GUI will definitely help it let us stand
the test of time we move over to the
camera which is an experience that we're
very excited to see and to put through
its paces as it pretty much is similar
to what you would get with the g pro 2
but does have some extras first of all
in the app you will find that this 13
megapixel rear shooter is backed by a
very nice app application that has been
somewhat revamped in order to give you a
more simplistic outlook simplicity is
what LG is going for here on the camera
differently shows it as you should be
able to just touch and shoot and be able
to get pictures going with really no
trouble at all and this is made possible
with some additions like OAS plus which
we already saw in the g pro 2 and we did
say that it was quite a good performer
now let's go ahead and talk about that
hardware side where there's a laser is
now found near the camera that helps
with quick and accurate auto focus now
essentially it uses a technology that
you would find in DSLR cameras these
days where a laser is bounced off of the
objects that it is supposed to be
focusing upon and it will be able to
find the point easier now this should
play its part at the very least in
making the g3 a much better autofocus ER
than the very slow g2 before it but
overall you do get some good shots with
vibrant colors and these are some
samples that I was able to get off of
the camera of the g3 off of the phone
rather and you'll be able to see that
the quality is actually quite good but
we're going to put through its full
paces and give a full camera shoot out
once the time comes one interesting
feature that was actually really fun to
use was in the front facing camera which
is a 2.1 megapixel shooter at f/2 point
no aperture which provides better
low-light performance obviously to
improve your selfie game now speaking of
that selfie game basically that feature
I'm talking about is when you bring your
hand up and the camera detects it you'll
see a box that is detected it's at that
point that you can just create a fist
and it will count down at that point
once it detects that in order to take
the selfie for you so you don't have to
use the on-screen buttons or even the
down volume button on the back in order
to take that picture and finally the g3
runs android 4.4 point2 with LG's GUI
interface right on top which has
received an overhaul from previous
iterations now which is something that
you're probably going to be very excited
about because it looks like LG is moving
towards a more flatter more minimalistic
look overall trying to scale things back
a little bit it also moves away from the
bright and colorful nature of the
previous iterations of the Optimus UI as
it was called before it's not as
cluttered as before thank goodness as
when you'd bring down the notification
drop-down you'll find that LG has
adopted the circle motif as well and you
find it in that quick setting at the top
you would be able to have quite a few
notifications here now because all of
those toggles are not taking up all of
the space the software is still as
packed with features as ever as a lot of
useful additions have been added on top
of returning applications like the
multitasker where you can use two
applications at once and of course the
NOC code which was originally introduced
in the g pro 2 now some new additions
are all called smart something as being
able to provide a concierge like service
is really what this one is trying to do
one is like the smart cleaning what
recommends an installation of apps that
you may not have used in a while and
also there is a new smart keyboard that
allows for much more customization than
other keyboards available including
adjusting the height to what suits you
the best and as far as circles go there
is the quick circle case that LG is
making for the g3 which I was able to
take a look at and you will see a
hands-on video of it a little bit later
but let's put it this way it is a nice
smart cover for the LG g3 that has its
own unique style and function and it is
pretty fun to use especially when you
use the camera through that little
circle at the top and so there you have
it for this first look at the LG g3 what
excites us the most about this phone is
the fact that at a 5.5 inch 2k display
you will still be able to use the phone
quite easily in one hand and that is
just a feat of design especially with
that thin bezel all around and the fact
that there is a great 13 megapixel OAS
plus camera on the back that should
provide some great shots especially with
some laser focusing that really speeds
up the process so keep it tuned to
android authority for all of the best
coverage of the LG g3 and stay tuned
because i have a lot of comparison
videos coming up some quick looks
against the current flagship devices
available so keep it tuned here and
