LG's flagship is finally here and we can
definitely say that we are excited with
what we see hey it's Josh with regard
from Android Authority what's going on
everybody
and this is your first hands-on with the
LG g3
now obviously the hero of this device is
right on the front which is the 5.5 inch
display that has 2560 by 1440 resolution
making it a 2k or quad HD display but
before we get to that let's take a look
at the general design LG's signature
button layout returns once again as the
volume rockers and the power burner on
the back now this is pretty much the
main reason why the sights happened to
be so thin and if you're not really that
used to the back button layouts from the
LG g2 then it will take a little bit of
time to get used to but on the g3 they
do feel even better with a much meteor
feel and they're a little more
pronounced as well you will notice one
other thing on the back as there's
another little area that has appeared
next to the camera this is the auto
focus laser which we will talk about
more later but aside from that to the
entire backing which is removable in
this international version of the phone
is made not necessarily of a metallic
material but it is a hybrid of sorts
where the polycarbonate has been given a
brushed finish to make it feel a lot
sturdier than the glossy plastic of the
LG g2 it almost has a matted feel but
it's more brush - the best way we can
put it is as brushed plastic and it is a
great upgrade from the original no
matter how you slice it 5.5 inches in
the screen does make for a large device
and that's the reason why the ultra-thin
bezels are really the main draw here
aside from the resolution of the screen
after having a move away from the glossy
plastic the feel is great in the hand
and that curved allows it to rest
comfortably you will be able to do more
on this phone with one hand than you can
with most other devices out there of
this size and that is a feat that LG can
be very proud of all right so let's jump
into that display which is the defining
feature of the g3 and of course it is
the beautiful 5.5 inch display that has
a resolution of 2560 by 1440 resulting
in a massive pixel density of about 534
PPI now there was a claim that the human
eye is unable to see pixel densities of
over 300
PPI as was being presented at least in
the launch event but apparently that is
not the case in lg wants to prove that
by providing a massive pixel density in
this screen granted this may not be the
first quad HD display on the market as
the Opel find seven kind of beat LG to
the punch but everyone is still waiting
for it so LG has a feather in their cap
now as being the first company to
provide a widely available 2k or quad HD
display and as expected it is as
handsome as you would want it to be as
it brings great brightness viewing
angles and of course crisp and clear
texts and images as far as performance
goes the LG g3 keeps up with the current
trends as it packs the best processing
package currently available with the
qualcomm snapdragon 801 processor now
looking at the performance aspect of
every other flagship with this
processing package is a good indication
of what you could expect out of the g3
despite that higher resolution display
we don't expect any slowdown in this
particular device and in the little time
that I had with it I did not experience
that on the hardware front you will be
able to expand the built-in memory with
microSD cards of up to 128 gigabytes so
storage shouldn't be a problem and the
full range of connectivity options are
available here including NFC and 4G LTE
in all applicable markets the LG g3 also
packs a large 3000 milliamp hour battery
which was removable and replaceable in
this international version of the g3
that I was using and in my short time
with it I would not be able to tell you
what the battery life is obviously but
it will be interesting to see how much
of a drain that quad HD display may
cause hopefully the power saving
features found in the GUI will
definitely help it let us stand the test
of time we move over to the camera which
is an experience that we're very excited
to see and to put through its paces as
it pretty much is similar to what you
would get with the G pro 2 but does have
some extras first of all in the app you
will find that there's 13 megapixel rear
shooter is backed by a very nice app
application that has been somewhat
revamped in order to give you a more
simplistic outlook simplicity is what LG
is going for here on the camera
differently shows it as you should be
able to just touch and shoot and be able
to get pictures going with really no
trouble at all and this is made possible
with some additions like OAS Plus which
we already saw in the G pro 2 and we did
say that it was quite a good performer
now let's go ahead and talk about that
Hardware side where there's a laser as
now found near the camera that helps
with quick and accurate autofocus now
essentially it uses a technology that
you would find in DSLR cameras these
days where a laser is bounced off of the
objects that it is supposed to be
focusing upon and it will be able to
find the point easier now this should
play its part at the very least in
making the g3 a much better autofocus er
than the very slow g2 before it but
overall you do get some good shots with
vibrant colors and these are some
samples that I was able to get off of
the camera of the g3 off of the phone
rather and you'll be able to see that
the quality is actually quite good but
we're gonna put through its full paces
and give a full camera shootout once the
time comes one interesting feature that
was actually really fun to use was in
the front-facing camera which is a 2.1
megapixel shooter @f 2.0 aperture which
provides better low-light performance
obviously to improve your selfie game
now speaking of that selfie game
basically that feature I'm talking about
is when you bring your hand up and the
camera detects that you'll see a box
that is detected is at that point that
you can just create a fist and it will
count down at that point once it detects
that in order to take the selfie for you
so you don't have to use the on-screen
buttons or even the down volume button
on the back in order to take that
picture and finally the g3 runs Android
4.4.2 with LG's GUI interface right on
top which has received an overhaul from
previous iterations now which is
something that you're probably going to
be very excited about because it looks
like LG is moving towards a more flatter
more minimalistic look overall trying to
scale things back a little bit it also
moves away from the bright and colorful
nature of the previous iterations of the
Optimus UI as it was called before it's
not as cluttered as before thank
goodness as when you'd bring down the
notification drop-down you'll find that
LG has adopted the circle motif as well
and you find it in that quick setting at
the top you would be able to have quite
a few notifications here now because all
of those toggles are not taking up all
of the space the software is still as
packed with features as ever as a lot of
useful additions have been added on top
of returning applications like the
multitasker where you can use two
applications at once
and of course the NOC code which was
originally introduced in the g pro 2 now
some new additions are all called smart
something as being able to provide a
concierge like service is really what
this one is trying to do one is like the
smart cleaning what
recommends an installation of apps that
you may not have used in a while and
also there is a new smart keyboard that
allows for much more customization than
other keyboards available including
adjusting the height to what suits you
the best and as far as circles go there
is the quick circle case that LG is
making for the g3 which I was able to
take a look at and you will see a
hands-on video of it a little bit later
but let's put it this way it is a nice
smart cover for the LG g3 that has its
own unique style and function and it is
pretty fun to use especially when you
use the camera through that little
circle at the top and so there you have
it for this first look at the LG g3 what
excites us the most about this phone is
the fact that at a 5.5 inch 2k display
you will still be able to use the phone
quite easily in one hand and that is
just a feat of design especially with
that thin bezel all around and the fact
that there is a great 13 megapixel óas
plus camera on the back that should
provide some great shots especially with
some laser focusing that really speeds
up the process so keep it tuned to
Android Authority for all of the best
coverage of the LG g3 and stay tuned
because I have a lot of comparison
videos coming up some quick looks
against the current flagship devices
available so keep it tuned here and
