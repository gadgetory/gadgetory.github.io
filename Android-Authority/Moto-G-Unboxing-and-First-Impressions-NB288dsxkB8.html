affordable price hell yeah I'm in hey
it's Josh regard from android authority
what's going on everybody and it's time
to unbox and give my first impressions
on the Moto G and there it is already
then if we get inside here we pretty
much just have the micro USB charging
cable and that's quite literally it
after that we pretty much just have a
quick start guide essentially the Moto G
is looking to be as affordable as
possible so assuming that the consumer
probably has some sort of plug adapter
already given a different smartphone or
a different peripheral device then they
should be able to just put the micro USB
cord right into that in order to charge
this or even into a laptop or computer
generally speaking when you get a
mid-range version of a flagship device
it gets shrunken down a little but since
the Moto X was already pretty small to
begin with the Moto G didn't have too
far to go 4.5 inches is what you get
here four and a half inches compared to
the 4.7 inch screen of the Moto X
however despite all of that the general
fuel is about the same and that's
because the body the form factor is
actually about the same so the handling
is very similar it's very familiar and
once you put this in your hand you get
that feeling of well this is really a
moto phone but then that's where the
similarities kind of start to fade away
starting on the front we do have the LCD
screen and obviously what that means is
it won't have active notifications
active notifications after all required
the AMOLED type screen that allows for
the activation of particular pixels so
this LCD screen despite coming in at
720p resolution does not have the
particular feature that differentiated
the Moto X when you come around the back
it's not the soft touch let's say
premium feeling plastic of the Moto X
especially if you get sort of that mat
back that is available however on the
Moto G we have a much a bit of a hollow
feeling plastic material that is
somewhat soft touched but it's
incredibly smooth and when you put it in
your hand and you feel that plastic it
does kind of feel like a real budget
budget minded phone and also that back
cover is removable allowing you to
replace it with other colors in case you
want to customize the Moto G to your
liking to remove the back cover of your
Moto G press the center and grip the
bottom edge lift up from the bottom
alright let's see how that looks it's
definitely not as easy as it kind of
sounds after all you're going to have
your finger digging into the microUSB
port good lord boy I'll tell ya this is
definitely giving the Moto G a little
bit more in the build quality column all
the cover does come off and that also
means that you can get a bunch of
different colors of it maybe even
different materials when you never know
what moto will have in mind for the
customization of the Moto G but there
you go and of course here's the warning
that the battery is not removable so
don't even try to take it out it's also
worth mentioning that you're not going
to get the touchless control either and
what that basically means for the Moto G
is that it is a budget accessible way of
getting into the Android ecosystem so
quite obviously the most exciting part
about this phone is its price $107 gets
you the Moto G at the base 8 gigabyte
model unlocked an unlocked phone at
under two hundred dollars that's a
pretty big deal especially for a phone
that has the moto name you do get that
sense that it will be a reliable phone
it will have good performance even if
it's not necessarily the fastest
performing phone on the market but more
than that the reason why I'm actually
really excited to have this in my hand
right now is because at that price point
it's obvious to me that this is going to
be a great way to get let's say someone
who doesn't want to be in other
ecosystems anymore an easy entry point
