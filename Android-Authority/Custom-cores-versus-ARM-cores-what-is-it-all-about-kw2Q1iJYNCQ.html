Android Authority now when you've been
hearing about smart phones particularly
been hearing about
smartphone processors maybe you've come
across this term custom core now the
question is what is a custom core why do
people make such a fuss about them and
who is it that actually designs them
well let's find out so the inside your
smartphone is a think relay system on a
chip
it's a silicon chip with various
components on it including a CPU a GPU a
memory controller a DSP and maybe a few
other interesting bits and pieces now
the design for the CPU can come from one
of several places including from Intel
or from arm now all I phones and the
vast majority of Android phones use CPU
designs from Armour so there are some
difference between arm and inter when it
comes to their business models and
weight comes to the philosophy of
designing their chips for example all
ARM chips are RISC chips now RISC sounds
will reduced instruction set computing
whereas Intel chips are complex
instruction set computers or sisk
computers now what does this mean that
means that in a reduced instruction set
computer
the number of available instructions to
the program are reduced they are simpler
but the downside is that you might have
to do two or three instructions to
achieve the same thing you'd include
with one single instruction on a sisk
chip but the idea is because they are
simpler it means the chippies easy to
design and it can run faster because
it's doing less complicated work and it
can run through those structions
actually a lot quicker now I said there
was a business difference between the
way these two companies work Intel makes
its own chip it designs its own chips it
manufactures its own chips and it sells
them directly to other companies like
ASIS for the zenfone 2 for example arm
is different arm doesn't have a
fabrication plant it doesn't make chips
it doesn't have a physical place what it
does it just designs chips and their
licenses those designs to other
companies like Qualcomm or like Samsung
as a result of this licensing
arrangement arm has lots of partners who
partner with it to build actual physical
silicon chips and the big partners in
terms of smartphones are Qualcomm and
Sam's
and why away and media tag and end video
and so on now each one of these
companies is a licensee there are two
types of licenses they can either be a
core licensee or they can be an
architectural licensee now a core
licensee is someone who takes the exact
core design for let's say the cortex a
57 or the court is a 72 and they bring
it as it is into their chip design
adding on the other stuff they want to
add on around that chip now the other
type of licensee is an architectural
licensee now these are people that say
we want to license your architecture the
instruction set and the philosophies
behind reduced instruction set computing
but they want to design their own actual
chip and then put that on their system
on a chip now many times these companies
that are architect or licensees are also
core licensee so they have a choice when
they come to design and SOC where they
want to use a core from arm where they
want to design their own one and this is
where we get the term custom core it's
the idea of an ARM architecture licensee
who has designed their own core rather
than using a core from arm now arm has
several architectural license seasoned
they include Qualcomm and Samsung and
NVIDIA and Huawei and of course Apple
what I have to do quickly is look at how
these different companies are using
their custom cause how they're using
their architectural licenses from arm so
first of all it look at Qualcomm now
Qualcomm is really a classic example of
an arm licensee it likes its core design
so for example the Snapdragon 810 uses
the cortex a53 design it uses the cortex
a57 design in fact they're an octa-core
chip with four of each of those inside
that CPU but previously before the shift
was made to 64-bit Qualcomm was using
its architectural license to design its
own calls and it became very popular
using its crate cause that we were found
in the Snapdragon 801 the Snapdragon 805
and others
now the Snapdragon 820 that's coming out
has also got qualcomm z' own designed
core at this time is called cryo so it
uses architectural license to build its
own design and put it into its own
system on chip however it's still using
arms
calls in other of its system-on-a-chip
so examples the Snapdragon six five two
will use four cortex a53 calls and four
cortex a seventy two cores so across its
whole product range Qualcomm has a whole
different set of core some are from arm
and some are from its own design team
so if Qualcomm were a classic example of
an arm licensee then Apple isn't a
typical example you see Qualcomm makes
its system on chips and it sells them to
other smartphone makers like Sony or HTC
or even to Samsung
whereas Apple only makes chips for its
own foes doesn't sell them to anybody
else now up until the iPhone 4s Apple
were using arms cortex designs in fact
the iPhone 4s had a dual-core cortex a9
chip inside of it but with the release
of the iPhone 5 what happened is is that
Apple had bought a silicon design
company a few years before called a PA
semi and they use that team to design
their own arm core using their
architectural license that they had from
arm and the result was the custom core
which we call Swift and that's what was
found in the iPhone 5 then when the
release of the iPhone 5s came out Apple
actually really had a lead on everybody
else in that in fact that it released a
64-bit core called site clone and this
actually left other people like Qualcomm
and Samsung kind of in the dirt really
because they were now from how history
played out there was 18 months before
Qualcomm and Samsung were able to bring
out 64-bit chip so Apple took the lead
by designing our own custom core 64-bit
chip of course that 64-bit chip has to
be compatible with arms architecture as
all about Samsung or Samsung is a
classic arm licensee it has a core
license and it also has an architectural
license for example the Exynos 7420 you
might find in the Samsung Galaxy s6 uses
four cortex a53 calls and four cortex
a57 cores and those core designs had
come directly from arm however the new
series of chips is designed the X naught
8 series is going to use four cortex a53
caused directly from arm but it's also
going to use four of its OH
cause which is designed in-house and
that is currently codenamed Mongoose and
we don't know the performance of that we
don't actually turn out but that's what
our Samsung are planning we think for
the Galaxy s7 and then for the next note
that comes after that and so on
now another company that has an
architectural license is Nvidia now
Nvidia have core licenses and
architectural license if we remember
where the original Nexus 7 tablet was
released it used a chip called the
Nvidia tegra3 now after the success of
the Nvidia tegra3
Nvidia then try to make the air Tegra 4
and the 4i and due to various problems
in the development process maybe some
managerial problems those chips turned
out to be pretty poor and behind the
rest of the competition and they didn't
really have much commercial success but
moving on from the Tegra 4 the company
then went on to release the Tegra k1 now
the k1 was a bit of a funny chip because
it came in two different format it could
either be a 32-bit cortex a15 design
quad-core or it could be a dual-core
64-bit design using a core known as
Denver or project Denver now project
Denver was using arms architectural
license to build a chip that could
compatible with arms architectural but
was actually designed in-house by Nvidia
now the difference with the Denver core
was is actually trying to use a
technology called code morphing which
means that the actual chip itself could
theoretically run any computer
instruction set from any design and when
it's presented with those instructions
it breaks them down internally morph
them into its own instruction set which
it then runs on the silicon if you
remember there was a company called
transmeta that briefly employed Linus
Torvalds the creator of the lineups or
Linux operating system and that company
tried to do exactly the same thing now
the story from the industry insiders is
that the Nvidia chip the NVIDIA Tegra
project was actually going to be able to
run both Intel and arm instruction set
at the same time however what happened
is they couldn't get a license from
Intel and it just got left using the arm
instruction set
now that chip did see the light of day
in fact it is the chip that is
the Nexus 9 tablet if you want to find
out more information about the
background behind code morphing the
background behind how in video designing
their CPUs then please check out semi
accurate com2 good source for this kind
of information now the problem is is
that the Denver project really was kind
of bent bold on invidious part because
transmitter had tried this approach
before and basically failed and cut the
company closed down and NVIDIA claimed
that had big plans for this technology
however we don't really think the
project's alive anymore there's nothing
really else going on in video aren't
talking about it anymore
and in fact the x1 the next chip that
came out the Tegra x1 went back to using
arms core designs arm cortex a53 and ARM
Cortex a 57 now the thing there are lots
of different ways to source an arm
compatible core the question is our
custom cause actually better and of
course this reads to the question what
do you mean by better because there are
different characteristics we can use
this performance are certainly
characteristic we can measure but then
there's also efficiency and there's also
the cost associated with the design and
manufacture of the chip of that chip
then there is marketing what impact does
having a custom core have on marketing
and then there's diversity do they
design just one core or do they design
many cores when it comes to performance
we might be able to say that Apple have
the lead and this actually makes sense
because Apple have been making their own
custom 64-bit calls now for three
generations first two its cyclone and
then you know typhoon mini head twister
even arm itself is only on its second
generation of 64-bit calls you had the
cortex a 57 then you had the cortex a 72
as a second generation and yet we
haven't heard about the how many
official announcement they way about the
third generation and Qualcomm and
Samsung are only now producing their
first generation 64-bit arm compatible
cores so in that sense we can expect
Apple to be ahead in terms of
performance
what about efficiency who has the most
efficient core out there well actually
that price does go to arm itself because
not only does arm produce the a 72 in
the a 57 cause it also produces
853 calls and it's also recently
announced the a 35 court and this also
brings us to the issue of diversity
Apple are only designing one core for
one specific task
Qualcomm are designing only one core for
one specific task Samsung is only one
core for one specific task whereas arm
have the court it's 8:35 the court is
853 the court is a 5,700 court is a 72
and there are other calls coming down
the pipeline that we expect to be
announced during 2016 and of course that
brings us to marketing what is the point
of all this in terms of marketing well
there seems to be some power in saying
we have our own core that we've designed
and then you can they can trot out all
lots of statistics about what it means
and maybe that has an influence over
consumers about which phone they're
going to buy because they like the idea
that it has a particular custom core
designed by their favorite company so
does all this mean well first of all it
means there's plenty of choice for
consumers and choice is good if you want
aid a cortex a 72 core you can have it
if you want Mongoose that's available if
you want cryo
you could try that if you want one of
apples cause go with that the choice is
really yours as the consumer second if
it means there's plenty of competition
amongst these different design teams
each team is able to be pushed by
another team to achieve new goals to
achieve new ends to push the technology
to the next level if there was no
competition then this technology could
stagnate my name is Gary Sims from

to check out our website and Rory calm
and also don't forget to use the
comments below to tell me what you think
about the different core designs are
available from the different companies
