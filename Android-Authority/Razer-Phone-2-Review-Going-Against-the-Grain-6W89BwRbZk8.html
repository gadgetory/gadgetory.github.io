Android Authority and in front of me I
have the razor phone too this is the
successor to last year's razor phone and
the razor phone to improves on some of
the things that people complain about
with last year's razor phone and also
adds in a couple of new features and the
razor phone too is a phone that I
consider to be a phone that's not afraid
to go against the grain and I'll explain
what I mean by that in a second but the
original phone too is priced at $799 or
800 bucks and for that 800 bucks you're
getting some really beefy specs you have
a snapdragon 845 processor 8 gigabytes
of RAM 64 gigs of internal storage with
a micro SD card slot a four thousand
milliamp hour battery and new to the
razor phone this year is ip67
certification and you guys already know
what this means this means you've been
dropped in the pool drop it in the
toilet
and it will survive also new to the
razor phone is it now has wireless
charging qi wireless charging which
means you can use any Qi compatible
wireless charger of your choice
but razor also sells their own wireless
charger which lights up RGB which you
can purchase for an additional hundred
dollars I think the only thing that
razor sort of skimped out on is the
internal storage 64 gigabytes is usually
more than enough for me on any other
smartphone but for a phone that is
centered around gaming where you might
be downloading a lot of games which will
eat at your internal storage pretty
quickly 64 gigs seems a little bit low
it does have the micro SD card slot for
expandable storage but I think this
phone definitely should have had a
hundred and twenty eight gigabytes
internally at the very least so here's
what I mean when I say the razor phone
tube goes against the grain if you look
at the razor phone to next to a Galaxy S
nine of pixel three or really any other
smartphone on the market it looks very
different instead of being this curvy
design with rounded corners the razor
phone to is just a black rectangular
sharp slab it's pretty much the same
design as last year's razor phone
the only exception here is that it now
has a glass back which is
they've enabled the wireless charging
and the design of the razor phone - is
not my favorite I typically prefer my
phones to be more curvy I like designs
of phones like the pixel 3 and the
Galaxy S 9 or even iPhone 10s a lot
better you may feel a little bit
differently about it but that's just how
I feel about this particular design
there are certain elements of it though
that I do like I like the large speaker
grilles on the front for the dual front
firing speakers which sound incredibly
loud by the way and it also delivers a
very even and balanced sound there's no
overemphasis on bass or treble which is
the problem that I had with the pixel 3
speakers I thought those were a little
bit flat and also not very loud for
front-facing speakers so I like the
speakers on the razor phone - a lot
better I also like the new RGB logo on
the back for the three-headed snake you
can adjust it and make it static make it
breathing or have it cycle through a
whole spectrum of colors and aside from
just looking really cool it doesn't have
a ton of utility you can use it for
notifications and stuff like that but
it's really just meant to make it look
more like a gaming product and it
certainly does do that so I like the new
RGB logo I also like that they've
centered the camera sensors on the back
there is a pretty sizable camera bulge
but because the cameras are perfectly
centered it doesn't wobble when you have
it laying flat on a table or desk the
only other thing that I don't like about
the razor phone twos design is how
recessed the power button is I do like
that the fingerprint sensor is
integrated into the power button and I
think that's something that more
manufacturers should do but because the
power button is so recessed it's
actually really hard to find by feel
when it's in your pocket or when you're
just trying to wake the phone up when
it's on a table or desk just to check
your notifications so one of the biggest
selling points of the original razor
phone and the razor phone - is the
hundred and twenty Hertz display so this
is pretty much the same display as last
year's razor phone but razor has made
this display brighter so it's actually
visible outdoors now which was one of
the big complaints about last year's
model but this is a pretty traditional
smartphone display it doesn't have an
so if you don't like notches there you
go and it's also sixteen by nine instead
of that taller and narrow aspect ratio
that we're seeing on a bunch of other
smart phones but the hundred and twenty
Hertz display is still just as
incredible as ever everything just looks
so silky smooth and it's awesome for
gaming especially if you're playing one
of the hundred and twenty FPS supported
titles which there are actually a pretty
good selection of so those games are
extremely fun and even just swiping and
scrolling through Android is a lot more
enjoyable just because of how silky
smooth everything looks and I've ran
this display at 120 Hertz out of the box
it does default to 90 Hertz which is
probably for battery saving purposes but
I've had no issues with battery life
even with running this display at 120
Hertz full time I'm still getting a
pretty consistent 5 hours of screen on
time but I'm pretty sure if you turn the
refresh rate down to 90 Hertz or even 60
Hertz
you'll probably squeeze out even more
battery life there's no real surprises
with the software on the razor phone -
it's running basically a stock build of
Android 8.1 Oreo but some of the system
UI elements and the default apps have
been themed with Razer colors it's also
running Nova Launcher as the default
launcher which gives you a very stock
like look and feel but it offers a ton
more customization I would say the
biggest disappointment with the software
on the razor phone 2 is that it's not
running Android Pi out of the box and I
feel like this would have given the
rigid phone to a big competitive
advantage over a lot of other
smartphones because there aren't a ton
of smartphones out there right now that
are running Android Pi
speaking of disappointments I wasn't a
big fan of the cameras on the razor
phone - and supposedly they're much
improved over last year's there's a
phone and maybe I've just been spoiled
by the pixel threes picture quality but
I wasn't very impressed by the images on
the razor phone - you have to 12
megapixel cameras on the rear one
standard angle and one telephoto zoom
lens for 2 X optical zoom and then you
have an 8 megapixel camera on the front
that now supports 1080p video at 60
frames per second which is really great
if you're into self vlogging but the
image quality is
okay the colors come out a little bit
muted and washed out to me and dynamic
range is also not very good you get very
little detail in the highlights and
shadows and that becomes even more
visible when you're shooting in
low-light the photos from the main
camera also have this really weird green
tinge or color cast of them which makes
photos look very unnatural and very
unattractive portrait mode on this
camera is also one of the most
artificial looking portrait modes that
I've seen on a smartphone in a while the
bokeh effect just doesn't really look
that convincing to me especially on the
front-facing camera and the front-facing
camera also lacks a ton of dynamic range
despite the bad camera this is still a
really great smartphone you're getting a
very beefy spec sheet a hundred and
twenty Hertz display that looks amazing
and it also doesn't have a notch for all
well under $1000 and if you're really
big into mobile gaming this is the
perfect phone to do it with now if
you're coming from the original RAZR
phone I don't think this is worth the
upgrade I don't think the changes are
significant enough but as an upgrade in
general it's a phone that's definitely
worth looking into it pretty much checks
all the right boxes it has great
performance a great display pretty good
battery life just don't buy this phone
for the camera and I think you'll be
perfectly happy with your purchase but
that's it for this review I hope you
guys enjoyed it if you did give it a
thumbs up I definitely appreciate it
