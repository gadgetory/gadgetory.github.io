andor Authority today we're going to be
looking at the Oppo f1 plus now the
phone comes with a 16 megapixel
front-facing camera that's right a front
facing camera is 16 megapixels it's got
4 gigabytes of RAM it's got 64 gigabytes
of on-board storage got a fingerprint
reader
it's got vogue fast charge it's got
calling Gorilla Glass 4 it's got a
really good set of individual features
and the question we're going to ask
ourselves is has Oppo mesh to put this
together to give us a good smartphone
experience well let's find out so when
it comes to design really the first
thing we have to talk about is the
similarities between this phone and the
phones by a certain Californian company
that use a fruity logo now some of you
will doesn't really matter you just
don't care for some of you it's a real
plus you let design it's really not an
issue to you and for some of you it will
actually be quite a negative thing
it comes down to everybody's personal
preference but whilst we could beyond
the design language I must say that this
phone is really a pleasure to hold it's
got a great 6.6 millimeter body that's
really quite thin and it's got a good
design to it it's got a good feel to it
everybody that I've had this to say hey
what do you think about this phone
they've been impressed by the way it
feels in the hand cause you as the
consumer it's your choice whether you
want a phone that looks like this or not
now looking around the phone on the
front we have the 5.5 inch full HD
display and then the home button the
physical home button which has a
built-in fingerprint reader at the
bottom going around the edges you have
the volume rocker on the left hand side
and the power button on the right hand
side which is just below the SIM tray at
the top there's very little except for a
small hole for a microphone whereas at
the bottom things are quite busy you
have this speaker grille you have the
micro USB port you have another
microphone hole and you have the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack now on the
back of the phone you have the Oppo logo
and a
the 13 megapixel camera the Oppo f1 plus
comes with a high-quality 5.5 inch full
HD IPS LCD display along with Corning
Gorilla Glass 4 the display is bright
and works well indoors and outdoors
with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 that
5.5 inch display gives you a pixel
density of 400 PPI which for a phone in
the premium mid-range segment is more
than sufficient the viewing angles are
good and the bezels are amazing at just
one point six millimeters thick the
significant lack of basil's gives the
display that edge to h feel without
incurring the additional costs of maybe
a curved screen one of the interesting
features of color OS 3.0 on the f1 plus
is this eye protection display settings
according to Oppo there is research
which shows that shortwave blue light
can actually be harmful to the eye
therefore they have a setting which is
able to filter out this blue light and
give a display a less jarring more
smoothing experience whether that's
marketing or science I don't know but I
like their thinking now turning our
attention to the hardware the f1 plus
boasts 4 gigabytes of RAM a fingerprint
reader and quick charging the only
slight letdown in my opinion is the
choice of processor the f1 plus uses a
mediatek helio p10 which is an octa-core
processor with 8 cortex a53 cores 4
cores are clocked at 1.2 gigahertz and
the other four cores are clocked at 2
gigahertz accompanying the CPU is the
arm Mali T 860 GPU in this particular
one has two cores in terms of everyday
use these specs are more than adequate
and most users won't find themselves
wishing for a different CPU and because
of that nice 4 gigabytes of RAM even
some diehard power users among you will
find the f1 plus more than sufficient
however if you play a lot of 3d games go
to lots of complex website or use CPU
intensive apps then you may find that
the
p10 isn't quite up to your needs the use
of a cortex a53 octa-core processor is
also reflected in the benchmarks the
Oppo f1 plus scored 876 on geek benches
single cort√©s and 3311 for its
multi-core tests now for some context
these scores are lower than the
octa-core a 53 keyring 9 3 5 found in
the mate s lower than the octa-core a 53
Helio x10 that's found in the redmi note
2 and also the single core test is
actually lower than the 32 bit
Snapdragon 801 as for an - - the f1 plus
scored 50 1158 and for Epic Citadel the
device managed 42.4 frames per second on
the ultra high quality mode if you set
the quality down to just high quality
then the device does score a very
reasonable 59 point four frames per
second so though while the CPU seems to
be a little lacking is towards the low
end of the performance spectrum it does
seem that mediatek have made some good
choices in the GPU Department the
fingerprint reader on the f1 plus is
very good it's fast accurate and
certainly comparable with the lightning
fast and reliable fingerprint scanner on
the Huawei mate 8 however unlike the
mate 8 which has its fingerprint read on
the back you can't wait and unlock your
phone just by putting your finger on the
reader instead you need to press the
home button with your finger which will
then wake the phone and at the same time
it will unlock it now that's maybe a
minor difference but my personal opinion
is that it's better to have the
fingerprint reader in a separate place
rather than on the home button it was
any consolation to you the Samsung
Galaxy S range and the Samsung Galaxy
Note range suffer from the same problem
but that's just my humble opinion the f1
plus features a single speaker on the
bottom edge next with the microUSB port
the speaker is quite loud and the sound
is reasonable considering it isn't a
front facing speaker as with many
devices music can sound a bit thin with
a lack of bass the f1 plus has a 2805
the milliamp-hour battery which is
amazing when you consider the 6.6
millimeter thickness of this phone now
that battery is more than sufficient to
give you full day battery life without
any problems whatsoever I did some
battery tests first I ran epics is a
deal to test the battery life while
playing 3d games according to my
calculations you had to play around four
and a half hours of 3d games on one
charge now four and a half hours of 3d
game playing is quite an impressive
number as there are phones out there
which don't even give you four and a
half hours of on-screen time when you
don't even go near 3d so this really is
a good sign as for simpler tasks like
browsing the web you'll get at least
eight hours from a full charge
alternatively you could watch eight
hours of YouTube video if you stream it
over Wi-Fi I did a cool test where I
call another phone for 30 minutes and
I'm more to the battery life and my
estimation is that the f1 plus will give
you at least 20 hours of 3G talktime now
when it comes to charging that 2,850
million power battery the Oppo f1 plus
comes with a Buch charging system and it
really is quite fast you can go from 0
to 75 percent in just 35 minutes and
according to my testing it takes just
under 1 hour and 10 minutes to go from
zero to 100% if you're looking for a
stock Android experience and the Oppo f1
plus is not for you because it comes
with color OS 3.0 which is opposed
heavily skinned version of android 5.1
for example there is no app drawer and
you have to put all your apps in folders
on the homescreen
much of the coloring and the UI has also
been changed
however Android users will find it
familiar having said that you do get
access to all of Google services
including Google Play and Gmail and
YouTube so everything you'd expect to
find on a standard Android phone is
found here color OS also has lots of
extra features including on one handed
mode and support for gestures there's
also support for the fingerprint reader
there's a quiet time mode which will
mute your device automatically according
to the times you set their support for
Oh cloud that's oppose cloud service or
backing up your contacts and SMS
messages and there's even a security
center which in
a virus scanner and various privacy
settings now the rear camera on the f1
plus has a 13 megapixel sensor along
with an F 2.2 lens and autofocus overall
I've been very impressed by the camera
I've used it for close-up selfies and
casual snaps both indoors and outdoors
and the camera really hasn't put a foot
wrong of course the caveat to that
statement is that it's a smartphone
camera and not a DLSR and no matter how
good the camera is it can't capture
light that isn't there I was
particularly impressed by the indoor
photos of course if you push the
lighting so no to the extremes you will
get lots of noise in the photos in terms
of the camera app you get a simple
camera interface by default however you
can swipe your way into different
shooting modes including time-lapse
video beauty and panorama you can also
tap on an icon to reveal functions like
Ultra HD
filters gif animation double exposure
and expert mode the latter allows you to
control the ISO the shutter speed and
the white balance however it also lets
you configure the camera to save a raw
version of every shot taken and that
will be saved in the digital negative
format plus of course you can manually
focus your shots
my biggest complaint when the camera app
is it doesn't rotate all the UI elements
when you go from portrait to landscape
although some elements do move many of
them remain in portrait mode which is
really quite annoying the Oppo f1 plus
is very unusual in the fact that its
front-facing camera actually has a
greater megapixel count than its rear
facing camera the front-facing camera
has a 16 megapixel sensor along with an
F 2.0 lens the software for the
front-facing camera has also been
upgraded and tweaked there is a new
beautify 4.0 mode for smoothing out
those wrinkles and covering up those
blemishes plus there is support for the
new selfie panorama mode which is
designed for group shots and so there
you have it the Oppo f1 plus got this
sleek 6.6 millimeter body thin bezels
Corning Gorilla Glass 4 you've got that
selfie camera at the front 16 megapixels
you've got the fingerprint reader built
into
home-button you've got vogue fast
charging your 4 gigabytes of RAM 64
gigabytes of internal storage in fact is
actually got dual SIM support and one of
the SIM slots can be replaced by a micro
SD card so you can expand the storage by
another 128 gigabytes now there are
three things you might not like about
this phone one is the design language
does it look too similar to the iPhone
the other is the color OS operating
system if you're used to using stock
Android then maybe you won't like color
OS and lastly there is the processor
really I was looking for something with
a bit better performance especially when
xavier all the extra features like 4
gigabytes of RAM 64 gigabytes of storage
that are built into this phone however
because of the price point
maybe those weaknesses can be overlooked
the Oppo f1 plus is available for just
389 euros in Europe and 299 pounds in
the UK well my name is Gary Sims from
