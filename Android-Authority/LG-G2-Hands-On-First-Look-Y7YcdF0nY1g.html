authority here we're here in New York
checking out the lg g2 and it is looking
pretty nice spec wise we've got a 2.2 6
gigahertz quad-core processor even
though they're saying 2.3 it's actually
2.2 6
the display is an on pentile Full HD
1080p screen its IPs so it's very very
bright 415 it's exactly like the Moto X
we saw last week they're using a step
battery to allow the phone to be small
and speaking of small just look how thin
this bezel is it's actually under three
millimeters and this part of this was
done by moving the buttons to the back
the power and volume buttons are on the
back and they serve additional
functionality as well you can hold down
the volume down button to access the
camera and that acts as a shutter button
as well I can hold the volume up button
up and that brings you to a quick memo
screen speaking of shortcuts to quickly
access the phone all you have to do is
tap twice on the screen this is called
knock knock we also have a guest mode
where you can use two different pins and
if you use your normal pattern you can
get access to your phone as you normally
would if you use a different pattern
that brings you into guest mode and you
can set up the apps that are available
to your guests there the battery is 3000
milliamp hours and LG says that this
will last 1.2 days and that's of actual
use not just standby time on Chris walk
in New York and we'll be bringing you
more coverage on the LG g2 very soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
