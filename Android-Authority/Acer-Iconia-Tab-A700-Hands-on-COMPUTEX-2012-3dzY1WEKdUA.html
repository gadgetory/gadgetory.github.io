computex 2012 you're reporting live with
android authority we're looking at the
acer iconia tab a700 or a 701 this
community coming on three different
variants we're going to have a Wi-Fi
only model we're going to have an HSPA
model and we're also gonna have an
lte-capable model as always we know that
taker doesn't play well with LTE so it's
very likely to have a Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 dual-core 1.5 gigahertz
inside but much like the Asus
Transformer Pad 700 series this tablet
is packing a sit 1920 x 1200 high
resolution display that's a lot of
pixels to push it also does have a
really large battery 9800 milliamp hours
otherwise it's just all pretty
conventional stuff it's got a 1.3 k
megapixel camera on the front it's got a
5 megapixel camera on the rear it's got
a really nice texture to it to a really
good feel actually it looks like ace is
really improving the quality of the
production line no word on pricing yet
otherwise yeah it's got GPS and the
GLONASS system in it which is vastly
superior but it's having just really all
about the display well none of these
crop of latest Android tablets are quite
up to the same level of resolution as
the latest iPad they're really really
close
yeah and with tegra 3 on board of the
performances excellent Android Ice Cream
Sandwich right out of the box yeah it
just looks to be a really really good
tablet and in the face acer can continue
its philosophy and have this had a
really aggressive price point maybe some
sub four hundred dollars it's possible
it could really be a great seller
because it's got great screen and it's
got long battery life anyway other than
that yeah it's weighing in at six
hundred eighty five grams making it
pretty light and it is a ten point nine
millimeters thin yeah so that's the
iconia tab a700 from a sir my name is
Darcy a cuvette reporting live at coffee
