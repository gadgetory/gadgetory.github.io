project at CES and this year was no
different last year we saw a massive
three screens laptop new project - Linda
is looking to bring your phone into the
mix to create the ultimate mobile ibrid
you all probably remember the Motorola
lap dog project Linda takes that concept
and brings it into the modern world by
literally making your razor phone the
trackpad in brains for your laptop it
connects me a USBC in the trackpad area
and it's essentially the form factor of
a razor blades stealth with half an inch
of added thickness to make the phone
level with the surface they're taking
most of the components out of the blade
style besides things like the battery
which actually works like a quick
charging battery bank when your phone's
inserted it's got over 53 watt hours of
capacity and it can charge your phone to
fold three times before you need to
charge it again razors also added a dual
array microphone to the top of the
laptop because they really want you to
be able to do everything you do on your
phone in the laptop form factor you can
video chat type texts and emails and
even take call on this thing so there's
really no reason you'd need to go back
to your phone outside the laptop razor
is planning on making the display 120
Hertz as well because they really want
the laptop to mirror the razor phone's
capabilities that way you'll be able to
play games watch videos and do whatever
else they do on your phone on a larger
screen and with a full keyboard the
keyboards chroma - if that matters to
you and then includes a variety of
Android navigation keys as well it's
powered by USB C but sadly it's not
Thunderbolt 3 for now you probably don't
need an external graphics card for your
phone but the possibility made me a bit
giddy and I needed to ask we've also got
USB a in a headphone jack so you should
essentially be able to do pretty much
anything you'd normally do on an
ultrabook lenez also got 200 gigs of
on-board storage standards so you can
store movies pictures or whatever other
files you might need as well the biggest
question I had was about London tivities
since we can probably expect a second
generation razor phone to launch
sometime later this year Rob told me
they've got a history of keeping the
designs relatively consistent
so we can probably assume the razor
phone to work with this as well there
still isn't a release date or price
point set for this thing but I really
hope it actually launches because it's
one of the most well executed laptop
phone hybrids I've seen well make sure
to keep you up to date with the
information as it hits because of course
we are your source for all things
