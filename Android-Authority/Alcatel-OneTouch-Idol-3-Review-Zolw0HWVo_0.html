quite possibly be one of the best budget
phones we've ever seen hey it's Josh
regard from Android Authority what's
going on everybody and this is my full
review of the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3
though the idol 3 comes in a couple of
different sizes we're dealing with the
larger 5.5 inch Edition which brings a
lot to the table without looking too
showy from first glance it's kind of
hard not to think of a larger Nexus 4
because of the pebble design complete
with a subtle silver lining and no
buttons but look at the edge as a top
and below the screen and you'll see
small speaker grilles yes there are
front-facing dual speakers powered by
JBL audio enhancements the screen itself
has a pretty respectable bezel around it
so even with this larger form factor you
won't have too much trouble handling
what is actually a pretty light device
and then it becomes obvious this is
actually a very symmetrical device as
well and if you accidentally picked it
up upside down you actually wouldn't
really notice this is actually one of
the features of the phone that you can
use in either orientation because the
screen will flip over for easy usage so
you don't have to worry in that
situation even calls can be taken upside
down as a microphone and speaker combo
are found on either end the button
layout on the sides is a little bit high
for the typical user at least in my
opinion and is constantly something that
will require hand gymnastics the power
button is up top on the left
opposite the volume rocker and below
that power button is a dual tray that
can house both microSD and SIM cards the
silver lining
sandwiches more sleek black colors and
the typical ports on the top and bottom
are found head over to the back and
you'd be surprised as we were to find a
brushed hard plastic finish that feels
more premium than the price LEDs on it's
pretty simplistic in branding - with the
idol and Alcatel logos hitting the top
and bottom third squarely and of course
the Sony sensor is nestled right up top
on the corner as I mentioned before this
larger device actually feels quite light
handling is where you'd expect it to be
for a 5.5 inch device without it being
any easier or harder than needs to be
though the smaller version might be more
accessible to the masses the price of
this one makes it one of the easiest
entry points for a larger display out
there ultimately the simplicity of the
idol 3 fits its price point but look
closer and all of the subtle touches add
much more value to what is already
a pretty accessible and attractive body
a 5.5 inch screen dictates the overall
size of this device but as mentioned
earlier it isn't any worse or better and
handling than any other larger form
factor phone but the power underneath
keeps - smartphone standards of quality
with 1080p resolution and 401 pixels per
inch as an IPS display you'd get what
you'd expect
pretty good brightness even in daylight
though it isn't an overachiever by any
means the same can be said for its color
production which is about as standard as
you can get this is not a quantum
display or a Super AMOLED display after
all contrast can use a little bit of a
boost and colors can turn out to be a
little bit bland but there are certainly
worse performers out there and plenty of
them don't even come in full HD
resolution text looks just fine though
it is helped by the size of the display
so anyone whose eyes need a little extra
help will get it here media was also
still enjoyable only further enhanced
with the front-facing speakers oh and
double tapping the screen wakes the
phone but I did notice that it isn't
particularly reliable and requires just
the right kind of tabbing cadence
especially considering the larger size
of the display the idol 3 is still an
enjoyable experience perhaps
particularly average but perfect for the
common user there's no mistaking this
phone for a mid-range performer when the
processing package falls under our usual
main buzz number but the Snapdragon 615
is far from the worst performer in the
market it's just a few steps back
including the adrenal 405 and 2
gigabytes of RAM now we've seen a LOF
snappy and smooth Android experiences in
the high-end market this year and
perhaps the best way to put it here is
that the idol 3 doesn't fall incredibly
far behind as a daily driver this mostly
stock version of Android doesn't get
bogged down by a lot of Alcatel
additions and even then the ones that
they put in remain pretty smooth loading
applications takes a noticeably longer
amount of time compared to hiring
competitors but the auto 3 isn't a very
severe offender in this department and
moving along applications in the recent
apps screen is still reliable if not the
fastest experience as a result and the
same can be said for gaming as Studdard
was observed in plenty crowded moments
what is most important to remember
however is that in the number of days
that I've used this phone quite a few to
be exact all of these nuances were easy
to look past if you really need the
fastest possible phone you won't get it
here especially if you're very spec
hungry but you'll still be able to
appreciate how much lighter this phone
is come
to the wait you get to keep in your
wallet now you wouldn't expect hardware
to be especially robust in a mid-range
or budget device like this one but idle
3 is actually quite an overachiever here
connectivity options are complete but a
version that uses dual sims is also
available if you so need it
speaking of phone calls and those
speakers that can be taken in either the
normal orientation or upside-down so
pick up the phone any which way and you
can take that call almost one important
disclaimer that appears in the Idol 3 is
that the orientation of the screen
dictates which speaker and microphone
combo is used just make sure you're not
reading the screen upside down and then
you'll be able to take the call in that
orientation and media is pretty
incredible here despite the standard
quality display it's still fun to watch
videos and play games especially with
the dual front-facing speakers bringing
full body JBL enhanced audio loud and
clear it is actually close to rivaling
HTC boomsound speakers which is really
quite a feat oh you are so on that
things have now become very much like
donkey kong we're gonna kick dust but
thank you storage options depends on
your version of the phone as 32
gigabytes come in the dual sim edition
but even with the 16 gigabytes the
memory is still expandable and finally
in battery the combination of lower end
processing package and a standard full
HD display keep the idol 3 in pretty
normal daily longevity my experience
easily got through a full day of work
and play with three hours of screen on
time before activating the power saving
mode at 15% for normal usage this phone
gives enough to power through and I
never needed to use an external battery
for an extra boost even near the end of
the day which is important for an
affordable but reliable daily driver and
in camera a Sony made sensor powers a 13
megapixel camera in the Idol 3 and it's
actually a pretty solid performer with a
nice eight megapixel front facing camera
to back it up the front facing camera
brings some larger pictures to the
selfie game though it isn't an
overachiever in the quality departments
pictures have a noticeable grain to them
in the ankle isn't quite as wide as
other iterations in the same market
segment to the app first though it keeps
things pretty simple with button
elements simply on the sides of the
viewfinder hitting the Menu button
brings up a number of modes including
even time-lapse which takes a bunch of
photos for every second of what ends up
becoming a video file HDR does a pretty
decent job
lightening up the subject if it's blown
out but otherwise its effect isn't
really all that strong pictures from the
idol 3 are actually quite good wood
details capture quite well and a slight
amount of post-processing working to
smooth out the grain while pictures
managed to keep from being too bland the
colors can use a bit of punch most of
the time and very latina the mark in
terms of contrast
lorelei shots get the typical amount of
grain and loss of detail but not to an
extreme degree usable photos are
definitely possible in these darker
situations this isn't a camera that
under performs especially if you
consider the devices of the same price
or even some that are more expensive and
that's a great thing and another feather
in the cap of the Alcatel OneTouch Idol
3 and finally in software we have a
mostly stock Android version with
Alcatel additions which manage not to be
too overbearing for example icons are a
bit more bubbly almost to the extent
that you would think there's no app
drawer but there is folders in the
homescreen fold open which is a nice
animation that actually is quite smooth
as is the twisting animation the phone
mix when flipped over and this animation
can be changed as well otherwise this is
a pretty lollipop esque Android
iteration with all the bells and
whistles baked in like the new
notification drop-down with quick
settings and even the animations getting
to and from applications as mentioned
before this isn't a slow version of
Android by any means which makes this a
good ride on the daily and without too
much Alcatel getting all up in your face
any android veteran will feel right at
home with the idol 3 and be able to use
it reliably on the daily which brings us
to price there really isn't much keeping
this phone from being a reliable
performer which is why the price of $250
is nothing short of incredible even
comparing so-called budget releases from
plenty of top-tier manufacturers this
can be considered one hell of a steal
and with that we might be looking at one
of the best affordable devices this year
possibly ever with plenty of mid range
to lower end offerings coming out all
the time it's great to see Alcatel
remaining unique from the rest and not
through any crazy features or gimmicks a
larger screen with dual front-facing
speakers JBL enhancements a solid camera
and a spartan operating system in an
attractive body make this one of the
easiest entry points to android
available yet and one of the easiest on
the wallet as well it's hard not to look
at value for the cost and thus we are
able to wait
this as an obvious editor's choice as
always thank you guys very much for
watching and hope you enjoyed this
review of the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3
this is a really great device especially
at $250 and you'll actually get some
very reliable performance without having
to break the bank
even gaming with a game like Dragon
Quest 8 which is usually pretty pretty
taxing on the processor worked pretty
well along here even though it might be
a little bit slower than the high-end
competitors it actually was still an
enjoyable experience so keep it tuned to
andrew authority for even more we have

events are happening pretty soon as well
