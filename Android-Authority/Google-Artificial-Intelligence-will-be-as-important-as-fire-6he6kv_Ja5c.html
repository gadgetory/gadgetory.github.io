for AI so much so that he said this AI
is one of the most important things
humanity is working on it's more
profound than I don't know electricity
or fire okay if that's true what does
that mean for you and me yes
artificial intelligence could
potentially have an impact comparable to
fire imagine this
any computational or knowledge-based
work could at least in part be assumed
by AI just to name a few
pharmacy healthcare diagnosis law even
parts of programming all those jobs that
have been traditionally high-paying and
sought-after will change now that does
not necessarily mean that 30 years from
now we won't need human doctors or
lawyers or pharmacists it just means
that to be successful in those
professions we're going to need to be
more than just dispensers of knowledge
you'll be expected to excel at aspects
of the work that a AI does not do well
like understanding human beings like
coming up with creative solutions to
problems that couldn't otherwise be
solved by common practice or repetitive
tasks imagine if we're able to eliminate
almost all human error from anything
that needs a human operator cars trains
airplanes cranes forklifts you name it
it not only makes it hugely more
efficient but is far safer heads up for
anyone who's aspiring to become a truck
driver 20 years from now your career
options are not looking good
get this nearly 1.3 million people die
in road crashes each year
just imagine the lives saved by AI from
road crashes alone now let's talk about
another fear and this will happen
eventually something AI powered will
kill an innocent human being baby no I'm
not talking about some james cameron
inspired dystopia i'm talking about how
a I will make ethical choices so for
example if I'm sitting in my driverless
car and all of a sudden a dog jumps out
and the AI swerves to dodge the dog but
loses control and now we only have two
choices drive off the cliff where the
passenger is
certainly gonna die or hits a small
child now a human driver is as a parent
is probably going to take his chances
over the cliff and not kill an innocent
child
but would the AI make the same
calculation if so who programs those
ethics into the AI and if it fails and
does kill an innocent child who is
responsible the programmer the
manufacturer or the board or governing
body that writes those ethics which
comes to the biggest in my opinion the
biggest problem when it comes to AI
currently there is no world governing
body that is recognized to establish a
code of ethics and enforce those code of
ethics here in Canada we could have such
a body but someone off in another
country could completely disregard all
of those regulations and out of greed
and need for recognition establish an AI
program that has no boundaries or
safeguards whatsoever you know what it
is it's like a new 16 year old who just
got their license technically and
legally they can drive but are they
fully responsible enough to deal with
everything no that's why we put
boundaries and restrictions on them
until they can show us that they're
responsible enough to deal with 3,000
pounds a hunk of metal down the highway
as a humanity are we responsible enough
to deal with all the implications of AI
hell no now although this does concern
me we should remember that a ice
capability is not going to explode
exponentially overnight right I mean
mine pixel 2 is learning right it is
learning my habits and trying to adapt
to my needs but it's not maliciously
controlling my life at least not yet AIS
capability is going to increase
gradually that should give us some
comfort we do have some time to decide
on a code of ethics
I just hope humanity's maturity rises to
the occasion
