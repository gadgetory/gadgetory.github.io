sifting through the possibly accurate
rumors with the likely BS so here we go
now first off let's start talking about
what could be powering the Samsung
Galaxy s8 as always Samsung's flagship
will be powered by both Qualcomm chips
and its own homegrown Exynos chips
depending on the market until now the
general assumption was that it would be
the Exynos 88-90 5 inside the s8 family
but the image accompanying a tweet
includes the telling line quote discover
cloud nine with Exynos there is some
circumstantial evidence that the next
flagship Exynos processor will be called
the Exynos 98 10 Sam mobile uncovered
the information in the LinkedIn profile
of an engineer that in turn for Samsung
in its Bangalore R&amp;amp;D center separately
my drivers quoted a Korean source
claiming that the Exynos 98 10 will
offer similar performance and power
consumption to the snapdragon 835 but
Qualcomm chip would retain its lead in
terms of cellular connectivity now after
the note 7 debacle samsung is now going
to great pains to prove to us that they
take quality control very seriously
which is why samsung recently posted a
video on youtube titled quality
assurance extensive tests set to the
tune of The O'Jays give the people what
they want
the video shows various tests Samsung
smartphones have to complete before they
can hit the market the s7 and s7 edge
which appear in the short video are
dropped bent submerged in water and
exposed to hot as well as cold
temperatures in addition to the newly
released video samsung also announced a
quality assurance measure a few weeks
ago including an eight-step battery
safety check that features a number of
improved safety tests you can expect a
lot more of that from Samsung but let's
talk about when the s8 could actually be
announced because there's been a little
bit of a shake-up the Galaxy s8 won't be
announced at the Mobile World Congress
2017 as it will be released a bit later
than usual this year however it looks
like Samsung may have decided to still
give us a glimpse of the upcoming flight
ship during this event in Barcelona
according to a report from the Korean
Herald
the tech giant will tease the Galaxy s8
in a one minute trailer at the Mobile
World Congress the video will be played
at a press event on February 26 where
Samsung will announce the Galaxy Tab s 3
so our friends in India we're getting
pretty excited regarding rumors that
suggested that Samsung was going to
relaunch refurbished Galaxy Note 7 in
India but we received confirmation from
Samsung India that they had no
intentions of doing such a relaunch so
Bing but a boom but a bunk but I'm
curious how many of you would actually
be interested in buying a discounted
refurbished note 7 would you want that
would you risk that what do you think
let me know in the comments below
suggesting that Samsung plan to relaunch
relaunch how many times I've done this
right oh my god
