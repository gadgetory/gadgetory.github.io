android authority from CES 2013 we're
here with huawei and they're giving us
the opportunity to a nice hands on
versus of the droid DNA from verizon
versus the huawei ascend d2 so a couple
key features first of all out of this
bag we're looking at a 3000 Milian
battery which is massive obviously
that's about forty percent of
thirty-five percent bigger than what's
in the droid DNA other than that both
devices feature 1080p display so really
really hard pixel per inch count four
hundred and forty plus blowing away the
retina most devices on the market they
are both 5-inch on the rear here we're
featuring a 13 megapixel camera which
does Trump the droid dna's 8 megapixel
camera additionally it is should be
noted that it is a live quite a bit
thicker but not too much that it would
be a big difference that 3000 memory is
really going to help other than that
we're looking at an s4 pro on the droid
DNA with quad-core 1.5 gigahertz whereas
this one is the ARM Cortex a9 1.5
gigahertz quad-core so generation behind
a little bit slower in performance but
still very fast for everyday use so
we're looking HTC Sense skin here versus
wall ways emotion UI other than that
this is also an impact water-resistant
and dustproof device it features corning
gorilla glass 2 features 2 gigs of ram
32 gigabyte rom no mention on LTE yet
whereas this is an LTE device that
probably would benefit from having a
bigger battery but both features are the
same size display obviously 1080p like I
said just the fact that has such a nice
large battery and is waterproof and
dustproof makes it really really
attractive for us and it has a higher
megapixel count so this is just the
first hands-on look of the huawei ascend
d2 versus the verizon droid DNA from HTC
my name is Darcy la cuvee we're here
with android authority here at CES 2013
