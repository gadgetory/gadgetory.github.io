weekly is sponsored by male wise email
hello again ladies and gentleman I'm Joe
handy the Android 230 app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly
let's get right into those headlines and
this week we get to talk about Apple I
know it's a little weird for me to
googles location-aware search is rolling
out right now this allows google search
to ascertain your location and you can
ask questions about your location
without actually having to say it this
is a nifty little feature that helps
search feel more natural and it's even a
little fun to use Google play's new
family-friendly section is now live in
the Google Play Store this helps parents
find a range of apps and games for kids
based on a specific age range you can
browse by ages 5 and under ages 6
through 8 and then ages 9 and up you can
also search by various categories such
as educational creative and music and
video square-one games has announced
that oddworld munches Odyssey will be
coming to Google Play sometime this year
the studio plans to demo the game at e3
and fans of the odd World Series can
rejoice we don't know anything about the
price or the release day just yet in our
last bit of news this week Apple
announced that there WWDC event that
they'll be releasing Apple music for
Android this will be Apple's first
official foray into the Android
ecosystem and it will be interesting to
see how Android users react of course
we'll be taking a look as soon as it's
available shortly after the announcement
Spotify who is not so keen on giving
Apple any of its business announced that
it will price match Apple pretty much no
matter what they charge for how many
accounts and thus the rivalry is born
for even more Android apps and games
news and updates don't forget to check
out this week's newsletter which is
linked in the video description below
there we'll have all the news and
headlines that we didn't have time for
today if you're so inclined you can also
sign up for the newsletter using your
email address and we'll send you this
information every single Friday ok folks
is take a look at the apps and games
that made a big splash this week as
usual if you want to check any of these
applications or games out you can find
those links in the video description
below first up this week is a huge
update that came through the
world-renowned route application
titanium backup the application gives it
support for Android and which means root
users of the future will not have to
worry about whether or not they can
backup applications freeze applications
or uninstall system apps the interface
didn't get much of an update sadly but
that's ok the functionality is there for
Android
that's what's really important machinima
is one of the most well known sites for
gamers they feature gameplay videos
comedy videos and original content they
just released their official Android
application and it's actually pretty
good it uses material design and gives
users access to the majority of
Machinima's content and community if
you're a fan of the site or a fan of
videogames you should definitely check
this one out the radical repelling is
the latest game out of Halfbrick Studios
the developers who brought us other
alliterative hits such as subway surfers
and jetpack joyride in this adventure
game you rappel down various cliffs
while you collect items do stuns and
avoid certain death you can also play as
one of two characters each with their
own set of quests and the game has
power-ups and leaderboards it's a fun
little time waster the Facebook light
was out in a few markets as early as
January but now it's rolling out to
parts of Europe Africa and Latin America
for those who don't know Facebook Lite
is a scaled-down Facebook experience for
those with inconsistent internet speeds
and less powerful devices it's a scant 1
megabyte in size and while it is only
available in select regions you can find
it with a little creative searching last
up this week is Final Fantasy Tactics
the war of the Lions this classic game
originally came out in 1997 on the
PlayStation and now it's been ported to
Android it has been remastered with
touchscreen controls that actually feel
pretty decent since this is a tactical
RPG and all you need to do is tap anyway
it also features a deep storyline
cutscenes and more there have been a few
release date bugs and the text is a bit
small but otherwise it plays really well
there are also no in-app purchases
thanks again for watching the Android
apps weekly show folks but let's get
down to some serious business mail wise
is an email client that covers a lot of
bases including Gmail Yahoo Outlook and
even exchange it features a simple clean
and friendly interface that lets you
move around your inboxes easily there's
also a select all option which will be
the envy of almost every gmail user out
there it supports multiple accounts has
a unified inbox that it even stores your
emails locally on your device instead of
on a server somewhere it's easy it's
clean it's free and it's definitely
worth a shot we'd like to thank mail
