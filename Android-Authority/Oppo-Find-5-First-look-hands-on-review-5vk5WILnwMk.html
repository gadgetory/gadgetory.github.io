live here from beijing we were kindly
invited to the Apple fine 5 launch party
and I have to say that my initial
impressions are very positive now this
is a device that a lot of you are
excited about and for good reason is
packing a 1080p display in a nice thin
profile not backing with a 13 megapixel
camera and dual LED it has a nice big
loud speaker at the very bottom it seems
like a lot of thought has gone into the
design of this device obviously its
claim to fame is is 1080p display which
will make it likely the second
smartphone to go on the market with a
441 pixels-per-inch count take that
iphone 5 other than that the display
source from Japan display code meaning
that it is extremely high caliber a lot
of expertise has gone into this it does
also feature hardware accelerated HDR
and the ability to capture slow motion
video at 120 frames per second now the
software isn't completely optimized on
this unit but so far so good I really
really can't emphasize enough how sharp
of this display is now obviously this
feature is extremely powerful processing
courtesy of Paul comes s4 pro we're
looking at obviously a 1.5 gigahertz now
it is an hour version 7 other than that
there should be led buttons here at the
very bottom but this is an engineering
build so we would have a context menu
and a home and a back button so it
claims that it does have one of the
thinnest bezels on the market and I'm
inclined to agree with them very similar
in terms of motorola's latest devices
other than that i found that is sighs we
profile to be very attractive coming
from the Galaxy Note 2 where I'm not
able to do a lot with one hand it was a
welcome change the performance is really
really stunning and I'm sure once they
optimize a little bit more by the time
it goes to market it will be even better
now in terms of the overlaying obviously
elbow is trying to make a lot of strides
here but it is similar to what you see
on Android 4.1 a 4.2 is promised 4.2
update is promise for end of January as
well just check out the in app menu here
not bad now it's very similar in terms
as a silent to the experiences I really
really wish that all of you can see how
sharp this display is we
it has some of the greatest ability to
produce text sharply and beautifully
produced images particularly 1080p video
now with this 2500 mAh battery it does
have better battery life from the drug
DNA or HTC butterfly chain sadly the
battery is not removable nor does it
have an expandable memory but it will be
coming in 16 and 32 gigabyte variants
NFC worked brilliantly on it with
another 55 and I tested on my note 2 all
in all for this price point which is
going to be released in a round 440 US
dollars and the fact that it's going to
be available pretty soon here means that
it's going to be on a lot of people's
radar it really does blow away any other
display I've ever seen except for the
droid DNA now I have to add a top oh it
looks like they're really really trying
to raise the bar and in specs build
quality and everything that I've seen so
far means that they're taking 2013 very
seriously just check out the display
difference here we got the galaxy s3
coming up here the note 2 and the Aqua
fine fine in terms of its build a half
set of there's very little flex and it
just as producers colors marvelously
well it's not the thinnest phone on the
market it doesn't really matter because
it's back in a nice large battery
slightly thicker than the Galaxy Note 2
and s 3 it really doesn't matter because
when you have a phone with a poco m√°s
for pro-ana 1080p display in a 5-inch
profile with large battery you got to be
impressed 1080p goodness in a 5-inch
profile nice curved back with matt hgr
accelerated video recording with 120
frames per second capability
13-megapixel large 2500 mAh battery and
if see bluetooth Wi-Fi all that good
stuff I really going to hand it to a PO
if they're able to actually produce this
at a 440 dollar price point and it is
going to come out in the middle of
January I think that it's going to sell
like hotcakes and how about you is the
fact that it's not the city limits 1080p
smartphone in the world a bit of a
letdown or do you think that is one of
the better looking phones on the market
let us know what you think of the Apple
55 thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
