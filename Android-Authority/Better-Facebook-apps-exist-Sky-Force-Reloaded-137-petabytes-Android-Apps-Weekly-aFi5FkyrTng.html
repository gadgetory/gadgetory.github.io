joe hindi the android authority app guy
and welcome back to android apps' weekly
this is episode number 143 and
admittedly it's a bit of a slow week but
let's get right into those headlines
Google Play got a new feature this week
that will recommend that you uninstall
applications that you don't use this
will save you space obviously but
depending on the type of application it
may also help you save a bit of battery
life this is one of the few actually
useful cleaner features that we've seen
and it should be rolling out to
everybody right now Amazon debuted Alexa
in browser format this week the idea is
that you can test out and use the Alexa
service without happy to drop $200 on a
device that carries it while this is not
overly useful for anything other than
seeing what it's like for right now it
is a fun way to see what Alexa is all
about first hand in a blog post late
last week Google celebrated the one-year
anniversary of Google photos by
announcing that photos has accumulated
13.7 petah bytes of photos that's about
a hundred and eighty-two years of HD
movies worth of space if you watch them
back-to-back
most of these are selfies obviously and
it shows how successful the service has
been so far a few Microsoft applications
have been updated this week to receive
the new tell me feature this allows you
to quickly search for various tools
inside of Word Excel and PowerPoint so
that you don't have to go rooting around
an application or Google search in order
to find them given that there are entire
college courses to teach you how
Microsoft products work this is an
excellent feature in an effort to make
Google now and ok Google more friendly
Google has hired Emma Coates from Pixar
for those who may not know Coates has
worked on movies such as brave the
spongebob squarepants movie and monsters
University the ultimate goal is to make
Google now feel more human to go along
with its efficiency and to better
compete with things like Siri and
Cortana for even more Android apps and
games news check out this week's
newsletter which is linked in the video
description below
admittedly it was kind of a slow week in
the world of apps and games but there
were still some updates and news worth
checking out that we didn't have time
for here if you'd like you can sign up
for the newsletter using the forum which
is in the written companion which is in
the video description below
and we'll ship that newsletter straight
to your virtual door every Sunday for
even faster news updates don't forget to
check out the android authority app ok
folks is take a look at
absent games that made a big splash this
week as usual if you want to check any
of these apps or games up we'll have
those links for you in the video
description below
Mecca Rama is a free-to-play puzzle game
where you must navigate a robot through
obstacles to get to the end of the level
the game includes 50 levels in total and
focuses more on relaxation and
creativity then it does challenge or
excitement the game is entirely free to
play with the in-app purchases
essentially being donate button's where
you can pay for it if you want to it's a
nice simple little time killer and it
doesn't take up a lot of space google
has launched maps beta in the Google
Play Store the idea is to give you the
chance to check out the latest Google
Maps features before they hit the main
application you'll have to join the beta
group before you can get it and it
should just update Google Maps with the
latest beta version after you do so
currently the beta version is 9.2 7
while the stable version is 9.2 6 so
there is a difference between what you
can have and what you can get if you
want to sign up we'll have that link for
you in the video description below
Skyforce 2014 was one of the best
freemium games out there and now a new
Sky Force is among us Sky Force reloaded
offers a lot of the same stuff as its
predecessor including really good
graphics for a top-down shooter and the
basic gameplay features are still there
some new elements of the game include
buff cards new planes to collect and
more stuff to do during missions this is
going to be one of the best freemium
games of 2016 so you might as well give
it a shot swipe for Facebook has been
out for a while but it seems to be
quickly becoming one of the go to
third-party Facebook apps unlike the
regular application this one has
material design themes and even layouts
that mimic other social media networks
like Google+ it's a little bit more
clunky overall then the regular Facebook
app in terms of feel what the features
are there including baked and messenger
support and some additional stuff that
you won't find in the official app
there's a free version and a paid
version and they're both pretty good the
Transformers earth wars is a kingdom
building game where you must build up a
base defend it from opponents and attack
the basis of other people to win stuff
yes that means it plays an awful lot
like clash of clans in this variation
you'll be able to collect various
transformer characters to help you out
summon reinforcements and use various
transformer abilities to get the upper
hand
it's nothing really overly new but fans
of the genre could find it enjoyable
like most Kingdom builders this one is
free with in-app purchases
well that about does it for this video

have the best new Android apps and games
from May 2016 linked up there on the
screen and in the video description
