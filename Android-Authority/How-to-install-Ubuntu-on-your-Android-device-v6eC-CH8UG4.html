general trend for technology to become
smaller and more functional we can see
this in the various new form factors
that bridge the gap between laptops and
tablets I'm a huge fan of convergence
because to me it means freedom as a
writer having an ultra mobile computer
means I can work from anywhere and
without having to carry a heavy bag
filled with wires and adapters while
phones appear to be getting bigger
rather than smaller that's because
they're packing in more functionality
now than ever before and replacing our
larger devices the first phablet
literally put the tablet in our pocket
and as phones become more and more
powerful they're gradually starting
replaced our computers as well the
ultimate realization of this can be seen
in initiatives like Microsoft continuum
and Samsung debts if you want a full
desktop productivity environment on your
phone though we're still a little way
off multi screen multitasking solutions
on Android leave something to be desired
and the best place to work is still a
desktop or laptop computer or is it
believe it or not it is actually
possible to get a fully functional
version of desktop Ubuntu up and running
on your phone as long as you've got an
Android and you've got root I'm a
Domitian it's key stay tuned and I'll
show you how I got this to work
yes this really is full desktop Ubuntu
running on a galaxy s6 edge+
it's running in truth and you can do
everything it can do on a PC including
installing new applications for the
terminal you can even choose from a
variety of different distributions
flavors and desktops so how do you get
this on your own device as mentioned
you'll need to start out by rooting your
device the process is slightly different
depending on what phone you're using and
your version of Android but if you've
got a common brand then you should be
able to find easy instructions online
and it's normally a fairly quick and
painless process once that's done you'll
need to install three different apps
these are Linux deployed busybox and VNC
viewer each of these can be found on the
Play Store so busybox gives your phone
access to linux commands that otherwise
wouldn't have and it's required for a
number of route apps to work once you
install it though you don't need to
worry about it again instead open up the
Linux deploy and make sure it has root
access
now hit the small download button on the
top or bottom right of the screen this
will bring you to the options menu and
most of the settings in here can be
lessons they are but this is where
you'll select your Linux distribution
everything is here from Debian and
Ubuntu to Kali Linux gen to fedora and
more picking this week will change the
flavor of Linux you can try them all or
you can do a little research and
choosers every one you like the looks of
mates down the bottom you can also
choose which desktop environment you'd
like which will change the look and feel
of the app click enable and the GUI to
ensure you have a graphical interface to
work with and check out the GUI settings
just below that change things like the
resolution for my galaxy s6 edge+ I find
that 1024 by 576 works best you can toy
around with this later set your user
names of routes to give yourself
privileged access and make a note of the
password or change it to something more
memorable
now click the menu that looks like three
dots and choose installed this will take
a little while so go make yourself a cup
of tea
this is installing the entire Linux
distro on your device so you don't have
to do a thing when it's finished just
click the start button to run it in root
which is essentially a small sub
compartment on your device and remember
you'll need to hit stop here when you're
done as well so it's running but you
can't see it yet so finally you use VNC
viewer in order to actually view the GUI
load it up and set the address to
localhost colon five nine zero zero then
enter the password that you set earlier
and with that as long as your version of
Linux is up and running you'll be golden
you'll be able to see it move around and
do whatever you like here now if you
want to start adding more software just
head into the terminal and type apt -
get install and then the name of the app
you want to install so Libre Office is a
Microsoft Office alternative iceweasel
is essentially Firefox
idle is Python idle GIMP the GIMP the
image editing software Nautilus -
Dropbox if you want Dropbox or software
- Center for an app store although this
one wouldn't run on my district other
than that it's entirely up to you what
you want to do with your new Linux
environment you really can use this for
some basic productivity as long as your
screen is big enough you'll need a
keyboard and a mouse I'm using the Mac
stock folding keyboard and the Microsoft
wedge Mouse even if you don't use it to
productivity though it's fun trying out
some different games and utilities in
the software center and just trying your
hand at Linux or you can show off to
people down the pub that they won't be
as impressed with you hope they will so
I hope you found this interesting guys

struggled with anything then be sure to
check out the full article at Android
authority comm which should be linked in
the description below
you'll be able to find more detailed
instructions as well as some links and
