authority and the LG g5 is the successor
to last year's g4 but it's really
nothing like it for the most part the g5
is a completely different phone
altogether and a lot of that has to do
with the design now there's been a lot
of controversy or confusion about the
design of the g5 a lot of people are
really curious if the phone is even
really made of metal or is it made of
plastic or a combination of the two the
truth is the phone is made of metal it's
a diecast unibody design but it's
undergone LG secret treatment process
that they call micro dicing which
essentially puts a layer of primer and
paint on the body of the phone sort of
the same way a car or a plane gets
painted that is basically what has
happened here with the g5 so when you
hold the phone you're not actually
touching bare metal you're not going to
get that same cold feel when picking it
up in the morning like you would with a
lot of other metal phones but the
coating also makes the phone a lot less
slippery in the hand the main benefit of
the micro dicing process is that it
allows LG to make the phone appear a lot
more seamless so instead of having large
plastic antenna lines running across the
backside LG has been able to hide all
that and the only places where you
actually see plastic is along the
chamfered edges which is a lot more
inconspicuous than having large plastic
antenna lines running across the back
which can typically break up the
continuity of a smart phones design LG
definitely had some good intentions with
this micro dicing process but if there
was one drawback to it I would say it's
the way it makes the phone feel because
you aren't directly touching the metal
or aluminum it doesn't feel like a metal
phone so you don't really get to fully
enjoy the fact that it is made of metal
it's kind of like having a metal phone
inside of a protective case and it's
just something you have to wrap your
head around when holding the g5 the
overall build quality is still pretty
top-notch though it's got a nice weight
to it it's comfortable to hold and it's
smaller than last year's g4 due to a
smaller display which makes it a little
easier to use in one hand the power
button is still located on the backside
in typical LG fashion but you'll notice
the volume rockers have been moved back
to a more traditional location on the
left side which I personally like better
because you can adjust the volume of the
phone without having to pick it up off a
desk anymore I just wish they weren't
quite so flush with the body of the
phone because it makes them a little
harder to press and find by feel the
power button also doesn't have the most
satisfying click it feels very uneven
and mushy and it's honestly one of the
least premium feeling parts about this
phone it does however double as a
fingerprint scanner and the fingerprint
scanner feels very Nexus like it only
takes five to six taps to register a
fingerprint and unlike other phones that
use a power button or a home button as
the fingerprint scanner you don't
actually have to press the power button
in order for it to read your fingerprint
it'll unlock as soon as you rest your
finger on it and it does it pretty
quickly and accurately - on the bottom
of the phone is a USB type-c port so
that's nice to see especially for a
mainstream flagship and flanking that is
a microphone and a single bottom firing
speaker speaker quality is actually
pretty good it doesn't compare to
front-facing speakers or anything but
it's loud and produces a clean sound
even at max volume and is one of the
better single speakers I've heard on a
smartphone in a long while the g5 isn't
going to win any awards for the way that
it looks
but the g5 isn't about being the best
looking phone it's about what this phone
can actually do that makes it unique
even though it's a unibody design you
still have expandable storage built into
the SIM tray for up to an additional 200
gigabytes and the bottom chin pops off
with a simple press of a button allow
you to remove and swap batteries on the
fly this removable bottom chin also
makes the g5 one of the first modular
smartphones to hit the mainstream and
it's really the most compelling part
about this phone what the g5 LG is
introducing what they like to call
friends because not all these components
are actually modules some connect
directly to the bottom of the phone and
some connect via bluetooth and there's
only a handful of these friends right
now but there should be more coming in
the future right now the only module
components are the camera grip which
gives you physical controls for
launching the camera taking a photo and
zooming in and out it also gives you an
extra 1,200 milliamp hours worth of
battery life on top of the standard g5
battery the only downside to this camera
grip is that it adds bulk and makes a g5
uncomfortable to use as a phone the
other module is a hi-fi audio DAC that
LG teamed up with B&amp;amp;O to produce for
higher quality audio when using
headphones
this doesn't add bulk to the g5 in terms
of width but it does make the g5 a
slightly taller phone other friends for
the g5 include a VR headset and a 360
degree camera that lets you take 16
megapixel 360 degree photos or 360
degree video and 2k resolution the
display as I mentioned earlier is a
smaller this year at 5.3 inches but it's
large enough that things like YouTube
movies and playing games is still a very
enjoyable experience it's an IPS LCD
with same resolution of 2560 by 1440
like last year's g4 it is slightly
sharper due to the higher pixel density
from the smaller screen but otherwise
it's a pretty typical display that you
would expect from LG it's super bright
and easily visible outdoors the viewing
angles are really nice and the color
reproduction looks pretty spot-on
they're vibrant without being overly
saturated and the whites on this display
are a very pure shade of white which is
something I noticed about it almost
immediately the g5 also carries an
always-on display similar to the v10 but
instead of a separate tiny display it's
been incorporated into the main screen
it doesn't have a ton of functionality
but it can show you the clock incoming
notifications or a signature or random
message the problem with it is it's not
very bright so if you're outdoors it's
practically invisible this is probably
due to the fact that it's an LCD and LG
had to keep the brightness low to help
conserve battery life with this being
one of LG's biggest flagships of the
year you can of course expect to get the
latest and greatest specs so inside it's
got the Snapdragon 820 Adreno 530 and 4
gigabytes of RAM and performance has
been really snappy and fast the
animations are buttery smooth it loads
apps quickly multitask and plays
high-end games
extremely well I haven't noticed its
phone slowing down whatsoever and it's
probably one smooth its performing
phones that LG has ever put out when
playing games for extended periods of
time or other heavy tasks it does
eventually get warm to the touch
especially with that metal body but it
was nothing out of the ordinary or
anything to get alarmed about and as far
as regular everyday use it keeps its
cool just fine as far as battery life
goes it's got a 2800 milliamp hour
battery inside which is a decent size
although with flagships I typically like
to see at least 3000 milliamp hours or
larger but it's been enough to get the
job done I'm not getting the greatest
screen on time numbers what's green on
time ranging anywhere between 3 to 4
hours but with normal usage I can
comfortably make it through a full day
without hunting for a charger midway
through the day
it does have Qualcomm quick charge 3.0
which makes it really easy to fill up or
top off but even better than that is the
fact that the battery can still be
swapped out for a fresh one if you
really want to take your phone from em
to full as quickly as possible even with
this revamp design and change in build
quality it's pretty awesome that LG
still managed to figure out a way to
keep the core features of their
smartphone intact so last year LG did a
dual camera setup with the v10 on the
front facing cameras but this year LG
decided to bring that dual setup to the
rear of the g5 the main lens is a 16
megapixel sensor with optical image
stabilization and an aperture of f-18
and the second camera is a wide-angle 8
megapixel sensor at F 2.4 the wide-angle
camera is easily by far my favorite
thing about the g5 it's totally awesome
and a lot of fun and even though it's
lower resolution than the main sensor I
actually found myself using it more
because I just love how the photos turn
out and you can really see how much of a
difference it makes over the standard
angle of the main camera you can easily
switch between the two cameras within
the software by either tapping the two
icons on the top of the camera interface
or it'll automatically switch cameras
for you when zooming in and out the
camera software is still pretty much the
same as it was on the g4 or the v10 you
can keep it as simple as you want with a
simple or auto modes or if you want full
DSLR light controls over the settings
such as white balance ISO and shutter
speed you can still do that with the
manual mode picture quality has pretty
much been exactly what I expected from a
company like LG the photos from the g5
are some of the sharpest and most well
detailed photos you can get from a
smartphone the color reproduction is
very pleasing to the eye and with that F
1.8 aperture you can get some really
clean looking depth of field especially
with close-ups or macro shots there
doesn't seem to be a ton of crazy over
sharpening going on but I do notice that
the camera has a tendency to really
crush shadows in a lot of daytime shots
but the HDR mode does a solid job of
compensating for that
it also doesn't over saturate the colors
so pictures still come out looking
pretty natural low-light performance is
decent but it's definitely not the best
that I've seen it can over expose a lot
with the highlights and there's a very
noticeable amount of noise reduction
going on especially in nighttime shots
also because the g5 doesn't have that
laser autofocus anymore it doesn't focus
quite as quickly in low-light as far as
the front-facing camera goes it's an 8
megapixel sensor with F 2.0 aperture and
it takes pretty good selfies whether it
be during the day or at night if you're
into that sort of thing now the software
is actually pretty interesting it's
running
Android 6.0 marshmallow with LG's usual
skin but it's changed quite a bit for
the g5 and is probably the cleanest and
least intrusive that LG's UI has ever
been it's got a much nicer looking color
scheme with the white and light green
colored accents in the notification
shade and Settings menu by default the
settings menu is still a four panel
setup that have always found difficult
to navigate but LG gives you the option
this time around to switch to a more
traditional ListView that falls in line
more with what you normally get on stock
Android many of LG's features like smart
bulletin and qslide apps are all still
baked in but they're not quite as
in-your-face as before and smart
bulletin is actually off by default but
they are there if you dig deep enough
into the settings to look for them one
feature that LG got rid of is the dual
window feature which was kind of a
strange decision since a lot of people
really like that feature but considering
that Android and will be bringing this
feature natively it may not be that big
of a deal the biggest change the LG
software is the lack of an app drawer
with a new launcher which makes it feel
more iOS like and if you've never used
an Android phone without an app drawer
before you might find it to be a little
bit jarring at first obviously if you
don't like this change you can easily
swap it out with a third-party launcher
like the Google now launcher or if you
want to stick purely to LG software LG
recently released their home 4.0
launcher that's available for download
in the smart world application to bring
back the app drawer pricing for the LG
g5 is pretty typical for a flagship
smartphone it ranges anywhere between
six to seven hundred dollars off
contract depending on carrier with
options to finance the cost through each
respective carrier the g5 is a step in a
completely new direction for LG it
offers a brand new metal design a very
impressive dual camera setup and it's
modular capabilities makes it one of the
most unique smartphones we've seen in a
long time while other manufacturers are
focused purely on making a good
smartphone
LG wanted to create a product that stood
out and they've certainly been able to
do that without sacrificing features
like expandable storage and a removable
battery so even though this is a very
different phone from what we've seen
from LG in the past they've still
managed to stay true to themselves but
the most intriguing part about the g5
isn't what it's capable of doing now but
rather what it's capable of doing in the
future and that alone makes the g5 one
very compelling smart phone as always
