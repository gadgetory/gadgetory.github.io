handy from Android Authority and in this
quick video we're going to take you look
at android 5.1 lollipop first let's talk
about the changes to the system volume
there isn't a classic silent mode yet
which may make some people mad but they
did improve on what was already there
for starters you can now see
notifications while in no interruptions
mode and I guess that's a step forward
you can also now see the icons next to
no interruptions mode and priority mode
this will help those new to the OS
discern which mode they're actually in
because those same icons appear in the
status bar once selected and that's a
nice touch the last thing they did was
give you the ability to get to the
system volume anytime anywhere all you
need to do is tap the little bell icon
on the right side and it will pop up the
system volume menu so you can make
changes it's a little thing but it's
actually quite a useful feature while
we're on the topic of notifications they
also tweaked the heads-up notifications
before you used to swipe up on them and
it would dismiss them entirely even from
the notification drop-down now you can
swipe up and hide the notification but
it is still in the notification
drop-down so you can get to it later in
the quick settings you'll see a couple
of changes you can now connect to Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth devices straight from the
quick settings without entering the
actual settings menu just tap on the
little down arrow and you will see a
list of available things to connect to
it's a nifty little feature for those
who connect to things frequently a few
elements in the OS also managed to get
some fun little animations here you can
see the landscape portrait toggle get a
new animation and Hindi clock
application all four icons along the top
are animated as well there are little
things but it's still appreciated while
we're on the topic the no sim card icon
also got a redesign and you can see that
right here another application that got
a bit of Polish is the contacts app the
gross color overlays are now gone and
you'll have unfettered view of your
contact pictures the little icons and
buttons do change colors depending on
the color of the contact picture or of
the color of the contact itself if there
are no pictures screen printing is a
feature that lets you lock people into
an application and it's great for kids
or people who are borrowing your phone
the screen printing instructions are
slightly better worded now and the
explanation is as well otherwise that
feature works pretty much as it always
did some of the other things that were
added is HD voice for select devices on
compatible carriers I was
able to test this feature but I have
used HD voice calling before it sounds
way better than regular calls and
they're also a bit clearer and louder
another feature that got added was
device protection again I couldn't test
this one because it's not available for
the Nexus 5 yet but the Nexus 6 and
Nexus 9 should have it essentially it
makes you login to your device
even if it's factory reset so people who
steal your phone still can't access it
even if they factory reset there were a
metric ton of under the hood changes
that amounted to about fourteen or
fifteen hundred total the dreaded memory
bug appears to have been fixed which is
great news there have been a number of
optimizations bug fixes and performance
improvements new player has officially
taken the place of Awesome player as the
default media player we'll see how that
all works out as time goes the lollipop
experience overall appears to be much
smoother than it was previously and
putting stress on a newly formatted
system didn't seem to affect it all that
much of course your mileage may vary and
I didn't test this super thoroughly but
it seems to handle literally all of the
preinstalled applications being open and
switching between them without too much
of an issue overall it's a very positive
update although I wish they've just
given us legit silent mode and that
about does it for this video folks if
you haven't already don't forget to

wherever Android authority is as always
thanks for watching everybody and have a
wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
