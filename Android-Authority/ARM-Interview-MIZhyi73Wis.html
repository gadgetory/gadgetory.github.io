to spend some time with a very special
friend of ours the man who works for arm
his name is James Bruce and he's the
head mobile strategies for arm and here
we are mobile world congress from
Barcelona and we're going to ask some
tough questions ok not so tough cuz
actually let's just talk about armors
company and let's just talk about how
things have led up to now so I mean as
you know arm is about 23 years oh yes
and really our focus rather than being a
processor company we came up with this
unique business model where we actually
licensed the processor to other chip
companies and what this means is that
you have great companies like Qualcomm
and video Samson broadcom I could keep
on going as 200 of them and it really
allows them to innovate they can use a
standards-based core with access to a
great ecosystem such as Android but then
it allows them to do their own unique
SOC s and I think the really exciting
thing from the perspective of consumers
perspective of people who really care
about their gadgets is that you end up
with devices that's all unique that are
different rather than just taking one
SOC and everyone doing different
plastics around it what happens is that
you see different solutions different
products coming out of that and that
different price points I think down here
we've got some great examples
so the first one we have
is a tablet from China this is a
quad-core cortex a7 from allwinner it
has a IPS screen running at 2k
resolution and I retina display retina
display yeah and as I mentioned had a
two hundred fifty dollar price point and
has for the price point and the fact
that it's just using cortex a7 has a
great user experience have the browser
and I bad with the same display that's
right yeah and this actually comes into
our next device here which I really like
and this is the base around rod 87 and
it's using the media tech parts and it's
got a very nice display it's got a great
user interface very fluid
and this is also coming up coming into
the market a very sort of mid-level
price point so there's a number of users
whether not lucky like for example we
are in the US where handsets are heavily
subsidized where they want a great user
experience but perhaps don't want to
spend six hundred dollars for us and
devices like this great when first one
and this one James um price point for
that is hasn't quite come to market but
I would expect it to be around that's
250 300 dollars so that meditation did
this one was almost previously
inexpensive that's right so this
particular one sells for seventy dollars
unsubsidized how many dollars but if you
want to go lower that's actually another
handset based around the same chipset as
spreadtrum of life selling for
forty-eight dollars unsubsidized in
China yes and that really shows the
differences that you're getting the sort
of scale of solutions and then if you
like me if you're a sort of gadget geek
and what they sort of ultimate and and
everything to our games of course I
wouldn't be doing this job otherwise yes
then what we've got here is a
demonstration of the Exynos 5 octa
showing off big listen the Exynos 5 octa
yeah can you speak a little bit about
this for us absolutely so it has eight
cores but rather than a cause being the
same size it's actually four little
pores and poor big ones and the reason
is is a lot of tasks actually don't need
that home
so you run on the little paws and then
when you need the Pullman it's able to
switch out to the big paws when needed
as demonstrated here go back to the
littles so you actually get the best of
both world to get the spray hi battery
efficiency and very high performance so
if you look at things like the quad
cortex a15 devices if you look at
benchmarks like deep bench they're
actually approaching benchmarks that you
see in a typical laptop and someone's
home today true so it's going to be
really exciting when products like this
getting to your hands for the
introduction there's been a lot of
speculation you know about the octa yeah
and a lot of consumers at least in our
commenting and on our forums and
everything is in when it one of the core
is going to solve and in reality are we
actually going to see octa-core in 2013
so eun devices so you're going to see
optical but you gotta remember this is
not octa-core like quad not only
conventional said no we are we
understand yeah i think our readers in
our viewers that android 30 days
certainly savvy enough to appreciate the
difference between a traditional a
coprocessor and a big little yeah
completely it's to architectures working
simultaneously
that's right and so I think really
you're going to see no increase in the
number of the same cause but what you're
going to see is actually people using
more cause to actually deliver great
performance or greater power efficiency
in the next step is really GP GPU
compute mm-hmm and I'm sure a lot of
your readers have the nexus 10 which has
our Marley t6o powerful SOC exactly and
that actually have a multi 604 has been
news now for things like image
processing image editing video editing
and so you're going to see this trend of
more and more cause because it really
allows to allows you to have the right
call for the job at hand this is
interesting can you explain to me just
briefly why Apple with our iPad and I
know you enjoy a special relationship
arm does with Apple why they're able to
push up so much performance with yet 512
megabytes of RAM and low clock
frequencies and what I view as previous
generation reference instruction sets so
I mean obviously I can't comment on
Apple directly and but I think you've
really got to look at it's very much
when you look at any product like this
from Firefox OS to other products such
as windows phone to android it's very
dependent upon the OS how its design
early yet and how much memory is oh yeah
so it's very dependent upon just the
fundamental OS and what you're doing
with it
viously the language that is coated in
you know it's very different to
intervene java-based it presents certain
you know architectural challenges you
know in terms of efficiency I think I
mean androids a great OS and yeah and
but also it's a very powerful OS with a
lot of multitasking exactly and I think
that's one of the great things about
Android you've got great handsets like
the note 2 other handsets 2 gigabytes
and the real multitasking environment
and I'm sure you've seen the videos in
the web where note 2 has been used as
sort of desktop replacements I have a no
to India change well oh yeah it's
extremely productive you know and i
think the exciting thing is that you're
going to see much more powerful handsets
coming out this year so as yet as your
readership is sort of true sort of
Android your fans you're going to have
some really exciting devices via
smartphones or tablets in your hands so
let's talk about the elephant in the
room which is Intel and they're trying
to play a lot of ketchup in the x86 you
know just in terms of the economy scaled
yeah they've killed in their very
profitable but x86 processor are
diminishing year after year arm in the
server space and the TDP w vs you know
the TV BTW that intel's able to produce
so i think what people have got to keep
in mind is that fundamentally if you
look at let's say the atom processor in
a medfield handset okay vs1 cortex a9
performance wise they're roughly the
same they deliver the same benchmarks
you can always find one benchmark that
makes the other guys look better and
vice versa love them but the key thing
is is that the cortex a9 is almost four
times smaller than the
yeah and what that means is that
fundamentally your SOC is a cheaper
fundamentally more power efficient and I
think the other great thing is that
really it's about buying cool devices
and if you look at what x86 has done is
brought nothing new to the market they
have brought enough you're a long time
not any new super phones and if you look
at all the cool devices even you know at
great price points or great performance
it's boats arm-based because we really
allow people to innovate well and you
have a lot of active relationships with
a lot of very innovative and
forward-thinking companies so tell me
this ten years from now James we have a
device that perhaps is this size there
can really just be our everything or is
it coming sooner than that it's coming
much sooner so I think you're really
looking at the point in let's say two
years to two years where it will have
really if you look at the Exynos 5 octa
and other parts such as the Tegra 4
they're almost at lap top performance
through this year so 2014-2015 really
the only limit is the size of your
screen and if you plug into wirelessly
connect two monitors bluetooth keyboard
mouse then it can replace your desktop
laptop and the last question that I'll
ask you sir is you know the it's really
incredible the IP instruction sets that
you're revealing and that you're working
with partners on actively improving
everything yeah but everything is
improving it people can argue 82 142 two
hundred percent per year
you know the performance yeah but
battery life is only increasing a five
percent per year so what can we do in
terms of that regard so I think there's
two things to keep in mind certainly
what you're seeing is we're looking at
technologies like big little which we
talked about GPU compute all there to
improve efficiency I'm going to cheat
and we going to say I get that beautiful
so what we've got here is a 14 nanometer
test way for 14 14 nanometer FinFET on
there so empty oh no actually IBM Wow oh
they're scary so really advanced
technology that helps on the power to as
well yeah and it's really incredible but
i think the other critical thing to keep
in mind is if you look let's say ten
years ago when you had that wonderful
nokia s40 handset unless you a snake
addict it was very hard to use the
battery through the day because you just
couldn't do much with it you can take to
make very different now James make a
phone call and now you just do so much
on your phone because it's very much
your primary compute device but
certainly as you look at new screen
technologies technologies like big
little the other stuff that our partners
are doing your battery life is going to
get better galaxy s4 octo-core i would
let samson on to that one you're no fun
just joking thank you so much for your
time sir okay right I really it's an
honor meeting you as well James all
right thanks so much android authority
here live from Mobile World Congress
hearing straight from the man himself
it's a real pleasure and an honor I'm
kind of having nerd struck right now and
we'll stay in touch with a white no you
know we're here for you guys delivering
the freshest finest Android news every
day thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
