by bitdefender mobile security the
galaxy s5 was just announced a few days
ago and as expected the impressions are
mixed some people want a more on the
spec side of things or a full overhaul
on design and others enjoy the new
design enhancements and they are
counting down the days until they can
get their hands on one let's dig into
the keynote and talk about the top 5 new
features of the galaxy s5 the first
topic during the keynote is that the s5
is now ip67 dust and water resistant it
may not be time to go swimming with your
phone just yet but this prevents dunks
and accidental drops in waters or
splashes or or even getting caught in
the rain these type of things will no
longer harm your phone the other phones
in the market that has a certification
actually holds up pretty well there's
some people that have ones swimming with
their phone and also there's videos
online of people taking showers dumping
them and submerging them in water now I
don't recommend doing that but the same
certification has worked for previous
phones and it should work the same for
this phone and the dust protection is a
bonus as well imagine taking your phone
to the beach and not worrying about
getting sand in your and your earpiece
or on the microphone or if your big slob
like me you don't want to have crumbs in
your phone because you're eating and
talking on the phone or you're eating a
text messaging it's completely sealed
from water and dust we could having a
certification for dust proof and water
resistant there's going to be additional
coverings on your phone so your
headphone jack your USB port all are
going to be covered they're going to
have a flap on there which at first it
may be annoying to pull the flat back
but the added protection it will be
totally worth it now the second feature
I'm going to cover is the enhanced
camera best five is using the ISO cell
image sensor which has been covered
extensively by our own Robert Riggs he
broke it down much better than I can
even fathom so instead of me not doing
it any justice to this topic just make
sure you read the article the link is
down below in barcelona some of our guys
had a chance to go hands-on with the
camera and i was told that it is
groundbreaking the initial tests
everything seems to be good they love
the way it auto focuses and they love
the way it feels there's a few features
that are worth mentioning and that is
the enhanced HDR that eliminates the lag
that is needed to take two images
selective focus gets the shallow depth
of field as you will see on a DSLR and
of course the 4k recording one
additional feature is called a phase
detect autofocus when working correctly
it can autofocus in three tenths of a
second this used the light in a sensor
for auto focusing versus contrast and
that actually space things up a whole
lot better and it's more accurate a few
DSLRs uses this technology photo
focusing already and so you can just
imagine how much better it will make
your phone the fingerprint scanner as
expected was added to the galaxy s5 it
uses a swiping method to read the finger
swipe down from the home screen and over
the home button to authenticate this is
used to login to the device private mode
which unhides pictures videos and other
sensitive data and also for PayPal
payments and of course with something
like this it just depends on how well it
works and it's something that's worth
even using I have a feeling that some
people may disable it if it doesn't work
on the first couple attempts and only
time will tell if samsung will hook up
with other applications to allow
authentication like maybe the Play Store
the possibilities are endless but it has
to be done right this five is really
focusing on fitness this time around so
when you're working out you can stop
your workout pull the phone out of your
pocket and see what your heart rate is
that know your heart rate is key during
cardio workouts to stay within that
optimal zone and Samsung is helping you
do that and if that's not your cup of
tea Samsung has a few other wearable
components that can help you as well
these smart watches fitness band type of
devices will track your heart rate for
you while being able to interact with
your smartphone at the same time now
what good is all these features if you
don't have the battery to keep it
running one of the versions of the s5 is
running the Snapdragon 801 SOC which
sips on battery life instead of slurping
it like other chips you may see the
battery is also a 2800 milliamp and when
combined with the 801 this should allow
you to get at least a full day's worth
of battery
and if that's not enough and you're on
your last leg there is a feature that
really cuts down your phone's resources
it actually makes your phone go to
grayscale and it disables every single
thing but the phone and SMS and they say
within 24 hour period you have less than
a 10% drain which is huge and there you
have it guys that was the top 5 new
features for the galaxy s5 stay tuned
