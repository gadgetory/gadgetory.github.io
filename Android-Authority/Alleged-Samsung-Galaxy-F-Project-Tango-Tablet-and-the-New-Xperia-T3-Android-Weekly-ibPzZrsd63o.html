is Jace and in this past week one of my
good friends asked me Jace when will we
see the big leap forward I mean when
will we see an innovation an Android
that just blows everything else on the
water and I didn't have the most
satisfying answer for him at the time
because when it comes to phones I think
we're going to see incremental
improvements and when it comes to
wearables though that's where we might
see big leaps forward but then Google
came out with project tango now I'm
willing to forgive the bezels that look
like they're a throwback from 2008
because on paper at least this tablet is
a beast the project tango tablet has a
quad-core nvidia tegra k1 processor with
4 gigabytes of ram 128 gigabytes of
storage 1080p display motion tracking
cams LTE and integrated depth sending
technology with USB 3.0 micro HDMI and
of course Android 4.4 KitKat as you can
see this tablet is without a doubt the
most impressive Android device in the
planet at least in terms of raw specs to
date and as you've probably guessed it
does not come cheap this is a developer
version right now and comes at a
thousand and twenty four dollars when it
launches later this month now like many
of you my interest was piqued by the
words integrated depth sending tech what
does that mean and how would it be used
well project tango is a little bit coin
exactly what it means but we know it is
something to do with 3d mapping so I
could imagine for example if you were
going to buy a house or rent a house
instead of having to go and visit 20
different houses before you chose one
you could go to website and view 3d
rendering or internal rendering internal
mapping of that particular residence
that would be very cool moving on to
news about the much-anticipated android
4.4 point 3 update as expected the
update has been full of bug fixes the
dialer and people apps have been updated
there have been fixes to Bluetooth
issues that some folks have been
experiencing as well as a fix for
popping sounds with flac audio files
there's also been improvements for low
volume on wired headsets better camera
focus for
nexus5 audio quality improvements also a
fix for Wi-Fi drop issues and plenty of
improvements and fixes that affect art
dalvik and many other apps but you
should know the update brought new bug
fixes one dealing with LT performance
issues and the second one we know of
deals with LED notifications failing
when you have missed calls now for all
of you in the market for a mid-tier
phablet sony might have some good news
for you the Xperia t3 features a 5.3
inch HD display and it features a bravia
engine too with enhanced video and image
quality inside the device takes an
unspecified quad-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon chip clocked at one point 4
gigahertz possibly a Snapdragon 200 with
one gigabyte of ram 8 gigabytes of
internal storage but it's expandable to
32 gigabytes via the microSD card slot
the Xperia t3 is an LTE device and comes
with 8 megapixel rear facing camera LED
flash and 1.1 megapixel front facing
camera it also has NFC and Bluetooth 4.0
this Sony Xperia t3 will launch globally
at the end of July with pricing to be
announced in the future now if you guys
watch last week's show where I ranted on
samsung and pleaded with them to release
ties into the world in the form of a
smartphone and almost in response that's
exactly what they did the Samsung z
comes with a four point eight inch HD
720 AMOLED display and there's a two
point three gigahertz quad-core
processor Samsung didn't specify what
processor was inside but we know it has
two gigabytes of ram 16 gigabytes of
internal storage and a microSD card slot
that allows for an additional 64 gigs
the rear shooter is an 8 megapixel model
while the battery is a respectable 2600
milliamp hour battery now so far as we
know Tizen from the beginning has been
designed to have a consistent user
experience right across all platforms
whether that's a phone tablet or even a
vehicle now up until the phone came out
Tizen only powered the gear watch and of
course the camera so we have lots of
hopes for Tizen if you guys if anyone
actually gets this phone I'd love for
you to tell me or what your experience
was put in the comments below or send me
a message by google hangouts
if you have that phone I would like to
get that message so before we go let's
have some rumor time and I'm talking
about the galaxy f or the galaxy s5
Prime depending on which rumor you
believe now this appears to be a press
render which could give us the first
look at the premium s5 or as evleaks
calls it the supposed galaxy f at a
glance we notice the chrome frame around
the device and the brushed finish of the
back cover which may actually be metal
or textured plastic similar to the LG g3
Samsung is no stranger to brush metal
textures it used a very similar finished
on the plastic active s windows phone
the camera flash and heart rate monitor
our back and seem identical to the s5
but the front camera is in a different
position just to the right of the
earpiece grill thanks for watching
android army my name is Jace love to
connect with you here on google+ or
twitter you don't wanna forget about my
