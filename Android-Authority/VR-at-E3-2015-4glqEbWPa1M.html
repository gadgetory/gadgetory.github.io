android authority and we are still here
at e3 it is the last day and we just
wanted to bring you guys a quick roundup
of the VR experiences that we saw here
at e3 and I'm joined by andrew grush one
of our writers so we're just going to
get right into it and start off with the
first one that we got to check out which
was the merge VR and basically this was
a it's sort of like a google cardboard
type experience I accept the headset was
actually made of foam it was a
high-quality phone that's designed so
that we can wipe off sweat easily you
know it's just it was opposed to be very
resilient you could drop it without
damaging the without damaging the
headset and really not a lot about the
design I mean what really makes it stand
out is yes it's gear it is a not gear
I'm sorry it is cardboard compatible but
the the the big advantage of this is
that it also has a remote that acts kind
of like oh I want to call out a Wii
Remote basically you know you could
swing around and you have full access
control and so that kind of gives you a
whole new level of you know to the
gaming experience the remote definitely
does add a extra level of gameplay to
the VR experience at least on a more
simplified VR headset so you do get to
interact with the game a lot more for
example the game that we got to play use
the control to basically shoot balls of
magic or whatever they were to sort of
attack the bats that were going at you
so it does add a little bit extra to the
experience but for the most part it's
really kind of pretty much the same
would you say it's really kind of the
same thing as Google cardboard or yeah
it will have its own SDK you that they
will have their own apps apps too well
it's not really an app store it's an app
and then it has all the links or
everything and then when you find what
you want pushes you out to google play
or the demo that we did show was on was
on an iphone but the final version when
it arrives we'll be on Android as well
but yes basically it is an over
glorified cardboard with a few
stress that make it you know interesting
it's about 130 dollars alright so
jumping to our next one next VR headset
that we got to experience was a Fauve
and this was the cool thing about this
particular headset was it uses on top I
just moved using your head to track
motion it also use your eyes and I was
like she's only one that got to
experience this particular one but I was
actually pretty impressed by because the
eye tracking works extremely well and
basically the game that we were playing
was a alien type game where a bunch of
aliens would pop up on the screen and
you would just look at them in order to
shoot them and they sort of made you
feel like cyclops in a way because
they're just shoot lasers at these
spaceships and all you had to do is just
basically move your head or just use
your eyes to basically aim at them and
blast everything away so there's
actually a really cool experience to
kind of experience something a little
bit different from your standard VR
headset that just repoed relies on your
head quality of it was actually pretty
good too they were they were quad HD
quad HD resolution so it definitely was
a pretty decent experience for just a
simple headset so let's go ahead and
talk about oculus and I'll let you start
off with your experience with oculus
this is both our first time experience
the oculus rift so what did you think
about it so I absolutely loved it I
played the edge of nowhere and it's a
dark if you like dark edgy type games
you're starting out an Arctic setting
and just going around and basically just
the experience is not where as we kind
of talked about in another video the
experience it's not true as far as like
you don't feel like you're the
controller you're like it's you around
the controller but it is still a really
immersive experience that it's similar
to what we have already had seen with
gaming but at a whole new level and this
game in particular was great because it
was scary to a point because you had
like stuff like running around you you
didn't what was going on there was a lot
of noises eventually likes all these
monsters and yeah I as far as the
hardware itself though moving beyond the
game uh I think there's a lot of
potential there right now it is a pricey
I mean I know they're aiming
you know over a thousand dollar pricing
but as far as a big next big thing I
think we are I think that uh the the it
is an excellent example of where we're
heading with VR and I'm really excited
when for the rift yeah I think oculus is
doing a great job with the rift and I
got to experience it for my before the
first time as well but what I really
want to jump into is project Morpheus
that was also a first time thing for me
so I and I was only one here that was
able to actually get a chance because it
was a really long wait it took a little
bit over an hour just to kind of get up
there and just 45 minutes of gameplay
and it definitely was worth the five
minutes that I got to experience with
it's really cool it's very immersive
feels a lot like oculus except the
resolution isn't quite as great but the
particular game that I mentioned in the
reactions video that I did it's called
rigs and basically you're inside a giant
robot and you go around blasting other
players and you have to score goals
things of that nature so it was a really
cool game I had a really fun time with
it and the experience is really great
there's no latency to it whatsoever
other than that it was a really awesome
experience I would say it's very
comparable one of the best VR
experiences that you can get out there
very comparable to the oculus rift the
last thing that we want to jump into is
the accessories that we saw for all the
different VR that we saw here at e3 so
brush you had more more time with these
accessories than I did so I'll go ahead
and let you talk a little bit more about
them sure so absolutely accessories were
a big deal here there were there quite a
few of them it's clear that there's a
lot of companies that are interested in
making VR move beyond just like a
traditional controller I saw a
particular Dumanis mike mussina and it
is a basically you remember some of you
some of our audience remember the
Nintendo Power glove from back in the
day you know your slipped on the glove
and allowed you to basically that's the
same thing here you have a glove and it
has little sensors inside with each
finger and you then have full access
control to move around with your hands
you can actually like point your fingers
and like shoot and it's just uh it's a
unique way of doing it it was paired
with the gear VR which that was my first
time with the gear VR as well and as far
as being like truly revolutionary it was
not but it was cool you know it was a
different way to control V are beyond
just having a traditional controller
some of the other things we noticed like
there's a thing called the nod and I
didn't personally get experience it but
what if it's a smart ring and like we
saw some really cool stuff like there
was a boxing where you have in one on
each hand and they were you know
virtually boxing with it there was also
cyber cyber earth is a treadmill and
it's kind of a treadmill / trampling
hybrid that people get in with like a
NOC list or another you know ne ne ve R
can be made to work with it and you get
in and you jump around and it just got
kind of ridiculous but it is uh it's
cool I personally think that it's a
little bit too much um but yeah I think
that that's where we're heading is
you're seeing virtual reality here at e3
and you're seeing a push towards making
it more and more immersive and it's only
going to get bigger from here yeah I
think you definitely hit the nail on the
head there vr is definitely becoming a
big thing and we're super excited to
actually be here to cover it for you
guys so hopefully you guys have been
enjoying all the coverage that we've
been bringing to you from e3 and besides
