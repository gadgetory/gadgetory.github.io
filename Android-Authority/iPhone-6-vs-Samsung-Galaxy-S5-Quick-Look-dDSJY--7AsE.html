look at the brand new iPhone versus the
Samsung Galaxy s5 we do have two very
different design philosophies at work
here as is usually the case between
Samsung and Apple Samsung continues to
Bank on plastic with their flagship
device switching out the glossy plastic
for a more soft touch like material that
has a perforated dimple designed that to
be honest we're still not too sure about
when it comes to its looks iPhone on the
other hand delivers yet again with its
build quality with the full metal
unibody construction of the iPhone 6 has
curved sides less of a rigid design when
compared to its predecessor which gives
it a nice curved look all the way around
you've it on the sides and the edges and
on the top and bottom the iPhone 6
display is a lot bigger now the overall
size of which makes it a little bit more
comparable to the galaxy s5 but the gues
5 is still a bit taller a little bit
wider and that's perfectly fine
considering its comparatively larger
display but the iPhone 6 remains one of
the thinnest devices available
especially at this size where they're
really pushing the boundaries on what is
available for the different ports and
buttons on the sides the front face of
both smartphones can be described the
same way there's a signature home button
I've integrated fingerprint scanners
within those home buttons but the galaxy
s5 home button is flanked by two
capacitive keys gone are the days when
the iPhone could easily be written off
just because of its much smaller display
Apple has given it a much larger display
this time around but they still tried
not to go too overboard fitting it with
a 1334 by 750 display that still has a
pixel density of around 300 326 to be
exact the LCD display delivers though as
you would expect with some enhancements
that allow for brighter colors and the
fantastic viewing angles are still a
thing here on the other hand the 5.1
inch Super AMOLED display of the s5
comes with 1920 by 1080 resolution and
432 PPI which has been heralded as one
of the best smartphone displays ever
everything we still like about Super
AMOLED screens is found here with deep
blacks a lot of contrast and colors that
truly pop now the difference in the
pixel density is somewhat noticeable at
a very close look but for the most part
you should be able to have a pretty good
experience no matter which of these two
phones you're using the iPhone 6
features the new in-house a8 1.4
gigahertz dual-core processor along with
1 gigabyte of RAM but the Galaxy S 5
packs too
point five gigahertz in a quad-core
Snapdragon 801 backed by two gigabytes
of RAM the galaxy s5 does offer
expandable storage on top of the
built-in memory but the iPhone 6 comes
with 16 64 or 128 gigabyte flavors so if
you really need more storage then you're
probably gonna have to go with one of
the larger and more expensive options
Apple finally introduced NFC here in the
iPhone 6 to be used with Apple pay while
that is something that Samsung devices
have had for a while with its iteration
of NFC now the fingerprint scanners on
both of these take on different types
where the Samsung one is a swipe down
the iPhone 6 uses a tapping motion or a
touch motion now finally the s5 also has
the very useful advantage of having
protection against dust and water with
its ip67 certification something that
the iPhone 6 simply does not have the
iPhone 6 retains an 8 megapixel rear
shooter but with a new sensor and AF 2.2
aperture lens faster autofocus via focus
pixels and a software based image
stabilisation video gets a boost as well
especially capturing 240 frames per
second slow motion at 720p resolution
now the front-facing camera has also
been given F 2.2 lens with a burst mode
and HDR video capability now the 16
megapixel ISO SEL rear shooter of the
galaxy s5 is definitely no slouch itself
using new technology from Samsung to be
able to give fantastic color
reproduction and very clean and crisp
images now what Samsung also does pack
in are a ton of features inside of the
app itself and the more simplistic way
of using the iPhone 6 application inside
of its camera does give it a little bit
of an advantage if you get overwhelmed
by everything that Samsung's camera is
able to do and finally when it comes to
software we look at iOS 8 in the iPhone
6 which is not an aesthetic overhaul the
way iOS 7 was but it still provides
quite a few new features like widgets in
the notification drop-down in a new
health app that actually taps into the
applications for help that you may
otherwise have installed and puts all of
that information into one place one
feature I did like a lot about it was
the ability to put in your emergency
contact and also vital information in
case you end up and say the emergency
room and you don't have all your
information on hand right away
now the Galaxy S 5 runs Android 4.4
KitKat the latest version of TouchWiz on
top of it the latest iteration is a
smoothest and the sleekest yet but that
doesn't necessarily mean it's been toned
down too much indeed it does come with a
lot of the same
that might overwhelm the general user
but that also includes things like the
heart rate monitor the my magazine and
also the bunch of gesture controls that
you may or may not be using there really
weren't any major UI changes when it
comes to this version of android and the
galaxy s5 so as always with the case of
TouchWiz you're either going to love it
or hate it or maybe you'll love it and
then you might find you're not really
using everything so much later on and so
there you have it for this look at the
Apple iPhone 6 versus the Samsung Galaxy
s5 Apple is finally packin a bigger
punch in its iPhones and we will admit
they are a little bit better competitors
now when compared to Android flagships
but the differences are definitely
something that you're going to have to
figure out on your own as far as which
one is better for you so keep it to two
