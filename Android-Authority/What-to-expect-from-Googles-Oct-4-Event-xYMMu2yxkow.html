president of Android and on Saturday he
made this bold claim we announced the
first version of Android eight years ago
today I have a feeling eight years from
now we'll be talking about October 4th
2016 pretty promising isn't it but take
that with a big grain of salt because
hiroshi has a history of leading us on a
bit of a wild goose chase last year he
was putting Clues out to the media that
Android M was actually Android milkshake
when of course it was marshmallow so
hiroshi if you are gonna break our
hearts and this is going to be anything
less than a fundamental shift I am
coming for you on twitter and the
differences between everyone else who
follows you and me is I bring the
Android army so not only did Android
executives put out very promising tweets
to the whole world about October 4th but
Google actually put a mysterious looking
statue in the middle of Manhattan so
what are they trying to say do you think
well what we do know is that Google has
officially confirmed that the pixel
phones would be unveiled on October 4th
and now the pixel and the pixel XL are
back with more leaked photos as you can
see both phones seem to be made of
aluminum primarily the front is a
similar story a slate of glass on top of
the display relatively slim side bezels
and a few sensors above the only
difference between the pixel and the
pixel XL seems to be the size they are
rumored to be a 5.2 inch display and a
5.5 inch display respectively one thing
is for sure whoever the pixel phones are
positively HTC they look very similar to
the HTC a9 and by association Google's
upcoming phones look very similar to the
iPhone for better or for worse to
refresh your memory the regular pixel
phone will likely come with a 5.2 inch
full HD display powered by a Snapdragon
820 the pixel XL will probably support a
5.5 inch quad HD display and said to be
coming with either a revised version of
the Snapdragon 820 chipset or the
Snapdragon 820 one both devices should
feature an identical 12 megapixel rear
cam and an 8 megapixel selfie shooter
now the latest news suggests that these
phones might be a bit more expensive
than preview
Nexus handsets with prices potentially
starting at 6:49 ouch to soften the
damage on your wallet however the same
source also suggests that Google will
introduce financing options with the
pixel what else can we expect from this
mysterious October 4th date what we're
expecting that Google will also
reintroduce stuff that they talked about
at Google i/o to start with Google home
remember Google home it's pretty much a
direct competitor to the Amazon echo but
with Google services baked into its core
it's much like a stationary Google
assistant some of the core features
include the ability to answer your
questions using Google search track
weather provide other information and
organize your itinerary the gadget can
also play your music or cast content to
other supported devices it should be a
neat smart product to have around and
the cost is said to be around a hundred
and twenty bucks are you convinced next
up we also expect chromecast to receive
an upgrade called chromecast ultra we've
been hearing rumors of a supercharge
chromecast and it will likely be named
chromecast ultra this will be a 4k
capable chromecast that is now rumored
to a cost approximately 69 bucks u.s.
what about Google Wi-Fi particularly if
you're not very happy with Google's on
hub routers Google is said to be coming
up with their brand new router that will
take your internet further literally
Google wi-fi's main features the ability
to link together multiple access points
to create one large wireless network in
essence it would be a simplified or by
glorified system of Wi-Fi range
extenders or at least that's what it
seems like it'll be it would be great
for large houses or offices especially
considering how easy it is to operate
one of Google's routers it is believed
that the administrator can simply
operate Google Wi-Fi through the onhub
app it should have smart features but
don't expect too much the rumored price
is a hundred and twenty nine dollars
which is much cheaper than on hub
routers oh this hurts to talk about oh
right in the fields I was only going to
talk about Google's October 4th event
but we just heard like 12 hours ago that
BlackBerry is getting out of the
smartphone market they are not going to
make smart phone hardware anymore
they're just going to focus on software
for those of you who are much younger
blackberry was the behemoth they were
the dominant smartphone maker for like
it 1012 years I mean there's a whole
name for people like that they're called
crack berries and now you know if you
only got a smartphone five years ago you
wouldn't understand this but they were
as big as Google I'm bigger because this
is before Apple made the iPhone they
were doing were just massive right I
mean anyone who was anyone who wanted
real work done and they weren't a
smartphone you got a blackberry and they
called you a crack berry because you
were always on it it's just so sad it's
just the end of an era
you know analysis wise it's too early to
tell let's hope they can pivot into
something else like IBM did we'll see
let me know what you guys think in the
comments below you guys will remember
from like 15 years ago when people were
making money hands over fist in the.com
bubble
remember we didn't call it a dotnet
bubble or dot org bubble we didn't call
them dot biz billionaires we called them
dot-com billionaires because that's the
power of a dot-com now why is that
because no domain name extension tells
your story with the same degree of trust
as a dot-com or dotnet domain name.com
and dotnet domain name extensions inject
credibility into your online presence
