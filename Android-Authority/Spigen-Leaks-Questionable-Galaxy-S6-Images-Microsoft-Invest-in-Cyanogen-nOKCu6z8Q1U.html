the world of news for samsung because
good old Sammy is not only shying away
from using the Snapdragon 810 but
they're promising less bloatware in the
s6 and maybe we've seen some leaked
images of the s6 and its third-party
case may be so let's start off with a
suggestion that the s6 will have less
blow where features that are built into
the operating system like multi-window
are likely to stay put but there's a
good chance that the number of
pre-loaded standalone apps will drop
significantly with that being said
Samsung is likely to keep the most
prominent and successful ones we got to
remember that the average Samsung user
out there doesn't know the difference
between Google services apps like Gmail
and Google now and Samsung's native apps
so I don't know if it's going to make
that much of a difference above and
beyond our own little tech geeky
community so you remember all that
hoopla last week about cyanogen well it
turns out that a major tech company has
become an investor in cyanogen and this
could potentially have major
ramifications that tech company
Microsoft if the wall street journal is
to be believed microsoft is a minority
investor in the latest round of equity
funding that managed to secure 70
million dollars for cyanogen while
neither cyanogen or microsoft has yet to
comment apparently several people
familiar with the situation have spoken
up about the matter Microsoft isn't
alone in cozying up to cyanogen either
as many other strategic investors have
said to be interested in investing
mainly because they want a piece of the
Android pie and are hoping to steal some
of Google's control over Android after
all Google's certification terms dictate
what the default search engine will be
for each phone what many of the default
apps will be out of the box and several
other aspects of the operating system
although this translates to a solid
experience for end-users it makes it
harder for app makers and service
providers to get any attention from
their own alternatives to google apps
now let's just think about the full
ramifications of this let's say cyanogen
does succeed at least to some measure in
these wild claims
they have to pull android away from
Google at least a little bit this would
be a good signal that maybe Microsoft is
doing a good thing and they should
invest more maybe even buy cyanogen and
possibly increase their market share
because right now they only have three
percent of the mobile market could be
interesting we'll see how that looks in
two to three years so apparently the
drama surrounding a Snapdragon 810 and
it's overheating issues has not stopped
because apparently Samsung might not be
using the 810 at all about a week ago we
first caught wind of a report from
Bloomberg claiming that Samsung would be
relying on its own Exynos processor for
the galaxy s6 with the biggest reason
being that Samsung had reportedly ran
into overheating issues while testing at
the Snapdragon 810 now Qualcomm has
seemingly confirmed that this is more
than just a rumor while Qualcomm didn't
say that Samsung isn't using the
Snapdragon 810 in its next flagship
device they did reveal that they are
adjusting the revenue expectations for
the second half of the year due to the
fact that quote a large customer quote
has elected not to use welcomes latest
chip in their flagship device putting
two and two together it seems more than
likely that Samsung is the large company
that Qualcomm is referring to as few
other OEMs are big enough to make
Qualcomm completely readjust the revenue
expectations now I'm here to warn you
that some of you may have seen these
leaked images of the alleged samsung
galaxy s6 in its third-party case but
don't take it too seriously here we go
again spigen the well-known case
manufacturer is trying to squeeze out
some early SEO juice by putting up cases
for a highly anticipated device that is
still weeks away it happened with the
HTC One m8 the Nexus 5 and now they're
trying again with the galaxy s6 the
images posted here are from speech ins
Amazon listing and allegedly show
Samsung's eagerly awaited new entry into
the Galaxy S series the clear case in
particular appears to be giving us a
good look at the galaxy s6 which if
rendered correct looks a lot like the
galaxy s5 save for the different
placement of the flash and the sensor
module is this it after Samsung promised
us new materials and innovative designs
will it deliver a galaxy s5 local I
probably not last year's pigeon put up
the galaxy s5 cases before the device
was even announced and while their
render of the device was somewhat close
to the real thing it was not entirely
accurate in speech ins galaxy s5
rendition the device had a two tone
flash but no heart rate scanner and
rather amusingly no home button so the
moral of the story don't choke on that
big grain of salt thanks for watching
android army my name is Jace I'd love to
connect with you right here on Google+
or Twitter you don't have forget about
my brothers in android Jos Joe in the
tech ninja Kevin lon and Chris Gary Nash
all working crazy hard to deliver the
best android console at the web I shall
see you next week on Android weekly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
