handy the Android authority app guy and
in this app review we're gonna be taking
a look at an educational app called
udemy
udemy allows people to take online
courses in a variety of subjects so
let's check it out so what does this app
do it's essentially a wrapper
application for you to me's online
learning platform you can use this app
to browse purchase and view content in a
variety of courses that range from
learning a second language to software
development cooking to graphic design
and pretty much everything in between so
here's how it works you browse courses
until you find one that you like you can
then buy it using in-app purchases and
you have immediate access to all of the
video lectures that are there you can
stream videos if you so choose or you
can download them for offline viewing
later the UI is very simple and that
makes the app itself very easy to use in
terms of design it follows many of the
standard Android design elements
including the slide-out left side menu
and the swipeable tabs there isn't a lot
in the app aside from videos course
listings and the courses you're enrolled
in a couple of fun things I'd like to
mention there is sign-in for Google Plus
and Facebook which is nice the in-app
purchases take place just like any other
so you can purchase whole courses using
your Google Wallet account or even Bill
your carrier which is also nice if you
have that option I've had no problems
getting videos to stream or download so
there's been no real issues so how can
you use this simply put you can use it
to learn the app offers courses and
virtually everything I could think of
and they add more all the time so if
there's a subject you've been meaning to
check out and haven't had the time or
you can't afford to take the courses in
a college environment this app helps
fill that void it's also worth noting
that if you're a current user of udemy
the website will sync with the app so
you can continue to learn on your
computer or your mobile phone no matter
which interface you currently use which
we found useful okay so here's the good
stuff the app UI is very simple and
follows Android design recommendations
thus it is very easy to navigate the
sheer number of available courses alone
make this app at least worth checking
out
I found classes for languages cooking
Italian food and even video game
development in the first 10 minutes
alone there is Google+ sign-in a plus
udemy the ability to download video
lectures for offline use is particularly
handy if you're a frequent user of
subways airplanes or being in places
without internet lastly it syncs with
its online counterpart rather well and
here are some things we think could be
improved the interface of simplicity is
also one of its weaknesses you can
sort or searches the courses you're
enrolled in you can only view them and
even though you can search for available
courses you can't sort them based on any
criteria
thus the app experience is not as rich
and interactive as the website
experience
the sign-in is a bit wonky the app
allows Facebook Google+ a native account
sign in whereas the website only allows
for Facebook and native accounts I was
able to get my content synced by signing
in with Google+ on the app and Facebook
on the website likely because I used the
same email for both but if you don't
have a Facebook and intend on using the
website you may need to create a native
account so you can sync I had a little
bit of a problem finding where
downloaded videos are located I had
assumed there would be a folder in my sd
card directory but I had to go digging
in the Android slash data directory in
order to find them also the videos
aren't properly named so if you want to
access these things outside of the
application good luck overall this is a
must-have application for people who are
looking to learn more things there are a
vast number of courses available in an
equally impressive number of subjects
and more are being added daily
the interface is simple and functional
if a little bare-bones in the feature
Department and the sign-in and file
management could use a little work that
said the issues aren't nearly bad enough
to outweigh the positive elements of
this application so if you're looking
for a chance to learn some new skills or
pick up some new hobbies this is an
amazing application to get after all
learning is good for the brain
it's free in the Play Store so the only
thing you have to pay for are the actual
courses dollar for dollar it's cheaper
than taking these same courses in a
college setting if you want it we have
the download link below once again i'm
