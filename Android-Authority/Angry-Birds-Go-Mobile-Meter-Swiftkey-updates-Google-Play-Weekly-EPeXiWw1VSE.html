hello again ladies and gentleman I'm Joe
handy the Android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly this
week we're gonna talk about Angry Birds
go a huge update to SwiftKey humble
bundle 7 and a whole lot more so let's
get started our first bit of news this
week Google is apparently releasing an
application called mobile meter which
rewards users for sending in mobile
usage statistics the premise is you
download the application opted in your
data gets anonymized and sent to Google
and they give you an unspecified
something in return and since the story
broke it's been confirmed that these
apps do in fact exist for ios and
android and will be out sometime in the
coming weeks it's worth noting that a
lot of stuff we do is monitored by
Google anyway but you can actually
choose to not opt in to this one of
course this is the only one where you
can get something out of it for opting
in and it is anonymous so people may
like it Swift Key has released a new
beta this week and it comes packed with
a bunch of new features namely keyboard
customizations and we're not talking
about theming what you can do now is
freely switch between tablet compact and
regular keyboard modes you can also
resize the keyboard and move it around
on your screen to your taste this
effectively combines the tablet phone
and phablet interface into a single app
which should make a lot of fans happy
with the ability to move the keyboard
and resize it SwiftKey is now truly an
all-in-one keyboard that you can use on
every device if you haven't yet check it
out twitter has been really busy this
year they have not only opened up their
application to beta testers but they
have all but released their tablet
interface to the masses now word around
the grapevine is twitter is working on a
messenger service this messenger service
would compete with things like Facebook
messenger hangouts and whatsapp the
details are scarce right now but the
rumor goes that Twitter will be
reformatting their direct messaging
service into a standalone messenger
service of course this is all just
rumors so it may not even exist if it
does Twitter fans could be getting a
whole new reason to stay on Twitter all
day long Humble Bundle 7 is out now in
our regular viewers know just how much I
love a good Humble Bundle package the
game selection this month is pretty
decent and considered you can get all
six games for about 6 bucks it's really
hard not to reckon
to people some of the selections are
already Android classics this includes
the RPG bard's tale which if you haven't
yet is a must-have for Android owners
that love RPG titles there are five
other great titles to choose from head
to Humble Bundle comm to see them all
and be Swift because it's only going on
until October 29th
Rovio just won't let Angry Birds die but
at least they're coming up with more
creative ways to bring the content to
gamers the latest out of Rovio will be a
racing game called Angry Birds go where
you will race go-karts downhill in Soap
Box Derby style races many may make the
lame joke that this is a mario kart
ripoff but it's really more of a Diddy
Kong Racing ripoff there are upgrades
available that let you fly around and a
variety of powers you can pick up and
use to gain an edge for a franchise that
really needed something different
Rovio might have done good here but we
won't know until it's released who wants
to see some trending applications as
usual if you want to give any of these
apps a try the download links are in the
video description first up this week is

performance pretty much across the board
along with a much smoother experience
the app also has a new GUI so it both
looks and acts brand new if you're a
Netflix subscriber and you've been
holding off on the Android version it
might be a good time to try it out now
we know a lot of people who use outlook
comms app don't like it very much but
they have been trying hard to not be so
terrible that said a recent update has
added a few new features you can now
choose more colors for theming your
inbox you can sync your entire mailbox
