lets you see more not just in terms of
how the device looks but how it looks at
the world it's Joshua Vergara what's
going on everybody and this is the
Huawei P 20 and the three camera toting
P 20 Pro prepare for some double takes
because this phone comes with what
Huawei calls the Twilight Edition there
are plenty of other colors like black
gold blue and a pink gold but we think
that this one is going to be the one you
want to look at the Twilight Edition we
wouldn't be surprised if you called it a
unicorn edition has this smooth gradient
from blue to purple on it's a very
unique look that we haven't seen in
pretty much any smartphone rounded
corners and the unique screen experience
put all of these together into one
attractive package though we will get
into the triple camera setup later let's
first talk about how modernistic the
approaches to these small details you
have the lenses they're lined up with
the official like us specifications and
then the small but impacting Huawei logo
they're all put over onto the side so
that the color it takes center stage but
holding the phone up all of these being
in a line on the side makes it look like
a very attractive and unique
point-and-shoot camera turn the device
running to get Huawei's version of a
full screen display with a notch yes the
notch is gonna be more of a thing in
Android but at least on this P 20 and P
20 Pro it doesn't take up too much space
at the top it has the call speaker and
the front-facing camera one interesting
feature about this notch is that you can
kind of turn it off it just means that
that entire bar at the top goes black
and everything renders just below it of
course this is at the top of the display
and then below it you do get a little
bit more bezel because they're still
trying to put the fingerprint reader
there while we did want to have some
continuity from one P device to the
other so the fingerprint reader returns
and it can be used as the home button or
rather the navigation button for all of
the actions if you turn off the soft
keys in the software and you are getting
full HD plus displays here at 18 by 9
aspect ratios the smaller five point
eight inch p20 gets an LCD panel while
the 6.1 inch OLED display provides some
great colors in the larger P 20 Pro
there are a few other differences under
the hood but all of these phones get the
ki-rin 970 but the Pro Edition gets 6
gigabytes of RAM over four and it's
battery is much larger it has a four
thousand milliamp hour battery compared
to the p20 3400
and for phones this thin it's
interesting that they were able to get
that much battery in here and of course
tying it all together is the emui which
if you have used it before is probably
going to feel pretty familiar it is
updated to Android Oreo and comes with a
lot of different options like we said
before you can turn off the soft keys
and just have a navigation dock or use
the fingerprint reader at the bottom to
go back home or to the recent apps
screen and then you have other options
like dual apps that are things that
we've seen in previous editions of emui
so finally we can talk about the cameras
they all start off with a high-powered
front facing shooter at 24 megapixels
though high resolution selfies will be
tested later we can expect familiar
modes like Beauty modes and other
features like we've seen before this
time with just more power underneath the
glass speaking specifically of just the
p20 it employs a familiar combination of
a 12 megapixel RGB sensor and a 20
megapixel monochrome sensor if the
original p10 was any indication this
combination should provide some highly
detailed pictures and then the p20 Pro
which does more than just add a third
lens that third lens is an 8 megapixel
telephoto lens so you get some zoom
capabilities but then you also get back
a monochrome sensor that is 20
megapixels and then finally that middle
lens is the main RGB sensor that has 40
megapixels behind all of these lenses
you get a ton of power and it's like
Huawei is trying to put every resource
possible together to provide the best
possible final shot and we wouldn't
blame you for thinking that the 40
megapixels means that low-light shots
might not be the best but while we has a
couple of answers for that one step in
that right direction by Huawei was
outfitting the RGB with the biggest
sensor found in a typical smartphone
it's bigger than the iPhone tens and
even bigger than the samsung galaxy s
nines and there are a ton of options for
this number of lenses but usability is
taken into account using Huawei's AI
engine this time around compared to the
May 10 pro there are more scenes built
in and the auto camera is always looking
for what kind of scene you're shooting
so that it can change the settings
accordingly this is something we already
tested where we brought it up to
somebody's face it detected the face and
then turned on the portrait ok mode and
then when we moved it over to a plate of
food it changed the colors up turned off
the bouquet mode and we suddenly got the
food mode and then back and forth we
went it took about a second for it to
recognize it properly and pretty much
any other scene but once you get there
it is changing the settings on the fly
and effectively so if you're worried
about having so much power here that you
have to get all the settings just right
while always trying to make sure that
that guesswork is taken out of the
equation
coming back to low light quality the
lack of optical image stabilization was
a concern for us but while we had an
answer for that as well a I assisted
stabilization all of the devices you're
carrying this feature much like in the
night modes for other devices you have
to take a long exposure and you also
have to take a bunch of different photos
so that the camera software can piece it
all together to a good-looking final
product normally in those situations you
need a tripod to keep the phone steady
but this time the AI works to crop all
of the shots it takes as needed so that
shaky hands won't even mess it up in
even the darkest of situations there's
still a measure of color and dynamic
range which is really impressive and the
result is a camera package that can get
a photo that is effectively 51,000 iso
and all of this is on top of other
considerations while we made like
putting together all the different forms
of autofocus Laser phase detection depth
contrast into one system called 4d
predictive focus so that means that the
camera app is always trying to figure
out what focus to put onto the scene and
in that way it's also figuring out what
scene to apply for the best settings
honestly there's a lot to take in when
it comes to those cameras and we
wouldn't blame you for feeling a bit
overwhelmed but the takeaway here is
that Huawei is trying to take every
hardware piece they can possibly put
together into one great package and then
adding in its AI engine so that it can
make the photography experience as easy
and as high quality as possible and of
course we're gonna put the P 20 and P 20
Pro up against the likes of the samsung
galaxy s 9 and the s 9 plus and you can
see those comparisons here at Android
Authority once we get down to our review
process so if you guys are as excited as
we are about this phone whether it's
about the camera or the color of the
phone or even any of the features and
just the way it looks you can head into
the comments down below and let us know
what you think will be in the comments
section responding to what we can and
then some of the top comments might be
put into a piece of content later on so
keep it tuned to Andrew authority for
more about the p20 and the p20 pro while
ways the latest flagship that is a very
exciting prospect and you can also stay
tuned for all of the great coverage we
do here at andrew authority and over at
