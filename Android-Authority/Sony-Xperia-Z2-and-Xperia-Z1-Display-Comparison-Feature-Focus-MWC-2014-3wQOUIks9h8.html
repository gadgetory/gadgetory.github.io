by bitdefender mobile security hey Josh
McArthur manager I thought hey what's
going on everybody and we're taking a
look at the Sony Xperia z2 in comparison
to the z1 now in this future focus I
wanted to highlight the new screen that
is available on the z2 they've gone from
the TFT and made an IPS LCD display
right here that provides very great
colors high brightness and most of all
it has much better viewing angles one
thing that we did notice here on the
Xperia z1 and also in the Z before it is
the fact that when you look at the
viewing angles of it there's like a gray
hue that kind of just goes over
everything now we are dealing with the
Xperia you can see it pretty much right
there that this gray overtone just goes
over everything on the display and it
was a bit of a bummer it kind of shows
the kind of quality that the screen has
now we will say that if you look at it
straight on like you are right now it
looks absolutely wonderful but once you
go like this it really kind of loses its
fidelity it's something that everyone
usually notices when it comes to their
viewing angles on the Xperia Z you want
to end the Z before it now I may not be
as important to you but this is really
something that I wanted to show you now
looking at it straight on does anyone
looks really great and then if you look
at the Xperia z2 it also looks very
great straight on but when you move it
over it doesn't have that hue
yes you can't look at it quite as
clearly as before but that's not
necessarily because that gray he was
going over it you still see everything
very nicely there it just kind of loses
a little bit of its brightness because
obviously the brightness is shooting to
your face but when it's not sure into
your face it does look a little bit
darker but that gray hue is not going
over everything so nonetheless both of
these displays look really great
head-on and they really exude that sony
tv type of feel and they're just a joy
to you as when you're watching media and
movies but this was just a quick look at
the differences between the two I'm
gonna go ahead and just move these over
a little bit and you'll see that gray
hue on my right hand right here that
goes over it but when you come forward
it's very vibrance but in comparison the
z2 doesn't have that gray hue those
colors still come out very nicely and
nothing real
gets sort of faded yes the brightness is
not quite there but nonetheless when you
look at it straight on the brightness
comes back but that color fidelity is
still pretty much stays so that's a
night that's sort of the comparison here
of the screens here on these Xperia z1
and the z2
the other thing that you're going to
notice if I bring them together the
bezel has been shrunken down and that is
one of the best parts about the z2 in
terms of its screen and it's just
something that we really love bezels
really aren't quiet everyone's bag and
when the bezels are smaller allowing for
a much larger screen and overall a much
more attractive front because a lot of
it is the screen then you have a great
smartphone there and the c2 is
definitely in the running for that so
keep it tuned to Android authority for
all of the best coverage this is our
comparison of the z2 and the z1
particularly when it comes to their
screens and we do really like what we
see on the Xperia z2 especially
considering those viewing angles and the
fact that those bezels are a lot smaller
so keep it tuned for our MWC coverage
here in Barcelona Spain it is the last
day of the conference but we still have
a lot of footage coming for you and a
lot of coverage so make sure you stay
tuned for all of that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
