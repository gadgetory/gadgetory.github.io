here with some quick first impressions
of the Moto X the first thing I did when
I got back from the Moto X event in New
York City was open up the box and fire
up the phone I went through the setup
process and started playing around I'm
not going to go over the specs right now
because we've already mentioned them
plus we have a full review coming out
very soon so I'm just going to say what
we know already this phone is not a
beast spec-wise but this seems to be by
design Motorola's focus with the Moto X
is squarely on features and streamlining
how you interact with the phone to the
Moto X's credit it feels fast when
you're using it but gaming performance
and hardware intensive apps could suffer
we'll see I haven't been using it very
long but just being able to say okay
Google now and start using the phone
without the press of any button is very
handy so are the active display
notifications the size and shape of the
Moto X were discussed heavily at the
Moto X press event and with good reason
the more I use this phone the more I
appreciate how comfortable it is to hold
and use I've seen plenty of other phones
this size of course but that usually
comes at the cost of a much smaller
screen here that's obviously not the
case now for me around four and a half
inches is where the screen jumps from
okay to big enough for me to use
comfortably so the Moto X definitely
works in that case I've played around
with the clear pixel camera a little bit
the gesture to launch is pretty cool and
it definitely takes a decent photo but I
haven't done the in-depth testing
required to see if the RGB see sensor
here really makes a difference
if there's one thing I find really
surprising about the Moto X it's the
price everybody was expecting it to be
much cheaper and that is in the case if
it was priced similarly to the nexus 4
for example I think it would fly off the
shelves on launch day we at the current
price of 1 99 on contract I'm not so
sure we'll see what happens and my time
playing around with a moto x I actually
like it quite a bit but that's
subjective for an objective look at it
you'll have to check out our review
which is coming very soon I'm Chris look
for android authority and as always
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
