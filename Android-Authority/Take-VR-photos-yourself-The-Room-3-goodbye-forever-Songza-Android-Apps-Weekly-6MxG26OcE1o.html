Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 118 let's jump right
into those headlines Telltale Games is
chugging right along as they pick up yet
another IP to turn into one of their now
iconic episodic adventures this time
around they're making a batman game and
if their prior efforts are any
indication this game will likely be
really good and true to form on the
Batman story the game is expected to be
released in 2016 Google Play has
released their picks for the best apps
and games of 2015 it's a pretty standard
listing a lot of them may only be there
because of their popularity or their
close ties to Google in either case
there are no real bad eggs on this list
and we encourage you to check them out
the room 1 and 2 are among the best and
most interesting puzzle games ever to
land on Android as it turns out the
developers have been fervently working
on the room 3 and that should be out
Monday January 11 2016 needless to say
this app guy will be buying that one on
day one because it's probably going to
be awesome google has released a new
type of advertisement that allows people
to play test games in the advertisement
without actually downloading the game
the hope is that the player will enjoy
the experience and download the game
after trying it in the advertisement on
paper it seems really awesome but you
know how people are when it comes to ads
last up this week google has announced
advise of January they will have
completely absorbed Songza into google
play music as a result these songs the
service will be shutting down
permanently there is a silver lining as
Google will be helping songs a users
migrated over to google play music to
continue using those features for even
more Android apps and games headlines
updates and new releases don't forget to
check out this week's newsletter which
is linked in the video description below
there you'll find all the stuff we
didn't have the time or space for here
today if you're so inclined you can use
the form in the written companion which
is in the video description below and
sign up for the newsletter to get it
sent straight to your inbox every single
week okay folks it's time to take a look
at the apps and games that made a big
splash this week as usual if you want to
check any of these apps or games out you
can find those links in the video
description below lego ninjago shadow of
ronan is a new action adventure game
from the popular lego franchise that has
you playing as a group of ninjas who
have lost their memories your job is to
get those memories back and then defeat
the evil Ronin to save the day it's a
fun little game to play and as with most
Lego games
it's about as kid-friendly as this
subject matter can be it's also a pay
once game with no in-app purchases we
don't normally do app updates in this
section anymore but LinkedIn made such a
huge change to their application that
it's worth talking about especially when
the application was as bad as LinkedIn's
used to be the new design feature
sprinkles of material design and it also
appears to have taken some design cues
from Facebook the app centers around the
core functions of the service and it's
so much easier getting around than it
was before if you haven't checked out
LinkedIn in a while now's the time to do
so Raymond ventures is the latest
adventure platformer game out of the
once iconic Rain Man franchise this one
features a bit more exploring than prior
titles and the point will be to collect
all of the incredibles interestingly
Ubisoft is going with a freemium pricing
model which is in stark contrast to the
prior titles which were pay once games
that didn't have in app purchases it'll
be interesting to see how it turns out
but so far the user reactions have been
positive the storehouse is a unique
photo sharing application that creates a
kind of web page with up to 50 of your
photos for easy sharing the basic idea
as far as I can tell is that it lets you
create a collection of photos which it
then arranged is on a web page type of
layout you can then send that link to
your friends who can view them on their
mobile devices or on the computer if
they so choose it's fun to use and it's
totally free with no in-app purchases
last and certainly not least this week
is cardboard camera this application is
meant to be used in conjunction with
google cardboard and it helps you create
VR photographs in other words that lets
you take photos that are meant to be
viewed in complete VR the application
works surprisingly well and some of the
stuff you can create is really awesome
it's completely free to download and use
and it's now another great reason to
grab at least a google cardboard device
