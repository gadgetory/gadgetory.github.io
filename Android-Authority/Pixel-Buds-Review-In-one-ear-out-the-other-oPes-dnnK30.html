category has a quirky design good sound
and put some Google assistant flavor in
your ear it's Joshua Vergara what's
going on everybody and these are the
Google pixel buds let's start from the
beginning with the pixel buds still in
the case now the case itself already
screams Google from the get-go with a
design language that is reminiscent of
recent pixel devices there's a fabric
all around the clamshell case and it is
charged with USB C cables and then of
course there is the G logo in the middle
open it up and there are the pixel buds
themselves nestled inside of the little
crevices that are also magnetized and
the cord is wrapped around the edges now
wrapping the cable around the edges when
you're charging the earbuds takes a
little bit of getting used to but once
you get it down it's easy to do without
even thinking about it and as far as
charging these earbuds go the 120 milli
amp hour unit is charged by 650 million
powers inside of the case itself which
allows the earbuds to work for pretty
much the entire day a single button
above the right ear bud area shows you
what the charge level is of the case or
of the earbuds if they are inside of the
case but the initial setup does require
use of that button you do have to pair
the earphones to whatever phone you're
using that has Google assistant on it by
holding down on that button while the
buds are inside now one thing I do want
to mention real quick is that Google
does claim that the pixel buds work best
with the pixel 2 and while I did use it
with them and it was perfectly fine I
actually used them mostly with this 1 +
5 t I will admit that the pairing
process on the 1 + 5 t was not
completely seamless as it still prompted
me with a pairing request on the pixel -
this is not the case but once you have
the pixel buds paired to whatever
smartphone you're using they will always
connect to it the moment you take it out
of the case without any delays at all
Google's design language permeates
throughout the headphones themselves the
court is made of a fabric material as
well and it even extends past the ear
pieces themselves more on that in a
second
the problem I have with the cord is that
it's just not long enough more length on
it would allow the ear buds to just
securely hang around my neck but even
during the recording of this video I've
had to fix the cord so that it wasn't
always slacking more on one side and at
worse they would just fall off my neck
and that happens more times than I would
like I've heard a myriad of different
opinions on how comfortable the buds are
ranging from positive to downright upset
personally the buds fit just right in my
and the way that they make them fit is
actually kind of interesting that extra
bit of fabric cord that goes past the
ear buds can be pulled or slacked in
more in order for them to just sort of
nestled underneath a portion of the ear
that way they don't come out too easily
now if you look closely the ear pieces
do have an open construction and that
means they are different from plenty of
other earphones you might be used to
that have a piece of rubber or silicone
at the end that you would then insert
actually into your ear now this is a
little bit more like the Apple earpods
and it does change the sound profile
quite a bit but I'll get to that later
the left earbud is simply for sound as
the touch sensitive control is found on
the right ear bud
where you can tap hold or swipe for
various functions and to be honest the
gestures of the pixel buds are one of
the main highlights interactions come
incredibly naturally hit the right
earbud to play or pause or to respond to
a google assistant prompt hold it to
talk to assistant or swipe forward and
backward for volume control there's no
control for changing tracks but that
function is pretty easily replaced by
just asking Google assistant to do so
just hold on the right ear button and
then you can ask it and it doesn't right
away it literally happens that fast in
opting for a more open configuration the
pixel buds mainly lose an immersive
level of bass but there was a good
enough sound profile that I still
enjoyed listening to music and also they
get pretty loud so you are able to
immerse yourself in the music at least
to that level but it's the lack of a
seal that I think most people are going
to get a little bit upset at because
they're used to just blocking out the
noise of the outside world and while
that is a very valid concern I also
think that's kind of missing the point
as a new way of having Google assistant
on at all times it's a bit obvious that
Google kind of wants you to have at
least the right earbud in at all times
if possible it might not sound
particularly appealing but consider for
a moment that Google assistant on the
buds is actually the best iteration of
it outside of the smartphone itself
holding on the right earbud and asking
to speak a different language launches
the app on the phone and it begins
listening you will be able to hear
either the foreign language or your own
translated accordingly in your ear but
it will still be displayed on your
device in order for the other person to
read it and for you to read their
response now this is a great function to
have but it is only as good as Google
Translate itself if you've used it at
all in the past you would know that it
goes for the more informal phrases so if
you are traveling a lot with the pixel
buds and with Google Translate just know
that you might be talking more casually
to people than they would
used to currently the pixel blood
support a number of different languages
including Japanese French Spanish Korean
Vietnamese and Thai but on a personal
note Filipino is not supported so that
was a bit of a bummer and to be honest
if you have Google Translate installed
on your smartphone a lot of these
functions are still available to you so
the pixel buds provide more of a
convenience in terms of doing
translation rather than actually being
an essential part of the process but
it's when you get into a dialogue with
the pixel buds that it really finds its
aha moment here's an example I double
tap the right earbud to get Google
assistant to do its usual tasks first it
tells me the time and then it tells me
if I have any calendar events coming up
third it begins reading off my
notifications on my phone if it hasn't
already covered them this is a kind of
literal part of the experience the
notification that you would read on your
phone in the notification drop-down
becomes exactly what you hear verbatim
in a slightly robotic way if you don't
have anything playing already on the
pixel buds the notifications will be
read in real time which again is a
reason why the open construction turns
out to be useful if you happen to have
one of these in your ear at all times so
you don't miss notifications at least
you're not sealing off the world and you
have more awareness so that well you can
be safer and finally Google assistant
will sometimes hit a messenger
application read out the message and
give me time to respond five chimes or
seconds in which I can hold the right
earbud to voice dictate a response
Google assistant repeats my response
back to me and then I can tap the bud to
send it or hold it in order to record it
again I'm completely convinced that this
is the point of the pixel buds not only
has it been nice to have assistant
always available but interacting with it
through the earpiece has proved to be
more natural than the alternatives let's
face it talking to our wrists in order
to respond to messages was kind of cool
but ultimately not practical and
definitely not foolproof the pixel buds
simply do this a lot better now because
of this the audience that will enjoy the
pixel buds are ones that are going to
already use Google assistant on the
daily for everyone else these headphones
will simply fall short they're not the
best sounding they're not the best
designed and they are not the best
priced at 1:59 the question is whether
or not the smart functions are worth it
everyone else should still pay attention
though because these are a lot like the
original Google pixel assistant was a
new exciting yet cautious move forward
in Google's first in-house smartphone
but soon it found its way to pretty much
every
I wouldn't be surprised if this was the
same story with the butts in which the
great gesture controls the maturing
Google assistance and even more find
their way to more headphones wireless or
otherwise and it would only be a matter
of time before a headset arrives that is
the opposite of the butts instead of
great smart functions and decent sound
it would have incredible sound and it
would happen to be enjoyably smart and
now that would be music to our ears so
as always thank you very much for
watching and hope you enjoyed this
review of the Google pixel buds they are
an enjoyable sound experience but an
even more enjoyable Google assistant
experience and I think everyone should
be paying attention because this is the
way that headphones might mature and
become smarter over time and honestly
I'm really excited to see what comes
next I wanted to give a shout out to
some top comments on my last video which
was the 1 + 5 t review so let's give you
guys a shout outs and good job keeping
the conversation going you can do the
same in the comment section down below
