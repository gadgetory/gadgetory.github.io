authority and the new LG v10 has a
military rating of 810 G which makes it
extremely resilient to drops so we
decided to put that to the test to see
exactly how durable the LG v10 is so LG
basically challenged us to test the
durability of this device and what makes
the v10 810g transit drop compliant is
the build materials the frame is made of
sae grade 316l stainless steel and the
top bottom and back of the phone is
composed of dura skin which is not only
soft and grippy to the touch but it also
provides a lot of protection against
impact and is very resistant to Nicks
and scratches the whole idea behind many
of these drops was to mimic real-life
scenarios like the phone falling off of
a counter falling from pocket high or
out of your lap when you're getting out
of your car but we also wanted to push
the v10 to its limit so you're also
going to see a lot of unrealistic drops
here as well but let's go ahead and take
a look at all the drops of the v10 had
to endure and see exactly how well it
fare
so after about 10 to 15 drops some
realistic some not you can see that the
screen has shattered but this actually
did not happen until the final drop
where I tossed it vertically in the air
and let it hit the pavement which is
something no one would ever do to their
smartphones and this was simply just to
see how far the v10 could actually go
before finally breaking overall the v10
would stood the punishment surprisingly
well and up until the very final drop
the v10 just had a bunch of minor Nicks
and scrapes along the metal rails camera
ring and the dura skin body even though
the screen did break if this was any
other smartphone it probably would have
been a lot worse
as beat up as the v10 is at this point
it is still a fully functional phone and
both the main display and the secondary
screen still work perfectly fine all in
all I have to say that I'm very
impressed with how well it held up
through all that punishment even if it
technically isn't a ruggedized
smartphone so basically the main
takeaway here is as long as the phone is
being dropped under normal or realistic
circumstances it's going to be able to
take a licking and keep on ticking and
if your lifestyle requires that
durability the v10 is definitely worth
considering as always thank you guys so
