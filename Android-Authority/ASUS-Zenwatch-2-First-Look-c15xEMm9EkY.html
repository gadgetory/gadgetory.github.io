brings a somewhat different design a
smaller companion and still the same
type of functionality that made us like
this and watch from before this is
Joshua Vergara from Android authority
what's going on everybody and this is a
look at the Zen watch - the Zen watch -
is heading to a number of markets in
October and comes in two different
configurations a larger 49 millimeter
variant that's a little bit more akin to
the one that we had last year with a 1.6
inch display or a 45 millimeter variants
with a 1.4 5-inch display now the former
of these will cost you $190 roughly with
the smaller version set at 170 dollars
now everything underneath is still
pretty much the same as before bringing
the same type of performance you would
expect from Android wear which doesn't
require way too much with a Snapdragon
400 processor half a gig of ram 4
gigabytes of storage and water
resistance at ip67 certification
now these then watch - does boast over
two days of battery life especially when
considering the ambient operating mode
charging the Zen watch - will also
supposedly be easier than before thanks
to a magnetic connector that will
supposedly get the watch to 50% power in
just over 30 minutes now we can focus on
the design of the Zen watch - which
takes on a much different look
especially when you consider the smaller
device of the - that is more suited to
people with a smaller wrist or just
don't want really large faces on their
wrists when I notice the most about the
Zen watch - is the fact that it does
have a somewhat thicker body now this is
something that I wasn't exactly too
happy about personally because the sleek
body of these N watch 1 did contour to
the ridge of the wrist and now that's
something that I really thought made it
look really nice especially with the
strap that it had it was just as if the
Zen watch 1 was catered to really fit a
myriad of different wrist sizes now of
course as is the trend at Aoife this
year you have to create a smaller
version to accommodate the rest of the
people out there who may not want the
larger bodies on their wrists and that's
perfectly fine but it just seems to me
that the girth has returned on this end
watch - one compared to the much sleeker
Zen watch
a myriad of different straps and
finishes are available in this one as
well as they are in the other
smartwatches here at Eva also including
gold colors black color silver colors
and leather straps metal straps with
deployment clasps or the kind of strap
that you were used to from the originals
and watch one for a little bit more spec
however the larger variant is going to
use 22 millimeter straps and it's pretty
easy to change the straps on there
through the lugs on the top and bottom
and the smaller version of the Zen watch
to will use 18 millimeter straps so the
Zen watch - certainly does bring a new
version with a smaller companion that
will be able to please even more people
out there who enjoyed how a soos took on
Android wear and speaking of which it
does come with a companion app that does
provide quite a bit of customization
including even a watch face creator in
which you can create a watch face that
will then cater to your particular
likings and the app itself will allow
you to have a Seuss's apps on top of
Android wear some of which were
available in this demo but primarily I
was happy to see that fitness tracking
is given a little bit more of a focus in
these applications we see on the Zen
watch - not that these features are
really all that new from the previous
Zen watch or even any other Android wear
devices but then again what you might be
paying for here is luxury available at a
very affordable price and that's what we
did truly love about the original Zen
watch and hope to see more of in the
second iteration keep you tuned to Andra
thority for even more including all of
the different smartwatches because we
are your source for all things Eva</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
