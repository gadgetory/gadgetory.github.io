the understanding of the human body has
increased we now know the need for
proper diet and regular exercise using
technology can help you stay organized
motivated and educated while you're in
the gym my name is Kevin the tech ninja
and this is how I Android at the gym the
first thing in any endeavor you try to
tackle is being organized when working
out it's important to be consistent in
the amount of times you work out but
also to mix up the workouts while you're
there the first thing I do is use the
application gym rat to make a routine
gym rat is a four-and-a-half star
application from the Play Store it has
built-in routines and show you how to do
different exercises per body part it
also tracks your fitness gains and also
has bodymetrix but if that's not your
thing you can also use Google Drive
spreadsheets to track your routine it's
a bit cumbersome to use in the gym but I
did it for a few months before
installing gym rat once the work out as
planned I go into my google now and I
say okay google remind me when i get to
life time to buy some protein so I grab
a bar from the store or eat one that I
packed here is what I bring with me to
the gym gloves monster isport victory
earbuds and the raft power portable
lipstick charger alright let's talk
about these earbuds for a moment these
are the best workout earbuds for me for
a number of reasons reason number one
they have a clip that connects to your
ear this keeps them in place so when I'm
running playing basketball or doing
anything inverted they do not pop out
reason number two the cord on the
headphones are flat so that means it
takes up less space and also doesn't rub
against me when I feed it under my shirt
and lastly it has a decent kick for bass
not the best sounding headphones but
when working out I listen to high tempo
music and having deep bass really helps
me kick it up a notch I keep the raft
power portable charger with me just in
case my batteries on the verge of dying
it's actually small enough so I can keep
the phone and the charger both in my
pocket if need be I can just keep it
plugged in for 20 to 25 minutes and I
get about a twenty percent
in battery life which is enough to get
me through the workout sometimes as I'm
working out i'm using gym rat or google
drive to track my workout and activity
other people will purchase things like
fitbit's the galaxy band or even the
jawbone up whatever works for you is
just fine and for strength training
keeping up with what you pick up and put
down that's how you get them gains i
have a google play all access
subscription and i use a workout
playlist it mostly consists of high
tempo music I mark the playlist for
offline access so all those songs in my
playlists are automatically with me in
the gym we are subscribed to a playlist
you market for offline access then
automatically it downloads new tracks as
they are added so I consistently have
new music being added to my workouts
lastly I go into my calendar on my phone
or my computer and I input what I worked
out and what body part of worked out on
so I actually have a running log on my
calendar of what I went to the gym this
part is not needed but it's a great way
to track your dedication if you're not
getting the results you're looking for
look at your calendar and I'll tell you
everything you need to know and this is
how I Android at the gym alright guys
