authority now Lenovo have an interesting
and diverse mobile strategy the company
sells phones under its own Lenovo name
it also sells phones under its motorola
brand because it bought Motorola from
Google and now it's also invested in
another company called Zack now Zack
have just released their first phone the
z1 or the z1 and they're not ashamed or
even shy at all about the Lenovo
investment because on the box it says
Lenovo Zuk z1 or z2 unn anyway I've got
the phone here today and we're going to
take a look at it so if you're ready
let's go so let's start with the design
if you look at this phone there's
certainly one thing that comes to mind
one phone that comes to mind when I
think look at it and that is the galaxy
s3 here you have the white exterior you
have a button at the bottom and on the
back there is this all plastic back
cover with the camera in the middle now
Zack have done one thing at least to
differentiate this phone from pass
phones or even from generic white
plastic Chinese OEM smartphones and that
is that it has a metal frame and the
Zack have got a long way to explain that
it's made with a cnc process it's made
from aviation aluminum and so on and so
on so it does raise the design of this
phone a little bit but if it was of that
middle brass band this really would look
like a generic white Chinese OEM phone
but thankfully there is the metal band
and so that makes things just a little
bit better now moving round the phone
you'll see the volume rocker on the
right-hand side along with the power
button on the left hand side there is
the SIM tray up at the top you'll find
the headphone 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack and on the bottom there is the
microphone hole there is the speaker
grille and there is the USB type-c port
which is used for charging and for data
transfer now moving on to the display
what you'll find here at the front of
this phone is a 5.5 inch full HD display
with a 401 pixel density it has a
brightness of 415 it's at
peak brightness and luck say it has a
contrast ratio of 1500 to 1
generally the display is of a good
quality it reads well indoors and
outdoors and also because it is an IPS
panel the viewing angles are great Zack
have also built in some extra features
to try and make the most of this display
for example there's a feature called
live display now because the phone knows
your time zone it knows what time the
Sun rises and what time to sunset it
knows when it's day times it knows when
it's nighttime and what the software
does if you activate this feature is it
changes the color warmth in the daytime
uses 6500k
a much cooler set of colors and then
during the night time it switches to
4500 K a much set of warmer colors so
that's an interesting feature they put
into this phone to try to make the most
of the display one final thing to
mention about the screen is there is a
small black border that runs around the
edge of the display where the active pix
will stop and the display material
continues until the basal now some
people find these little black borders
around these phones quite distracting
personally it doesn't bother me but if
you don't like that then the zaccharas 8
1 is not a phone for you now let's talk
a bit about performance inside this
phone you'll find a Snapdragon Qualcomm
Snapdragon 801 and that's the
interesting choice by Zack because
really that could be considered to be
yesterday's technology is a 32-bit
processor it's a quad core processor and
of course it was the processor that we
found in many many flagship phones
however today people are maybe more
interested in 64-bit processors quad
core and octa-core big dot little and so
forth maybe this was a wise decision by
Zuck because I'm sure the 801 processor
is probably a bit cheaper now because
coal come have moved on to their next
generation and I've even started talking
about the next generation of processor
after that that means they could
probably get the 801 for a relatively
good price and actually a 32-bit
quad-core Snapdragon 801 is going to
outperform a low-end 64-bit processor
like this Snapdragon 410 for example so
actually I would rather have an 801 in a
phone like this rather than a Snapdragon
410 because going to bring better
performance even though it is
a 32-bit processor talking on
performances phone worked absolutely
flawlessly
there was no lags there was no stutter
there was no delays everything is smooth
the 801 is still an excellent processor
it still got a very good GPU in it and
the UI responded all the time I was able
to play games on it without any problems
asphalt 8 and Riptide and other 3d games
and 2d games without any problems
whatsoever now in terms of actual
benchmarks this phone scored forty four
thousand nine hundred and six on and - -
and managed a fifty two point eight
frames per second on Epic Citadel in
high quality mode and it was actually
even faster in high performance mode so
overall performance of this phone is
more than acceptable in fact it's only
really just one step or two step below
what a flagship phone would be able to
produce today so let's move on to the
hardware what we find in this phone will
have already mentioned it's got the
quad-core Snapdragon 801 that's backed
up by three gigabytes of RAM it also
comes with 64 gigabytes of internal
storage now 64 gigabytes of Entomology
is the only option available for this
phone there's no 16 gigabytes there's no
32 gigabytes it's 64 gigabytes and
actually that's a really good choice by
Zuck and also it's a good choice because
they haven't included an SD card now
that means that of course if you had 32
or maybe even 16 the use of an SD card
would maybe be quite important but at 64
gigabyte that's probably not so bad so
good choice there by Zack now with a
full HD display with an 801 processor
he's going to need a good battery and
this phone packs an excellent backer
it's got a four thousand one hundred
million power battery 4000 hundred
million power battery and I've really
tested this and it is an excellent
battery now I did all of my testing that
was always the testing for this for this
video that was GPS testing stalling out
performance testing game testing
everything I needed to do I just charged
this phone once and over a period of 40
hours I managed to get six hours of
on-screen time and 35% of the battery
life still remained six hours of
on-screen time over a 40 hour pay that's
two nights
for forty hour period and 35% of the
battery life is to remain this is an
excellent battery in this phone
well done result for putting such a good
battery in this device
another important thing inside of this
phone is the fingerprint reader the
fingerprint reader is here inside of the
home button now it's an excellent
fingerprint reader it is quick it's
reliable in fact I don't think I've had
any miss read of my fingerprint in the
whole time that I've been using it and
it works in a very similar fashion to
say the galaxy s6 all the note 5 you
have to place your finger on the button
for it to be read if you want to wake
and unlock the device you eyes I have to
wake it using the power button and then
place your finger on the home button or
you can actually press the home button
keep your finger on the fingerprint
reader and about a second the phone will
wake and unlock all in one go
unfortunately the speaker on the z1 is
average at best it isn't that bad
however it lacks any kind of depth and
the sound can be quite tinny here's an
example so you can see what I mean
the situation is partially alleviated by
the inclusion of the Audio FX app which
adds an equaliser with various settings
like rock folk classic normal and so on
so here's another sample with the
equaliser switched on
like many of the next generation of
smartphones Zack has opted to include a
USB type-c port on the z1 I think this
is a good move particularly in terms of
marketing and future proofing
however Zack have also been quite
pragmatic in its choice of USB cable it
doesn't supply a double-ended USB cable
but rather a cable with a USB type-c
connector at one end which plugs into
the phone and a normal standard a plug
at the other end which can connect to
your in quotes normal USB port on your
computer or any other charger and while
we're talking about charges the supply
charger for the z1 is fairly standard at
five volts and two amps so let's talk a
bit about the camera inside the zuc one
you'll find a 13 megapixel Sony based
sensor that is behind a five element
lens and has an aperture of f-22 on the
front you'll find a more vanilla eight
megapixel camera for taking selfies now
I've been testing the camera for a
little while and outdoors the pictures
are really quite good when there's lots
of sunlight when there's even there's
good colors there's the really good
pictures are taken not low levels of
noise good level of exposure the colors
seem bright and vibrant but yes not
unrealistic now
the indoor colors are a bit different
the indoor pictures are a bit different
a little bit of noise starts to creep in
however if you've got natural light
coming in through a window or you've got
good indoor lighting the indoor pictures
are certainly above average the only
place where the camera starts to fall
down is when you're taking low low-light
pictures now to be honest the camera
does try its very best to make the scene
seen as bright as possible to seem as
luminous as possible however to do that
lots of noise is introduced into the
picture and I recommend you take a look
at the written companion to this a video
you'll find that on the Android or
thority website and there I've posted
quite a few pictures samples I've taken
with the camera particularly if you look
at some of those pictures you can see
the difference in the indoor and the
outdoor pictures the low noise pictures
and the more noisy pictures please go
and check that out you'll see the kind
of pictures of this can
I can take let us talk brief about the
camera app is actually the standard
cyanogen camera app that comes with all
santa gen firmwares it's the same ones
one you can download from the Google
Play Store it's a pretty good camera app
it allows you to do things like HDR and
panorama it can do video of course and
take stills there's some live filters
that can be applied that apply actually
directly onto the screen while you're
lining up your shot it's overall a
pretty good camera if you've used it on
other cyanogen firmwares then you know
exactly how it is let's talk about
software that come to the phone the
phone doesn't come with stock Android it
actually come to see anagen OS 12.1 12.1
is based on Android lollipop 5.1.1 but
it does bring some extra features to the
table and those extra features include a
theme store include extra improvements
in privacy
there's ability to add on-screen buttons
even though this device actually has
capacitive keys
there is some replacement some of the
default apps have been replaced for
example the email app and the Kanda app
have been replaced by apps from boxer
which you could also download from the
Google Play Store if you wanted them
just for your particular phone and of
course there are some other neat
features like there's one I really like
which is double tap to sleep now a lot
of phones got double tap to wake and in
fact this phone has a double tap to wake
but there's also a double tap to sleep
if you double tap on the status bar the
phone goes to sleep which is I think is
a great feature course anagen is
verified by Google which means that I've
been able to put all the googles apps
onto this phone including the Google
Play Store Google Hangouts YouTube and
all the other Google services and there
we have it the Zuk z1 or Z 1 depending
on what part of the world you're from at
the moment it's just gone on sale to the
international market you can get it from
eBay in Spain and eBay in France for a
special introductory price of 280 euros
there's going to be a fairly short sale
period for this some maybe just for a
week or two and after that the phone
will return to its normal RRP of 375
euros so if you fancy getting yourself a
Zac one now is the time
