looks a lot like the Samsung Galaxy Note
8 but that's because this year is all
about refinement aesthetically the
Galaxy Note 9 looks really similar to
the Galaxy Note 8 but if you look a
little bit closer you'll see a few
tweaks and changes to give it a whole
new feel the sides of the phone are a
little bit flatter than last year
because the Galaxy Note 8 took a lot of
design keys from the Galaxy S a which
has a much curvier body the camera visor
is also a little bit more scrunched and
smaller this year and they've actually
moved the fingerprint reader to right
below that camera visor so you're not
gonna put your finger directly on top of
the camera lens the screen is also
slightly larger this year at 6.4 inches
mostly due to a slightly smaller bezel
on the bottom of the device the screen
is a big brightly beautiful 1440p just
like last year and it'll probably look
just as good as the Galaxy Note 8 the
only other major aesthetic change comes
with the s-pen for some reason Samsung
decided to make the blue variant of this
phone have a yellow s-pen and while I
don't really understand this move it
does look kind of cool and showcases
that you have a Galaxy Note 9 instead of
a Galaxy Note 8 that is fun can do all
those fancy software things that it can
do last year but they've actually added
bluetooth to the s-pen this year which
can be used as a remote camera shutter
you can also double tap the s-pen to
change the direction of the camera so
you can kind of decide whether you want
to take a landscape shot or more of a
selfie portrait most of the other major
changes this year are on the inside the
Galaxy Note 9 has been updated to
Qualcomm's latest snapdragon 845
processor you can actually get six to
eight gigabytes of RAM with 128 or 512
gigabytes of storage you can actually
upgrade this storage to a terabyte if
you use a 500 gigabyte microSD card but
we're not quite sure anyone would ever
need that much storage in their life
the camera is pretty much exactly the
same camera that was on the galaxy s 9
with a dual aperture mode to let in more
light and just take better photos
they've also added an AI scene
recognition mode like you might see in a
phone like Huawei or LG's recent g7 so
it'll help you take pictures of things
like food or landscapes and kind of just
tweak the color and exposure to suit
what you're taking a picture of probably
the biggest SPECT bump that Samsung is
trying to advertise this year though is
the four thousand milliamp hour battery
now this is a pretty big jump especially
since the Galaxy Note 8 had an even
smaller battery than the note 7 due to
that whole exploding battery thing we're
hoping that this can get you a couple
days of battery life like Samsung says
but we're definitely going to test this
in our full review coming later down the
line the Galaxy Note Neyman is running
Android 8.1 Oreo so it's not the brand
new Android Pi that just got launched a
couple of days ago but again that just
launched a couple of days ago so I
wouldn't necessarily expect them to be
quite up to date just yet also Fortnight
is actually exclusive to a number of
Samsung devices and the galaxy note 9 is
high up on that list this is probably
the most powerful Samsung device that
you'll be able to play fortnight on and
you'll be able to download it from the
Galaxy app store on your phone we're not
quite sure just how long this is going
to be exclusive to Samsung devices but
make sure you stay tuned to the website
because we will keep you up-to-date as
soon as it comes to other devices on the
market Samsung is only selling this
phone in two colors in the United States
this year which is ocean blue and
lavender purple you can get the 128
gigabytes of storage and 6 gigabytes of
RAM model for 999 dollars or you can
jump all the way up to the 512 gigabytes
of storage and eight gigabytes of RAM
model for one thousand two hundred and
forty nine dollars pre-orders of the
galaxy note 9 are starting on August
10th but I really want to know do you
guys think that this is a big enough
upgrade from the Galaxy Note 8 make sure
you leave your comments in the comment
section down below and I'll jump down
there and interact with you guys then
but until then stay tuned because of
course we're your source for all things
