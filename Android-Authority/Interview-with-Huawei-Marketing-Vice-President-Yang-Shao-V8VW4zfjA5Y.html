welcome to China and welcome to Folly
and we are the new player in the
smartphone area and I look at this
device I saw no Holly so I think we have
big way long way to go and I hope that
today if you want anything from us I try
my best to answer and also I want to
also learn from you that maybe you can
give us the suggestion how to move
forward in future thank you
I think a while why this is attractive
is not because this is a very very small
path it's because they can post be a pad
and a phone that's the real usage
most of people when they use is 70% of
them still use them as a phone not only
impact big wire that's why why we have
another 1p what the pan talk pan so this
is this is the most advantage of this
and at the and in West Europe the
consumers fear fear to use such big foam
is a little weird so that's why we
didn't learn to march in the in the West
Europe markets but it is there quite
worrying in China yeah and the feedback
is that some very young person very
likely to have this kind of if
especially they are the heavy Internet
user
yeah we have the NPS NPS figure for
every smartphone the net promoted skull
it means that people like it like it and
you like to recommendation to their
friend and this is this is the top three
smartphone we launched them last year
the top why does that matter and this is
a number three they find that the
e-commerce is very fast and e-commerce
needed speed and very flexibility the
the traditional channel can easily to
support like if you have something new
you don't need to buy so many channel so
many connection to the to the to the
consumer the your own e-commerce channel
and the third pod channel becomes can
you can do this so that's why we start
to have the owner Brad Forest that the
owner Brad is is mainly focused and very
how to say very interesting and and the
new product this product may be not easy
to accept by people in the first stage
like this one this one was used on the
brand in China it's starting quite well
because the traditional channel fear
they are not easy to accept this concept
is good or not but but unlike Anna no
this which picture they are flexible and
people can choice so that's why because
we have so many innovation and a new
idea about the product and we think the
owner Brandon Kara's to how to shorten
the distance with consumer directly
communicated directly it's there and
directly feedback so that's what we
position the owner Brad I think in the
in the Europe market maybe France is our
well first away on the brand market the
the France the traditional channel is is
either how to say is a very naughty day
to to practice role and and we tried
some ecommerce and e-commerce is really
work well so for the father West year of
the frenzy of the first priority for the
Arabic on the ground and another country
we wait can say it's at the US market US
market I didn't know a lot of us all
comes from us the the us previous we
meet a big problem is that we are we are
using the operator channel too much and
a follow-up air channel it need to Ted
use one year to make the test that make
the preparation and and go to the market
and our technology grow very fast if we
keep some smartphone last year to the
current market it's very hard to compete
so that this year we were more push on
the branding US market and make the
total market time in the workshop and
and more attractive pure Android phone
we have this we have this analyzer and
currently we fear that this is a this is
not a concept not our strategy the
strategies that we want to push our
emotion you are an emotional we want to
build the strong link between how we
underwater happier and in the taxi
that's that's not in current plan but I
mean lighter maybe maybe we were try
somewhere to use a pure I think for our
you know when we when we enter this
market currently we are the PDP company
and and a lot of our partner say you
need to enter the consumer power because
we need you and you have optic
opportunities so we move but when I move
we find that there are so many
barrier beyond ours the first barrier
they say how is no brand no
Graham and no brand the image so we try
and try and find that I would say this
is immaculate possible we tried to make
the innovation for you next I've seen
different for you
I mean passports in for you and the
second day that people say wow a the
lack of the design design being a so
you're falling the ugly from the survey
little a smartphone ugliest monster and
under then with our P series we change
the image that have people think how has
a good design and men's have also people
all very good design and then people say
how is a good night house full house a
the the the premium dreaded impossible
impossible far way we are peel the
premium phone and if people use Huawei
they were fear shy Shen
or something so and and we try the in
one by one phone and and they put more
and more effort to innovation people
know far away but the people not
familiar with power
so that means nothing
the we need to really touch with them in
every life case and and they really let
people know what's what's the the
innovation why we trying to bring to
them and I believe year by year we will
really be the very familiar and the
loved brand followed for each country
what's your budget
you are so less than Samsung that's easy
that's that can be an Istanbul but you
are much less than
HTC but less than LG how can you success
and and I think is the real answer is
that from the past to several years with
fear the world is is really changing the
word is really changed is that tempt the
the real image is not kind of by by the
money
it's really experienced by the person
and the person have so many channels it
can really really share their experience
if you make something normal
it's very hard for them to share if you
make something how they excellent they
were like to share if you make the true
difference they were lucky to share so
we need to make something healthy we say
make it possible when you to make
something looks impossible possible
maybe we are not doing there well now
but we need to do it later step by step
every product we need to if you remember
however say the S&amp;amp;P was limited
smartphone and ascent made to the
biggest smartphone and ascent the t1 the
most powerful smartphone and the ascend
mate is the best luxury smartphone some
stupid word we are using but it's really
we want people know this is different
we have a map about the strategy a
strategy one way to show the growth
ratio another way I need to show the
current size like the smartphone the
current size is a big but the growth we
are not being very very high and under
the verbal is like very small but the
growth in fact so far we I think why why
we need to amass more in the level is
because we currently we are doing this
this is something very very connected to
the to the person this is a mall maybe
this is the most used use the wearable
for people even this is not a war
somewhere
but at people calculator every time and
when we already done this we need to we
need to build the the the link with
Whistler wearable and make the make the
total experience even better so indeed
in the mobile Congress we were our start
our aware above lunch and and we will
show some interesting thinking of Hawaii
and I think in the in the coming years
will bring more and more mobile and make
it you know synergy system for people as
I mentioned when we started area we are
analyzing what are we starting we say
there are the hardware software under
protection first advantage is connection
we have the good understanding about
antenna communication so that's why we
sync the connection part we need to be
the best nobody can be better than our
it will others are better than power in
this part we have no any reason and can
be the best so that's why we derived in
the chipset and chipset a unity is also
very hard one but in the beginning time
there are a lot of complain about this
but I think last year is the training
year with high silicon 925 people change
their mind they fear that this is this
is really fast and really power
consumption is very good and and also
they can bring the best speed with the
Kecak because other spring has succeed
but like let her tears so this helps in
the in the first several years in either
house they destroy the brand but now
it's an absolute right yeah how am i
doing chip said I really think cocoa
means in the
either in a very high technology and the
background company but the the
comparative have some thing about wall
synergy because when we see battle to
the phone and we team up with the
chipset together I mean even in the
initial stage of the team can can
communicate to make it a perfectly match
to each other like a post hardware is
always the Petra's our Android because
apple can use the hardware the software
adapt much efficiently and and then and
that's why I become Canon they need to
lead you to negotiate with different
vendor at the end abuse goes away not
not very hard to be very close but
another thing that we steer using the
Wacom allowed if you look at forest
phone there are a lot of smart phone we
are using the cocoa the only thing that
if they think is someone we need to
bring the best connectivity to the world
and and the we were fine with high
circle it really someone can help us to
do this another thing you can see if you
before if accom launched some chipset in
the same time a lot of Bandar launched
this ship them so a lot of other is
similar they are launches but the
forestry is more more easier to choose a
time to love you
the smartphone market is a very very big
at a very hot
it looks like the the so many
opportunity can have in this market but
from our experience from our history we
find this is a very very dangerous
dangerous times big market it don't
means the Manning survival big market it
sometimes means a very small spiral many
years before while we when we moved from
2g to 3G even networks are so many
people is exciting for 3G is a big
market big market and everybody's
heavily invested and doing a lot of new
thing and and everyone the market really
consolidated would find a very few
people alive Nokia Siemens moved
together octet loose in the move
together Motorola and not had
disappeared so this is not means that
the big market that we can we can be
very nice of focus it still means that
we need to more and more focus much much
more focus that there any others so we
need to we need to steer heavily invest
in this market and I believe is the next
maybe two year you will see some branded
disappear and other and this brand
already have very long history in this
market but they were disappear because
the competition will be much much
harder than previous and and the for the
father for the new area I think we
should to try because we we are we are
working based on the innovation but it
can't be the way that we can we can less
focus on of the current smartphone area</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
