what's going on everybody and these are
reasons to buy or pass on the Moto X
phones under the five inch size are
becoming more underappreciated these
days 4.7 inches is the size of the
screen on the Moto X and while it does
provide 720p resolution it still makes
all media look really great but more
importantly it makes for a phone that's
very easy to use in one hand the Moto X
is probably one of the most accessible
phones out there underneath the surface
you get a mostly stock Android build
which is always great but even comes
with more features given Motorola
zextras that they've baked in and those
are the touchless control which is
Moto's way of making search even easier
with voice-activated commands that you
can use even when the phone is locked by
simply saying okay Google now after that
you do have the active display or the
active notifications and this is all
powered by a package that may not be the
fastest processing package available but
is still providing a very good reliable
and speedy experience and the battery
life is also very good on this phone and
can last about as long as you need it to
and all of this comes in a package that
is fully customizable
using the Moto maker you can create a
phone that is literally for you in
different colors and in the future
different material choices for a price
that is actually not too hard to fathom
$99 on two-year contracts make this a
pretty easy entry into the Android world
in the - category for the Moto X we
can't actually say that the size might
be a detractor for some because for
those of you who want a big phone and
everything that entails like a large
screen and much higher resolution in
that screen
well the Moto X is just going to feel
small to you and in terms of power the
Snapdragon s4 pearl the updated version
of it in here is far from the highest
performing package available today those
of you who are very spec hungry won't be
finding a Snapdragon 800 in here anytime
soon in software there is a pretty
decided lack of features now while the
two main editions moto put in are really
cool and pretty practical when you strip
them away you pretty much only have a
vanilla stock Android experience which
is not really for everybody
expandable storage is not possible
either as only 16 or 32 gigabytes are
available for you power users and with
the Moto maker while it might be a bit
of a game changer it
still lacks some of the features and
some of the choices that were previously
announced and are still yet to be
released
like for example where are my wooden
backs moto and the final reason to pass
on the Moto X is unfortunately that
camera which has been highly publicized
for just not being a very stellar
performer while an update to it much
like the Nexus 5 has come out it still
hasn't made the pictures look that much
better the pictures are still usable but
they're not going to impress anybody
anytime soon and so there you have it
for the reasons to buy or pass on the
Moto X again if you want to get more
information than just the Quickfire
reasons we've given you in this video
