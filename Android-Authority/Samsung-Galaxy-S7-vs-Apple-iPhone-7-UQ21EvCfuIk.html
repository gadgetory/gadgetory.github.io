different flavors or rather sizes and
the smaller of the two is going up
against the smaller of the galaxy
flagship line in charge of agar from
Android Authority what's going on
everybody and this is a comparison
between the iPhone 7 and the Samsung
Galaxy s7 if you want to see the larger
of these two devices go head-to-head we
did do a quick look of that over at Tab
x and a more comprehensive overview of
the two will be done here at Android
authorities sometime soon the story in
design is actually pretty simple if
you're familiar with the previous
editions of these phones you know
exactly what to expect this year the
galaxy s7 continues the dual glass and
metal frame design from the galaxy s6
with all of the different elements
exactly where you would expect them to
be there is now a curve on the back that
makes it more accessible and probably
want to be easier to use devices in the
Android camp and even though it uses
microUSB which dates it it still
provides fast charging and pretty much
everything you would need from a micro
USB powered phone on the other hand
lightning port is really all the rage on
the iPhone 7 because it's where a lot of
the magic will happen overall the design
is the same as before it looks exactly
like the iPhone 6s except its home
button is no longer a physical home
button it's now a capacitive home button
that provides vibration feedback when
you press hard enough it's not that bad
and even though it's a little bit weird
to get used to at first the main problem
that we have with it is that it's hard
to feel that vibration when the phone is
lying on a table but back to the
Lightning port this is where even the
audio is going to come because there's
no longer a headphone jack this will be
a controversial topic for many and we
already had to contend with it ourselves
during a phone call I wanted to use
headphones during it and I needed to
fiddle around and find my lightning
adapter just to use my headphones during
the voice call if you're not keeping
that thing connected to your main pair
of headphones all the time it's kind of
easy to lose that small piece of kit
there's so much more to consider when
choosing between these two phones but at
the very least if you used a previous
version of these phones you know exactly
what to expect this year a bigger
display in the galaxy s7 is not all that
it has over the display of the iPhone
now Android tends to trump Apple when it
comes to their display technologies and
right now you have a quad HD Super
AMOLED display on the Galaxy S
seven that is leaps and bounds over that
of the 1334 by 750 resolution IPS
display on the iPhone now the difference
in quality is actually not all that
different considering that the pixel
density gets better with the smaller 4.7
inch display of the iPhone now you're
going to get work and play done pretty
well on both of these but there are some
extra features underneath the surface
the slightly warmer Super AMOLED display
also takes advantage of that technology
by having an always-on display on the
other hand the iPhone has forced touch
essentially pressure sensitivity that
when pressed hard enough provides even
more shortcuts for applications or turns
on the live video from various photos in
gallery will give one more nod to the
iPhone for its ease of use mostly
because of its display size but the spec
hungry will definitely go for the galaxy
s7 because of its bigger and higher
resolution display now performance is
actually tough to gauge in a battle
between Android and iOS because they
require very different specifications
the Apple 810 with 2 gigabytes of RAM
goes up against the Snapdragon 820 and 4
gigabytes of RAM in the galaxy s7 now in
the galaxy s7 this is exactly what you
would want out of a flagship device and
it performs as such
very smooth interface is very easy to
use applications and high powered
applications like mobius final fantasy
work really well on there but it also
works really well on the iPhone where we
were able to play mobius final fantasy
for quite a while the ecosystems
themselves will dictate which one is
better for you but you can rest assured
that these are the flagship specs you
would want out of these 2 phones now
Hardware almost always favors the
Android camp simply because companies
like Samsung tend to over saturate the
feature sets but the iPhone has been
able to close the gap in recent
generations now when you're looking at
the iPhone force touch comes to mind and
we already mentioned that in the display
side of things but it actually gets a
bit of a leg up in audio now before you
even say anything we will mention that
the headphone jack is a big omission
that makes the iPhone go a couple of
steps forward and then a few steps back
but at least it has dual speakers one on
the bottom and one in the earpiece that
provide better overall sound when
compared to the Samsung bottom mounted
speaker that just doesn't do the same
job Apple even went for IP certification
for these phones and with the iPhone 7
and 7 plus we even had them go into
the ocean at one point and they still
worked after we brought it back out
battery life unsurprisingly is fairly
standard for both of these devices the
galaxy s7 being the smaller of the two
will have basically a day to a day and a
half in its battery life and we found
that to be the case even months later
however it does have wireless charging
built in and has fast charging in that
microUSB port so power is never really
that far off the same can some would be
said for the iPhone which doesn't
necessarily have fast charging but it's
smaller nineteen sixty milliamp hour
battery does charge up fairly quickly
John Velasco over at tab times mentioned
that the iPhone can get a full day's
worth of work and plate done with just a
little bit more after that which doesn't
surprise us and it also wouldn't
surprise us if any iPhone 7 users were
looking for chargers before bedtime
but speaking of where the iPhone has
been trying to close the gap cameras
come to mind the iPhone 7 now has a 12
megapixel camera as does the galaxy s7
both optically stabilized and have
similar apertures very low but the
galaxy s7 has the lower of the two out
of f1 point seven
the front facing cameras are actually
more different with the galaxy s7 having
only five megapixels compared to the
seven megapixel shooter of the iPhone 7
however the galaxy s7 does have 2k video
recording available on the front camera
so if you're a bit of a vlogger or you
want to take self videos then the galaxy
s7 might be a little bit better in that
regard but the differences are really
shown in controls the iPhone has always
been known for its ease of use and when
you open up the camera app it's what you
see is what you get you can swipe to the
different modes which includes slo-mo
panorama and time-lapse all of which are
available in the galaxy s7 s camera app
as well and then you just hit the
shutter button and you'll be able to go
on the galaxy s7 however you also have
pro mode now Android has been embracing
more granular controls and the pro mode
is a great example of that in our camera
comparison the main difference that you
see right off the bat is the wider focal
length of the galaxy s7 in both cameras
an abundant light we see how details and
really even the color is very similar
between these two with the galaxy s7
sometimes going for slightly warmer and
slightly over saturated colors to the
somewhat more accurate iPhone 7 it's
really in low-light that we found a real
difference as a galaxy s7 with its
dual-pixel focus pixels we're better at
capturing details and providing a little
bit more sharpness in its photo when
compared to the softer iPhone 7 taken
exactly as they are too with HDR off the
iPhone 7 is a little bit better at its
dynamic range however the galaxy s7 was
able to really compensate for that once
HDR was turned on and finally when it
comes to video stabilization oh is does
a pretty good job when recording at 4k
for both of these cameras obviously if
you have them down to 1080p resolution
the software stabilization kicks in
which could make a jello or warping
effect in the videos but at 4k they
still did a pretty good job it's kind of
tough to actually pick a camera between
these two because they are kind of the
best of their bunch but your allegiance
to iOS or Android will pretty much
dictate which phone you'll have in your
pocket so you can just rest assured that
no matter which one you end up picking
in this comparison the cameras are both
really good which leads us to the final
portion of this comparison iOS vs.
Android essentially it comes down to
which software you want to look at every
single day
iOS 10 has added a couple of extra
features including a new home screen
that is to the left of the main home
screens which don't have an app drawer
by the way that has widgets
notifications and news tickers for easy
access to information this can also be
accessed in the lock screen and also in
the notification shade iOS is owned
quick settings area is the control
center that is swiped up from the bottom
compared to the quick settings that are
available in the notification shade of
Android which brings us to Android which
on the other hand changes drastically
and depending on what company or phone
you're using but on TouchWiz there are a
lot of features on top of what Android
users are used to an app drawer a
potential second home screen to the left
in this case the briefing that's powered
by Flipboard and of course a number of
features that Samsung has made clear
will always be in their phones things
like multi window pop-up window and even
built in theming support meaning that
customization in Android is still front
and center as one of its main selling
points so of course it comes down to
personal preference if you want
customization to make Android look
exactly how you want it to then of
course Android is the one you'll pick
but the iPhone 7 and iOS have been one
of the easiest to use interfaces
throughout
the smartphone era and it continues with
iOS 10 it might look exactly the same as
before but for a lot of users that's a
comfort that is hard to pass up and so
there you have it a pretty in-depth look
at the differences between the smaller
smartphones in these two respective
flagship lines the iPhone 7 does take a
few steps forward while taking maybe one
or two steps back depending on where you
stand on the headphone jack situation
the galaxy s7 on the other hand is
definitely the phone that has a lot of
features to boast about and it also
feels very familiar to previous
iterations of the galaxy line consider
for a second that both phones have
similarly SPECT cameras and the same
water resistance and these phones become
closer and quality and capabilities so
that users can find a good experience
either way so whichever one you choose
will probably predicate on whether or
not you're an Android or iOS fan to
begin with but even if you are going to
make the switch from one to the other
you can find the experience to be
actually very high quality and exactly
what you would pay for in these higher
priced devices as it always comes down
to in these battles to each their own
