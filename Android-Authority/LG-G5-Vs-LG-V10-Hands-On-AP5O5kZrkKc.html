authority and we're taking a look at the
LG g5 versus the LG v10 these are two of
LG's most powerful smartphones so we
figured we'd take a quick comparison
between the two and see exactly how they
stack up the most obvious place to start
would be the design because this is
where you'll see a very huge difference
the g5 is rockin all aluminum metal
build with a modular design it's the
first all-metal phone that we've seen
from LG and the modular aspect of being
able to remove the bottom and swap on
other accessories makes it pretty unique
the v10 is made of some pretty high
quality materials as well you've got
stainless steel rails on the sides and a
body made of Duras skin order guard
material that makes the phone shock
resistant to drops what you won't get
with the all-metal g5 the v10 is also a
wider and taller phone so it isn't quite
as easy to use in one hand in comparison
to the smaller more compact g5 both of
these phones have removable batteries
with the g5 s being removable through
the modular cover while the v10 is the
more traditional method of taking the
back cover off and popping out the
battery with the modular design this
also makes the g5 one of LG's first
flagships to involve using a sim tool to
remove the SIM card you still have LG
signature power button on the back on
both which also doubles as a fingerprint
sensor but you'll notice that what the
g5 LG has chosen to move the volume keys
to the left side the cameras on these
two phones are actually quite similar as
well but there's also some key
differences they both have dual camera
setups with a wide angle and standard
angle lens but the v10 has its cameras
on the front whereas the g5 has them on
the rear you are dealing with 16
megapixel sensors on both but the v10
uses laser guided autofocus whereas with
the g5 LG made the switch to phase
detection autofocus and with the v10
you're getting manual controls for both
photos and video while the g5 only has
manual for photos as far as specs go
you've got a Snapdragon 808 four gigs of
ram and 32 gigs of internal storage and
a 3000 milliamp hour battery on the v10
while over on the g5 you're getting the
latest Snapdragon 820 from Qualcomm with
the same four gigs of
and 32 gigs of on-board storage the
battery is slightly smaller at 2,800
milliamp hours but you are getting a
much more powerful phone with a g5 and
you're also getting USB type-c whereas
the v10 is using a standard micro USB
port software wise the v10 has lollipop
with LG's heavier UI that has a lot more
features but it also has a lot more
bloat the UI on the g5 is relatively
bloatware free and LG has scaled back
the software quite a bit you'll notice
that they've dropped the app drawer
entirely and features like Q slide and q
memo have been removed in favor of a
more simple and cleaner experience but
that's pretty much going to do it for
this quick comparison of the LG g5
versus the LG v10 hopefully you guys
enjoyed it and stay tuned to android
