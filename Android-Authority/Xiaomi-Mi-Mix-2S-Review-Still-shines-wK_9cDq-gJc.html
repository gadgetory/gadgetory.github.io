everybody and we're taking a look at
this xiaomi me mix 2's now I've spent a
little bit of time with this phone
already it's been updated to final
software and xiaomi themselves are off
the heels of an IPO announcements
they're also going to be opening stores
out in europe so it's an exciting time
for them and their most unique
smartphone could be making it into more
hands a side-by-side comparison with the
original me mix to makes it pretty clear
what's been added a new telephoto lens
that add zoom capabilities but you still
get ceramic backings here which is
Xiaomi's forte and it still makes this
phone look awesome even if it is
ultimately familiar one thing we really
like however it's that included in the
box is this wonderful case it's a
plastic case that is very form-fitting
and when you have it on the phone you
still get very tactile feedback from the
buttons over on the side it's still the
volume rocker and the power button
nothing new there with the fingerprint
reader on the back the design is mostly
the same which means that on the bottom
you get a little bit more bezel
underneath the screen and yes the
front-facing camera is still in that
area underneath that you have a single
bottom mounted firing speaker and a USBC
port that requires an adapter if you
want a headphone jack this is designed
at johnny's best and it keeps this phone
which is very familiar still exciting
it's really hard not to like what
Johnny's done here 6 inch 18 by 9
display is still of a full HD plus
resolution which for the most part is ok
because me UI has been updated so that
it has a tighter use of space colors
from this panel do look a little bit
muted when you compare it to more
saturated displays out there but it
hardly took away from any of my
experiences I do wish that the display
got just a little bit brighter though
this is an IPS panel and when the Sun is
really bearing down on it and I go to
crank the brightness all the way to 100%
I felt like it could get a little bit
brighter and helped me out so that
things were more legible now the me UI
still crowdsources many of its features
from the forum community so one feature
that Apple introduced appears here in
its full screen gestures if you really
want to have the entire screen be
available for whatever you're doing you
can hide the soft key bar and just use
gestures by swiping up from the bottom
of the screen in order to go to home
holding from there to go to recent apps
or swiping from either side in order to
go
backwards in the interface now there are
some annoyances here for example when
you are in YouTube and you're watching
videos and landscape swiping from the
bottom to look at related videos could
trigger the home function oh and when
there's no home button on the bottom
that also kind of eliminates the easiest
way of activating Google assistant but
to their credit Xiaomi continues to buck
trends in this line by not going for a
notch
while a number of other phones are
putting the front-facing camera centered
at the top Xiaomi is still making their
compromise by putting it in the bottom
corner it's a compromise that proves to
be annoying on its own perhaps on the
same level as a notch so why don't we do
this let us know what you think in the
comments down below which of these types
of designs are better where Xiaomi
really gets things right is in the
performance package and of course there
are gonna be very high specifications in
these phones the snapdragon 845 provides
a ton of power but you have different
configurations between 6 and 8 gigabytes
of RAM and 64 128 and 256 gigabytes of
on-board storage available so all of the
specifications really mean a high
powered device I know it's the same as
before but I still want to mention this
little slit at the top which is zombies
way of bringing back a more proper phone
call experience in the original me mix
they put a bone conduction speaker in
there and this is just way better but in
terms of audio the loudspeaker at the
bottom of the phone just isn't all that
great it doesn't provide much body to
the sound and a lot of other flagships
are really pushing for a better speaker
experience I'm a fairly heavy user and I
pretty much have something running in
the background at all times here whether
it's YouTube or music or podcasts and
even with that I was able to get 5 hours
of screen on time with the 3,400
milliamp hour battery unit inside
what's great this time though is that
there's wireless charging so even with
that ceramic backing you can use
wireless charging so you can make sure
you're always topped up and the best
part is that that wireless charging mat
is really affordable as long as it's
available in more markets this thing
should sell like hotcakes because it is
$15 USD equivalent alright so let's talk
about the camera aside from adding in a
telephoto lens the me mix 2's also gets
a better sensor the main lens now has an
F 1.8 aperture with pixels at 1.4
microns
the zoom lens on the other hand gives
you 2 X optical zoom but the pixels are
one micron sized all right let's talk
about the front-facing camera the
placement still makes it a bit annoying
to use there are ways around it like
turning the phone around so that you are
able to get a more conventional selfie
and then you can import that into the
different applications we're turning the
phone over might mean some silly
interactions like Instagram or snapchat
it's still not in an ideal place to do
video calls or live streaming but then
again that's the compromise you have to
make for a full screen experience
pictures out of the front-facing camera
or 5 megapixels they are pretty decent
but not something to get too excited
about it also provides the ability to
add bouquet background effects much like
a portrait mode but then again there is
a real portrait mode now for the rear
shooters the frame will be a little bit
tighter and the software will be adding
bouquet background effects as long as it
gets the cutout right which it does
maybe 80% of the time it really kind of
depends on your subject but overall when
you get the good result then the picture
itself looks pretty great with great
detail and the background effect is
pretty nice the same can be said for
most photos coming out of this phone
actually detail is pretty good and
colors are not quite that saturated but
they're still pleasing to the eye and
the only thing lacking is in the dynamic
range it could be just a little bit
better video capture is actually pretty
detailed I was pretty happy with a lot
of the 4k video that I got out of this
device especially for that vlog and as
long as the exposure is dialed in
properly you'll get a good looking video
audio could be a lot better though as
plenty of the videos exhibited a lack of
audio clarity one final addition is the
AI engine denoted by a simple AI icon at
the top of the viewfinder you just click
that and it will try to figure out what
you're pointing the camera at once it
does that it will change the settings
accordingly the main gripe I have with
this is that it doesn't change straight
to the portrait mode if you're pointing
it at one person which I feel like
should be the default behavior however
if you're pointing it at let's say food
or some sort of plants or a flower or a
building so that it brings up those
particular modes it also seems like the
default behavior is to up the exposure
and then make the photos more saturated
it made me kind of feel like the AI
engine needs a little bit more work just
to make sure that it's doing more
in general thankfully pictures out of
the phone already look pretty good so
it's not like you have to have the AI
mode on all the time
I expect that the AI engine is going to
be enhanced in future generations and I
look forward to that
after all the software me UI is updated
all the time and because it is
crowd-sourced because of their robust
forum community then you get a ton of
new features all the time and in this
particular case with me UI 9.5 there are
a number of them added in we already
talked about the full screen gestures
but in the home screen so you now get a
guide it's a little bit like the oneplus
shelf where shortcuts can be added and
one widget gives quick access to a
note-taking area it's a simple but
welcome addition that shows that the Bui
is always evolving and thanks to the
input of its users it's very avid users
the me UI will provide even more on top
of the existing android 8.0 Oreo
experience and so there you have it the
me mix 2's jammies high-end phone that
is also their most unique one and it's
really a phone that just shows that
Jonny is not playing around not only do
they provide as much performance as
possible they're also trying to get the
camera rights granted they are a little
bit stifled because of the placement of
the front-facing camera but that is just
a motif that you're gonna have to expect
from this line and it's the way that
they are able to provide the full screen
experience that kind of pioneered the
trend it's an exciting time for Xiaomi
and this just might be the flagship
phone that they want to move them out of
the East and move more into the West and
luckily even if this is just an update
to a phone we already reviewed last year
the good thing is that the mimics 2 s
hasn't lost its luster
as always thank you guys very much for
watching and hope you enjoyed this
review of the Xiaomi me mix 2s now you

coverage of this phone including the
Shanghai vlog that I put out a little
