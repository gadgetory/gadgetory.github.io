front cameras along with manual video
controls well that's the LGV 20 in a
nutshell and we were fortunate enough to
have a unit on us while we were here in
berlin germany so we figured why not try
using it like a proper vlogging camera
it's Josh magar from Android 30 what's
going on everybody and this is vlogging
with a smartphone LGV 20 berlin edition
now you don't get the same manual
controls with a front-facing camera but
you are able to use the wide-angle
because it comes down to front camera
and the back camera so you have a little
bit of freedom to play around with the
lenses so you can do stuff like this
right
get a little bit more wide-angle put
more people in you know I was here did
you so this is actually a really good
example of using both wide-angle lenses
at the same time because we're using the
multi view in the auto mode but you
can't use a manual video bug and we
don't on the front-facing camera nice
and wide otherwise it would be like cut
to run here and the cameras actually
coming close to Chris so we have to use
the wide-angle lens to get him in the
frame no you got to move your head to
the fries or your hand as a show with
the frame yeah this is truly vlogging
I'm holding the same fried you can send
fries yeah everything's to do with the
wild
is what you said one of my favorite
things to do with the wide-angle camera
on the back is used it as the main
camera for blogs so instead of using a
selfie front face or whatnot just turn
this thing around super fun for years
this is what happens we're always
working we come over to the town sit on
the side and yeah we're here at the
historic Brandenburg Gate
so we wanted to get some coffee
Starbucks right
Starbucks it's under construction I
swear I've been to the Starbucks Oh
father no wait maybe they're
deconstructing oh they're moving into
putting a drive through it because those
exist in Germany or something weird
reason not Oh
setting up because we have even more
content to do with this phone so we have
come to this lovely Park which is in
front of the Bundestag another
historical landmark here you see that
dome out in the distance you can walk in
a circle through there but the line is
always so long because everybody gets
tickets for it the camera like this DSLR
is able to zoom so you have wide or
narrow shots no smartphone can do that
so I'm going to be 20 I think that's
already a huge gap so are the aspiring
vloggers that are out there I want to go
for the views money certainly one of the
most compelling options so far
