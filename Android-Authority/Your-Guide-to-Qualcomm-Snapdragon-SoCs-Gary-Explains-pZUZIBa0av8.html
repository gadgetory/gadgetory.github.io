Andrew authority now one of the
best-known mobile processor
manufacturers is Qualcomm and Qualcomm
of course make the Snapdragon range of
processors and you can find these
processes and everything from low end
phones mid-range phone flagship phones
tablets and even laptops now of course
all these mobile processors have
different numbers on them eight four
five and six three six and sometimes all
these numbers can be a bit confusing so
today I want to give you an overview of
Qualcomm
range of mobile processors so if you
want to find out more please let me
explain okay before we dive into the
details of the individual processes the
core core make let's have a quick look
at what is a mobile processor more
technically we should call it a system
on a chip because it's not just a CPU a
central processing unit and it's not
just a graphics processor or a GPU a
graphics processing unit it's actually
made of a whole bunch of different
components so you have a CPU multiple
calls you have a GPU you also probably
have an image processor for processing
those pictures from your cameras you
will also have a modem a 4G LTE modem of
some kind
then of course is a memory interface
that will go out to lpddr4 or maybe LP
ddr3 memory then of course you've got
wireless communications like bluetooth
and you've got things like Wi-Fi and
then of course on top of that you've got
other functionality like let's say quick
charge of Qualcomm have their quick
charge system and as well as all those
different components and designs the
actual physical chip can be manufactured
on different manufacturing processes
which we quote in nanometers it's
basically the measure of the gap between
the transistors and the smaller the gap
the more power-efficient the processor
is and the higher speeds can be achieved
so older chips might be on 28 nanometers
and then we kind of came down to 14
nanometers and 10 nanometers and the
bleeding-edge processes of today now at
the end of 2018 are kind of about seven
nanometers so looking at the CPU side
for a moment all of coal compromises
have multi-core
designs and those designs mainly come
from armed the company of course that is
responsible for the ARM architecture now
Qualcomm have a special license with arm
which is allows them to actually take
the design and tweak it slightly there
are some parameters that can be tweaked
it's not you can't do a redesign but
there are different things that can be
tweaked and they're allowed to market it
under their own brand which in
Qualcomm's case becomes the cryo so they
call them their cryo cpu calls and most
of Qualcomm process as I said our
multi-core normally they would be in an
optical setup there would be for high
performance calls and for low
performance calls however Qualcomm do
have some variations amongst that
including some that have two
high-performance cores and six power
efficiency cause I will code to look
into that when we look at the individual
processors in a moment
alpha graphics Qualcomm used their own
in-house Adreno designed GPU of each new
generation of proteases that come out
they are increasing the performance and
the power efficiency of those current
GPUs and so every year we're expecting a
performance increase and a power
efficiency increase and this is all
handled in-house by Qualcomm and they
don't sell that GPU to anybody else so
when you buy a Snapdragon processor or a
device with a Snapdragon processor you
know that the GPU in there comes from
Qualcomm itself and the other thing that
Qualcomm are do all in-house is their
modems that's the 4G LTE modems for
talking to your cellular network now
Qualcomm specialize in building modems
and gain for themselves that they put
inside of those SOC s kokum dual so
cells separate chips that actually other
manufacturers can use in the past Apple
have used their modems in some models of
their iPhones and the thing about 4G LTE
is all about the current standards and
whether you support the current fastest
speed so one of the differentiators that
we will see as we look across the range
of Qualcomm's processes is that the
flagship ones have the latest greatest
fastest 4G LTE modems and as you go down
the range they put in
and you know and less higher-performance
modems in the different processors okay
so that's a quick look at all the
different components and basically what
Qualcomm do is they choose which
particular CPU they want to pair with
which particular model of the GPU and
they look at which a kind of image
processor they want to put in there and
what memory they want to connect it to
and whether they support quick charge or
not then they wrap it all up and they
decide what process they want to use to
manufacture it and obviously the older
the process the cheaper the process is
going to be it is a bleeding-edge
process and that's going to be more
expensive and then once they decide all
those combinations they say this is
going to be a processor aimed at this
particular market and the way Coulomb
divided up their marketing is they have
the 800 series which is their flagship
devices they have the 600 series which
is their mid-range devices then they
have their 400 series which is their
low-end devices now there are some
changes here and there for example we're
going to see there's actually now a 700
series which fits between the 600 series
and the 800 series and we'll look at
that in a moment and they also have some
other devices for things like wearables
and so on but in general these are the
three categories for hundreds of the
low-end 600 for the mid-range and 800
for the high-end so this year's flagship
processor from Qualcomm is the
snapdragon 845 last year it was a
Snapdragon 835 and the year before that
it was the a Snapdragon 820 and 821
first have a look at these three
processes in a bit of detail so going
back to the Snapdragon 801 that actually
use for CPU cores that were designed
in-house by a Qualcomm itself and that
was coupled with the Adreno 530 GPU it
also had an X 12 LTE modem which allowed
a maximum download speed of 600 megabits
per second and 150 megabits per second
upload and it could support dual 13
megapixel cameras it has support for
quick charge 3 and bluetooth 4.1 and
this was produced on a 14 nanometer
process I just mentioned megabits per
second there if you ever get confused
about the difference in megabytes per
second and make a bit
the second I do have a video over on the
Gary explains channel which will tell
you all about the differences and I'll
link to that here in the description
below now the successor to the
Snapdragon 801 was the 8 Snapdragon 835
and now our core qualms went over to
using these arm processors using this
special license agreement they have
called built on cortex technology and in
fact it had four cortex a7 t3 calls and
four cortex a53 calls which were
marketed under the cryo 280 branding and
that was coupled together with the
Adreno 540 GPU now the Adreno 540 GPU as
far as I understand is really like the
530 however it's been shrunk down to the
10 nanometer process which of course the
whole processor was built and there are
some other internal tweaking but
basically it was still a fifth
generation Adreno and that some tweaks
are made at the 530 over to the 540 but
a big step here in the LTE modem now
with a thousand megabits per second
possible download speed still sticking
with a hundred and fifty megabits per
second upload speed and for the camera
now jaw 16 megapixel camera support
quick charge for and of course blue to
five and as I mentioned earlier all
built on the 10 nanometer process and
this year we saw the core Core 845 which
saw the move over from the court is a 73
to the court is a 75 from the court is a
53 to the court is a 55 and they were
coupled with the Adreno 630 was a new
generation of GPU and the ex 20 LTE
modem with even greater download speeds
quick charge for again blue 2 5 and 10
nanometer production process now if you
do wonder what a court it's a 73 is and
a court is a 75 and of course is a 55
and so on I have videos about all of
those different processes and designs
here on the Android authority Channel so
I'll also link to those in the
description below now below the flagship
scope on have a set of mid-range
processors which are called the 600
series and we'll also have a look at the
newly announced 700 series at the low
end of the 600 series we have the 6-3 to
which again is an octa-core
configuration using court it's a 73 with
cortex a53 and Adreno 506 so that means
it is the fifth generation but it's a
much lower version of the GPU it only
supports LP ddr3 memory and it has a
lower modem dx9 which has a download
speed of up to just 300 megabits a
second so different CPU different GPU
different modem different memory support
that's a whole different mix and that
means it's aimed at the low end of the
mid-range however at the top end of the
Snapdragon 600 see we've got the
Snapdragon 6 7 OH which has got two high
performance Cuates 8075 calls and that's
the same cause that you find in the
Snapdragon 845 and it's got six of the
cortex a fifty-five power efficiency
calls and again that's the same cause as
you find in the Snapdragon 845 we've
also now got the six generation GPUs the
Adreno six one five and then basically
the rest of the staff is very very
similar to the snapdragon 616 our course
we've moved over to ten nanometer so as
you can see at the low end of the
mid-range processors things are quite
different you've got a less performant
CPU you've got a slower GPU you've got
slower memory slower modem and as you go
up through the mid-range we're starting
to touch grab hold of the coattails of
the flagship devices now using the same
kind of CPU design the same GPU design
faster memory and better LTE modems now
this year Qualcomm announced the
Snapdragon 700 series and there's only
one processor in that series at the
moment and that's the Snapdragon seven
one zero 710 now let's have a look at it
and compare it to the snapdragon 616
same octa-core setup but with two high
performance calls and six energy
efficiency calls just like the
Snapdragon 600 it's got the Adreno six
one six GPU compared to the audrina six
one five GPU which means there are some
minor differences there
but probably is not much of a huge step
up there
however importantly it's now got the
x-15 LTE modem with faster download
times it also supports up to dual 20
megapixel cameras and again the same
quick charge for Bluetooth 5 and on the
10 nanometer process and then below the
mid-range we have these low-end range of
processors which are in the 400 series
which really are aimed at a budget and
price sensitive handsets all the
processes in the 400 series are based on
a 12 nanometer fabrication process so
it's a bit better than the 14 nanometer
not quite as good as the 10 millimeter
right there in the middle and they all
exclusively use an optical design just
using the cortex a53 processor no high
performance course here no cryo 385 no
cryo to 80s these are just cortex a53
calls and basically it's a combination
of the different GPU and the different
modem to give you that kind of different
price point so let's take a look at a
relative performance graph to show you
the differences across the whole range
so of course as you'd expect the
snapdragon 845 is the clear leader out
there with the best performance that
Qualcomm have to offer today and you can
see that actually it has a significant
performance increase over the Snapdragon
835 then below the 8:35 as you'd expect
is the 8 to 1 and then we have the
Snapdragon 710 as you can see the
Snapdragon 710 is very very close to
what the previous flagship device could
achieve and then below that you've got
the 670 which as I said very similar to
the 710 but clearly that difference in
GPU has made a slight difference there
in the overall performance and then as
we go down we can see the 6 6 over 6 3 6
and the 450 and clearly the 450 is much
much slower than the Snapdragon 845 so
the basic rule of thumb is this the
higher the number the better the
protesser so the 8 45 is better than the
8 3 5 anything in the 600 range is
better than in the 400 range
and so on and so forth now before we
close let's have a quick talk about the
future I'm recording this video in
October of 2018 if qualcomm will follow
their previous form they're going to be
announcing a new flagship processor in
december of 2018 and then into the early
part of 2019 february and march will
start to see phones being announced that
use this new flagship processor there is
some questions about the naming of this
processor will it be the eight five five
to follow-on from the eight three five
eight four or five now the eight five
five there are some other rumors that
Qualcomm either change their naming
completely and it might be the eighth
one five five we really will have to see
what Qualcomm announces at the end of
the year and it also both mentioned that
Qualcomm are very much invested in the
idea of Windows on arm laptops always
connected laptops so these are laptops
that run Windows but not on an AMD or on
an Intel processor but actually on a
Qualcomm processor and I have a video
over on the Gary explains channel
talking about the Snapdragon 1000 and
the potential for next year for a whole
new performance level when it comes to
these always connected PCs okay that's
about it my name's Gary Sims this is
Andrew authority and I really hope you
