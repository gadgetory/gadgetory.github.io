curved display but it also might be just
the largest one that you'll be putting
on your wrist so far hey it's Josh
regard from Android authority what's
going on everybody and this is your
first look at the Samsung gear s this
new SmartWatch by Samsung not only
sports a curved display and might be one
of the largest smartwatches that we've
seen to date it is also able to take a
nano-sim in the back which we'll touch
upon later but ultimately it allows the
gear s to be a standalone device without
needing to be tethered to a SmartWatch a
smartphone what you've seen here already
is the clasp system for the band that
takes a page out of the original gear
smartwatches but being able to change
the band's actually takes a page out of
the gear fits book and you're going to
see in a second here how I'm going to
change the band especially by taking the
unit out of the band completely like
right here and you can see that that's
much like the gear fit which then you'll
be able to put into other bands we saw
one that was slender and one that was a
lot wider to better contour to the kind
of size that this actual unit has from
there though you will see that there is
that one button on the bottom and from
there you'll be using swipes to go
throughout the Tizen operating system
which is on here size and of course has
been enhanced to bring you even more
information and take advantage of this
much larger screen that comes in at a
360 by 480 resolution and will be able
to show you a lot more information
because you'll be scrolling up and down
as you can see here I'm looking at the
notifications and I'm actually able to
reply to this message with a full
keyboard that shows up on the screen or
to use voice dictation if I so choose
that to be my method you will be able to
see when you swipe to the left of the
main screen all of the different
notifications with a summary page that's
right here and then the ones one by one
after that you're actually able to reply
or rather call back people reply to
missed calls using the fact that you
have the nano-sim in the back which will
allow you
3G connectivity and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
which are already standard inside of the
gear to begin with being able to do
voice calls and voice dictation is
obviously applicable to the microphone
that has been built into the gear s and
as you can see here I'm taking a look at
the different applications that are
available which do include the heart
rate monitor but I
you saw there was also a UV monitor as
well to make sure that you're not
getting too much bad sunlight out there
in the day diving a little bit deeper
into these settings you can see all of
the different widgets that you can put
onto the screen of the watch and this is
one of them right here you are only able
to have five at a time but you still are
able to get pretty much everything you
need especially with this summary page
which will allow you to open a bunch at
once so here's a look at the nano SIM
slot that is on the back now we're not
too sure what it's supposed to look like
especially in the American market if
you're going to be changing your SIM
from your smartphone to your watch but
we imagine that with American carriers
being the way that they are they're
going to have separate plans not only
for your smartphone but also for your
SmartWatch and I'll probably be treated
much like tablets are in various
carriers around the States at this
moment but we're going to get a big
better look at the gear s as time goes
on so stay tuned for all of that
coverage and for the rest of the
releases that Samsung has in store for
you here at Eva in Berlin we are your
source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
