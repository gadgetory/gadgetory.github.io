with its newer design but all of that
philosophy was also put into their
larger tablet note line it's Josh of a
gar from android authority what's going
on everybody and this is the samsung
galaxy note 10.1 2014 edition while
everyone is certainly very excited about
the galaxy note 3 let's not forget about
its bigger brother the note 10.1 it is
the biggest entry in the note family
that Dwarfs the note 3 and the note 8
what we're working with here is a great
10.1 inch screen capable of 2560 by 1600
resolution if you remember Samsung's own
next is offering the Nexus 10 it had a
screen capable of this as well and now
it's on the note it's a super LCD screen
that brings 299 pixels per inch the
design of the note 10 is quite literally
a much bigger undertaking of the same
philosophies put into the galaxy note 3
the glossy plastic material has finally
been done away with in this generation
of Samsung's products and now has been
replaced by a textured plastic that
gives you the impression of leather
especially considering the stitching
design on the sides under the hood we
have the Snapdragon 800 the quad core
2.3 gigahertz processor that is simply
incredibly powerful and that is backed
by the audrina 330 it sits squarely
among all of the top-tier devices out
now and the performance will help users
get the most out of the multitasking
abilities and the S Pen features the
operating system is pretty classic
TouchWiz with changes mainly dealing
with the S Pen here we look at the added
functionality to multi window however in
which you are actually able to have two
of the very same app open at once also
when you tap on the dot in the middle
line separating the two apps elements
from one can actually be dragged into
the other when it comes to the S Pen the
same additions that were put into the
galaxy note 3 become a part of this
tablet edition Air Command is a small
menu that helps you get the most out of
your S Pen easily and without too much
fuss included are the action memo which
can to contextually plug your info into
appropriate applications the scrapbooker
and even a pen window function which
adds to multitasking by putting a small
app overlay on top of your current
workspace and so there you have it I'll
first look at the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014
edition if you're a note fan the
additions to the note family
functionality will likely please you
very much and if you wanted a larger
slate to work on this 10 inch tablet
looks to be your perfect
onion for everyone else if you haven't
used the s-pen before you just might
love all that this little stylus can do
on such a large screen so for all the
best coverage keep it tuned to android
authority because we're your source for
all things android coming to you live
