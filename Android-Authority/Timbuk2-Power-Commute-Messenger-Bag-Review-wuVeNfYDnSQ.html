management authority what's going on
everybody
now today we're going to take a look at
something a little bit different now we
love our Android phones and tablets but
there are times when we have to travel
even if it's a small commute to work or
you're going to a place overseas and you
need to be able to store your devices in
a safe place
also when you're traveling or commuting
sometimes you run out of power well when
those situations arise Timbuktu has the
answer for both of those situations and
it's called the power commute bag now
what makes this bag special is that it
comes with a power brick called the Joey
T one included inside which allows you
to charge your devices on the go in a
very easy way we're going to take a look
at that and this is a bag that I brought
with me to CES and the entire Android
authority team that went to CES
absolutely fell in love with the bag so
what's a good way to review a bag that
has the word commute in its name
obviously we're going to commute so this
is the Tim book to power commute let's
go
nice give me some coffee
all right let's do this
all right so as you saw in the video
earlier there's a little white cord
coming out from the bag going into what
was my Samsung Galaxy Nexus right here
and now that's one of the great features
about this bag is that there happens to
be a power brick installed at the other
end of this cord and I'll show you that
in a little bit but as you can see this
is a Timbuktu bag it's a messenger bag
and goes around your shoulder and what
happens is you're supposed to be able to
carry pretty much everything that you
need inside of this one bag and that is
illustrated by the fact that at the back
here there's a whole new compartment for
a bunch of different electronics in this
case I brought my Nexus 10 however one
of the other great thing about it is
since this flap comes out it is TSA
compliant meaning that when you have
your laptop in here which is supposed to
hold a 15-inch MacBook which means a lot
of 15-inch PCs won't be able to fit in
here but if you have a compatible laptop
it'll go through here and it becomes TSA
compliant meaning that when you go to
the airport you just take this flap you
bring it down and it'll go through the
scanners just fine you don't have to
take your bat your laptop rather out of
the bag and put it in its own tray so
that's a really great feature of this
otherwise you have room over here for a
couple other different devices like two
tablets which is what I usually use the
Nexus 10 is right here the Nexus 7 is
usually over here and then when you zip
it all up it's able to store those but
still have a lot of room on the inside
and that would be enough room for
various different inserts like for me
since I'm a videographer or photographer
and whatnot what I usually have inside
here is my camera insert
this camera insert is able to fit in
there and as you can see it has all of
my camera equipment inside so put that
aside over here otherwise as you can see
there are a lot of different pockets
inside if you have even this little flap
on the back which doubles as a laptop
insert when the one in the back just
doesn't seem to work I happen to use
this insert quite a lot with my laptop
because it's kind of a behemoth I've
even just 15 inches it's really thick
but still fits back here even with the
camera insert inside otherwise you have
a couple pockets over here one pouch in
the middle and on the front right here
you have two pockets for different cell
phones if you want to use that for that
or anything else another great thing is
there's this pocket on the side right
here that zips out and opens up one
great thing about that pocket is again
this is called the power commute it
helps you while you're on your commute
so you don't have to open up your bag to
reach certain things for example if I'm
holding it like a suitcase I'll be able
to go into the pocket right here zip it
down and I'll be able to reach in and
grab whatever I need the last thing
about this would be the power brake
that's inside
and that would be here at the right
pocket of the Timbuktu bag this is
called the Joey T one and the reason why
it's called the Joey is because it has a
very unique feature it doesn't come with
its own charger what you need to do is
here's the cord for charging whatever
device you connect it into however right
here there's another port that is the
microUSB port and that's used by any
charger that you have already available
for your phone see what the Joey does is
it piggy backs off of the charger that's
already included with your phone so it
charges using that but while you're
charging your power brick you should be
able to use the charging port already
there to also charge your phone at the
exact same time so that's the reason why
it's called the Joey and the Joey is
supposed to be able to do about two and
a half charges for a cell phone and
maybe about one two maybe three quarters
of a charge for it for a full sized
tablet so you kind of have to pick a
poison there however the Joey is a great
way to charge your devices on the go and
it's a great tool to have when you're on
those commutes you just happen to run
out of a little bit of that a little bit
of power this is just a quick overview
of the Tim book to power commute bag
and so there you have it another long
day at work and finally home sweet home
the Timbuktu power commute bag is
available at Timbuktu calm for the price
of one 9999 that might be a bit of a
hefty price for some people but trust me
if you felt like this is the bag for you
that price is more than worth it
Timbuktu has a lifetime warranty on all
of their products and for good reason
they're pretty confident that their
products will last a lifetime and in my
experience they've certainly lived up to
that expectation also any Android phone
phablet or tablet that you might
possibly have will feel at home inside
of here and the Joie t1 power brick one
sure that your device has never go
without power ever again
unfortunately however it does come in
just this color and while I like it some
people may not really enjoy the gunmetal
gray and green that this bag only comes
in I'm pretty sure though that Timbuktu
will come out with more colors in the
future however like I said Timbuktu calm
for the power commute bag I hope you
enjoyed this review and remember we
