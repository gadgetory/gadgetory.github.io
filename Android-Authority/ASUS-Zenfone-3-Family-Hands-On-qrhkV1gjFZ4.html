authority and i'm coming to you live
from Computex
2016 and we're taking a look at the
zenfone 3 lineup announced here by a
sous and there's three different devices
in this lineup so you have the regular
zenfone 3 the zenfone 3 deluxe and the
zenfone 3 ultra let's start off with the
regular zenfone 3 so design wise it's
made of a glass and metal construction
so you have glass on the front glass on
the rear and a metal frame that wraps
around the sides and it feels extremely
solid in the hand and it looks pretty
awesome too on the front of the phone it
has a 5.5 inch 1080p IPS LCD display
with a ppi of 401 and it's made of
Gorilla Glass 3 internally you're
looking at a snapdragon 625 adrenal 506
3 gigabytes of ram on the 32 gigabyte
version or 4 gigabytes of RAM on the 64
gigabyte version on the backside you
have a 16 megapixel Sony IMX 298 camera
with an aperture of f2 and it does have
laser and faith detection autofocus it
also has optical image stabilization and
a dual LED flash on the front there's an
8 megapixel camera and inside it also
has 24-bit audio and then along the
bottom of the phone you have your USB
type-c port your power button on the
right side 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
on the top and on the back side there's
also a fingerprint reader inside the
phone there's also a 3000 milliamp hour
battery and it comes in sapphire black
moon like white and shimmer gold as the
color options next up is the zenfone 3
deluxe and this one is the flagship out
of the bunch so it has an all-metal
design and the interesting thing about
the design of the zenfone 3 besides
being a metal unibody is that it doesn't
have any antenna lines running across
the backside it is the first all-metal
unibody phone that does not have antenna
lines running across the back like you
would find with other metal flagships on
the front of the phone is a 5.7 inch
1080p Super AMOLED display with a ppi of
386 and it's all protected in Gorilla
Glass 4 and so far it looks pretty good
it's very vibrant very punchy and has
really
viewing angles as well internally it's
packing a snapdragon 820 processor with
the adrenal 530 and comes in either 64
128 or 256 gigabytes of internal storage
and will either come with 4 gigabytes of
RAM or a whopping 6 gigabytes of RAM on
the back of the phone is a 23 megapixel
Sony IMX 318 camera with F 2.0 aperture
laser and phase detection autofocus and
it also comes with optical image
stabilization and dual LED flash there's
an 8 megapixel camera on the front it
also has 24-bit audio just like the
regular zenfone 3 there's USB type-c on
the bottom the power button is on the
side and the headphone jack is up top
and then along the front you have the
standard capacitive keys and just like
the regular zenfone 3 it also has a
fingerprint sensor on the backside below
the camera inside is also a 3000
milliamp hour battery which also
supports quick charge 3.0 and this one
comes in glacier silver titanium gray
shimmer gold and it will start at $4.99
for the 64 gigabyte model and lastly we
have the zenfone 3 ultra and this one is
the biggest one out of the bunch it
still has an all-metal build just like
the zenfone 3 deluxe but it has a huge
6.8 inch 1080p display on the front
which makes this a very big phone and
it's almost tablet territory but the
nice thing about the zenfone 3 ultra is
that it has TV grade dual speakers on
the bottom and DTS headphone 7.1
surround sound if you really want high
quality audio inside is a Snapdragon 650
2 processor the adrenal 510 and it comes
with 32 64 or 128 gigabytes of internal
storage and either 3 or 4 gigabytes of
RAM depending on the model on the back
it has the same 23 megapixel Sony sensor
as the zenfone 3 deluxe but instead of
having the fingerprint sensor on the
backside like the regular zenfone 3 and
the deluxe model you actually have the
volume rockers on the back and the
fingerprint sensor is actually on the
front embedded in the home button the
rest of the specs are pretty much
identical to the other two zenfone so
you have an 8 megapixel camera on the
front 24-bit audio support and USB
type-c on the bottom and inside is a
massive 4600 milliamp hour battery so
you should get pretty solid battery life
with
phone they're all running on Android 6.0
marshmallow with Zen UI 3.0 on top and
it's a pretty familiar experience to
previous design phone devices there are
a few new features like the Zen life
application which is basically a
newsreader
and it puts a floating bubble on your
home screen that you can move around in
place wherever you want pricing starts
at 249 for the regular zenfone 3 $4.99
for the zenfone 3 deluxe and 479 for the
zenfone 3 ultra so they're all very
affordable smartphones but for more
