that doesn't shy away from its roots and
thus does not shy away from its true
identity the result is a phone that
simply just gets dot it's Joshua Vergara
what's going on everybody and this is
the productivity focused keyboard toting
blackberry key you want like where he
returns to his roots with the design
that doesn't shy away from the signature
keyboard compared to the more recent
fully touchscreen detect devices and the
BlackBerry Prive which literally slid
over the keyboard to hide it the
keyboard is the key feature of the key
one many of the features of this new
BlackBerry four go subtlety instead
proudly showing its capabilities the
camera packages on the front and back
are quite large and this aluminum frame
proudly shows all of the different
buttons including the new convenience
key that accompanies the power button
and the volume rocker the backing is of
a rubberized plastic material already
putting this phone in a different
playing field than the glass toting
slippery phones that we have in the
flagship space and the result is a phone
that can fit under a couple of
particular descriptors industrial or
business oriented and when compared to
its totally touchscreen competitors we
found ourselves pretty enamored with the
look and feel of this brick like key one
now the rear material and the thicker
body actually make the handling pretty
easy it sits comfortably in the hand and
it's easy to grip with the only main
gripe we have with it being the
notification drop-down it's just kind of
hard to really reach it at the top a few
keyboard gestures allow for easier
one-handed usage for example swiping up
and down in order to look at pretty much
any application it's nice to have one's
finger out of the way so that I'm able
to really look at Instagram very easily
however a one-handed usage is not really
the focus of this phone as it has a
physical keyboard that pretty much
encourages the pinky balancing act now I
had a little bit of trouble figuring out
what my convenience key would be by
Jimmy westenberg who helps write the
full review at andrew authority comm did
the brilliant move of putting the Google
Voice Search as his convenience Keith
and since then I have done the same
and finally the fingerprint reader is
embedded in a place that makes an
incredible amount of sense for
blackberry the spacebar a couple of LEDs
even pulse to show when it can be used
and unlocking the devices as easy as
just resting
on there because pressing the spacebar
actually doesn't do anything when the
phone is in standby the key one is the
only device that looks and feels like it
does in the flagship space managing to
find the best middle ground for every
feature that is splayed across its body
we applaud blackberry for putting some
real thought into the key one without
going too far in certain aspects one of
those aspects is the display in order to
accommodate the keyboard and to take up
all of that space on the body the screen
has to become a 3 by 2 ratio at 1080p
resolution it's going to look very
different from the 18 by 9 like aspect
ratio screens of 2017 that said however
it's still a very functional screen and
it doesn't do any worse than any other
flagship device despite it not being
quad HD resolution the IPS display still
does a good job of showing off youtube
video sling TV in my case and even works
well when it comes to gaming however one
thing we notice about this display is
even at its lowest level the screen is
still a little bit too bright in dark
conditions and in broad daylight even
the highest setting kind of keeps it
from being fully visible you might end
up noticing in this review that there's
a bit of a trend with the key 1 while
the display and some other aspects of
the phone are not going to be really
above average or even on par with some
of the flagships that you're seeing in
2017 it still does just enough so that
you'll be able to enjoy the device and
get your stuff done and that trend will
continue in performance the spec sheet
makes this phone seem far from the
flagships that you might be comparing it
to the Snapdragon 625 the adrenal 506
and 3 gigabytes of RAM are all at least
one step back from basically any other
high profile phone it should come as no
surprise then that this phone is not
meant to be a end-all be-all powerhouse
and this is probably mostly due to the
three gigabytes of RAM it gets filled up
pretty easily and I found myself having
to do clear-all maintenance as I call it
basically going into the recent apps
screen and remembering to clear all of
the applications before I opened up
let's say a game or even use the phone
with Android auto which did hang a
little bit when the RAM was filled up so
hardcore gamers and avid media consumers
probably won't have the best time with
the BlackBerry key one however if you're
looking for productivity and for
businesslike tasks to be the main part
of the key one then the phone actually
moves swimmingly going into the hub and
looking at emails or just
sponding to messages and even swiping
over the productivity tab all provide an
experience that is seamless and
incredibly smooth and really just gets
the job done we had no issues with call
quality on the t-mobile network even
having a really good audio experience
because there's a noise cancelling
microphone on here and anybody that I
called said that I sounded clear and
very crisp four-and-a-half hours of
screen on time was pretty common when it
came to our usage with the q1 however on
some occasions I actually found myself
getting six hours of SOT now of course
there is a 1080p display on here and
it's a smaller screen compared to many
of its competitors however it's still
one of the better parts of this phone
and it's easy to top off the battery
because qc3 is available in the USB
type-c port down here even better
blackberry added in a boost mode plug in
the phone and some of the functions and
also processing power will be dialed
down allowing for the phone to find the
fastest possible charging time
blackberry Veterans of the bold or even
the classic will feel right at home here
but other users might need a little bit
of time to get past the learning curve
pressing down with force on tactile keys
takes a little bit of getting used to
especially for those that are used to
swiping on touchscreens or even touch
typing with keyboards like flexi if you
want a swipeable keyboard then you can
always put one on the screen but then
you're going to lose precious screen
real estate
indeed the workflow that Blackberry is
kind of touting here is typing on the
physical keyboard and then resorting to
voice if you need it even the currency
key that has a speaker icon on it has
basically just one function turning on
the loudspeaker during calls you can
imagine that if you're on a call and you
need to look something up you press that
button and then you're already on the
keyboard so you continue typing and
searching and finding the thing that you
need now a lot of BlackBerry users were
probably trying to figure out what
shortcuts they're going to put on their
keyboard 52 shortcuts - for every letter
on the QWERTY keyboard are available for
long presses or short presses there is
one caveat however you have to use the
BlackBerry launcher in order to take
advantage of this functionality the
reason is because the BlackBerry
launcher ways for the input and then
opens the corresponding app or shortcut
using a third-party launcher will open
up the device search which is an extra
step to the shortcut but as we'll
explain later the BlackBerry software is
actually really nice to use so it may
not be that
much of an issue if you feel the same
way with a little bit of imagination
there are many possibilities to the key
one keyboard me in particular I ended up
using the keyboard for mapping controls
for my favorite games in my favorite
emulators I was able to play the PSP
without a lot of the face buttons being
on the screen and they're now mapped to
the keyboard and out of the way
go deep into the keyboard settings and
you'll find the ability to change the
right shift key to a control key of
sorts allowing you to do control a
control C control V for copying and
pasting all over the place and you can
even use the physical keyboard swiping
along it in order to bring up and down
the exposure compensation in the camera
while using the spacebar as a shutter
button as I said there's a little bit of
a learning curve with this keyboard and
if you are one of those people that
really wants to type super fast on your
phone then it might take a little bit of
time to get used to however once you get
past that learning curve there's so much
fun to be had on this phone and you'll
be able to discover new things that you
can do with the phone in an easier way
because you have all of these inputs
here on the bottom of the phone
blackberry take steps from some
reputable smartphone cameras to make one
that is on par with typical needs while
it's not an amazing shooter it keeps
from being below average 12 megapixels
at 1.5 5 micron sizes and f/2 Plano
aperture the main issue that we have
with this camera is how it deals with
sharpness and detail everything seems a
little bit soft once you zoom into the
photo even if at first glance it's still
pretty good to use on social media where
we do enjoy the camera experiences and
self-portraits the front-facing camera
gets a nice bump up to 8 megapixels
which is actually more than many other
cameras out there that support 5
megapixels the results are slightly
sharper selfie photos which can be used
in pretty much any situation but
blackberry makes to the point that this
could be a great video conferencing
camera another main gripe that we have
is the lack of optical image
stabilization so in low-light even if it
is able to expose the photo properly it
might end up being a bit blurry because
without stabilization that slower
shutter speed could lead to more motion
blur we don't think that the camera is
terrible in any particular regard but
like the display and like performance
it just doesn't offer as much as pretty
much any other high-end device we've
seen in 2017 don't expect it to be above
and beyond
but you can still expect it to get the
job done
and finally the experience that ties all
of this together the software BlackBerry
has done a lot to add its own identity
to Android over the last couple of years
and it all begins with the launcher the
only place that it really clutters
things is in the app drawer where even
the shortcuts tab or the widget tab just
seems a big antiquated compared to
current nougat additions but one thing
we really do like about it is the
ability to have quick pop-up widgets by
swiping up on any of the different
applications that have widgets installed
you'll be able to have a small pop-up
version of it rather than needing to put
it on your home screen but really it's
just a gateway to all of the
productivity apps the BlackBerry hub
being the place where it all comes
together it's a catch-all for emails and
messages and it pulls from different
messaging apps even WeChat however when
it comes to these messaging apps for the
most part you're just looking at the
notifications selecting any of them will
just open the original app emails are a
better time on the hub where you get a
number of tools to be able to richly
format your responses or flag them for
later usage and of course if you swipe
down you'll be able to take a look at
your next upcoming calendar entries this
same functionality has been brought to a
Productivity tab which is a little bit
like the edge view X in the Samsung
Galaxy devices where you swipe from the
side and you'll get a quick glance at
your emails your context if you need to
call anybody upcoming calendar entries
and also an apparatus for the task
manager and in order to keep all this
secure blackberry have included DTEC
essentially a checklist showing you if
all of the different security options
have been turned on however there's also
a app and permissions area that will
allow you to see what permissions and
what things each application is actually
accessing and though there might be some
stumbling blocks and the overall
experience of the BlackBerry key one
what is great about this phone is that
it knows exactly what it sets out to do
and it actually does it very well while
it might not be the best phone for
literally everybody for those of you
that actually want to get your stuff
done well for $549 this might be the
phone that you've been waiting for and
if you've been looking for something
different well this is definitely a
phone you should be checking out there
are a lot of users out there that might
scoff at the BlackBerry key one or have
blackberry in general but those might be
the same users that ended up saying
recently that smartphones are starting
to get boring we have nothing but touch
screens now and everything is a black
slab
and while those are very valid arguments
you should also remember that BlackBerry
has decided to buck that trend this is a
phone that dares to be different and
even if it's not perfect it is still an
enjoyable device we don't recommend it
for literally everybody but if you've
been waiting for something different and
something that just simply gets done
well the blackberry q10 that you've been
waiting for and here we are in 2017 and
we can't wait to see what they bring
next as always thank you guys very much
for watching and I hope you enjoyed this
review of the BlackBerry key one if
you're a blackberry fan then this might
be the fun that you've been waiting for
but if you've also thought that
touchscreen phones have started to
become a little bit cookie cutter or
maybe morning then you've also been
waiting for a phone like this keep it
tuned to Android authority for even more
about this phone and even more across
the flagships that we have this year in
2017 we're only halfway through the year
so there's a lot to look forward to keep
it tuned to Android thority for that and
even more head on over to Android or
decom for all of the best written
