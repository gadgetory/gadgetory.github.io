Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly
let's jump right into some headlines
first up this week cyanogen has
announced that boxer will be their
default email application starting in a
few months boxer is a well-designed
email application with decent ratings so
we'll see how that turns out we already
knew that Sony planned on scaling back
some things and PlayStation mobile
appears to be the next target because it
is shutting down for good the company
hasn't told us why but we assume it's
due to lack of popularity amazon is
giving away a
twenty-five-thousand-dollar shopping
spree to a random Android user to help
promote the Amazon Appstore entering is
easy there's a survey to fill out and
then you just have to download an
application from the amazon appstore and
then you're entered to win a new
application out of google called
interactive events is apparently under
development a version leaked but it
doesn't really do anything yet and
there's even a notice asking people not
to talk about it oops in our last
headline this week the premier podcast
application pocket casts received a huge
material design update it looks better
than ever and there were some bug fixes
as well if you do pick it up don't
forget to check out the Friday debate
podcast which we set out every Friday if
you want to see more updates releases
and headlines don't forget to subscribe
to our newsletter I curate it myself
every week and it brings the latest news
and releases straight to your inbox
every Friday we'll have a link to that
in the video description below ok folks
let's take a look at the applications
that made a big splash this week as
usual if you want to check any of these
applications out you can find the links
in the video description below android
system webview is an application powered
by chrome that allows other applications
to display web content if you're running
lollipop this has already been installed
on your device but now it's officially
in the Play Store so it can be updated
there's really not much to do on your
part it's already there and now it's
also in the Play Store blood and glory
immortals is an action RPG out of glu
mobile where you play as one of three
heroes that take on the armies of Zeus
Hades and Ares it features decent
graphics plenty of gameplay a decent
single-player campaign and you can
create your own guilds it's free to play
so it costs nothing to check it out
corgi for feedly is a free lock screen
replacement application that brings you
stories from your feedly feed straight
to your lock screen it has a colorful
fun design and it works
really well it is a newer application
though which means it has newer
application problems but it is totally
free so it's worth a shot street art
watch faces a new android wear watch
face and it's the first one that's been
released by google it features some
colorful fun visuals along with an
analog minimal and digital option there
aren't a lot of other customization
features but it is a nice addition to a
watch face collection especially if you
like urban scenes with five nights at
Freddy's one and two were huge hits in
2014 and we imagine that the third
iteration will be a big hit in 2015 the
gameplay is a lot of the same kind of
stuff with some new gameplay elements
mixed in the graphics are pretty good
and there are even multiple endings that
you can try to go for it's two dollars
and ninety-nine cents with no in-app
purchases once again I'm Joe Hindy the
android authority app guy why you're
here why not subscribe to the android
authority youtube channel if you're
hanging out for a minute we have a
couple of awesome videos for you to
