Authority calm today I'll be showing off
some of the awesome and cool features to
the latest and hottest super phone the
Samsung Galaxy Note 2 GT and 7/100 do
you want to know why thousands of people
have gone crazy over this phone find out
by watching this video review let's see
what Samsung's newest phone has in store
for you first let's examine the phone's
physical features if you've used the
original Galaxy Note before you'll have
an easy time with a new Galaxy Note 2
the two are almost of the same size and
thickness the Galaxy Note 2 though is
slightly taller and slightly wider it's
actually a huge phone almost tablet like
that's why a new word has been coined
for it
phablet short for phone tablet Samson is
known for using hard and durable plastic
for most of its Android smartphones from
entry level up to the high-end ones like
the galaxy s3 the Gauss e note 2 is no
exception it's housing is predominantly
plastic we try to smash the phone in a
drop test but the note 2 survives with
only minor blacks and blues we have a
video of the drop test also here on
YouTube the ones that our test device
got from that awful day for the gravity
of the earth allowed us to see that the
edging or frame is still made of hard
plastic but coated with a thin layer of
some sort of metal the bag cover is also
plastic and is attachable the NFC
antenna is embedded in the back cover
nevertheless the handset is very light
and is easy to carry around
despite supporting a wider screen but
since it's a big phone and might bulge
out from your pocket you can buy the
Galaxy Note 2 in either white or grey
watch our other YouTube video comparing
the two colors as far as Hardware
buttons and ports are concerned little
has changed from the first galaxy note
the power button is still on the right
side volume rocker on the left charging
port and S Pen cradle at the bottom and
a headphone jack at the top moved
towards the left corner notice that the
our and volume rocker keys have been
moved down a little bit they are more
accessible to the fingers now what about
the display Samson added about a tenth
of an inch to the screens diagonal the
display on the note 2 is actually taller
than the first note this means more
viewing space for browsing games and
video playback the original node had a
16:10 aspect ratio with screen
dimensions of 800 by 1280 pixels for the
new node has a 16 to 9 aspect ratio at
720 by 1280 pixels the note 2 still uses
Samsung's much celebrated HD Super
AMOLED technology but using an RGB
matrix at this time instead of the
pentile matrix used in some of samsung's
previous HD smartphones the displays
very crisp very bright and very sharp
even in broad daylight the capacitive
touch screen accepts both as a pen and
finger and put it is very snappy and
smooth no lag when swiping between home
screens buttery zoomin and zoom-out
no jitter and animations and transitions
but gives a note to at superpowers the
phone's processing hardware packs a huge
super punch pod core Samsung Exynos 4412
ticking at 1.6 gigahertz 2 gigabytes of
RAM up to 64 gigabytes of internal
storage and high-capacity lithium-ion
battery for up to 16 hours talktime on
3g together with android 4.1.1 jelly
bean touch wiz and the phone's awesome
hardware you can expect your experience
of the phone similar to soft butter in
terms of physical built screen and
display and processing hardware the
Galaxy Note 2 appears to be durable and
very powerful the original Galaxy Note
certainly turned heads with a stylus
called the S Pen it is a centerpiece of
the Gauss keynote series including the
note 2 with the s-pen you can write and
draw on your Galaxy Note 2 and more
let's find out more about this pen
Samsung changed the looks of the s-pen
for the galaxy note 2 significantly
many of the changes make the new pen
more ergonomic can
prior to the previous s-pen the new one
is taller and thicker still roundish but
with a flat side for easier grasping
it's very light so it's easy to control
when you doodle on your note to the
triangular girth of the s-pen also makes
it easy to return the pan into its
holder the pan only goes one way into
its slot
unlike the cylindrical stem of the
previous s-pen which often cost us the
pence head to misalign with a notch so
you'd need to rotate the pen to lock it
in place the button on the s-pen is
still around samsung has made it a bit
more prominent and easier to find unlike
the previous S pen's button which
blended with a cylindrical stem notice
that the new S Pen has notches these
provide additional traction for grasping
and for easy clicking by the thumb or
index finger Samsung's latest software
for the Galaxy Note 2 brings a new
feature called air view which takes the
hovering pen icon several notches higher
let's see how this works for example
when viewing your media files in the
gallery you can preview an image or
video just by hovering the pen over a
thumbnail also the gallery shows your
photo albums on a column on the left so
that you won't need to tap the back
button to pick a new album to browse
well we're here in the gallery you might
also want to see that the new gallery
has acquired several visual improvements
while watching a video you can also use
air view to help you determine the place
that you want to skip ahead - like this
therapy also works for emails in the
default Mail app you can preview an
email message without opening the email
itself just hover the pen over the email
list like this the same feature works
for the s planner app - hover the S Pen
on an item on your calendar and you'll
see the event details in a tooltip
balloon air view even works with a
default browser hover the S Pen on the
browser's buttons and you can see
tooltip labels you can also scroll up or
down a webpage just hover the S Pen over
the edge of the screen
sometimes hyperlinks are tabs and a web
page will also be highlighted when you
hover the S Pen on it on the
multi-window menu you can view the
complete URL address of your tabs by
just hovering the S Pen on the URL at
the moment air view works only with
stock Samsung Apps mostly such as s
planner and the default email app you
won't be able to use air view just yet
using Gmail or YouTube so far I've shown
you what the S Pen can't do without
actually touching it on the screen let's
take a look at the wonderful things that
happen when you actually touch it on the
screen click hold and tap the screen to
grab a screenshot click hold and draw a
select region to copy the selected
portion to the clipboard and open it in
the image editor from there you can
share the image to your cloud accounts
or social networks the S pen's button
also has other functions besides of
taking screenshots and the S note app
for instance click the pen button to
activate the eraser tool the Galaxy Note
2 also automatically detects when the
pen is detached from its holder
if your phone is locked and you remove
the s-pen the screen unlocks and brings
up the S Pen page known as the page
buddy feature as you can see here it
contains shortcuts to the various S Pen
apps so the phone actually readies
itself for S Pen input at the moment you
remove the pen from its holder you can't
change the app shortcuts on the page
buddy screen but you can enable or
disable a certain page buddy also since
we're discussing this intelligent
detection mechanism I'll show you how
the phone also auto detects the
headphones when earphones are inserted
the page buddy for earphones will appear
on the home screen
here you can choose to launch the video
or music player the same thing happens
when you connect your phone to its dock
try pulling out the S Pen while in a
call the pop-up note appears so you can
quickly jot down notes while talking on
the phone it even appears even if your
screen is locked so no need to reach for
your pen and notepad another new S Pen
feature on the note 2 is quick command
this lets humanum eyes tapping and
navigation for common tasks such as
sending email hold down the S button and
flick upwards to open quick commands and
the quick commands app draw the @ symbol
write a contact name and it will let you
compose your email right away do a quick
internet search by drawing a question
mark followed by the search term jump to
a location on the map using the
exclamation mark use a hash or number
sign to call a number draw a tilde to
compose something or you can even add
your own quick commands with your
personalized set of symbols the S note
app is still around after all it is the
app that is most frequently used
together with the S Pen an S note you'll
find various Note templates that you can
use to create various kinds of notes and
memos it has more notebook covers if
you're into personalizing your notebooks
hold down on the notebook of your choice
and choose from 32 notebook covers
rename your notebooks either by typing
the name or by scribbling it with a s
pen when you have a lot of notebooks
make a folder for better organization
when you hover the tip of the S Pen over
the folder it'll give you a preview of
the notebooks inside the new page
flipping animation is a nice touch this
animated flipping will make owners of
the original galaxy note envious even
also record voice memos and attach
images and videos s note also lets you
record your progress in writing drawing
or making diagrams and flowcharts
hovering the S Pen over an open S note
and holding down on the button will give
you access to ideas sketch write down a
word and it'll give you a clipart for it
it's handy for when you're solidifying
your notes with images so far I've been
babbling about our favorite features on
the note 2 the S Pen and its apps what
else can the note 2 offer you a few more
goodies actually for one the camera is
really awesome there are also some new
software features baked into TouchWiz
for the note 2 so let's talk about the
camera this time the Galaxy Note 2 packs
an 8 megapixel camera and it has a few
tricks up its sleeve like the original
Galaxy Note the Galaxy Note 2 also has a
super fast camera zero should are lag
here guys let's check out burst mode and
see how fast this camera really is the
camera has a feature known as best photo
which is handy when you're picking the
best shot when trying to capture motion
you can use scene mode to adjust
lighting for certain conditions such as
sunset and dawn you can even apply
filter sort of facts to your photo right
on the viewfinder if you're short on
light turn on the cameras low-light shot
feature the picture quality is rather
good you turned off all the lights in
the room and dependent only on sunlight
coming in from the window Pikachu see
really stood out if you're fond of base
shots the camera feature called best
face can give you a hand this feature
lets the camera take several continuous
and successive shots of the face then
suggests the best face you can also
override the phone suggestion make your
photos more personal with a photo note
feature you can write at the back of
your photos it's just like the real
thing
right after you've snapped a photo you
can send it over to your friends via NFC
technology and sbeam all you need to do
is to touch your device against the back
of another NFC capable device then tap
your screen to send the file easy the
video camera also has an option for
slo-mo take a look at how we film
Pikachu in this fall and impact with the
floor
if you knew the burst of speed fast
motion speeds up the frames to capture
speed up action on the screen footage is
a bit grainy however for both of these
modes software wise the Galaxy Note 2 is
the first Android phone to come with
Android 4.1 jelly bean out of the box
Samsung's take on jelly bean includes
extra features such as home screen mode
cloud syncing and blocking mode home
screen mode lets you change your home
screen to easy mode which presents users
with larger widgets this one's great for
newbie users who are still getting used
to touchscreens
it also puts all your favorite apps on
your home screen or you can switch to
the usual Samsung home screen the cloud
app lets you create or add a Samsung
Account to sync your calendar contacts
Internet and s note notebooks you can
also set your Dropbox account for
syncing your content if you don't want
to be disturbed
turn on blocking mode this mutes all
notifications from your handset you can
also keep a whitelist of contacts that
you can allow to contact you
even if blocking mode is on we first saw
the smart stay feature on the galaxy s3
and now it's back on the Galaxy Note 2
smart stay is an eye detector at the
phone to text your eyes looking at the
screen the phone won't go to sleep this
is exceptionally convenient especially
when you're browsing or reading an
e-book we also got more smarts for the
smart rotation feature it analyzes the
position of your face and will adjust
the screen orientation accordingly if
you're not up to typing with your thumbs
you can pull out the S Pen and hand
write for messages the Galaxy Note 2 has
handwriting recognition software which
converts your handwriting to text it's
not flawless but it does read my awful
handwriting the Galaxy Note 2 screen is
wide and unless you have a super long
thump chances are you'll be using your
two opposable thumbs to type text the
Galaxy Note 2's one-handed operation
feature once you confess the keyboard
and move it to the side of the screen
closer to
them one-handed operation is also
available for the phone dialer
calculator and pad and unlock screen
Samsung has made the Galaxy Note 2 more
capable of multitasking for example when
you want to do other things while
keeping an eye on a video you can use
the pop-up play option this option lets
you view a video in a floating window
while you go about using your Galaxy
Note 2 browsing the internet or taking
down notes we first saw the ability to
multitask on the Galaxy Note 10.1 the
Galaxy Note 2 also allows you to use the
screens real estate through the multi
window feature you can display two apps
on your screen at the same time sort of
like split screen not all apps support
this feature though the Galaxy Note 2 is
a unique and powerful beast with more
features and functions then we can
exhaustively cover in this review
besides we don't want to take the fun
out of your own exploration of Samsung's
hottest phablet now do we if you love
the original Galaxy Note you'll
definitely want to get the galaxy note 2
smaller hands may find it rather large
but it's screen is great for gaming
reading and media consumption the S Pen
is a magical accessory to note-taking
and sketching become more fun on the
note 2 Samsung's new software features
as well as improvements the previous
ones on the original note does amazing
stuff and tandem with the phone
super-powerful hardware
despite some phone limitations and
imperfections we are in love with a
gaussian note 2 and we highly recommend
this to those who are on the verge of
buying their next android smartphone
