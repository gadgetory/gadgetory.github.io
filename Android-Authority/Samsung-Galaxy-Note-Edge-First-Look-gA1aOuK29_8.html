different from Samsung you pretty much
got it right here hey it's Josh of Garf
a mandroid authority and this is the
Samsung Galaxy Note edge now for all
intents and purposes the Note edge is
the Galaxy Note 4 inside and out it even
has its own s-pen as it does have the
note moniker and it has the same
processing package the same powerful
processing package underneath with the
high resolution screen but it is in that
side that you're going to see that well
since there's an edge on the right side
we have the button layout on the left
and also the power button is now up top
since you have to make room for that
curve on the side and the backing is
still of that faux leather that textured
plastic that gives it the real Note feel
that we've come to expect since the note
3 but obviously the change comes with
that curve on the side and it's
basically an area that you will be able
to perform a lot of different tasks as
you can see right here it is obviously a
place that I had some shortcuts on but
once you swipe from the very edge of the
screen or from the very edge of the
actual curve itself you'll be able to
slip through a number of different
panels that will give you some
information now we have seen quite a few
different ones already the main
application being the shortcut area
where you'll be able to launch different
applications easily and even have the
camera controls there when you have the
camera opened up but as you scroll
through all of the different panels
you'll see that you'll have a lot of
information available it's almost like a
ticker of sorts that will be there at
all times if you so choose for it to be
so so you can get the news while you're
watching a video on YouTube or you'll be
able to see your tweets and all of the
trending topics coming up on that little
panel using the Twitter panel there are
a lot of developers already hard at work
to create even more experiences with
that panel and we're sure that the list
will really expand through time and give
you even more functionality on this edge
and here's another function where you're
able to actually have the controls in
that little curve up there so that when
you have it available activated it won't
take up any of the real estate on the
screen allowing you to really take
advantage of the video itself and not
interrupt your viewing experience and
you can see here that the touch
sensitivity on there is still about what
you would expect and also there's this
functionality right here where you can
have a clock mode
a night mode in which you just rub the
curve while it is in standby and you'll
still be able to access all the
different panels in just that one little
area even when the entire rest of the
screen is off this is obviously
something that we would expect to see
people have on their nightstands make it
easy for you to have a little bit of a
clock using your phone and by using that
curve on the side you also have tools
underneath for various different
functions but ultimately it's a nice
little innovation on top of what is
already a very established note line and
is a different take on the kind of
information you can have when using now
a curved display which Samsung is a bit
of a pioneer on at this point we don't
know exactly what markets the note edge
will be going to but we've basically
been told that it's going to be like a
limited edition of the note 4 itself and
it does certainly feel like it as it has
the same type of build quality but this
time this curve really adds to the
experience even if it is pretty quirky
on its own so keep it tuned to Android
authority for further coverage of all of
Samsung's releases this year at Aoife
2014 because we are your source for all
things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
