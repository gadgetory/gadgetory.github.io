by doing what I've been saying they
should do for years make an Android
phone though its name might be a little
weird it is short for privacy and
perhaps appropriately privileged and
that's because this is a phone that
stands out in more ways than one but how
does it stack up in an already crowded
Android space it's time to find out
because it's Josh of agar from Android
authority what's going on everybody and
this is the BlackBerry priya blackberry
makes a splash or rather a slide right
into the Android space by bringing back
a feature that we haven't seen in a long
time a hardware keyboard but before we
get to that let's take a look at the
rest of the device which BlackBerry has
done a good job of making fit into the
general Android lexicon the large 5
point 4 inch screen has no capacitive
keys accompanying it but at the very
bottom portion of the phone that does
not slide there is a front facing
speaker we have the power Bunn on the
left side and then the volume rocker on
the right with a single button in the
middle in my testing this button doesn't
really do anything but open the
notification dialogue to switch modes
the back of the phone is of a soft
plastic weave that helps with the grip
so it definitely isn't going to slide
about in your hand up top is the camera
optic package that does stick out but
the ring around the glass is pretty
substantial
so let's finally slide that screen up it
slides up assuredly but it doesn't snap
with a snikt like other sliders you
might remember instead it smoothly moves
up and softly locks into place features
of the keyboard will be delved into in
the hardware and software section so
we'll focus on the feel of the keyboard
though it takes on the classic
blackberry construction and layout it
does ultimately feel a bit squishy and
that's because it takes a while to get
used to typing on a physical keyboard
again as the keys obviously require a
tiny but noticeable bit of force it's
probably a pretty safe bet to say that
your muscle memory needs to get
acclimated to the keyboard again and
when extended the already large phone
all-around is harder to maneuver when
the screen is farther away for even the
most experienced hand gymnasts to reach
the BlackBerry probe is a very executive
looking device and we love its look and
feel however because you do have that
slide up screen and that keyboard we're
not surprised to find that the period of
cuts a couple of corners for one thing
it's not necessarily required that
phones need to have metal in order to be
considered premium
but if metal is what you're looking
forward to in the Android space then
you're just not going to get it here
after that the backing despite having a
very good grip to it does seem to press
in a little bit seems just that tiny bit
flimsy when you put a little bit of
force on the lower half and also I did
find it a little bit weird that I got
into the habit of sliding up the screen
to wake the device even if I wasn't even
going to use the keyboard blackberry
despite not being part of the full
flagship game for a while has worked to
ensure that they include all the right
features in their first Android phone
and the display is a good example of
that not only doesn't come in the high
quad HD resolution but it leverages that
pixel density into a panel that is 5.4
inches large couple with that in AMOLED
construction and it's not hard to see
that Blackberry put some real thought
into here
the screen is plenty good with the right
color saturation for some good eye candy
especially considering all that the BBU
version of Android can do and text is
really sharp for a phone that especially
for the working types will be able to
show all of the web articles tasks and
calendar entries thrown at it not only
is it enjoyable to use it shows the
company is definitely trying here and
actually the same can be mostly said for
the processing package though not the
latest and greatest the Snapdragon 808
is more than enough for the BlackBerry
Prive the 808 is backed by the audrina
418 and three gigabytes of RAM all good
specs to have for a phone made for work
but we haven't had any problems with
just about anything on this device
though there are some stutters and bugs
that we run into and we felt that was
more the fault of BlackBerry's own
Android iteration game still go along
without much incidents as do media and
general web browsing most of the work
that the BlackBerry faithful will
probably do on here involve the built-in
hub and productivity tools all of which
proves snappy for simply getting things
done now when blackberry gets an even
better handle on their version of
Android we're sure that the performance
aspect will improve but currently the
proof is still more than able to get the
job done
which brings us to hardware which is a
laundry list of good choices made by
blackberry we start off with the front
facing speaker which is in and of itself
a great choice and provides decent sound
it skews toward the higher ends just a
bit and could use a little more volume
but it's still better than any
rear-mounted units above that phone
speaker are two trays for this phone sim
and microSD yes blackberries stuck to
having expandable storage to bolster the
32 already
Tim and for such a large phone a big
battery unit is ideal if not required
and a pretty substantial 34 10 milliamp
hour battery has been tucked into this
phone longevity has been a pretty
average affair unfortunately there's
likely quite a bit going on at all times
if you do leverage all of BlackBerry's
features and the hub so we aren't
particularly surprised a couple of my
colleagues here at Android Authority
actually have the privilege to battery
life and we found that the results were
really mixed nerve was able to get close
to five hours of screen on time but that
was actually quite rarely more often
than not he got around three hours for
normal usage lon on the other hand had
trouble actually getting that three hour
screen on time average and I found that
that was my case as well I'm somewhat in
the middle because on a heavier day I
got maybe two and a half hours maybe two
hours and 45 minutes and then on a
regular usage day that mostly involves
podcasts and music playing and a little
bit of GPS navigation at one point did I
get three and a half hours but it really
didn't happen all that much apparently
fast charging is built-in but you need
to have a compatible charging solution
in order to leverage it even to that end
the battery took a couple of hours to
fully charge up from zero and finally we
get to the biggest difference this phone
has had over the rest the physical
keyboard slide the screen up and the
keyboard lowers the on-screen one
freeing up all that space on the screen
and the keys take a look getting used to
as we mentioned before so your mileage
will vary when it comes to typing fast
in fact we found this out in an informal
typing test when I was on all about
Android earlier this week swiping tap
typing and the physical keyboard were
all put against each other and I just
barely missed the finals using the
BlackBerry Prive but my experience is
kind of specific I'm a very fast typer
on-screen keyboards like flexi and
actually the very good blackberry on
screen iteration but there are other
uses for the keyboard if typing occurs
pretty much anywhere else in the
interface either an automatic Google
search triggers or any short or long
presses can be used to trigger shortcuts
and the entire keyboard is outfitted
with touch and swipe sensitivity so that
tasks like scrolling a web page can be
done by lightly passing the finger over
the hardware keys so though typing speed
will probably be different for just
about everyone there are these extra
features that make the cube
useful despite all that we found
ourselves using the touchpad like a
scroll quite often as well as a few
shortcuts for easy access to particular
tasks the BlackBerry Prive looks to make
good moves in the camera department by
employing an 18 megapixel shooter with
optical image stabilization and optics
made by a reputable European company a
misstep in the camera department is
obvious right away though because the
front-facing shooter only packs 2
megapixels BlackBerry's camera
application is a big tell that they've
been out of the loop recently it's not
only rather rudimentary in its design
but it is actually quite slow in
processing only a few modes are
available from video to panorama and HDR
is actually auto capable manual controls
are missing aside from the ability to
change the exposure compensation
shooting pictures takes a solid second
to do and even more if you have HDR on
we found that the only way of shaving
time off the shutter press is to change
the picture quality from fine to
standard but I only helped a little and
by far the one thing we really don't
like about this camera app is that it
goes back to default settings each time
it's opened as a person who almost
always shoots without flash having to
turn it off every single time got
annoying really fast it's an analogy for
the camera quality that Blackberry is
showing just how new they are in what
has already become a great camera space
in Android this year the optics are
capable of some good data capture but
processing looks to be the worst part of
it pictures in bright light look quite
good with adequate color saturation and
a bit of a boost in HDR but lower light
situations really show the flaws
processing is a little too aggressive so
low-light photos tend to look quite
smudgy add to that sensitive auto white
balancing and sometimes low-light
pictures can just be too warm which is
another reason why I don't prefer spot
metering for pretty much any camera the
privat ends to overcompensate for the
very spot you pick either making the
surrounding areas way too blown out or
too dark and this is also the case in
video as well where low-light
performance is the biggest issue that we
saw overall the blackberry proof camera
is the biggest example of the company's
good intentions and poor execution
whereas other companies have evolved
their cameras and feature set and
processing blackberry simply has a lot
of ground to make up in a short amount
of time if their follow-ups to the Prive
to be true competition against the likes
of Samsung or LG and finally in software
Android is the main story here as
blackberry has adopted Google's OS in
hopes of becoming relevance again and
they've done a pretty good job with it
despite trying just a little too hard in
key areas the general interface is very
familiar with home screens and widgets
easily within reach and an Abbe drawer
that includes the old pages for widgets
and all of the shortcuts that used to
permeate the operating system these
little shortcuts can be tied to any of
the keyboard shortcuts so with some due
diligence the keyboard can become a very
powerful tool but there are some extra
features somewhat hidden within those
three dots under icons in the home
screen mean that if you swipe up from it
a pop-up widget will appear which is a
great way of saving space on the actual
home screens even then swiping up from
the home soft key can be cater to any
applications that you might need easy
access to notifications have been
grouped together in a line of icons at
the top of the drop down can easily sort
them this is a great way for seeing only
what you need rather than getting
inundated with information and as I
mentioned earlier the BlackBerry
on-screen keyboard is actually a pretty
stellar performer swipes up from the
next letter in a word can put the
suggested word in and then swipes to the
left delete whole words which is
actually a personal requirement that I
have in a keyboard BlackBerry's
additions baked into the general shell
of Android have actually been producible
I'm but it's when blackberry tried to
start adding in layers and apps on top
of all of it that we found some issues
mainly it's how blackberry stuck to its
guns for a number of functions bbm for
example is a nostalgic return to a once
ubiquitous messaging network that no one
uses anymore
for security D Tech is the way to see if
the phone is as safe as it can be these
features can be anything from setting a
lock screen to encrypting the entire
device for the general user it's a good
way of getting into some better habits
when it comes to security but on the
other hand the app will show all the
applications and what they're doing in
the phone as well as logging events so
that you can look back and see what the
heck just happened and for all tasks and
messaging services the BlackBerry hub is
the built-in way of consolidating at all
open it up set up gmail accounts and
even some social media and you'll have
everything in one place it works well
enough and picking specific accounts to
dial down the information how
but if you already have an african solid
dating all of your emails this might not
do it for you for one thing there's no
unified login for the hub so you have to
set up every little one little by little
to that end the hub needs to be updated
to support some main features in Gmail
namely the ability to archive messages
rather than just flat-out deleting them
and also to search more than just the
amount that has been synced to it by
default that's about one week push
notifications are available for all
accounts but by default it checks every
15 minutes for a new message a relic of
a long past generation of smartphones
but the hub does have one really nice
feature which is triggered by swiping
from a specific area on the side of the
screen a quick access area allows you
access to the most recent messages in
the hub as well as calendar and tasks
entries that make for an easy way to
maintain productivity so blackberry
clearly knows how to make Android work
for its own purposes with extra little
features baked into the core of the
interface but the fundamental uses for
their long-standing applications are not
quite updated for today's Android users
of course you can just not use the
BlackBerry applications and then have a
mostly stock Android experience on here
but that's a bit of a boon to what
blackberry is trying to do here the
BlackBerry Prive is available now for
the very premium price of six hundred
and ninety nine dollars on paper it
makes a little bit of sense but still
feels a bit steep and that's because we
go back to what proof means mainly
privilege for a lot of money you may be
paying to be a part of the nostalgia
that just the name blackberry evokes the
brand used to be iconic and in the wake
of a declining public image the privet
is supposed to be the film that brought
them back into the limelight but by
prioritizing features like the keyboard
and security measures that don't simply
fit in with the general Android lexicon
blackberry is also selling exclusivity
by getting this phone you just might be
part of a privileged group that not only
still believes in the brand but can
manage to drop the high price for what
is BlackBerry's first attempt at Android
the company has to improve the features
that users often require of current
Android flagships like the camera and a
bit better ease of use in the operating
system if blackberry manages to stick
around long enough and learn from its
competitors we just might see a
we'll come back for a company that
especially now manages to still be
fundamentally different from what we've
had the last couple of years as always
thank you guys very much for watching
and I hope you enjoyed this pretty
comprehensive review of the BlackBerry
pre if we have to take our time with
this one because it's kind of a new
anomaly in the Android space not only a
phone that has a physical keyboard now
but is made by a company that we haven't
necessarily heard a lot from in a while
it is a pretty good device that got
quite a few things right but it's not
for everybody because they tried a
little too hard in a few aspects when
the rest of them should have been
focused upon as well keep it tuned to
Android authority for all of the best
coverage including more about the
