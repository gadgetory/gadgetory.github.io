brought to you by Gamefly welcome back
to Android weekly my name is Jason this
week was wearable week in the wonderful
world of Android with the launch of the
Moto 360 and the LG G watch all powered
by Android wear so now all of us can
dawn are painfully tight jeans and
channel our inner Michael Knight first
up is good news for all of you who can't
wait to get your hands on the new Galaxy
s5 unfortunately there's no release date
given for the s5 but Samsung said the
phone will ship sometime an early April
worldwide but pre-orders for the new
flagship phone are available now from
AT&amp;amp;T and from t-mobile on March 24th
yeah now we're moving on to some pretty
sleek looking smartwatches meet the Moto
360 it will be voice enabled feature
deep with Google now integration and
have a fitness component besides that
the device looks like a beautiful
conventional timepiece with a round
watch face and even a mechanical button
on the right hand side with the Moto 360
Motorola says it wants to quote
reimagine the wristwatch for the future
and continue with the basic wristwatch
design that has endured for a century
because of its elegance and usefulness
at a glance
now Motorola is also boasting of some
sort of unique charging method you'll
notice that there's no USB charge port
or any other typical connector that you
would use to charge the device so we can
only guess that inductive charging is
going to be included here but we shall
have to wait and see now not only did
Motorola unveil its SmartWatch but LG
has officially announced its G watch now
we don't know quite as much about the G
watch but the CEO of LG promised that
quote the opportunity to work with
Google on the LG G watch was the perfect
chance for LG to really pull out all the
stops on both engineering and design now
the good news is is that unlike the gear
2 the LG G watch will support a wide
range of Android devices now both of
these devices are powered by Google's
new platform for wearable tech called
Android wear and there
two main components to Android wear one
is the contact stream and two are the
cue cards the first of these is
basically a vertical list of cards that
show notifications and other useful
information in a way that is fairly
similar to Google now on Android phones
it's important note here that each of
these cards may have additional pages of
information that you can access by
swiping horizontally including tappa
buttons that allow you to respond to
notifications and more you can also
easily dismiss cards by simply swiping
left to right the cue card UI is brought
up by simply saying okay google or by
tapping the g' icon on the home screen
from here you can either say a specific
command or you can scroll and tap on a
list of possible commands developers
will be able to link to some of these
specific commands like calling a cab
with their apps and it will be up to you
to assign which apps are utilized with
the command by default now last week I
invited you all to play battlefield with
me because let's face it there is
something cathartic about sneaking up
behind the tank and blowing it up with
c4 it's okay it's happy tears but we all
need affordable ways to get our gaming
fix on and with plans starting at 1595 a
month
Gamefly members can rent one to four
games at a time and keep them for as
long as they'd like Gamefly members can
also play hundreds of PC games for free
with unlimited PC play please feel free
to add me on Battlelog I go ant paladin
hop I play a lot of the first-person
shooter games and I always use paladin
pup is my Nick I shall see you in my son
you can also get one month free trial
when you go to gamefly.com forward slash
authority last week in Beijing Oppo
announced the find seven a major effort
to rock the world of high-end Android
devices the fine 7 actually comes in two
variants standard and premium but don't
let the name fool you even the standard
model packs some of the best
specifications you can get in a
smartphone right now and the premium is
a notch above starting with an
incredible quad HD display that we've
been hearing so much about
in fact the fine 7 is the first device
that will
to the western shores to come with quad
HD display which means you get 25 by 60
x 1440 pixels crammed into a screen that
is 5.5 inches across you want to be sure
to check out josh's videos on the Oppo
find 7 he not only reviews the device
but he compares it to other android
flagship devices thanks for watching
android army but let's be serious who
actually watches this portion of the
show i could be talking to nobody but if
you are still watching somewhere in
internet lands i do have an opportunity
for you to win an android a thority
t-shirt but here's what you have to do
what is the original inspiration for the
SmartWatch I'm talking with in the media
right I mean for smartphones we saw
crazy stuff that looked like smartphones
in Star Trek
where's the inspiration for smartphones
and I'm not talking about Knight Rider
that was just a watch communicator I'm
talking about a SmartWatch that's a
really really cool stuff I think you
could trace it back to a cartoon from
the early 80s I won't tell you the name
of it but if you can give me the name in
the comments below you will win the
t-shirt I will ship it anywhere to you
here is your one and only clue the
leaders or the the team of Heroes in
this cartoon would do something with
their watch they would do this transmute
