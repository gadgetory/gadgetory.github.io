Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome to the 160 fifth edition of
Android apps weekly let's put the crazy
away from the last week and talk about
some app news google announced this week
that Google Chrome has hit 2 billion
installations that includes desktop and
mobile it's also the first Google
service to boast that many installs
according to google only about 1 billion
of those are actually active users fun
fact Google now has seven services with
over a billion installs and they are
chrome Gmail Google Play Android Maps
search and YouTube amazon has been
ordered to reimburse customers 86
million dollars due to unauthorized
in-app purchases this is the final
verdict from a court case that dated
back to 2014 the court case revolved
around kids being able to use the in-app
purchases without parental consent both
Google and Apple have had similar suits
filed against them with 19 million and
32 million dollar fines respectively we
bet amazon is going to be a lot more
careful about this kind of stuff moving
forward the latest humble bundle is now
live and the theme for this one is board
games you can pay one dollar to get to
games three dollars to get up to six
games or you can complete the bundle for
five dollars or higher there is a really
good set of board games up for grabs in
this one including carcassonne ticket to
ride and catan it's also a fantastic
deal since taken to ride alone costs six
dollars and ninety-nine cents of course
it's also a great way to give to charity
exposed users were wondering if the
framework would eventually make it to
android nougat the developer released an
update to let everyone know that it's in
the works the bad news is that there are
some hurdles that are getting in the way
based on the given information
overcoming these hurdles is going to be
quite the task and will determine if
nougat gets exposed framework good luck
to robo 89 we're all rooting for you pun
intended Square Enix reportedly made
over 1 billion dollars in sales mostly
thanks to mobile games the mobile gaming
portion of the sales totaled over seven
hundred million dollars this is mostly
thanks to titles such as mobius final
fantasy final fantasy brave x vs Final
Fantasy record keeper and an assortment
of Final Fantasy console ports with
Final Fantasy 15 coming out later this
month on console we're sure that'll help
add to the pot and bounce
out a little bit now that Google
daydream is officially out we're going
to see a ton of applications for it one
of the most prominent ones of this last
week was YouTube BR it's essentially the
standard YouTube platform that's been
redesigned for VR consumption it puts
special emphasis on 360 degree videos
complete with spatial audio as well as
other VR types of content anyone who has
picked up a daydream device should and
probably will check this one out astral
frontier is the latest JRPG out of
chemco it features a fairly familiar set
of graphics and concepts you'll be
exploring a world following a storyline
and beating up on bad guys to get to the
end of the game the combat is pseudo
text-based first-person structure like
you saw in JRPGs back in the 90s it
should run on most devices including
lower end ones it's also fairly
inexpensive at two dollars and
ninety-nine cents and it has no in-app
purchases android auto has been out on
android for a little while however this
week marked the first week where it was
widely available to most Android users
you'll be able to download this
application onto your phone and use it
in your car which negates the need to
have Android auto in your car natively
you'll be able to do things like listen
to music navigate with Google Maps send
messages and a whole lot more Google is
still working out all of the kinks but
it's worth a shot pinout is the latest
game out of mediocre the makers of the
popular game smash hit this title is a
hybrid of an adventure game and a
pinball game you'll use the flappers to
launch the ball through the level to try
to make it to the end it features smooth
colorful graphics along with simple
mechanics you can pick up the game and
play it for free with no in-app
purchases or advertising there is an
optional 299 premium upgrade that will
give you the ability to save your
progress if you so choose microsoft
released a photo application this week
called microsoft selfie this is a wicked
simple little photo editor that's also
pretty easy to use you simply open the
application take a photo apply a filter
and share it where it needs to go there
is also a slider that lightly edits your
photos automatically as well it's
nothing overly special but it is quick
and it does seem to work pretty well at
the very least it's completely free with
no in-app purchases do beware of those
release date bugs though for even more
Android apps and games news updates and
announcements don't forget to check out
