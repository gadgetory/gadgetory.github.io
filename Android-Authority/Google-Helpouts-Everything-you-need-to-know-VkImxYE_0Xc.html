hindi the android authority app guy and
this is Google helpouts a lot of people
know about helpouts already but we'll go
over it once again for those who may not
know helpouts is a platform where people
can go to find help you simply go to the
site type in the subject and you'll be
given the option to have a live person
help you over a video chat think of it
like tech support but for almost any
subject and you can chat with a person
face to face instead of over a phone or
in a text chat ok so here's how it works
first you need to develop a problem
here's hoping that doesn't happen but in
the event that it does you would go to
help out google.com and either search
for your problem or you can scroll down
and browse the various categories it
can't take a minute as a keyword can
bring a lot of results from a lot of
different categories but it shouldn't be
too difficult to find what you're
looking for once you find the help out
that works best for you your next step
is to get into it you can start a
HelpOut right away or you can schedule
one for later if your problem can be
solved at a later date sometimes you
have to schedule it for later because
not all helpouts are immediately
available because sometimes people have
to eat and sleep this is also a common
thing with popular helpouts during this
process you'll also need to secure a
payment method for I helped out chat if
it's not a free one you'll need Google
Wallet for this if you don't have one
it's fairly easy to set up once you have
secured your payment method you are
ready to go once you have completed
these steps you simply have your
helpouts and that it's helped out
sessions can be short or long depending
on your spending limit and your
scheduled time if you've ever been in a
hangouts call before then you know how
they work you simply have a video chat
with somebody that you're paying to help
you it's also worth mentioning that you
can perform this entire process through
the Android application if you so choose
the application can do everything the
web version can do and that's always
comforting so if your problem is either
somewhere where you don't have access to
a computer or it's because your computer
is broken you can still access a help
outs if need be so what can you use this
for well for anything really I went
diving in to see what topics I could
find and there really are a bunch of
unique things you can find anything from
yoga poses to food preparation to
creating 3d parallax video clips out of
2d photographs simple concepts like tech
support to more complex things like
writing a novel even has some weird and
specifically specialized stuff like
aquaponics and blue
animal instructions critics of helpouts
have pointed out that you can find most
of this stuff on the internet free of
charge and that is true you can find
tutorials for pretty much anything that
explains how to do pretty much
everything however there is an inherent
advantage to having someone
knowledgeable to interact with and you
don't get that advantage when you read a
wiki how link having someone there to
answer your specific questions and
concerns can help streamline the
learning process and reduce the amount
of troubleshooting time significantly
okay so let's take a look at what's good
about helpouts the website and the
Android app work pretty much the same
way so you can do whatever you want on
both of them this is a rare instance
where the mobile platform and the web
platform achieve a near-perfect parity
and I always have respect for that
because I don't see it very often
helpouts has a vast number of topics you
can find help obtain analysis or learn
about pretty much anything and Google is
adding new topics all the time for the
most part helpouts are reasonably priced
there are also free ones available if
you're looking to just try out the
platform you can never argue the
advantage of having someone live there
to talk to you about your specific
problems sometimes you just need someone
to sit down and walk you through a
problem or a process so you can
understand how it works and helpouts
delivers exactly that it is a Google
service which means it integrates with
other Google products if you use
hangouts and Google Wallet and chances
are if you use Android you have both of
these things then you already have all
the tools you'll need to use helpouts
thanks to Google's strict approval
process most helpouts are hosted by
people who know what they're doing in
their particular topic in most cases
this is not amateur hour
finally it's easy to use the mechanics
are very simple because it's just a
video chat over hangouts with a
professional that you pay for there are
no difficult parts about the process of
course like any service there are some
cons as well so here are the bad things
some help outs can be rather expensive
granted in most cases the people who run
them are seasoned professionals and it
is how much she'd usually pay for that
level of help anyway however people on a
budget have expressed that they wish
some of the pricing was cheaper there
are some country restrictions I don't
have a definitive list on where it does
and does not work but you'll know when
you try to use a helpouts also if you
want to host a helpouts the country
limitations are much more restrictive
finding the right topic can require some
creative searching as a few keywords do
overlap for instance if you search for
driving help you won't get any results
for driving a car but you'll get a bunch
of google try
helped results so if you search for
something and the results are not what
you were expecting try using different
keywords overall this is an amazing
platform it has its detractors sure but
so does everything ever and in this case
I would highly recommend that you try it
out for yourself to see if you like it
there are free topics to get your feet
wet and it's a great way to get
personalized help in a surprisingly wide
range of subjects seriously even balloon
animals the interface is easy to
navigate in the process of paying for
and getting into helpouts
is a straightforward as you can
reasonably expect it to be there are
some limitations here and there sure but
the benefits of using helpouts
outweigh the limitations by a fairly
large margin if you want to try it out
simply head to help outs google.com to
get started or if you want to try the
Android app we'll have that linked in
the video description as well as the
written companion if what I've just told
you isn't hitting those strings or
pushing those buttons what if I told you
that you could try it at a discount for
a limited time you can use the promo
code Android off which you can see there
at the bottom of the screen you get $20
off your first paid hangout there's also
a link you can follow in the video
description and in the written companion
that'll help you automatically redeem
that so now you have $20 to try out your
first help out and really is there any
reason not to at this point once again
