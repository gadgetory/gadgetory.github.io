you with an unboxing of the red magic 3
this device has the potential to be the
best value gaming phone on the market
right now for under $500 that's 450
euros you get your device that's packing
all of the very top tier specs and a lot
of unique features that I'll get to in a
moment that makes it significantly more
affordable than the Razer phone - or the
Zeus of rods which are both a generation
behind now I've already reviewed the red
magic Mars recently that was sporting a
Snapdragon 845 but this should be a
significant step up from that already
very impressive device of course this
comes with the Snapdragon 85 5 now which
means it gets the Adreno 640 GPU as your
still it actually has a built-in fan a
physical fan with vents and everything
otherwise you've got a five thousand
milliamp hour battery which is stupid
impressive built-in shoulder buttons so
you've got some actual tactile input see
it sounds pretty interesting
let's take a look lift that off and in
here we have the box very nicely
presented looks like it's in a showroom
or something here's the phone itself now
of course these are gaming phones that
means you get the gaming aesthetic I'm
aware they're not everyone is into the
gaming aesthetics but personally I
really am in fact if I had it my way
everything would have RGB lighting
here's the Aurora band we got on the
last one otherwise in the box it's just
a bear charger in a manual but it's a
nice charge on a manual
so all these vents are obviously for the
fan and they also have the added bonus
of adding to that gamer aesthetic at the
same time anyways let's do the bit that
everyone likes and take off this sticky
cellophane I actually have like a stick
of phobia so I don't enjoy the spin I
could just slide it out but I'm doing
this for you guys
I'm gonna get a satisfying peel that was
not really actually because it's not
stuck to the foetus while I care little
pocket that was that's pointless
we've got to do it just have a kind of
screen protector on it by the looks of
it but I'm not going to remove that they
go it's very metal very shiny much more
premium feeling than the red magic Mars
and you like it when we get to review
phones aren't just black squares and
this definitely isn't that that she
feels really nice it's weighty
so where the shoulder buttons those are
the shoulder buttons first a little
emblem down here looks like the Ferrari
emblem or something got some kind of
interesting connector here which
suggests the addition of future
peripherals yeah I'm liking anyways
enough of that let's boot it up here we
go privacy policy everybody's favorite
bit well skipper for now do you ever SIM
cards put into it later do if you can
tell from my accent but I am from the UK
to get that from now they look
yeah location consent that's fine
oh hello that's all cool
I'm the guy in the background there I
don't know what franchise that's from so
it won't come across in this video this
is actually really buttery smooth thanks
to a 90 Hertz refresh rate to massive
screen to it's a 6.5 inch AMOLED which
means obviously really immersive games
but also quite useful for productivity
tasks and typing on the screen that kind
of thing yeah feels nippy but I mean
you'd expect nothing less
let's take a look at the camera shall we
agree yeah well it's hard to tell right
from the start but it's certainly not
skimping on anything so there's just one
camera lens as you probably noticed but
this is a 48 megapixel Sony IMX 586
sensor that's the same one found in the
likes of the Xiaomi 9 so it's actually
pretty decent despite that and this is
the first smartphone apparently to offer
8k video recording actually when you
take into account that camera and the
low cost and the great screen which
would make it fantastic for media
consumption this could be a really good
prospect for non gamers as well as long
as you don't mind the aesthetic
and it's actually cheaper than other
ostensibly value phones like the oneplus
7 when you take all that into account
it's really tantalizing prospect so yeah
Google is present and correct too on the
phone so that means I can start
downloading some apps and test out the
performance okay so I've added some
games to the device now flick this
switch on the side and you can actually
enter a dedicated game space and see all
your titles in one spot this also gives
you quick access to features and
performance tweaks you can control the
fan for example check the temperature
enter a performance mode it's pretty
cool it really is like a gaming PC
almost so those were just my initial
thoughts when I open this thing for the
full review of course check out the link
in the description and head over to
Andrew authority comm I really put this
thing through its paces and there's a
lot to discuss over there whilst you
there of course why not take a look
around after all we are your source for
