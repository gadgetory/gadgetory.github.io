weekly show is sponsored by NV SMS
messenger the Logan ladies and gentlemen
I'm Joe Hindy the android authority app
guy and welcome back to android apps
weekly this is episode number 126 so
let's get started reddit is officially
testing the closed beta version of their
official application up until now reddit
users had to rely on third-party apps to
get their reddit on soon people will
have the official option if they want it
we don't know what it'll look like just
yet but we'll let you know as soon as it
comes out a recent report was released
that showed that Adobe Flash use
accounted for a meager six percent of
online video consumption in 2015 this
has led analysts and anyone with a brain
really to the fairly logical conclusion
that Adobe Flash will be dead and gone
here in a few years it had a good run
and will live on in our memories google
announced last week that over 5 million
Google cardboard units had been shipped
and they have downloaded a combined
total of twenty-five million VR
applications which averages out to about
five applications per person it's a
budding market but this growth is very
promising especially considering that
there are only about a thousand BR apps
currently available back in December
square enix announced that they were
going to re-release final fantasy nine
on mobile sometime in 2016 to show that
they're really working on it they've
released a 90 minute gameplay video that
shows the game working quite well with
on-screen controls are you excited cuz
I'm excited after months of waiting
Spotify finally launched video content
on Android the music streaming service
has video content from big providers
including Comedy Central ESPN NBC adult
swim and various others the selection
isn't that big quite yet but it is
encouraging to see so many big names

okay folks is take a look at the absent
games that made a big splash this week
as usual if you want to check any of
these apps or games out you can find
those links in the video description
below spin circle is a new minimal
puzzle game that has a lot going for it
the premise is that you control a yellow
circle in orbit around a center point
you then tap each side of the screen to
control the orbit path and speed while
avoiding blocks that are bouncing around
the square that encompasses the circle
there are variable difficulty settings
leaderboards and simple controls that
round up a good time waster experience
it's also free to download google has
released the google indict keyboard
which is a version of the official
android keyboard that works for indic
languages there are plenty of languages
supported including hindi bengali
punjabi and many others it works
effectively and does what it's supposed
to do it also has the ability to spell
out words phonetically using the English
language a handwriting mode English mode
and a whole lot more it's entirely free
and a great option if you're looking for
something like this down well is a retro
arcade game where you must fall down to
complete levels it has charming retro
graphics and simple on-screen controls
that take virtually no time to get used
to as you fall you'll find optional
rooms for power-ups bad guys various
platforms and other obstacles you can
attack enemies or hover using your gun
boots and the gameplay itself is pretty
fast-paced and easy to play there are
also no in-app purchases where real is a
newer set of Android wear watch faces
that aim to look as realistic as
possible of course you can only do so
well on a where watch face but these do
look pretty good on top of the time the
watch bases also contain Google fit
information temperature battery level
and more stats they should be compatible
with most watch spaces whether they have
round or rectangular screens and they're
also free to download Digimon Heroes is
the latest card collecting game from a
franchise that knows a thing or two
about card collecting games given
Digimons history it should surprise no
one that the game comes with over 1,000
Digimon for you to collect and enhance
using a variety of techniques such as
digi bulb and digi-fuse you'll battle
various types of opponents and there is
a lot of content to play through it is a
freemium title with the classic card
collecting pitfalls but if you can get
past that the game itself isn't half
