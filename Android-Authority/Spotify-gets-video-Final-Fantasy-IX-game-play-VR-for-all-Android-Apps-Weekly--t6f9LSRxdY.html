let's get started reddit is officially
testing the closed beta version of their
official application up until now reddit
users had to rely on third-party apps to
get their reddit on soon people will
have the official option if they want it
we don't know what it'll look like just
yet but we'll let you know as soon as it
comes out a recent report was released
that showed that Adobe Flash use
accounted for a meager six percent of
online video consumption in 2015 this
has led analysts and anyone with a brain
really to the fairly logical conclusion
that Adobe Flash will be dead and gone
here in a few years it had a good run
and will live on in our memories google
announced last week that over 5 million
Google cardboard units had been shipped
and they have downloaded a combined
total of twenty-five million VR
applications which averages out to about
five applications per person it's a
budding market but this growth is very
promising especially considering that
there are only about a thousand BR apps
currently available back in December
square enix announced that they were
going to re-release final fantasy nine
on mobile sometime in 2016 to show that
they're really working on it they've
released a 90 minute gameplay video that
shows the game working quite well with
on-screen controls are you excited cuz
I'm excited after months of waiting

below spin circle is a new minimal
puzzle game that has a lot going for it
the premise is that you control a yellow
circle in orbit around a center point
you then tap each side of the screen to
control the orbit path and speed while
avoiding blocks that are bouncing around
the square that encompasses the circle
there are variable difficulty settings

boots and the gameplay itself is pretty
fast-paced and easy to play there are

look pretty good on top of the time the
watch bases also contain Google fit
information temperature battery level

with most watch spaces whether they have
round or rectangular screens and they're
also free to download Digimon Heroes is
the latest card collecting game from a
franchise that knows a thing or two
about card collecting games given
Digimons history it should surprise no
one that the game comes with over 1,000
Digimon for you to collect and enhance
using a variety of techniques such as
digi bulb and digi-fuse you'll battle
various types of opponents and there is
a lot of content to play through it is a
freemium title with the classic card
collecting pitfalls but if you can get
past that the game itself isn't half
