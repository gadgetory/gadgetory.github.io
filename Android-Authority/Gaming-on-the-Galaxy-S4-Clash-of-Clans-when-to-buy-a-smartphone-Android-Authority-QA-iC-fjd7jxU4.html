Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to android authority Q&amp;amp;A we
have a lot of great questions this week
regarding gaming controllers on the
galaxy s4 whether or not you should wait
for the next big thing and whether or
not you can buy devices with google play
store credit we have that a lot more so
let's get started ron asks i'm looking
for a physical game controller for my
galaxy s4 any recommendations the answer
to this is a little complicated with
root it's really easy all you have to do
is pair your controller to your device
using the sixaxis app without root it's
a little bit more difficult some people
have reported limited success with
connecting a PlayStation 3 controller
directly to the device and that helps it
para via bluetooth without root I've
added a link to the written description
with more details on how you can do that
best of luck Gabriel Jimenez asks will
the Sony Xperia Z come to more carriers
than just t-mobile unfortunately sony
has a bad habit of not releasing phones
in the u.s. very often in fact you can
count on one hand the number of flagship
devices sony has released in the US and
most of those have only been for one
carrier so unfortunately I don't foresee
the Xperia Z making it anywhere other
than t-mobile keep your fingers crossed
but right now there are no rumors to
suggest otherwise philip asks can i buy
nexus devices with google play store
credit unfortunately the answer to this
question is no according to the google
play Terms of Service gift cards cannot
be used to purchase app subscriptions
devices or other hardware I know you
said it was store credit but according
to every source I could find store
credit is essentially a gift card and
they adhere to the same kind of rules
sorry for the bad news Syed asks hey
android authority I was thinking about
buying a new smartphone but I'm really
confused because there might be better
smartphones coming out soon what would
you guys advise me to do unfortunately
you have run into the biggest conundrum
of being an Android tech nerd there is
always going to be another phone right
around the corner that's going to be way
better than all the phones that are out
right now if you're always going to wait
for the next big thing to come out
you're never going to upgrade your phone
again because there's always a next big
thing that's right about to come out my
advice to you is to pick up a phone that
you really like enjoy it and in a year
or two when you're ready to upgrade pick
up the next big thing then
Luke Galloway asks one of the most
popular iOS exclusive apps is the
multiplayer game clash of clans do you
think this game will make it to the Play
Store and if so how soon there's
actually been a lot of news about clash
of clans on Android here lately
according to sources clash of clans is
currently in the beta testing stages in
the google play store so we imagine that
it won't be too much longer until the
game is actually released I can't
speculate on an exact date but I imagine
the wanted out as soon as possible so
I'm going to save right about a month or
two once again I'm Joe Hindy the android
