it today yeah all right here we go
okay using PayPal and place order there
you go all right there you go so I just
wanted to show you really quickly in
this little short video just how it is
done when you receive a invite from one
plus or from anybody else who happens to
have an invite when you receive it you
go ahead and claim it and you will have
a certain amount of time in order for
you to actually purchase the device that
only lasts for certain amount of time
what I will say though is it looks like
the invite will stay in your inbox for a
while and it's only when you claim it
that that particular portion of time
will actually count down from the moment
that you claim it so there are a couple
of the things i want to show on the
website there are accessories that are
going to be released add to the one plus
website and a couple of them include a
clear case that's made of just straight
plastic that goes around your phone kind
of like a bumper except it has a vacuum
also and then that flip cover that i
actually really wanted but as you saw
there it doesn't it's not really
available yet but it does show that one
plus is slowly rolling out all of the
different accessories and items that
will go with the phone that you will
inevitably by once you receive your
invites now as far as invites ago no I
don't have an invite for you guys just
yet but we are working on it and we will
be able to receive invites very soon to
be able to do a giveaway with you guys
so make sure you guys stay tuned we're
going to have at least maybe a couple
and we'll figure out a way to do the
giveaway for you guys but I just wanted
to show you what it's like it when you
do eventually receive your invite
weathers from us or from anybody else
and this sandstone version sandstone
black version rather of the oneplus one
that comes in at three hundred and forty
nine dollars which is still a great
price with 64 gigabytes worth of storage
also comes with the updated and now
retail full retail version of
cyanogenmod 11 s and not only does that
bring with it all of the fixes for the
software issues that I did mention in my
original review but also the backing is
different from what I can tell compared
to the baby skin soft white version that
I've been using in my review unit so
stay tuned for my follow-up videos to
show you what has changed from the
original version that I review to the
final production you
