play looks not too shabby
the Model X 4 will feature a 5.2 inch
full HD display with Corning Gorilla
Glass protection and will be available
in either super black or sterling blue
there's going to be four global variants
in total with subtle differences between
each model but all should be powered by
a Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 processor an
adrenal 508 GPU in Europe North America
and Latin America the handset will come
with three gigabytes of RAM and 32
gigabytes of storage while the Asian
Pacific region the Moto X 4 will come
with 4 gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes
of storage at the bottom of the display
we've got the fingerprint sensor while
above the display as rumored is the 16
megapixel camera with a 2.0 aperture
which Motorola says is designed for
ultra low-light selfies and will come
with an adaptive low light mode this
camera is capable of shooting 4k video
at 30 frames per second or a full HD
video at 60 frames per second the Moto X
4 has a contoured design on its glass
back and based on the renders it should
look rather nicely when held in the
light also on the back is a dual camera
which sees a 12 megapixel main camera
with dual autofocus and a 2.0 aperture
and it is paired with an 8 megapixel
ultra wide sensor at a 2.2 aperture it
also has a 120 degree field of view the
camera comes with a dual LED flash phase
detection autofocus and the ability to
add depth of field effects like most
other dual camera devices including the
moto Z to force the entire package will
be powered by a 3000 milliamp hour non
removable battery that also comes with
Motorola's turbo charging feature which
Motorola says will offer hours of power
off just minutes of a charge the Moto X
4 will come with moto actions moto
display and moto voice which are all the
features that are available across the
range of Motorola devices and offer
additional features - it's unknown
whether all of these features will come
to the Moto X poor but it's likely that
several of them will the Moto Explorer
will also be ip68 dust and water
resistant offering additional protection
for those with buttery fingers now if
this device is priced right it could
potentially be a very aggressive play by
Motorola now I know some of you will be
put off by the non removable battery by
the 630 Snapdragon but those things
aren't necessary for the vast majority
of people I'm talking about the average
Android lover who wants a solid mid tier
phone that's not going to cost six seven
hundred dollars if this is $450 that's
pretty sweet what do you guys think let
me know in the comments below or better
yet in Twitterverse
