brought to you by full sail university
well flagship season is fast approaching
but until then we've got some goodies so
far the rumor mill has said that a
sodding from adding a micro SD card slot
and possibly waterproofing into the mix
the galaxy s7 will largely look the same
as its predecessor over the weekend Evan
Blass aka we be leaks also brought us
alleged renders of the galaxy s7 that
further confirmed this claim at least as
far as the front of the device is
concerned curious how the back will look
well evan has got our back again this
time showing off the rear samsung also
put out a short teaser clip featuring
its gear VR headset it's possible that
virtual reality will be incorporated
somehow to the launch of the galaxy s7
and there has been some confusion
regarding a third version the galaxy s
seven plus possibly launching at the
Mobile World Congress but our current
understanding is that only a 5.1 inch
Galaxy s7 and a 5.5 inch Galaxy s7 edge
are coming on februari 21st and as
expected LG has confirmed via twitter
that it will announce its upcoming g5
flagship on sunday febrero 21st same day
as the galaxy s7 thanks to our exclusive
leaked a few weeks ago we know that the
LG g5 will come in a thinner taller and
wider package along with a redesign
chassis it's also expected to come with
some notable goodies such as a
rear-mounted fingerprint sensor a 5.6
inch quad HD display an iris scanner and
a secondary ticker display like what's
found on the LG v10 as well as a magic
slot that can be used with different
hardware accessories other reports have
speculated that the device could sport a
16 megapixel rear camera I Qualcomm
Snapdragon 820 processor 3 gigabytes of
RAM and 32 gigabytes of on-board storage
you'll also be interested to know that a
leaked photographed purported to be the
front of the HTC one and ten has
surfaced and it looks quite a lot like
the one a9 now there's no HTC logo on
the front of this device and it looks
like the company has ditched the black
bar that has haunted the m series so far
an elongated oval shaped home button
rests on the bottom of the device and
there's some speculation that it's also
a fingerprint sensor the volume and
power buttons are housed on the right
side of the phone and the power button
looks pleasantly ridged like the edge of
a coin which should make it immediately
identifiable with the brush of your
fingertip now what we're not seeing is
the second front facing speakers load
the display so that may mean that
boomsound speakers aren't going to be
making the cut in this model all in all
this look is fairly in line with what we
were expecting from the one m10 solid
metal construction and what looks like a
5.1 inch qhd AMOLED display under the
hood the device is rumored to run a
Snapdragon 820 chipset 32 gigabytes of
on-board storage for gigabytes of RAM
we're also expecting a microSD card slot
for additional memory and a 12 megapixel
ultra pixel rear camera and for those of
you who are lovers of swiftkey you'll be
interested to know that Microsoft is
acquiring swiftkey to the tune of 250
million dollars both Microsoft and
SwiftKey have confirmed the acquisition
the swiftkey team will be joining
microsoft and continue to work on both
android and iOS apps which will continue
to be available free in their respective
app stores according to Microsoft's EVP
of technology and research Harry Shoom
the acquisition quote further
demonstrates Microsoft's desire to bring
key ops and technologies to platforms
from windows to android to iOS unquote
you know it's become a bit of a cliche
now people learn how to create an app
but don't learn how to distribute it and
get it in the hands of the people who
actually want it that's where full sail
is going to be a big help with the
mobile development undergraduate degree
program you'll learn how to both create
and distribute apps and if you're ready
to advance your development skills check
out the mobile gaming graduate program
students receive a mac book industry
software plus iOS and Android devices
and if you're ready to compete in this
rapidly growing industry visit Full Sail
