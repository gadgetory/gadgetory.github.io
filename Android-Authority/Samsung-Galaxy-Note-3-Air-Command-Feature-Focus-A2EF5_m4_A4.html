what's going on everybody and here we
are again at the Sony booth at Aoife in
Berlin taking a look at the Galaxy Note
3 now what we're going to be doing here
is I'm going to take the s-pen and show
you a few of the new features that were
added in to the Galaxy Note 3 to enhance
the pen experience what they really
wanted to drive home with the note 3 was
the idea that the s-pen should be as
easy to use as possible and here we are
with the Galaxy Note 3 I'm gonna make
sure I'm gonna try my best to have my
hand out good enough fashioned right
here ok so what we're working with here
is the Galaxy Note 3 full HD display
quick overview of all the many things
that you can do and this doesn't even
really add in the pen so here comes the
main thing that has been added in is a
new menu that comes up when you put the
pen close to the screen we just hover
right over and you see like a tiny
little dot when it comes up on the
screen when you see that I press the
button on the pen
called the air command menu there are
five functions on here that are at least
exempt some things will be the most used
functions of the S Pen aside from say s
memo and s note so the first one that
we're going to take a look at is the
action menu actually action memo sorry
and it hit the action memo and a pad
will come up it is within this pad that
you can write anything and contextually
you should be able to tell the note 3 to
take the information that you write down
and send it to an appropriate
application so for example for example
we're going to probably just put in the
term Aoife which is a little button
right here that is linked to action
when you click on that
you can select the specific part of the
memo by drawing line around it life what
happens is it finds your writing
automatically and gives you a number of
options starts off with the phone
contacts messaging email browser maps or
a checklist if you wanted to write down
a checklist it'll automatically make a
checklist for you and we've got a
browser let's use the regular browser
and we'll go right in you see the note
is minimized right here and it will
search on google for info
and there you go we have our right there
so that would be the action memo the
next function is the scrapbooker and
essentially what this scrapbooker does
is allows you to take us make a circle
around something that you want to save
so let's say you wanted to save the I
suppose this is the official trailer of
Aoife let's do this one down here
the actual website that he thought
it saves it not only does it save the
actual little square or part that you
circle it also saves the website that is
fine so all of the data is right there
so those are two of the main functions
that are on here however I'll just
quickly go through the other ones of
course you have screen right which is a
lot like another member type of
application it takes a screenshot of the
screen and then you can write all over
it if you want to after which of course
you have notes on top of the screenshot
you can always save save the last thing
I'll show you is pen window now real
quick the s finder right here then to
the magnifying glass right there that
would be the search function that is
available on the note 3 it is an
enhanced search function that can search
everything literally everything that's
on the device including your memos and
your notes and everything like that and
you can even write down something that
you've written before in a memo and they
will be able to find that with
handwriting recognition now we did try
it a few times it was mostly accurate
but you have to be careful with your
handwriting for that to work
the last one is pen window which is
essentially small apps for about 3 I
just hit the pen window icon right there
and what we're going to do is draw a box
now we'll bring up that box this box had
just appeared after I drew it will be
one of these apps so for example if you
want to go to youtube and give me a
small muted window
wonderful so wonder if we just search
for a couple of things here let's look
for
all right there you go we'll see Android
Authority there so what's gonna happen
is I can always just click on one of
them and there you do I have a small
window that allows me to watch a video
while I'm doing everything else like for
example if I'm going through a front and
trying to look at stuff like so there
you go that's just a quick look at the
new pen functionality that the note 3
has with its S Pen
the S Pen is very much a feature that a
lot of people love about the note and
this is definitely a new way of using it
so we have the note 3 here on the floor
of FIFA in Berlin at the Sony booth
we'll have more for you in the coming
days so stay tuned to android authority
because we're your source for all things
