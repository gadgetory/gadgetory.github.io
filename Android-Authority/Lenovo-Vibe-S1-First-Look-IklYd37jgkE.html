smartphone that brings with it a pretty
sleek design and quite a bit of power
it's Josh of regard from Android
authority what's going on everybody and
this is a first look at the Lenovo vibe
s1 there are actually quite a few
features that are available in the vibe
s1 that make it somewhat compelling but
the first thing we'll look at is the
design the first thing that we noticed
when we got this phone in our hands was
just how nimble it was this is a very
thin device and it's also very
lightweight and it's something that
really sticks with you as you're using
the phone the handling is just so easy
and the glossy finish on the back almost
helps its case because it just sits very
nicely and even though it might slip
around a little bit the screen is not so
big that that would become a problem
that being said the screen is a five
inch full HD display that's 1080p
resolution it is an IPS construction
underneath the surface a mediatek
processor octa-core 1.7 gigahertz powers
this particular device and three
gigabytes of RAM is what backs it up 32
gigabytes of internal storage are backed
by a microSD card slot that can be
expanded up to 128 gigabytes and more
now what is also pretty nice about this
phone aside from the handling is the
fact that the rear and front cameras are
given a couple of enhancements the main
one being in the front-facing camera but
first we'll talk about the rear it's
just a simple 13 megapixel rear camera
that has a dual color flash so you will
be able to get some nice low-light shots
using the flash without too much of it
being washed out but the big story here
is the dual front-facing camera setup
eight megapixels for the main camera and
two megapixels for this secondary camera
essentially you're going to get depth
information so that you have your
subject usually yourself for a selfie
with a nice depth of field effect in the
background well we also did find in the
camera app aside from having quite a few
options is that it has a lot of ways for
you to take your self-portraits one of
the main ways that we noticed right away
was the auto selfie when you bring up
the phone to your face or rather just
far enough so it detects your face the
moment that it does detect that there's
a face in the frame it will take a
selfie right away this was a little bit
too effective in how we're testing so we
did feel that this was an option that
any people will probably end up turning
off from time to time underneath all of
that we have a twenty five hundred milli
amp hour battery that should go for a
little while especially with some power
saving features that are available on
the s-1 the operating system is still
pretty much what we expect from Lenovo
phones there are some tropes of it that
it might be a little bit too bloated
there are some really colorful elements
to it but mostly it is quite functional
and with a 1.7 gigahertz octa-core
processor it should run pretty smoothly
and pretty reliably unfortunately the
vibe s1 might not really be available to
many people in the West as generally
lenovo's smartphones kind of stick to
European and Asian markets but that
being said for those of you who aren't
in those particular markets you might
find that the vibe s1 is a very reliable
very standard but still very attractive
phone that is able to get the job done
in a pretty stylish way so keep it tuned
to Android Authority for even more as we
are here at Aoife in Berlin on the show
floor hanging out with the Lenovo seeing
what they have in store for us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
