Clayton coming at you once again from
Android Authority calm today we've got
an unboxing and very quick overview for
the Lenovo idea Tab s2 109a this is a
very cool tab it's got some impressive
specs it's gonna unbox it real quick as
you can see here on the side of the
package it says we are running our TI
OMAP 4460 lore processor we've got a
nine point seven inch LED IPS display
that's in-plane switching it's a very
very nice screen a lot of the purists
love it now sixteen gigabytes of storage
one gigabyte of RAM we've got our Wi-Fi
certifications it says we're running the
Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich operating
system so this is our box so you've got
some cool contours on the box the box
looks really nice but we're just gonna
open it up for the first time okay so
here's our Lenovo idea tab
lift it up move the box of the way for
just a second here you can see as I take
another packaging very very nice device

as much as a samsung galaxy tab see we
have our speaker's here with SRS audio

speakers right here we also have a micro
USB mini HDMI out and then mini SD card
on this side we've got our power a small
mic and we have our volume rocker here
on top we have no rear facing camera on
the Lenovo we do have a front facing
camera so we'll let our lenovo set to
the side really quick as you can see
here packing label open up the rest of
the box within here
although was that's all the novel
boot-up

the Lenovo and the OS overview of very

limited warranty information lift this
up with an inch within each individual
box we've got some more stuff ok within
this box we've got our USB adapter cable

box it's kind of tedious opening I'm
putting a bunch of individual boxes just
to get these stuff whether it's all
packaged nice

our silicon case installed our skin here

have powered it once this is our lock

from the lock screen go ahead and unlock
there was some different theming on the
tablet icons but this device is not
running a custom overlay such as the HTC
Sense or you know Samsung TouchWiz and
as we go down to our about tablet see
them running Android 4.0.4 we've got our
developer options now the USB debugging

review if this is the Novo idea tab as
2109 a because I always like to get a
good week of use in before I give my
final judgments on what I like and
dislike about the tablet so keep
