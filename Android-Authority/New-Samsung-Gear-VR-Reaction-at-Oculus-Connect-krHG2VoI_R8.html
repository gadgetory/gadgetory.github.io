hey it's Josh regard from Android 30
what's going on everybody and I'm here
at oculus connect the Developer
Conference for oculus rift and also for
Samsung gear VR and this morning we got
a couple of announcements from Samsung
about new content and also a new
peripheral that they're coming out with
for gear VR now unfortunately I won't be
able to show you the new peripheral at
$99 it's a bit of a game changer
providing gear VR to the consumer masses
for a very accessible price point you
got to give them a lot of credit for
that and we're really excited to get our
hands on it
and I was actually able to feel a
prototype version of it so I can give
you at least a couple of points that it
is bringing to the table the new gear VR
at $99 will be able to fit not only the
s6 the s6 edge but also the s6 edge plus
and the galaxy note 5 it will be able to
fit all of them because the size of the
actual headset is going to be the size
that you would expect first a the note 5
except on the bottom there is a slider
that will allow you to put in the s6 or
the s6 edge so that it can accommodate
the smaller device now that's really
awesome
because in the past gear VR was only
available if you were to get new
versions of them based upon that Samsung
device that you probably have I know
that I had the note 4 in the past last
year and then the note 5 and the s6 came
out and having to get new versions of
the gear VR was definitely not really
ideal for people but now you'll be able
to get gear VR at a very good price
point for all four of them so no matter
which of this year Samsung smartphones
you have you'll be able to use gear VR
now the thing about this particular
headset is that it kind of weighs down
on the cheeks a little bit and that's
kind of just a way that people have been
tolerating the gear VR experience as
awesome as it is it kind of weighs
things down and look especially when you
take off the top head strap which is
something that I tend to do so I don't
mess up my hair and lawn can attest to
that as well and what makes it really
nice is that the new gear VR is
substantially lighter than any of the
other iterations we've had already now
that's gonna make it easy to bring the
gear VR for a lot of different
applications like for example being on a
flight let's say you're going from LA to
New York or even an international flight
you'll be able to have this on the plane
without it weighing your face day
and the lightness will make it easier
for everyone and even easier entry point
into the video now video content is
where things are starting to get pretty
pretty interesting because now there are
actual partners from regular video
streaming sites in this case Netflix
that are coming to gear VR now the
Netflix the Netflix experience is
actually kind of simple what you're
going to do is when you fire up Netflix
from oculus home which is the platform
that you use in order to access all of
the apps that oculus makes available
from gear VR you find yourself inside a
living room it's really the best way to
put it you find yourself inside of a
living room there's a coffee table in
front of you where there are some props
and everything and basically you're
there and when you pick from a regular
Netflix looking menu
what you want to watch it comes up as if
you're watching it in a theater and
that's a that's a pretty interesting way
of watching Netflix it'll give you that
depth of field sort of feel I should say
that will allow you to feel like you're
at home watching TV we're going to be
able to do is use oculus social on
Samsung Galaxy devices on gear VR to
share in an experience with other people
who have the same peripheral and the
same set now in my case I used twitch as
a way of sharing an experience of
watching game streams with friends when
you look inside and you fire up oculus
so shoulder then fire up the twitch
stream again you're leaving the room but
when I look around there are four other
chairs and you'll be able to see avatars
of the other people who are joining you
as you're watching the twitch stream now
this is nice because you'll also be able
to hear the audio input from all of
those people so what you'll be able to
do is share in an experience and be able
to talk about the experience with them
now in this case we only looked at
twitch streams but there should be other
platforms that are available like
hopefully YouTube and even Netflix for
example because we already saw the
living room example with the Netflix
with the Netflix demo so yeah I'm just
picking it here with Samsung and oculus
at the oculus connect to developer
conference we took a look at the new
gear VR that's coming at $99 and there's
only about a couple months away but
there is their new Khan
as well certain games have been added in
as well but now they provide a couple of
examples of how to play games on here
but it's mostly a lick and
point-and-click experience unless of
course you're using the Samsung
controller right here that are to be
able to control certain rooms just like
that but it still has a uniquely mobile
experience something you would expect a
smartphone to be able to do in terms of
gaming but we're gonna take a look at a
couple of other things here at oculus
connect so stay tuned to Android or even
more as I'm here at oculus is developer
conference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
