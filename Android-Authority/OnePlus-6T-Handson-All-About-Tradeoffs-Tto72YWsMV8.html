the 1 plus 6 and it's still one of my
favorite smartphones I've ever used
oxygen OS is amazing it's jam-packed
with specs but now they have a new phone
just five months later this is the one
plus 60 so the questions you're probably
wondering is is it actually better
should I buy it well I've had this phone
for about five days now so I don't want
to give you a definitive review just yet
but I do want to give you my impressions
so let's focus on what's different now
the first and probably most obvious
thing about this phone is the in screen
fingerprint reader and oneplus says it's
the fastest in the industry they're
claiming that it can unlock your phone
in 0.34 seconds and in my testing I
haven't really found that to be the case
sometimes it's really fast but sometimes
it just kind of takes a while to unlock
my phone now comparing this to the
huawei mate 20 I really find wall ways
to be a lot faster but oneplus does say
that their fingerprint reader is
supposed to learn your finger more over
time so I need to spend a little more
time with the phone before I can finally
make a conclusion so now we'll move to
the back of the phone and it looks
really similar to the 1 plus 6 the first
thing you'll notice is that that
fingerprint reader is gone obviously
because they want people to use the in
screen fingerprint reader but the back
of the phone pretty much looks exactly
the same as soon as I took the phone out
of the box I noticed that it was just a
little bit thicker than the 1 plus 6
they've also added a little bit of a
curve here which they say is to make it
fit better in your hand but they did
increase the battery life by 400 million
powers now I didn't think that this
would actually help that much but I'm
getting about 8 hours of screen on time
in my first couple days of use which is
just totally insane I don't usually get
that on any phone ever and so I'm
probably willing to sacrifice the
straightness of the oneplus 6 for the
slight curve if it means much better
battery life now the cameras are pretty
much in the same position as they were
last year and they're pretty much the
same cameras as they were last year to
the biggest changes here are probably in
the software side of the camera app
there's a new nightscape mode which is
kind of like nitesite on the pixel it
does a long Expo
to kind of brighten up the image in dark
areas and you've got a new portrait
lighting mode which is pretty similar to
the one on the iPhone 10 it pretty much
puts you in this little box and adds
little lights to make you look a little
bit better now there are two other big
changes here and the first one and maybe
most obvious is the removal of that
headphone jack and oneplus says that
they were planning to remove it
eventually anyway and now they just
thought it was the right time but I
really think that they should have kept
it for at least a couple more
generations because Bluetooth really
isn't the complete standard yet also
they took multiple poles to their user
base to ask them if they still wanted
the headphone jack and overwhelmingly a
lot of people said they did that just
doesn't seem like never settled to me
now the other change is the water drop
notch which is noticeably smaller than
it was in the 1 plus 6 and the 1 plus 6s
notch wasn't really that intrusive as it
is but they've moved the speaker grille
into the frame of the phone so now
you've got a much smaller notch that
just has is the front facing camera I
didn't really think this would make that
big of a deal but when I was watching
content on YouTube it was noticeably
less obtrusive so that's really nice to
see so that's pretty much all there is
with hardware besides the power button
that's like slightly shifted down a
little bit but most of these changes are
in software
the oneplus 60 is running on oxygen OS
on top of android 9.0 PI and oxygen OS
is still one of my favorite Android
skins ever it's super lightweight it's
really fast it's really smooth and
they've done a few things like making
the gesture animations better so that
it's a little more fluid to navigate and
they've also done things like putting
app data in RAM so that apps launch a
little bit faster now all of these
changes are being pushed to the 1 + 6 so
you don't really have to worry about
that if you do have a 1 + 6 but it's
really nice to see these incremental
changes over time as far as specs scale
you're not really getting that much
different from the 1 + 6 you're still
getting that snapdragon 845 you're still
getting a 6 to 8 gigabytes of ram and
this time you've got 128 or 256
gigabytes of storage now you'll notice
that they got rid of the 64 gigabyte
option and they have up the price of the
base model by $20 but you are getting
twice as much storage so I think that
that's a pretty good trade-off the other
SKUs are pretty much exactly the same
price now probably the biggest deal
about this phone is that it
coming to t-mobile and it's fully
compatible with Verizon now if you want
to buy this phone today October 29th
you'll be able to go to the t-mobile pop
up in Times Square if you're in New York
City but otherwise you can pick this up
from t-mobile stores nationwide or on
oneplus calm on November 1st so now
you're probably wondering if you should
buy this phone and ultimately it's
really a trade off if you want the
headphone jack in a more streamlined
flatter phone the one plus six is still
really awesome and I still really love
the feel of that phone but if you want a
little bit better battery life a smaller
notch and that in screen fingerprint
reader the 60 is still a really good
phone and the fact that it's the same
price made me think twice about it so
honestly I kind of feel like this is
like a horizontal option oneplus will
still be selling the six for a little
bit longer and not that much longer so
you should probably get it while you can
if you really want that headphone jack
but you'll be able to buy the 60 really
soon here so a full review is coming
soon we'll have more stuff in there like
extra camera samples and all that stuff
but until then if you have any questions
that I didn't really answer here drop
them down in the comment section below
do the thing with the Bell and you know
all those notifications and whatever and
I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
