on the samsung galaxy s nine Korean
business publication the Bell claims
samsung has designated project star as
the codename for the Galaxy S nine while
the s 9 plus will be known as star 2 the
more interesting part in the bells
report touches on Samsung's accelerated
production schedule for the Galaxy S 9
reportedly Samsung wants to start
manufacturing the s 9 and s 9 plus three
or four months earlier than usual
unnamed industry sources speculate that
the reason might be an increased focus
on Quality Assurance which makes sense
considering the predicament Samsung has
found itself in last year due to the
note 7 now the same source claims that
we shouldn't expect any major design
changes making it more likely that we
will once again see the double edged
display now the iris scanner on your
brand new Samsung Galaxy s8 is supposed
to make the device much more secure and
it is but not completely hackers from
the Chaos Computer Club have
demonstrated just how easy it is to
trick the essays iris scanner in a
perfectly controlled environment that is
mark Clifton CEO of the company behind
the iris scanner found in Samsung's
flagship once explained how his
company's technology can register up to
200 identifying features from a single
iris or up to 400 with two irises
compared to 130 identifiers on the FBI's
fingerprint technology however it looks
like in a perfectly controlled
environment the galaxy s 8 iris scanner
is easier to fool than previously
thought this is how they did it and I
quote the easiest way for a thief to
capture iris pictures is with a digital
camera in nightshot mode or with the
infrared filter removed depending on the
picture quality brightness and contrast
might need to be adjusted if all
structures are well visible the iris
picture is printed on a laser printer to
emulate the curvature of a realized
surface a normal contact lens is placed
on top of the print this means that at
least in theory someone could steal your
Galaxy s8 and trick the iris scanner in
order to make online payments using apps
like Sam
pay the Chaos Computer Club or CCC
consequently recommends that you use the
traditional pin protection however it is
important to note yet again that this
test was done in a perfectly controlled
environment meaning the likelihood of
someone being able to capture your
irises with a camera and stealing your
Galaxy S 8 device is quite low on top of
that there's been other tests where
hackers have been able to successfully
steal users pin numbers or bypass
fingerprint scanners so the bottom line
is that in theory any security
protection is susceptible to a malicious
hack we just need to be careful when
using password or biometric protection
and avoid storing sensitive information
on our phones now since this news when
public Samsung has issued a statement
and I quote we are aware of the issue
but we would like to assure our
customers that iris scanning technology
in the Galaxy s8 has been developed
through rigorous testing to provide a
high level of accuracy and prevent
attempts to compromise its security such
as images of a person's iris if there is
a potential vulnerability or the advent
of a new method that challenges our
efforts to ensure security at any time
we will respond as quickly as possible
to resolve the issue now let's move on
to fun stuff and you know what's fun
drones especially affordable drones who
doesn't love drones once the playthings
of the wealthy now there's some of the
coolest toys around especially the ones
with cameras check out this silver
dollar sized drone with full video
recording capabilities the cheerson CX
TC launched as the world's smallest
camera drone now the camera is only 0.3
megapixels but users have said that it
is surprisingly good low-light
capabilities and is crystal-clear
outdoors this micro sized cat Terrorizer
launched at a price of $50 however it's
dropped to around $25 in most places
what some things can you think of doing
with a $25 drone let me know in the
comments below now if you are a
developer or an aspiring developer code
is your world you create it tweak it and
lovingly obsess over it so picking the
right repository management tool is
super important that's why our sponsor
