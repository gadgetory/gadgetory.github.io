buddy and we the andro thority team are
here in Barcelona Spain the fear Grand
Villa is right in the background for MWC
2017 now we brought you a lot of
coverage already over the last couple of
days and is now day three of MWC however
what we also wanted to do is share with
you what else we get up to in our little
Network here as we have a number of
other web sites where we where we bring
you stuff beyond the world of Android
and we have bring you this segment
called beyond Android where we show you
what's going on on websites like charge
do tab times sound guys and VR source so
why don't we go ahead and operate it hey
guys Tom Velasco here with answer
authority over to you talking quickly
about some stuff beyond Android for our
sister website be our source some of the
recent things that we did was Josh
actually went out to the IMAX a VR
experience in Los Angeles and it's
pretty cool because he explains it as
being a VR or paint of sorts have these
different pods values free arcs very
and use the HTC vive and these are VR
headsets and you get to add all sorts of
the Argives experience there another one
of my colleagues David and Mel that can
check out the brand new Samsung VR
roller coaster over at Six Flags in
Vallejo California and it's kind of
Silverton all the other types of VR
roller coasters we've seen from Samsung
so you strap on the headset get to ride
the roller coaster but there's a VR LMS
because you put on the gear VR and
you're transported to the Space Shuttle
game and it's a co-op effort so you have
play with a partner and it's definitely
thrilling and as for myself I reviewed a
couple games for VR sores first one is
present
7 or the PlayStation VR and I gotta say
that's by far the best game right now or
the PlayStation VR it changes up the
gameplay and also up here are longtime
fan it's barely get some type of
gameplay and also spoil on gotta check
that out
I also reviewed the unspoken for the
oculus rift
he uses the into touch controllers that
bondsmen Doctor Strange the movie
displeasure or the sorcerer magician
make up all these spells we do a lot of
hand movements and gestures so you gotta
check them out and here at end all this
2017 meaningful we are there checked out
here who was the new Samsung gear VR
roller and he get chance to see an ass
and I did hold it it's bare someone to
the Google date you
because there are sensors inside of it I
can track motion and there's also
trainer so it feels a lot more than
and that's about it so that's more about
this video check out our website your
source to me out and from there I'm
happy to bring you the coverage from
charge al now a little bit over a week
ago I myself got to take a look at a car
called the lucid err now I'm not gonna
give you too many details on the car
because I really want you to watch the
video not only because I was the one who
put it together but because it's one of
my favorite videos that I have ever ever
done it I'm only gonna give you a sneak
peek of it right now
now the Lucid air is essentially a
competitor to the Tesla Model S and it
brings incredible comfort into a package
as also incredibly powerful the car is
also able to do autonomous driving so
you'll be able to have the car do self
driving on top of just being able to
wield that sheer power of the electric
motors so head on over to charged on IO
to see that video and learn more about
the Lucid air the link is down in the
description below and then at the end of
this video you'll see subscription
buttons for all of our different
channels bringing it back stateside i'm
adam alina here in new york for sound
guys and we had a couple interesting
things happen as well for one josh got a
chance to check out the IFI stackable
speakers which was an indiegogo project
we've wrote about way back in 2015 and
actually one show awards at this past
CES what makes these special well you
can wirelessly daisy chain them by
stacking them on top of each other or
placing them next to each other
Joshua's definitely a fan of the
speakers but not a big fan of the 299
dollar price tag per speaker meanwhile I
also got a chance to check out the new
Bose QuietComfort 30 headphones which is
the upgraded version to the QC 20s they
still have some of the best active noise
canceling around but what makes these
special is that you can now control the
amount of ANC like you do with the
volume to up and down buttons let you
adjust the strength as you see fit which
is pretty great in everyday use on the
flip side I had some connectivity issues
that made me really question if they
were worth a price on top of that the
neck band was a little all over the
place for me and I couldn't get it to
sit still in the end I feel Bose just
slightly missed the mark with these if
you want to know more about the eye-fi
speakers or the bose QC 3s or any of the
other products you review make sure to
check out sound guys comm if you want to
keep up with all we do here at sound
guys including reviews best lists and
monthly giveaways you should
definitely subscribe to our YouTube
channel if you haven't already links all
of that down in the description even if
you don't really care about audio maybe
you'll win some free headphones nose so
that should pretty much do it for our
first edition of beyond Android make
sure you check out the other websites to
see content from them and subscribe to
those channels as well so you can see
even more in the world beyond Android
our MWC coverage has pretty much come to
a close so in the meantime go ahead and
check out these other websites for all
of the best outside of Android and bring
it back here because we are your source
for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
