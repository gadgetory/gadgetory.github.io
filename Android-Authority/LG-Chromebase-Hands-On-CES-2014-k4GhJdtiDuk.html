by Toyota
now Google obviously doesn't just do
Android handsets or tablets or phones
they also have a whole nother division
based upon the Chrome OS and those are
the Chromebooks however LG has come out
with an all-in-one desktop solution that
is called the LG chrome base hey Josh
Megara from Android 30 what's going on
everybody and let's take a look at the
LG chrome base so essentially what you
have here is a 21 inch screen at 1080p
resolution with all of the bits inside
that need to run Chrome OS now Chrome OS
is the mostly cloud-based system that
allows you to have all of your
information synced up to the cloud you
can use all the Google services like
Google Drive Google Play Music Chrome
obviously and Gmail and applications for
such things as that and it's a very
simplistic operating system but it is
powered by a Haswell processor inside by
Intel which is essentially the kind of
processor you get from all of the new
Chromebooks that are coming out these
days so you get great performance in an
all-in-one solution that will basically
sit on your desktop and be ready to put
the world at your fingertips we took a
look at a couple of different
applications on here and they all looked
really great a 1.3 megapixel webcam is
upfront for your video chatting needs
and then after that you have ports all
over the actual device itself in order
to have USB or even HDMI out so it is
actually really great to see that the
Chrome OS is getting a lot of play on a
lot of different devices and the first
all-in-one solution for it in a desktop
solution is right next to me right here
once again this is Josh magar from
Android authority and this was the LG
chrome base here at CES 2014 and once
again thank you to Toyota for sponsoring
our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
