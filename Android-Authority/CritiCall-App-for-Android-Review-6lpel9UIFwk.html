Authority and I just wanted to take you
all through a quick app that I found
called critical you'll see you down here
in the bottom left of my app drawer
critic Hall is an excellent app if ever
you're worried about missing a call
while your phone is on silent or vibrate
so with that said we'll hop right into
it right off the bat you'll notice
critical has a really great user
interface it doesn't necessarily follow
Android holo design guidelines but as it
says at the top never missed a critical
call again critical overrides your
phone's volume settings to always ring
when you receive calls from a critical
contact now I've got critical on right
now you can set what volume control you
want your phone to ring at when this
critical call contacts you and then from
there you can hop straight into the
context list it's fairly straightforward
you've got your entire context list here
and if you merely tap one it says do you
want to make this contact critical and
you say yes or no now if you want to see
how many critical context you have you
can just hit the critical context button
and you'll see I've added myself there's
an alphabetical listing and you can also
add groups now I've added myself and
from there that's really all you need to
do you can hop into the settings menu in
the settings menu is fairly simple you
can do auto backup so if you flash a new
ROM or you get a new phone and happen to
transfer SD card data it'll
automatically import your old critical
context you can set the default call or
call setting ringtone for new critical
context right now I'm using the sign-in
tone because it's very loud and kind of
abrasive you can also do this for text
messages but because I use Google Voice
that won't apply to me anyways there's
an auto resume set setting rather that
you can choose if you don't want
critical to ring perhaps while you're
asleep you can exit until to not ring
critical calls and then after eight
hours it will turn itself back on that's
not really an issue for me right now
either so you'll see I've got a critical
contact listed as myself so from there
I'll go back from there I'll exit and
then let me go call myself from another
phone real quick and you'll see just to
double check that my phone is not only
on vibrate
it is also its own complete silent mode
so it shouldn't ring it all be right
back I've just dialed myself on my other
phone
and you notice right there
that it was silent for a second sorry
about that had to go turn off the other
phone right there that you it rings a
silent for a couple of seconds and then
up here it actually gives you a
notification in the pulldown bar that
says critical overrode your phone's
volume setting so that's how you know
that it worked
other than that critical is pretty
simple I know that it saved me when I
was waiting to hear from my new bosses a
couple times and I would highly
recommend it if ever you find yourself
in a situation when you need to receive
a call from somebody critical is a mere
ninety-nine cents in the Google Play
Store so if you need an app like this
that's definitely one I would check out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
