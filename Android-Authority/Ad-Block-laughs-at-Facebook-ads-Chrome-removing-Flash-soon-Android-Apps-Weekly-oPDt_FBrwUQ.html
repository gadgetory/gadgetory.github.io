Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 153 so let's get
started IFTTT has rolled out direct
third-party support what that means is
that instead of going into the I FTT app
to create recipes individual app
developers can now include them directly
into their apps people can then just
head to the settings and turn on the
recipes that they want it's a new thing
so there aren't a whole lot of
real-world examples yet but some
companies like coraggio Adobe sky bell
bloom sky automatic and others will have
it sooner or later Facebook announced
this week that their advertising will be
more resistant to ad blockers basically
the company is redoing how the
advertising is rendered on the page in
order to disguise them as organic
content so that ad blockers leave them
alone ad revenue represents a large
portion of Facebook's revenue stream and
many sites depend on it to reach new
audiences so move like this isn't
unexpected it is worth noting that
adblock responded in kind like two days
later so it's probably a non-issue we
are but one month away from the day when
Google Chrome will start killing off
support for Adobe Flash despite the
sudden off switch coming in just a month
Google Chrome has slowly been lowering
and support for adobe flash over the
last few years if you still have uses
for flash you won't be able to do things
anymore but at this point most sites
have migrated away from it anyway so
it's not really that big of an issue
quadrotor is a new security flaw and
Android that affects devices with a
Qualcomm processor it's a standard
privilege escalation vulnerability which
means that applications that have this
problem can get root access and then
it'll have access to everything on your
device luckily features that already
exist such as verify apps pretty much
prevent this from happening as long as
you don't side load applications or you
get apps from trustworthy sources your
chances of having these issues are
virtually zero percent hulu announced
this week that they're doing away with
their free service initially you could
watch some stuff for free and then you
can get additional features and shows by
paying for the monthly subscription
however the company stated that their
free offering is so far removed from
their paid experience that they decided
to scrap it altogether it definitely
sucks but that's how things go for even
more Android apps and games news
including the latest Pokemon go news you
can check out this week's newsletter
which is linked in the video description
below if you want to sign up for the
news
they're for yourself you can use the
form which is in the written companion
which is also linked in the video
description below don't forget to check
out the official android authority app
for even faster updates Raines is a
strategy simulation game with some
pretty unique mechanics instead of using
controls to maneuver a world you're
given a stack of cards you then swipe
through each card tinder style to answer
whether you agree with that position or
not the longer you play the longer you
remain in power and if you make the
wrong decision you are mercilessly
killed it's a goofy little idea and it's
a pretty interesting use of the tinder
swipe mechanics it's two dollars and
ninety-nine cents with no in-app
purchases isotope is a beautifully
designed application from Jack Underwood
developer of the popular today calendar
and this application helps you learn
more about the periodic table of
elements it features a 118 element table
complete with transition animations
along with high-quality images for most
of the elements the developer has
promised to include more over time you
can also read more information and fun
facts about the elements search for a
specific elements and some additional
features if you go pro you get an
additional theme and it's worth noting
that neither version has ads the manga
works is the latest simulation game out
of Cairo soft the same developers who
did the highly acclaimed game dev story
in this sim your job is to run a studio
that produces manga you'll start with a
fledgling studio and you'll be hunting
for plot ideas to make your manga better
it has a lot of the same graphical
styles and mechanics as game dev story
so those who may have played that will
have an idea of how this game works it's
four dollars and ninety-nine cents but
there are no in-app purchases the only
downside is it doesn't appear to have
cloud saving one view calendar is a fun
new calendar application with some very
bold ideas for starters it doesn't sort
your calendar by the classic month day
or week views instead the entire thing
is laid out in a single agenda view mode
where you can scroll through your entire
calendar it supports pinch to zoom so
you can navigate easily and it syncs
with google calendar which should make
migration easy you can add events by
dragging and dropping the icon where it
needs to go it's completely free and
it's actually a lot of fun to use efie
swordplay is a new fencing game and
frankly the best fencing game now on
Google Play you create a character and
then you learn the finer points of
fencing and the mechanics are simple and
easy to understand while being difficult
to master the game features
customization that has you adding
equipment to your characters and even
fine tune in your weapon there is a PVE
campaign mode or you could face off
against your social media friends in the
PvP mode it has in-app purchases but
they're generally an offensive the game
is definitely worth a shot and that
about does it for this one folks if you
want to keep watching we'll have Jace's
latest news video linked up there on the
screen and in the video description
below don't forget to sign up for that
