is Jason this is where we cover the
week's Android news and this week we
learned what many of you already know
and that's that Android dominates the
world yes eighty-five percent of all new
smartphone shipments are now running
Android which scares some folks because
they're all worried about the whole
Skynet thing come on I mean it's not as
if who will knows where you are at all
times who you're with what you buy what
you don't buy who you communicate with I
know you bought Justin Bieber tickets
still here oh your god that's right
Google is so dominate with Android that
some countries in Europe are accusing
Google of being a monopoly European
authorities are said to be looking into
investigating the search giant for its
overwhelming advantage over other mobile
platforms this investigation would carry
through if Android was to ship over
eighty percent of devices within the
European nations which currently isn't
the case android devices account for
seventy-three percent of ship devices
within the said continent to be fair
though more competition can only be a
good thing for users like you and me now
for those of you who were salivating
over the shield tablet I talked about
last week good news for you at just 2 99
the 8-inch shield tablet is one of the
most impressive slates you'll find in
the market today in large part thanks to
the beefy Tegra k1 processor some of the
tablets other specs include two
gigabytes of ram 16 gigabytes of storage
for the Wi-Fi only model and 32
gigabytes of storage with the LTE model
with a microSD card slot the device is
billed as a gaming tablet with support
for the nvidia controller which is sold
separately but to be fair this is a
great choice for anyone who wants a
high-end tablet experience at a very
affordable price and the good news is
these devices have shipped if one of you
have it I want to hear about in the
comments below tell me what you think
now one of the phones to get the most
media coverage this year was the one
plus one and it's rumored recently that
they'll be coming out with a SmartWatch
could the SmartWatch equally
press the alleged watch is said to go by
the name one watch and while details of
the hardware are pretty much
non-existent we have both a sketch and a
web page screenshot that gives us a
glimpse of what to expect probably the
most interesting feature here is that it
is circular in design just like the
upcoming moto 360 the sketch also claims
that it will have an o LED display with
sapphire glass the sketch further claims
that the watch will have a curved
battery titanium borders a leather band
and will charge wirelessly now remember
guys last month we heard a rumor about a
one plus one tablet which was a complete
hoax so please take these screenshots
with a grain of salt we can help now if
you're like me and you're a big fan of
Sony's compact phones we have a sighting
of the Sony Xperia z3 compact a new set
of images have appeared on Weibo showing
off a handset that is supposedly the
Xperia z3 compact the catch here is that
the images don't match with the images
we previously saw of the supposed z3
compact the big difference here is the
placement of the front facing camera now
there could be two variants of the z3
compact secondly this could be a
completely different handset all
together or perhaps even a fake although
it must be said it does follow Sony's
aesthetics my only hope is that these
great compact flagship powered Xperia
devices are more available here in the
West because they're like seven hundred
dollars on ebay come on Tony give us
some North American love thanks for
watching a droid army my name is Jace
love to connect with you here on Google+
or Twitter I read all comments at
replies even the rude ones but I read
them can't respond them all but I do
read what you say you don't want to
forget about my brother's an Android
Josh Joe and the tech ninja Kevin Chris
and lon that's right and for those of
you who don't watch the Android qas you
should know that there is a four-part
series going on on the Android QA shows
and there is a hint a very tiny
misleading sneaky hint in each one of
those for q and A's and if you can take
all those clues and piece them together
to answer the question I posed you want
a fifty-dollar google play gift card
to see you next week on Edward week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
