Authority in this episode I'm gonna
teach you a few tips and tricks for
mastering blinkfeed on your HTC one HTC
One is a nifty gadget it has a wonderful
build and design it has amazing hardware
specs and it is loaded with lots of
interesting software features one of
which is blinkfeed what is blinkfeed
it's an HTC exclusive feature that shows
all your favorite content on your home
screen this can be in the form of posts
from supported sites posts falling under
a particular topic category updates from
your social network and posts from your
other Android apps if you have ever used
Flipboard you'll find blinkfeed to be
similar except that all your feeds
appear right on the home screen also
blinkfeed has fewer features than a
Flipboard and is available only in the
recent versions of HTC Sense
if you want to master blinkfeed you'll
want to know how to customize it master
bling feeds navigation controls and find
your way around your feeds you'll also
want to know how to get rid of blink
feed so to speak just in case you decide
that it has become too annoying first
let's talk about customizing your
blinkfeed you can tell blinkfeed what to
show on your home screen to do this
first go to the topmost feed on the
blinkfeed home screen you can do it
quickly by tapping the home button once
there swipe down a little bit
like this to show this row of
customization buttons don't swipe down
too far or else you'll just be
refreshing the feeds then tap the Menu
button and select topics and services
from the menu you'll see these three
tabs for services and apps feature
headlines and categories you can swipe
left or right to switch between tabs on
the services and apps tab choose which
apps you'd like to be able to post
content to your blinkfeed if you're a
member of social networks such as
Twitter Facebook Flickr and LinkedIn you
can also log into your accounts through
this page so that posts from those
accounts will also appear in your
blinkfeed screen on the featured
headlines page you can choose from a
list of HTC recommended sources the list
varies according to the default country
that used bus
five for blinkfeed if you have not set a
default country just open the menu and
blinkfeed tap on settings then local
content here select a country from this
list unfortunately you cannot add your
own sources to blinkfeed the third tab
shows you different categories think of
each category as a bundle of feeds from
various sources when you select a
category popular feeds and posts from
that category will be shown on your
blinkfeed so if you're addicted to games
for example the gaming category should
suit you well or if you want to always
stay up to date with the latest and the
entertainment industry then you know
which category to enable now that you've
set up your blinkfeed according to your
wishes learn how to go around blinkfeed
browsing your blinkfeed posts is as easy
as swiping up or down to open a post
from the feed just tap on it like this
and you'll be taken to the post itself
at the bottom of each post you'd usually
find a link for viewing the original
stories web version using your browser
while reading posts from your blinkfeed
you can use some tricks to help you
navigate faster for example you can
swipe left or right or go to the next or
previous post if the text is too small
you can adjust it tap this button and
pick a comfortable text size if you tap
the source name at the top you can see a
list of other posts coming for the same
source this button of course is for
sharing the current post to your other
apps there's more than you can do with
blinkfeed this time let's talk about
managing your feeds to ensure that you
get the latest and hottest posts
blinkfeed automatically refreshes your
feeds when connected to a Wi-Fi network
you can also manually fetch the latest
posts by just going to the topmost feed
and pulling downward until you see the
release to refresh label let go and
blink feed will update your feeds you
can also choose to use mobile data if
Wi-Fi is unavailable on the blinkfeed
page open the menu and select settings
tap Auto refresh and select this to
update your fiends my mobile network be
careful about enabling this as using
mobile data can cost additional charges
from your mobile carrier depending on
what topics services headlines and
categories you selected you could get a
deluge of Post
from all your favorite content providers
you don't need to drown in that flood
though for one you can filter your feeds
by choosing which ones to highlight just
bring up the customization menu like
this then tap the Menu button beside the
highlights this page lets you filter out
sources whose posts you want to hide
from your feet if you're looking for a
specific post you can look forward with
the search function this is the button
the tab you can even bring your search
to the web
aside from receiving content through
feeds you can also post through social
networks through blinkfeed blinkfeed not
only keeps you updated but also lets you
update your friends by posting social
updates on blinkfeed to do that just tap
this button select which social account
to use and then type your status update
not all HTC one users add or blinkfeed
some prefer to have it hidden or
deactivated how can you do that first of
all you cannot uninstall blinkfeed
because it is integrated into HTC Sense
itself
but there are several ways to prevent it
from showing up on your home screen by
default blinkfeed is set as the main
home screen so each time you tap the
home button you will be taken to your
most recent feeds however you can change
your main home screen to something else
just open the menu in blinkfeed and
select customize home screen in this
page you will see a mini thumbnail of
your home screens just hold down on any
other home screen besides blinkfeed
and drag it to the set as home label
that appears when you see this home icon
and the thumbnail you'd know that that
thumbnail is the main home screen from
here on every time you tap the home
button you will no longer be taken to
the most recent feeds and blinkfeed
you'll be taken to your new main home
screen instead a second way to get rid
so to speak of blinkfeed is to use a
custom launcher
there are many of such apps on the
Google Play Store ranging from the
simple and lightweight ones to
eye-popping 3d launchers that look
delightful custom launchers usually
alter your phone's looks including the
home screen so there's a very big chance
that your preferred custom launcher
won't let blinkfeed appear a more
drastic solution is to flash a custom
ROM for the HTC One there are several
custom roms cooked up by third-party
developers for the HTC one most of them
don't include blink feed but be care
about going this route though as
flashing a custom ROM may void your
phone's warranty blinkfeed is
undoubtedly a feature most HTC one users
consider needs and useful although some
would disagree through blinkfeed
all the latest content from your
favorite publishers are made accessible
to you right on your home screen
in this episode I shared to you some
tips and tricks on how the master
blinkfeed I even shared some tips on how
to make it disappear from your main home
screen I hope you find the tutorial
