suite in the Renaissance Hotel its Darcy
lacunae reporting from CES 2014 I'm here
with Steve Miller he is an ambassador
for lanova and he's going to show us a
very cool piece of kit
it's a 4k monitor but he knows more
about it than me so I'll let him take it
away
thanks a lot yet I do want to show you a
4k display at 4k 2k is the next great
thing out there the contents really
coming at it says you need to see how
beautiful display is we're just talking
about the details you can see on this
lady's face is a really bright screen
but you may notice if you look at the
sign here this has smart display so we
do a little play on the words here a
little bit it's not just that let it
switch over off of my Windows machine
over to when you're going to see pop-up
KitKat this is our new smart display so
one of the challenges that we see is I
have this spent money this is going to
retail above $1000 but I'm not to be
working right now and I've got this
hugely expensive monitor just just
sitting here doing nothing it's usually
expensive because it's doing nothing but
why not put the base on it and have an
Android power ecosystem I like Windows
I'm a fan of Windows but Android was
designed as everything about it is a
touch operating system so let's take
advantage of a touch screen and 4k
currently this is the only 4k 2k Android
device on the market this really is
amazingly beautiful but all the ports
you can think of I've got three HDMI
I've got DP I've got USB I've got smart
device I've got audio video with a great
speaker bottom on the bottom so if
you're in SMB market or a home office or
just an end user you want to take
advantage of this resolution 4k 2k but
when it's doing nothing and it stops
being expensive because you have an
entertainment system you have your
ecosystem you have everything that
you're used to with your Android
environment right here when are we going
to be able to get it
okay this ships summer probably July and
announcing this week at CES but shipping
in July well I think that pretty much
sums it up cool thank you very much for
your time mr. Miller you're welcome
all right Sandra authority reporting
live from CES 2014 we got lots more
coming up for you guys to stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
