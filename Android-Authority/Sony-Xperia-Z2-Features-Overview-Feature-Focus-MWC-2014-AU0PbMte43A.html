by bitdefender mobile security hey it's
Josh Vergara from Android 30 what's
going on everybody and here we are
revisiting the Sony Xperia z2 which is
the update to the flagship from last
year the Xperia z1 now one thing I
wanted to touch upon once again quite
literally is the feel of the device
after all we do have the same general
design language from the Xperia z1 and
in this feature focus on the general
features of this phone we wanted to
really highlight the way that this phone
feels in the hands you still get the
very decisive rigidity that what that
has permeated throughout the Xperia Z
smartphones the first experience Z and
then the z1 after and of course but with
some curves here and a somewhat softer
feel in terms of the metal here it does
feel very nice and comfortable despite
having that rigidity that makes you it
that makes you think that you really
have a solid solidly built phone in your
hands there you really don't feel like
you're gonna be dropping this because
the grip is really easy given the
somewhat rounded but still very rigid
corners I keep using the term rigid
because that is the kind of build
quality that we have here
they have very decisive lines all around
you still have the dual glass finish
here and really in the hand it's just
really like one of the best handling
phones out there simply because you know
it's in your hand better than most other
ones it'll never slip out because it
really just sits in your hands very
nicely with its width it's very decisive
design there aren't too many additions
to the general stock like experience of
Android on the Xperia smartphones and
that really helps with the performance
you do have the notification drop-down
right here but there has been an update
with the quick settings toggles right
over here that give you an easy access
all in white of course in a very nice
motif that allow you to change the
various settings on your phone you can
also edit these and you aren't able to
change the order or even add extra
buttons if you wish so let's say roaming
cuz we're in Spain airplane mode because
we're gonna be on a flight later and you
will see that they show up right there
on the bottom so really nice and easy
the other addition that Sony also loves
to put in there is these small apps and
let's just do that a little bit you have
the reason to have screen but the small
apps are right here on the bottom and
you do have a few more up here
one in particular that I really like is
of course the Gmail one so I can't show
it right now but a small box would show
up showing me my emails for quick
multitasking you've probably already
noticed in the performance aspect and in
the aesthetics that I was showing
already there are just all of these
really quick flourishes that allow the
phone to just look really smooth it you
see how everything just is pretty quick
there's the camera it just moved right
over very nicely and then when we come
here it's just got that nice fade the
notification job done has a nice fade to
it as well it slides over rather and
when you go into any of the apps it just
has this really nice aesthetic to it
that makes it seem very snappy very
smooth and it just sort of guides you
through everything that it is doing it's
a very nice aesthetic that the z2 has
with its updated Android operating
system and all the performance that is
underneath it's just something that I
really wanted to highlight after that
you also have the different apps like
the Walkman which still looks really
lovely and has a little bit of an update
here with a nice pull over from the left
side and right there you have all of the
pieces of music that are on the phone
itself along with the the shortcuts here
to send you to the unlimited store
services that Sony puts on their phones
as well if I was going to go ahead and
play a song you can see there it's just
really nice the Walkman is still one of
the best media players out there in my
opinion you also have the gallery here
the album that has
on and the nice pullover also from there
a lot of the apps in the Sony ecosystem
have been updated to the 4.4 look that
has a pull out from the left side so one
last thing that I will show you as
always and you probably know about this
already the Sony Xperia z2 much like the
previous entries in the smartphone line
for them is waterproof and water and
dust resistant and Here I am just
dumping the phone in here I'm going to
go ahead and hit the silver power button
on the side and you'll see that the
phone turns on down there and once I
take it out of the water here you'll see
that it works just fine I'm looking for
going through the there you go swipe to
unlock and there you go we're back in
business even though the phone took a
dip in the water so it's Josh Flagg our
from Android thority as you know already
and we're here taking a look at the Sony
Xperia z2 oh the water is making some of
the presses on here a little bit more
difficult got to wipe this off before I
can continue using the phone but we are
here at the Sony booth at the Mobile
World Congress in Barcelona Spain make
sure you stay tuned for the rest of our
coverage this is the last day of the
show so we have a lot coming for you in
the coming days
finishing up of the show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
