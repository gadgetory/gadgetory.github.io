everybody and we have a bit of a
different one for you here we thought
about taking a look at the galaxy s 9
and putting up against while one of its
main competitors and has been a while
since we featured an iPhone on Android
authority of course but we thought this
would be a good time to take a look at
the iPhone 10 and maybe expound on what
Samsung might be doing in the future
after all the next one is going to be
the S 10 but there are a couple of
different takes on a number of different
aspects of a smartphone when you take a
look at these two side-by-side we're
using the samsung galaxy s 9 plus in
this case because it has the most
features compared to the iPhone 10 which
is a little bit smaller but still packs
as much as possible in terms of design
the iPhone 10 did have to go a little
bit more radical for its anniversary
device and we expect that Samsung will
probably do the same thing but you could
let us know what you think about that in
the comments down below the iPhone 10 is
a radical difference from the arrests of
the iPhone line especially since the
iPhone 6 with its metal design this one
is glass on glass and it does have a
different look not only for the lack of
a home button up front but also for the
dual camera on the back now speaking of
the lack of a home button you don't
really have any buttons at all on the
iPhone 10 everything is done via swipes
from either below the screen or from
above the screen to get to the control
center and then of course if we're gonna
talk about the top of the screen then of
course there is the notch let us know
what you think about the notch and the
comments down below obviously everyone
has differing opinions on it but the one
thing we will mention here is that even
if Samsung is using a large screen the
infinity display with soft keys on there
at least there's nothing impeding the
full screen experience on the iPhone 10
even what games like Tekken like I'm
playing right here on either phone the
knotch actually cuts into the content a
little bit which might be a bit annoying
to some people but on the other end of
the spectrum the Samsung Galaxy S 9
probably had to be at least familiar to
any users who have been using their
phones in the last couple of years that
way they would be able to rekindle or
rather recapture the user base that they
have had ever since the Samsung Galaxy
s6 era you of course have iOS which
requires very different specifications
when compared to Android it's the
Android device that will seem much more
powerful because of its high levels of
RAM its snapdragon 845 especially in the
case of the samsung galaxy s 9 and from
there you have high amounts of storage
and expandable memory for example things
that the iPhone 10 generally does
not have and there are people that have
said historically that space tends to be
an issue when it comes to their iOS
devices you have the camera and on the
back of the iPhone 10 there is a dual
end setup with one of them being a
telephoto lens this is obviously a trend
that was followed by Android a little
bit later on and the galaxy s 9 plus
follows suit it also has a telephoto
lens but we have to say that the s 9 is
trying to move forward in the camera
game by bringing some hardware physical
features to the smartphone lens no
matter which s 9 you get the main camera
not the telephoto lens that is only
found on the s 9 plus has a dual
aperture that allows for more light to
flood in when using at F 1.5 and then
you are able to get a much wider field
of focus when you use the F 2.4 aperture
and you can set that in the camera app
the galaxy s 9 does boast the 4k 60
frame per second capture that also
translates to 960 frames per second
capture for super slo-mo on the other
hand the iPhone 10 tends to have less
Pro controls but you can always download
an app for that but inside of the camera
application the built-in one you are
able to get some pretty good shots from
there with all of the settings pretty
much put on Auto there are a number of
different modes that you can select like
slo-mo panorama even a square mode if
you're an instagramer and from there
you'll be able to get some pretty nice
photos using either the back or the
front camera but the front camera of the
iPhone 10 does allow for a specific
portrait mode that gives you different
lighting options it also tracks your
face using a different camera array
which is used for things like face ID
face ID is a little bit different when
compared to the intelligent scan of the
samsung galaxy s 9 which uses a
combination of the iris scanner and also
face unlock in order to provide a
seamless experience no matter what
you're doing as long as you're looking
at your phone when waking it up but now
we can get into one of the main
differences between the two and it just
has to do with how much fun you can have
with it different kinds of emojis the
iPhone 10 brings an emojis and you can
say that it was the first one to think
up of this idea because you have these
little characters that you access by
going to some sort of messaging
application it's not built into the
camera and you just move your head
around and the same technology that
gives you face ID allows you to have
basically one-to-one movement with the
character including your mouth your eyes
and
your voice because you can record a
message as one of these little
characters take for what you will you
might have your own opinion when it
comes to an emoji but Samsung has gone
ahead and made their version of one
called a our emojis a are emojis
basically lets you take a picture of
your face and it will use recognition to
create an avatar of sorts for you it's
more of a caricature than a completely
accurate depiction of you but you can
also do the same thing there but you can
customize it to your liking put some
different clothing on there even change
the color of various elements and you
can turn on your AR emoji when using the
front-facing camera so you can record
your own videos with it with one-to-one
recognition it might seem a little bit
buggy at first we're sure that this is
going to get improved in the future but
it's another fun way of showing off a
digital version of yourself it even
saves eighteen predetermined gifts that
use your avatar to convey a number of
different emotions and finally the
Battle of assistance
you have Bigsby on the samsung galaxy s
nine which has been getting a lot of
updates which allows it to do more than
just be a voice assistant which in a way
is what Siri is Siri is just available
on the iPhone 10 and it allows you to
use your voice and to talk to the phone
in order to get a number of tasks done
however Bixby tries to take that a step
further with Bigsby vision and a number
of other functions Bixby vision in
particular does tried to find items in a
sort of reversed image search fashion in
order to tell you where you can maybe
shop for stuff or it might be able to
tell you what kind of food is right in
front of you there are a number of
enhancements in Bixby and no matter what
your opinion is on there it is trying to
be an all-around assistance so
throughout this video you've heard me
say that you should sound off in the
comments down below about where these
two phones kind of sit in the mobile
tech space we definitely want to hear
from you about how you feel about these
two devices whether or not the Galaxy S
nine is being more reactive to the
things that the iPhone 10 introduced or
maybe they are just two separate devices
that are trying to do very similar
things but it remains that you probably
have your opinion about either of these
devices and you know which one you're
going to get if you happen to be on the
fence though you can have that dialogue
with us in the comments and we'll see
what we might be able to provide in a
future comparison where we put these two
phones head-to-head especially when it
comes to their cameras so that was just
a quick look at these two devices we
will do a more full
Harrison later on you can find that
either here on the channel or on Android
or e-comm you can argue that these are
the two hottest devices out there right
now and of course we're going to see
what the future updates will show us
from these two companies the iPhone 10
was obviously a radical change and the
s10 from Samsung is probably gonna have
some sort of radical change as well
after all that's apparently what Tennant
years does to a company in any case you
can keep it into Android 34 more about
these two phones and more about the
Galaxy S 9 in particular and you can
head over to Android 30.com for all of
that great coverage don't forget to
subscribe to this channel if you haven't
already so you can keep up with all of
that and on social media as well so
