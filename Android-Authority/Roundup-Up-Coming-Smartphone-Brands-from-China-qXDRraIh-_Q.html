to you by domain.com well as predicted
Chinese manufacturers are beginning to
dominate the mobile industry all but the
most premium of smartphones you know
some of them Xiaomi Huawei oneplus and
if you're hardcore maybe even Oppo but
there are a number of other
manufacturers out there making waves
we are gonna seriously geek out today
let's start with Xiaomi Xiaomi is often
referred to as the Chinese Apple thanks
to its rise to the top it happens to be
number 2 in Chinese smartphone shipments
in China only falling behind Apple the
issue is most Western customers have no
clue about these phones as these can't
really be found at any regular store
Xiaomi is taking an approach most of the
market is not familiar with they save
millions in marketing by resorting to
mostly promoting their devices via
social media and word-of-mouth another
way Xiaomi saves money is by making sure
demand is always higher than supply they
have no extra inventory laying around
making their losses much smaller in the
long run some of the more recent devices
include the Xiaomi Mino Pro and the
xiaomi mi4i
now what about Mizzou Mizzou is a main
competitor to Huawei and Xiaomi taking
one of the top spots among the biggest
manufacturers in China they accomplished
this in a very short period of time as
the company was only established in 2003
just like Xiaomi musi was known for
making great devices that keep your
wallet relatively healthy the
manufacturer is responsible for devices
like the Mizzou mx-5 the m2 note and the
mx4pro which all are great handsets at
very low price points the only issue is
that they are only big in Asian markets
and will probably take some time before
they reach the US if they ever do you
could have the devices imported but not
many customers will opt in for such
inconvenient measures now let's talk
oneplus which is a big fan favorite
among geeks though they are a very new
startup these guys are the kings of
social media and the affordable market
they are known for hyping their devices
to no end but the main difference is
that they actually have something to
tout as opposed to just making a blast
about gimmicks the oneplus one
smartphone was priced only at $300 when
launched it came with specs that could
put most $600 phones to
internals include a 5.5 inch 1080p
display at Qualcomm Snapdragon 801
processor 3 gigabytes of RAM 16
gigabytes of internal storage 64 for the
higher-end version and is 13 and 5
megapixel cameras respectively all
packaged in a strong body with solid
design now I know this phone is not
perfect and barring some hardware issues
and some marketing gaffes this phone is
still today one of the best bang for
your buck phones you can get now let's
talk Oppo we have to give props to Oppo
they may not be too popular outside of
China but they can put together some
awesome smartphones that are actually
innovative they were the first to become
selfie kings with a rotating camera and
they're amazingly thin Oppo r5 and are
seven are stunningly gorgeous most of
you probably have not heard about leti v
let's talk about that although you've
likely not heard about this company this
does not mean they are a small player in
fact this company runs the biggest
online video company in China which is
definitely an important market to have
in your pocket they just happen to be
making smartphones they've announced
three different smartphones which are
all coming to the u.s. they are the L
max the L one Pro and the L one now the
trio of handsets are meant to be
affordable but they are in no way cheap
check this out the best of the three has
a full aluminium body a giant 6.3 inch
qHD display a Snapdragon 810 processor 4
gigabytes of RAM 64 to 128 gigabytes of
internal storage and a massive 3500
milliamp hour battery the thing is a
beast and oh yes
they're all three are coming with UBC
something that smartphone manufacturers
are continuing to take their sweet time
on now for ZTE ZTE is much more popular
as they've managed to pierce into the
American affordable smartphone market
most people don't know ZTE can also make
some quality smartphones and they also
happen to be a major player in Asia this
is one of the few Chinese smartphone
manufacturers to have a significant
presence in America and its devices like
the ZTE grand X Max Plus and the ZTE
star 2 and the SP ro 2 which have taken
it to where it is ever heard of Nubia
you have now Nubia is new but not really
the truth is it's pretty much a branch
of ZTE but they run independently now
these guys even have separate PR teams
which makes things a bit harder for us
at times but it's all worth it because
they make some awesome devices new via
smartphones tend to have a much
friendlier and sleek design
they are also usually affordable but
come with specs that are more usable for
the casual consumer in fact these phones
have some of the best camera software
that we've ever used you may want to
check out the Nubia z-9 or the Nubia 5s
mini next up is axon and every time I
hear that name it reminds me of you know
what flex on watch Sunday
Exxon hat backs off the axle on phone
mysteriously showed up online last June
we had no idea what this new
manufacturer was about but after some
research we discovered it wasn't really
an actual manufacturer it turns out this
new brand is linked to you guessed it
ZTE which would make acts on yet another
sub brand of the Chinese phone maker now
let's talk about one of the biggest
Huawei and it's really pronounced Huawei
I love the attitude Huawei has taken
towards their lack of recognition in the
u.s. they know they're the underdogs and
they find clever ways to get their name
out there even though people don't even
know how to pronounce it those who do
know Huawei will recognize it for its
super affordable handsets you usually
find in American stores and the truth is
Huawei is a huge manufacturer in other
markets especially Asia contrary to
popular belief at least in America
Huawei does make some outstanding
handsets an example of a great device is
the huawei ascend mate 7 which we have a
full review of and last up honor
now just like ZTE Huawei has created
other brands to be more accepted in the
US market and this is what honor is
honor is another brand of Huawei just
like Toyota created Lexus different
brand same company and this technique
seems to be working very well for wall
way as honor sales have been booming
take a look at the honor 6 plus and the
winner of the t-shirt is BAM oh great
