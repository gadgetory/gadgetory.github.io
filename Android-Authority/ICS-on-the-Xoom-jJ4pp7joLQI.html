android authority i am doing zoom hands
on this is the zoom with ice cream
sandwich and here I'll show you the
unlock right now camera doesn't work but
it's changed the unlock screen from the
original hiding film there's camera over
here so I'm lock over here currently the
camera does not work as you can see and
let's go here's another thing i noticed
doing the whole down i can't get to the
widgets I don't remember if you could or
not with honeycomb but you cannot for
sure from the home screen on Ice Cream
Sandwich and here we go here's the
transition of effect from apps to which
it's like that is the new transition
fact let's see what else so you have Tia
team at Rahman here so it's a little
different than I'm used to here's a
pop-up screen notifications settings
let's see what else you can do Oh tablet
let's zoom in here to see it's android
4.0 wing ray which is the zoom code name
here's some more options data usage
doesn't work yet so that it's a Wi-Fi
anyway so I wouldn't really need that
but let's see here anyways it doesn't
really have a wallpaper that comes with
it since it's the AOSP al comes with i
guess it has these I didn't even know
that I got the market to work on it
camera doesn't as I said I got a lot I
haven't had our problems really I can't
play youtube
hi def for any sort of playback for
youtube but I've gotten a regular like
YouTube app but the regular YouTube like
have no problem play flash videos on
this but as you can see everything works
pretty smoothly that's a lot smoother
than my overclocked honeycomb 21.5 i
have is running on one gigahertz since
our clock well yeah i don't never rude
yet but um as you i can show you i can
show you scrolling on it prepared to la
cura can't clear but there you go image
intensive site now and it asks mobile oh
here's the other feature that i read
about that i really liked request
desktop switchover from mobile on the
browser which is a beautiful future
sometimes it doesn't work with facebook
I've had some problems but before when
you scroll like this before with them
the browser it would chunk I don't block
now it runs very smoothly alright and
that's my hands on with um ice cream
sandwich on the zoom it's up now to
finish build but it is working really
well so far and this I got this off the
XDA I'll give cuts in the article or the
write-up idea</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
