authority now you may have heard this
idea that smartphones can suffer from
screen burning where kind of marks or
artifacts are left on a screen well is
it true and if it is true what can you
do about it well let me explain now
you'll remember way back in the day when
we should have the big square CRT it's a
cathode ray tube monitors on the desktop
we used to always run a screen saver and
it was there because it was there to
save the screen and the reason for that
is under the CRT technology the
phosphorous on the glass could kind of
get weaker and weaker and so therefore
things would get burnt in to the screen
of course it was no actually burning
there's no heating up going on but just
because that the Ray from the cathode
ray tube was always hitting in that same
place it would kind of use up the
phosphorous on that part of the screen
now obviously CRTs are very very very
different technology to what we have
today with our LCD and AMOLED screens on
our smartphones but there is some
concern that on AMOLED phones
particularly there can be this screen
burn effect now why does that happen
well if you think about the status bar
or the navigation keys or even on
displays I've got this kind of always-on
function there's a clock in the middle
of screen they're always there when
we're using our phone and the same thing
is being displayed basically the kind of
the status bar the navigation keys and
the same LED is always being powered and
the same LEDs next to them are always
being powered off to give you the black
and the the theory is that after a while
the LEDs that are being powered lose
some of their color and it's true but we
are talking about a period of several
years not talking about hours we're
talking about years here now what
happens is as the current goes through
the LED the LED gives off the light and
as it gives off the light the higher the
more current that goes through over time
it just can get slightly dimmer now here
is a photo of an AMOLED display from a
samsung device they took using a
microscope I'm using for another video
that I'm doing quite soon about how
AMOLED displays an LCD displays work and
you can notice here that the
blue LED is bigger than the green and
the red ones now why is that well it's
because the blue LED is particularly
susceptible to this problem of losing
some of the color so what Samsung have
done is they've created the LED to be
slightly bigger which means less current
needs to go through it if less current
needs to go through it that means that
kind of fading effect is slightly
diminished and the other thing that
companies like Samsung do is that where
you have permanently displayed things
like that so that that HOME key or the
clock then basically are moved ever so
slightly kind of one pixel to the left
or one pixel to the right what that
means is it's not always the same pixels
that are carrying the burden of
displaying the kinds of colors and being
lit up while the ones next to it are
remaining dark it moves around even just
by a couple of pixels you won't really
notice that it's not dead center on your
screen but yet it's moving the burden
around so that not always that same blue
pixel in one place always having to be
on it every time your phone has power to
it now if you are really really worried
about this and you shouldn't be but if
you are worried about it a few tips for
you one is don't power your display at
100% brightness the lower the brightness
means the less current going through
those LEDs which means that we less
color fading so always bring your
display down to what you is a for you is
a good level but don't push it harder
than that
also change your background regularly
you know you can use one with darker
colors that will help as well and also
if you really are worried about like the
clock being on the screen all the time
then you can just turn off those
functions on some of these devices so if
it is an issue less brightness change
your background
switch off the always-on display
features but really we are talking
several years here before you'll start
to see any of these problems what my
