everybody and here we're taking a look
at the brand new Alcatel devices for
2018 now you're going to see the 1
Series the 3 Series and the 5 Series
which all undercut the $300 price point
I'll go into a little bit more detail
with those in a little bit however well
we have to tell you in a small
disclaimer is that we actually don't
have a whole lot of details about the
specifications
that's because Alcatel at CES 2018 we'll
only wanted us to focus or really
everyone to focus on the aesthetic and
design that they're bringing to all of
their phones this year all of the
specifications will be coming out at MWC
which is in a couple of months about and
you can wait until then to get all of
the specifications for the cameras the
processors and pretty much everything
else now we'll start off with the
Alcatel one series which is going to
come in at a sub $100 price point it is
a series of phones so you're only
looking at one version of what could end
up being a bunch of different one series
devices it does have a textured backing
with a finger per reader on the back
which they deem as a premium feature but
as far as premium features go there is
also the ability to do face on lock
which is a feature it shares with the 3
Series and the 5 Series phones as well
now another thing you might notice even
with the most affordable of these 3
devices is that it has an 18 by 9 aspect
ratio it's something that is clearly
focused upon on the 3 Series phone which
is supposed to have a large and
high-resolution display but of course we
don't know exactly how large or
high-resolution it actually is the phone
is the biggest one out of the bunch and
it also sports more screen real estate
compared to the rest so hopefully the
resolution matches its size another
thing you'll notice in the 3 Series
phone is atop that fingerprint sensor
you have a dual lens setup now we don't
know exactly what the configuration is
or what the megapixels are but when we
went into the camera application we saw
a number of the different modes that you
would expect from Alcatel devices like
beauty modes for the front-facing camera
but for the rear-facing camera we did
see that there wasn't necessarily a
setting for wide or otherwise angle
choices now the backing also has a
glossy finish which means that it took
their fingerprints pretty easily however
it also is the lightest phone of the
bunch which is something we really
noticed one compared to now the 5 series
the 5 series device is the most premium
of all three of these devices we saw
during our hands on time and it has a
brushed backing which looks and feels
awesome and the phone also is pretty
thin very sleek and fit
nicely in the hand especially when
compared to the 3-series phone it's 18
my 9 aspect ratio is definitely the most
eye-catching because the bottom portion
of it really gets as close to the bezels
as possible and contrary to the 3 series
which has dual lenses on the back the 5
Series has dual lenses on the front and
one of them is a wide-angle lens so you
can fit more people into your selfies
now the one serious phone is going to
come in at sub a $100 price points the 3
series will come in under $200 and this
highly premium at least an Alcatel 's
line 5 Series phone will come under $300
that makes for a lot of different
choices that undercut the competition by
hundreds of dollars so you can keep it
tuned to enter Authority for the rest of
the specifications and details on
Alcatel z' devices when they come at
Mobile World Congress in a couple of
