Andhra thority now recently Qualcomm
announced its latest iteration of its
quick charging technology quick charge
3.0 and today I want to take a look at
what is quick charging and specifically
what is quick charging 3.0 so if you're
ready let's go now one of the things
that probably noise all of us is our
battery life have you found yourself
stuck somewhere away from a charge and
your battery's down to 10% and you don't
know whether you're going to have enough
energy left in the battery till you get
home and things like that well there are
different ways that manufacturers are
trying to solve this problem one of
course is there's ongoing battery
technology research and other ways we're
trying the companies trying to build
better phones better CPUs better
displays another approach is to have a
quick charge technology which allows the
phone to be charged up very quickly
therefore if we're about to dash out
somewhere we can just plug the phone in
and a few minutes later it's got enough
charge to keep us going until we get
home now we need to talk a little bit
about charging technology before we go
any further
the modern smartphone when it charges it
charges in two phases the first phase
from zero to about 80% can be done with
quite high levels of energy and the
energy just pumped very quickly into the
battery however there has to be a
trickle charge at the end that last bit
from 80% to 100% has to be done at a
much lower level of energy that's just
the way the batteries work now if you'll
notice that when companies like Qualcomm
and some some talk about quick charge
what they all talk about is how quickly
they can get to 80% we can charge it to
80% in 30 minutes or in 40 minutes or
whatever the numbers they are quoting
and that's because that first initial
stage is very easy for them to pump in
that energy however there isn't yet a
technology that exists for that latter
20% and sometimes that 20% can be
actually as long as the initial 80
percent or maybe even longer now on your
computer you've got a USB port now USB
ports used to be the standard way for
charging up those users or plug your
phone into the USB port and it
charge up but of course USB has only
five volt and not 0.5 amps now that was
fine for phones of a few years ago with
much smaller batteries much more
displays however today we've got big 5
inch 6 inch phones that have massive
3000 4000 5000 million power batteries
and they need a lot more energy to
charge them up so a modern-day phone
will come to this own charger that rated
at 5 volts and probably something like 2
amps now that if you've worked no bit
about physics that gives you a total of
10 watts energy 2 times 5 10 watts of
energy that you can pump into your
telephone now quick charge works with
more wattage than that by using more
than just fire bolts it might use 9
volts or even 12 volt now even if your
phone has quick charge even if your
phone uses its own charger at 5 volts in
terms you still can actually plug it
into a USB port and let me example my
Galaxy s6 will charge using Samsung's
charger in about 1 hour and 20 minutes
however I can plug it into the USB port
on my computer and charge it at 5 volts
not 0.5 amps which is 2.5 watts compared
to the 10 watts of a 5 volt 2 MB charge
of 2.5 volts and actually that will take
a 6 hours take 6 hours to charge it that
way we're talking about 1 hour and 20
minutes if you use Samsung's charger now
this is where quick charging comes in
qualcomm invented this idea that it
could charge at higher rates than just
10 watts now i'm going to read to now
some of the numbers just so that you
know what kind of different levels we're
dealing with so a normal USB port is 5
volts no point 5 amps that's 2.5 watts a
normal charger for a modern-day
smartphone might be 5 out 5 volts and 2
amps which will give you 10 watts now
quick charging will give you 9 volts at
1 point 6 7 amps it's less amps less
less than 2 and so on point 6 7 amps and
it will give you 15 watts of power that
will get pumped into your battery
and quick charge - in fact we'll even
work at 12 volts and if you have 12
volts at one point six seven amps that
gives you 20 watts of energy so what
happened with quick charge 2.0 is that
coal come invented a system where they
could get up to 20 watts of energy into
the phone
quick charge 3.0 is basically the same
idea but there's one important change
with quick charge 2.0 there were those
just set voltages nine volts 12 volts 5
volts 1.6 7 amps and all those numbers I
just read you but now with quick charge
3.0 there's an intelligent system in
terms of negotiation system that allows
the phone the charge to talk to each
other and ask for exactly the Volks that
the battery requires exactly the amps at
the battery requires for its current
stage of its charging cycle that means
that the phone won't be drawing more
than necessary won't be taking more from
the charger than it has to which means
that that extra heating up effect won't
happen and it tries to get rid of the
energy it doesn't need now before I go
on will tell you a quick slightly
comical story that happened to me this
summer friend of mine vey dear friend of
mine was I was with him and he didn't
have a charger for his phone and he
found a child he didn't talk to me he's
found a charger a USB charger he plugged
it in and he came to me little while
later I said my phone isn't charging
what's wrong with it have I broken my
phone I'm gonna have a look at it we
checked the cables and then I thought to
look at the reading on the actual
charger and it was an old iPod charger
and it was rated at something like
naught point one amp or something it
really was quite tiny and of course it
wasn't enough energy to actually start
charging his phone but there was another
charger that he had that looked
identical to that one but when you read
the label you saw it had a great
different output so it's always
important to check what's on the label
of your charger because they're not all
the same one good thing is though is if
you charge if you put in a phone into a
charge of it's too big for it if it's
like a 2 amp one but you're throwing
needs one hand for example it doesn't
matter it won't blow it up the phonee
draw from the charger what it actually
needs but conversely if you stick a
bigger charge it won't
any quicker the phone is the thing that
draws the current from the charger the
phone is a thing that asks for the
current so that it can charge up its
battery so you're pretty much safe to
plug in just about any charge in fact
I've even plugged in the quick charger
charges into a normal phone that doesn't
have a quick charging and it works
absolutely fine
and I've tried quick charges on Samsung
products and Samsung charges on quick
charge approach and they all work fine
they're all basically interchange
because the last thing these companies
want is a story of someone plugging in
their phone and blowing it up because
they use their charge on it so it's all
going to be okay so back to the Anur
technology the thing about it is is now
the phone and the charger can negotiate
with each other and the phone is able to
ask for anything from 3.2 volt upwards
to 20 volt in increments of 200
milliamps okay so that means it has fine
control over what is able to be drawn
from the charger which means that we
less heat going to the phone less heat
means that we less heat dissipated
because your bachelor won't heat up so
much and of course it saves your
electricity bill in fact Qualcomm are
saying that this particular new
technology is 38% more efficient than a
court quick charge 2.0 now one thing to
note is that you're going to need a
really good USB cable for this a cheap
USB cable isn't going to hack if you
start if your phones are starting to
draw 12 volts even 20 volts of current
down them you're going to need a proper
USB cable and probably the one just
supplied with your phone be good enough
but if you ever do buy a replacement
make sure you buy a quality one because
that's going to be an issue of course
this is all in the future there are a
couple of companies that were already
released quick charge 3.0 charges though
they're a bit worthless at the moment
cuz there are no phones that are able to
use it however in 2016 maybe even in
early 2016 we might start to see some
phones that appear with quick charge 3.0
technology built into them well my name
is Gary Sims from Android authority I
hope you enjoyed this video if you did
please do give it a thumbs up also
please use the links above to subscribe
to androids youtube channel also hit
you'll find links to our social media
and my social media links also please
use the comments below to tell me what
you think about quick-charge 3.0
technology
and if you want you can gripe in general
about batteries and battery life that's
absolutely fine and as for me I'll see
you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
