and we recently reviewed the HTC 10 so
if you haven't seen that make sure to go
check it out it'll either be linked in
the description below or in a card in
the upper right corner of this video
there's only so much that can be covered
in a review so today I wanted to take a
closer look at the new HTC Sense
interface for the HTC 10 and go over
what's different about it from previous
versions what has been improved and sort
of give you my thoughts on the latest
version of sense so one of the biggest
and longest running problems most OEM
skins is how bloated and heavy they feel
this year major manufacturers like LG
and Samsung have made pretty good
strides at slimming down their
interfaces but here in 2016 I don't
think anyone has done a better job with
that than HTC HTC Sense has always been
one of the more attractive looking
interfaces with a very mature look but
over the years it became a very heavy
and intrusive skin what the HTC 10 sent
still feels like sense but it also feels
a lot like stock Android and this is
probably the closest you'll ever see HTC
get to stock Android without actually
being stocked Android it's a much
cleaner and leaner version of the
interface and areas that HTC used to
tamper with like the notification shade
settings menu and recent apps those have
all been left alone and kept purely the
way that Google designed them HTC made a
pretty big focus on reducing a lot of
the unnecessary blow so one thing that
you'll notice is that HTC doesn't
bombard you with a bunch of widgets
anymore there's still a few most of them
are just clocks including the old-school
iconic HTC clock but otherwise that's
really it as far as the widgets go HTC
also worked closely with Google to
remove a lot of the duplicative apps so
instead of having two apps that do the
same thing you now just have Google's
photos google play music and Google's
calendar without the HTC alternatives
now just in case you're wondering even
though the new HTC Sense feels a lot
more like stock Android there's still no
Android Easter egg in the settings menu
not a big deal but I figured I'd throw
that out there for those of you who were
curious one of the most iconic features
of HTC Sense since the one m7
has been blinkfeed and just like
everything else in this new version of
sense it's a lot cleaner and much more
streamlined it's got a darker gray color
scheme over the blue from previous
versions and it's a lot nicer to look at
with HTC's new font and wider separation
between the blocks HTC was one of the
first companies to start the whole left
homescreen trend and out of all the
companies out there that have done
something similar blinkfeed is still one
of the better implementations out there
it's fast fluid and will only show you
things that you want to see like your
calendar Twitter mealtime
recommendations and tons of other
content such as sports tech news
politics and entertainment from hundreds
and hundreds of other publications now
if you don't like blink feed or it's not
your cup of tea you do still have the
option to disable it if you want one of
my favorite things about HTC Sense is
the built in theme engine which lets you
easily customize the look and feel of
the interface there's tons and tons of
themes to pick from in a variety of
different categories and the cool thing
about themes on sense is that you can
mix and match the wallpapers icons
sounds and fonts from any of the
available themes or even create your own
based on the wallpaper that you pick new
to the themes engine is what HTC likes
to call the free style themes and these
themes basically ignore any sort of
specific grid size allowing to have some
very unique looking beams like this
Mario one for example and you can freely
move things around and place the apps
and widgets anywhere you want it sort of
reminds me of what third-party apps like
super and you CCW allow you to do so I
definitely like these free style themes
a lot they're pretty cool and a lot of
fun to play with also new to this
version of sense is the be mobile
keyboard and that's because the new
Sense keyboard is actually powered by
touch Pal a very popular third-party
keyboard with hundreds and hundreds of
themes so you can make it look like it's
glowing with these neon colored themes
or more like stock Android or however
you really want to make it look it is
purely up to you and despite how light
this version of Sense is I really like
that HTC gives you a lot of flexibility
with customization HTC has also given
users the ability to calibrate the
display with the HTC 10 it's not the
most robust thing in the world but you
do have the
to pick between a vivid mode which is
the default setting and a standard RGB
mode that gives off a much flattered
color profile and you can also adjust
how cool or warm you want the display to
appear based on your personal preference
like everything else in this version of
sense the camera software also got a
pretty major facelift it's a lot cleaner
more intuitive and easy to use all of
your camera settings and modes are
stored in a simple slide-out panel on
the left side of the screen which makes
everything very quick and easy to get to
there's also a new pro mode that gives
you dis alar like manual controls and
it's pretty easy to make adjustments to
the camera settings but the layout can
clutter up the viewfinder when you're
trying to adjust multiple things at once
that's really a pretty minor complaint
but aside from that I really love the
improvements they've made to the camera
software so what do you guys think about
sense on the HTC 10 personally I think
it's very clean and intuitive HTC has
done a really nice job with reducing the
amount of bloat while still giving you a
lot of really nice and useful features
on top of Android but that really does
it for this video guys hopefully you
