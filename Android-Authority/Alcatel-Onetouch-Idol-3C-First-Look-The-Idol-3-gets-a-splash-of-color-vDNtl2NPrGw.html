authority and I'm coming to you from
Aoife 2015 and we're hanging out at the
Alcatel OneTouch booth taking a look at
the idol 3c and this is actually the
same exact phone as the regular idol 3
but the biggest difference now what the
design is the back is actually removable
and you can swap these out with a
variety of different colors so as you
can see I have the yellow one here but
you can get this in a bunch of other
colors like pink green white orange a
ton of different choices they're gonna
be able to pick from with the idol 3c
but it has the same beautiful design
isn't for with the front-facing speakers
on the top and the bottom and it's still
reversible just like before and just to
recap many of the specs again here you
have a 5.5 inch full HD display on the
front so it was 1920 by 1080 it's being
powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 615
octa-core CPU it's running Android 5.0
5.0 lollipop it's got a 29 10 milliamp
hour battery and on the back you're
looking at a 13 megapixel camera F 2.0
lens and of course you have your 5
megapixel front facing shooter for all
your selfies and your video chats
it is LTE capable so all the same great
stuff that you had on the original Idol
3 the same clean almost stock like
interface here everything that you would
expect from the original Idol 3 is on
the idol 3c and you can see it's very
snappy and fluid just like you would
expect because of the mostly stock like
interface but it does have a few Alcatel
tweaks as you can see from the icons and
be paying the OneTouch stream that's
over on the left side here but as far as
pricing and availability goes you're
looking this year so before the end of
this year they didn't give us any sort
of exact details and you're looking at
around 300 euros
so it's going to be you know same great
price same great form factor but again
the biggest difference is the colored
back so you have a lot more
customization with the idol 3 now
because of this particular feature but
we just wanted to bring you a quick look
of the different colors that you're
going to get with this phone but this
has been a look at the idol 3c thank you
so much for watching we definitely have
a lot more to come from Aoife 2015 so
stay tuned for the rest of our coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
