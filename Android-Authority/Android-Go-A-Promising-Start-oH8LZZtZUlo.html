quality experience to affordable
entry-level devices with Android Go made
a pretty big splash here at MWC 2018
while the high profile devices from
companies like Samsung typically steal
all the attention at Mobile World
Congress it's important to pay attention
to emerging markets especially when
Google believes its next billion users
will come from countries like India
Android go is a super lightweight
version of Android that's optimized for
phones with lower specs and a gigabyte
of RAM or less so none of these phones
are really going to blow you away in
terms of raw numbers but that isn't the
point Google has created less intensive
versions of many of their apps to ensure
that the performance is smooth on this
much more mundane hardware and for the
most part you're not losing out on much
with the go versions of their apps
there were several Android go devices
shown off here at MWC like the Alcatel
1x and although the hardware of Android
Go phones aren't necessarily eye
catching this one does come with an 18
by 9 display then there's the Nokia one
again another pretty uninspiring design
but it's a sub $100 smartphone and it's
hard to complain about anything at that
price there were many other Android Go
devices that made their presence here
such as the g m8 from general mobile
lava Z 50 and tempo go from ZTE but
we're expecting to see more Android Go
devices from other high-profile
companies such as Huawei the big drawing
point to Android Go devices will always
be their price some are sub $100 and
some will even cost less than $50 and
that's extremely impressive for phones
that are capable of offering a decent
experience simply through optimization
of software you're also getting the
latest version of Android out of the box
and the promise of timely updates that's
not something you can typically say
about smart phones in this price range
these phones aren't flashy but what they
are is practical and cost-effective and
for users in emerging markets those
qualities are more important google has
made a very strong presence here at MWC
2018 with Android go but we want to know
what you guys think about Android go so
