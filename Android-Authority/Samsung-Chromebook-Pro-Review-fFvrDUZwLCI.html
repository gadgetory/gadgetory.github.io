authority and the latest product from
Samsung comes in collaboration with
Google and is in the form of a
Chromebook or Chromebooks and this is
the very first Chromebook to be built
from the ground up with support for
Android apps and it also comes with a
built-in stylus that Google says makes
this Chromebook especially good for
multimedia and productivity purposes but
let's find out how good it actually is
this is the Samsung Chromebook pro we
saw quite a few Chromebooks back at CES
2017 but Samsung Chromebooks definitely
were some of the most appealing ones at
the show and are going to be some of the
more high-end Chromebooks you'll be able
to get your hands on this year this is
the Chromebook pro but there's also a
plus version and functionally and
aesthetically they're exactly the same
but with the plus model you get an ARM
processor while the pro version here
comes with a more powerful Intel Core m3
processor on the outside it's got an
all-metal build that gives the
Chromebook pro a very high quality feel
on top of its metal design it's
extremely lightweight at just under two
and a half pounds and it's also not very
thick at only thirteen point nine
millimeters so it's very thin very
lightweight and compact in size and can
easily fit in a backpack or a messenger
bag without weighing you down if you
really want to it's also pretty
comfortable to just carry around in your
hands so affordability is easily one of
the best things about the Chromebook pro
obviously with this compact size it's
not going to have the largest keyboard
or trackpad but I think Samsung did a
pretty decent job given the size
limitation the keyboard is still
spacious enough to comfortably type on
and they're chiclet style keys with a
fair amount of travel and if you look
closely all the keys have a slight curve
that makes them contour better to your
fingers the trackpad itself works well
for the most part and I didn't have any
issues with the size of it but I do wish
that I had to pinch to zoom
functionality and the feedback on it
could be better as it doesn't really
give you that satisfying click when you
press down on it but the trackpad does
support light tap if you'd rather use
that instead of physically clicking the
trackpad the biggest Achilles heel to
the Chromebook pro is the speakers
you'll find two speaker grille sitting
on the bottom side towards the corners
and aside from being in a position where
they can easily be muffled from sitting
on a table desk or even your own lap
they simply don't get very loud and be
tough to hear in a room with
any sort of ambient noise given how thin
and light the Chromebook Pro is it still
comes with a decent amount of pores on
the left side you have a three and a
half millimeter headphone and mic jack a
USB type-c port and a micro SD card slot
on the right side you've got the power
button a volume rocker and a second USB
type-c port both of which work for
charging and data transfer but you can
also use these ports the output 4k
content to an external monitor or TV I
like that there's the USB type-c port on
both the left and the right side so you
can pick whichever side is more
convenient for charging based on the
positioning of your wall outlet
especially if you're trying to use it
while it's charging on the right side
you also get something that you don't
normally see on a Chromebook and that is
the inclusion of a stylus the stylus
looks exactly like the s-pen for
Samsung's Galaxy Note line it's the same
size same top that clicks in and out and
the only difference that you'll find is
that it doesn't have a button on the
side the included spouse brings quite a
bit of functionality to the Chromebook
some of which is very similar to what we
saw on samsung's note 7 before it
disappeared you can use it to capture a
specific portion of the screen take a
screen grab use it as a magnifying glass
and it also functions as a laser pointer
which lets you move and point the stylus
all around the screen without
interacting with any of the content you
can also of course draw or write notes
with the stylus and it has direct
integration with Google key there's
built-in optical character recognition
so anytime you write a note you can turn
that handwritten note into regular text
or conduct a search for any notes you've
previously written being able to convert
handwritten notes into text is a
convenient feature but it can be pretty
buggy with the text recognition
sometimes it gets to conversion a
hundred percent correct but more often
than not it either doesn't recognize the
text at all no matter how clearly you
write or it only converts part of what
you wrote something that many people are
going to wonder is if the stylus
actually adds any real value to the
chromebook pro and although the majority
of my usage with the stylus has
consisted of just using it as a
surrogate finger I do think that a
stylus makes more sense on this type of
device than it does on a phone on those
few occasions where I did need to jot
something down I could comfortably write
on the screen and rest my palm on it
without worrying about blocking what I
was trying to write due to having more
screen real estate to work with the
screen on the Chromebook pro is an LED
panel at
point three inches with a resolution of
2400 by 1600 which makes it a quad HD
screen but if you're wondering why the
resolution sounds a little bit off is
because it has an aspect ratio of three
by two giving you more vertical space to
work with which is great when you're
reading web articles and it also gives
you a wider screen when using it in
portrait it's a rich and vibrant screen
with great colors extremely wide viewing
angles and gets bright enough that you
still comfortably see it if you happen
to use it outside the coolest part about
the display is they can rotate it 360
degrees on its hinge allowing a proper
Chromebook in a tenth position
that's great for watching YouTube movies
or Netflix or you can take full
advantage of the touch screen and fold
it over completely to use it as a tablet
alongside the Intel Core m3 processor
the Chromebook pro also comes with 4
gigabytes of RAM and 32 gigs of internal
storage and performance is very smooth
with operations within Chrome OS itself
even with a lot of tabs opened it never
showed any signs of getting slow or
laggy where it starts to get Harry is
with Android apps but this is more
likely an issue with Android apps at the
moment and not necessarily be Hardware
powering the Chromebook although the
Chromebook pro or plus are the first
Chromebooks to run Android apps out of
the box it's still in beta which means
the experience isn't going to be
flawless while social media apps like
Facebook and Twitter do work the
experience especially what scrolling can
be choppy and there are many apps
particularly games that fail to even
load the ones that do load currently
don't run all that smoothly especially
if they more graphically intensive game
and many apps tend to have issues with
properly rotating between landscape and
portrait when trying to use the
Chromebook as a tablet unlike a phone or
tablet whereas can take up the entire
screen I do like that a good majority of
Android apps on Chrome OS can be ran in
a minimized or smaller window for easier
multitasking between applications and
allow the Chromebooks still feel like a
computer as it's meant to be instead of
just a tablet with a keyboard attached
Android apps on Chrome OS has a lot of
promise and due to having access to
everything on Google Play I love the
extra functionality that it brings both
in terms of multimedia and productivity
but until it's out of beta and all these
bugs are ironed out it's not going to be
the showcase that Google or Samsung
wanted to be sampling quotes the battery
life of the Chromebook pro at 8 hours
but I would say it ranges anywhere
between 8 to 10 hours because the
Chromebook pro did very well in getting
me comfortably through a full workday
with the exception of editing photos or
videos this pretty much became my
primary work machine and that typically
consists of checking and responding to
emails communicating with my colleagues
on plaque and writing down notes or
scripts on Google Docs and on top of all
that I'm doing the typical stuff like
watching YouTube videos and checking
social media apps like Facebook Twitter
and Instagram pretty regularly
throughout the day and I only had to
charge the Chromebook Pro once a night
and it was always good to go for the
entire day that's a huge shift from my
MacBook Pro which is my normal work
machine and I typically have to charge
that two to four times a day it just
sort of depends on what I'm doing so if
your usage is anything less than mine
you might be able to stretch the battery
life out a little bit further with a few
extra hours into the following day
before having to plug it back in the
Chromebook pro won't be available till
sometime later this year but if you
can't wait for the pro version the plus
model will be available starting this
month for $449 the price of the pro
version is still unknown but it's safe
to say that it's going to cost more so
these Chromebooks are certainly in the
upper tier at least in terms of price
they do however offer a lot for that
price you're getting a simplicity of
Chrome OS but with an included stylus a
rotating touchscreen and access to all
of Google Play the Chromebook pro can be
the simple machine when you want it to
be or become a more than capable
multimedia flash productivity workhorse
and that's really the beauty of this
collaboration between Samsung and Google
