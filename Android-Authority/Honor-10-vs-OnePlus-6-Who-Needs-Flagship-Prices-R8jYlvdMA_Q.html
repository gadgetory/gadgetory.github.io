similar space in the smartphone market
these are both affordable devices with
flagship esque specs you're looking at
performance dual lens cameras top-end
chipsets and tons of neat features but
there can only be one so who shall rise
victorious one shall stand in terms of
the design both devices look pretty
similar at first glance and the first
thing that's like to hit you in both
cases is that these devices are pretty
much all screen with 19 by 9 aspect
ratios and big old notches at the top
now if there's one thing I've learned
working at Andrew Authority is - every
one of the knotch
without exception it's like obviously
this is a divisive feature but the good
news is that you can eliminate that
notch in both cases so you can have your
cake and eat it too the one plus 6 has a
slightly bigger screen at six point two
eight inches versus five point eight
four inches but both are pretty generous
in that regard overall though I'd say
the one plus six is the winner for sure
for two reasons a it's an AMOLED display
giving it deeper blacks and punch your
colors and B it's covered in Gorilla
Glass 5 the honor 10 doesn't specify
what type of glass it uses but it feels
a lot softer and seems more prone to
chips and scratches in my time with it
so far it's also a bit dimmer and not
quite as crisp although it's still a
nice screen both sport Full HD plus
resolutions it's also worth noting that
the honor 10 has more of a chin on it
owing to the decision to place the
fingerprint sensor around the front
I've heard some commenters point out
already this seemingly contradicts the
choice of a notch design the oneplus 6
meanwhile keeps its sensor around the
back which is arguably the smarter
decision that said the honor 10 does
boast an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor
that claims to be faster and operate
better even with wet fingers and the
honor 10 sports at dazzling Aurora glass
rear panel made from 15 layers of glass
is quite a bold statement and shimmers
in all kinds of different colors
depending on the angle of the light
hitting it it won't be for everyone some
people might find it a bit ostentatious
but it certainly sets the honorton apart
of something different that said the one
plus six is no slouch in the looks
department either it's also made
completely from glass with each color
utilizing a different material
and overall a very premium effect it
generally feels a bit weightier and
heavier in the hand as compared with the
honor 10 but do keep in mind that one
plus six is slightly more expensive than
the honor ten so it's only fitting that
it should have a slightly more premium
build quality
neither device is IB certified but they
do both support headphone jacks
as for the specifications both of these
devices are running top-tier chipsets
which is fantastic news at this
mid-range price point the honor 10 has
the ki-rin 970 while the oneplus 6 uses
the snapdragon 845 both of the latest
offerings from their respective
manufacturers but the ki-rin 970 has
been around a little bit longer and it
shows in the benchmarks the eight four
five and therefore the one plus six is
the superior performer when it comes to
gaming and general smooth operation the
970 is all about that NPU though and
this is what allows the on a 10 to boast
a number of advanced AI features mostly
involving the camera and memory
management either way it should be safe
to say you'll be very well served by
either of these options in the
horsepower department the oneplus 6 does
have a slight edge in the RAM Department
though with the option between 6
gigabytes or even 8 2 gigabytes plus
it's just for through the honor 10 both
come with 128 gigabytes of storage and
again you can bump that up even further
two two five six on the op6
but you won't be able to expand either
via an SD card one plus six might also
be a little bit snappier thanks to its
near stock version of Android with
oxygen OS it's not quite stock but it's
certainly a lot less bloated than the
EMU I ate on the honor 10 and a lot of
people don't like any way I count myself
among them fortunately though the
stylistic choices can at least be
eliminated with a new launcher and a few
other customizations so this won't be a
deal-breaker for most people this is a
matter of opinion though but I do think
most people are going to prefer the
software experience on the 1 plus 6 both
devices are very similar in terms of
battery the 1 plus clocks in at 3300
milliamp hours while the owner 10
squeezes in just a tiny bit more juice
with a three thousand four hundred
million power they both have fast
charging but neither has wireless
support finally the cameras here we have
a dual and setup in both cases you get
an iPhone like vertical array on the
oneplus and a more original
to lay out for the honor in terms of the
specs the one plus six is main camera is
16 megapixels with a nice wide aperture
of f17 and it also features both E is
and OIS and that's backed up by a
secondary 20 megapixel sensor it can do
super slo-mo and record videos up to 4k
at 60fps like nearly every other
smartphone camera these days it can also
do portrait mode effects you're on a 10
meanwhile comes with a 24 megapixel rear
camera backed up by another 16 megapixel
lens so it winds on the megapixel front
although it has a slightly narrower
aperture at F 1.8 it's also a shame that
this doesn't have any optical
stabilization it does feature some
impressive AI photography tricks though
which allows it to do things like
recognizing flowers or food in shots in
order to adjust the settings for the
best effects your mileage may vary in
terms of how beneficial this is for you
however what honor also brings to the
table though and what's often overlooked
is a smorgasbord of cool options and
features in the camera app including my
favorite long exposure mode for like
painting and star tracking these go
beyond just gimmicks and they're
actually really nice features to have oh
and of course there's portrait mode
ultimately which of these is the better
camera might welcome down to your
priorities and your personal preference
both do a great job either way and
especially for the price point on both
phones also have decent front-facing
cameras to the 1 plus 6 sports a very
respectable 16 megapixel shooter or the
honor 10 has an even more impressive 24
megapixels so to wrap up what we're
looking at here well first of all we're
looking at two incredible phones for the
asking price spoilers for my honor 10
review by the way when I reviewed the
Nokia 7 plus I thought that was crazy
good value then came me on a 10 with its
near flagship looks and performance and
now the 1 plus 6 the bottom line Samsung
Google and Apple are gonna have to work
extra hard next year to justify their
super high price points or introduce
some serious new innovation both of
these are fantastic phones and a strong
argument could be made for either it
will largely come down to personal
preference and which features matter
most to you for example I love the light
painting and star tracking mode on the
honor phones so much that would almost
be enough to clinch it for me but I'm
probably alone in that and do remember
that this isn't a completely fair
comparison
the one
six is a little more expensive than the
under ten of course declaring an
absolute winner in a vs video like this
is folly not only is the entire thing a
matter of subjective opinion but it's
also a surefire way to get a huge number
of dislikes on a video lots of comments
saying that we're biased and all that
but with that said the one plus six is
the winner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
