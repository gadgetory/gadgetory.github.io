brought to you by domain.com I once
heard mobile apps described as the
suburbs of the internet because mother
Google and daddy Apple have a
stranglehold on what we can see and use
but what if you could enjoy a great user
experience on any device online or
offline and not have to trust a virus
Laden suspicious look an app store you
know what that is
now what I'm talking about here is
native mobile apps versus html5 web apps
and let's start with definitions a
native app for the purposes of today's
show refers to an application built
completely using technologies native to
a particular operating system this could
be Android iOS Windows or Blackberry for
Android native apps are typically built
using Java while for iOS a native app
can be built using objective-c or more
recently Swift so the vast majority of
apps that you use on your phone are from
the Google Play Store hence they are
native mobile apps an html5 app on the
other hand refers to a mobile app built
completely using HTML CSS and JavaScript
only html5 apps are web apps and they
must be run using the underlying OS
browser note that html5 supports offline
data as well as rich media such as audio
and video a well-written html5 app can
be used even when the device is offline
or at very least show an error message
now I know what you're thinking you're
thinking Jase why should I care
well Google and Apple have near complete
control over what you and I can do and
consume on our own devices forget the
social and economic implications and
let's just talk about the stranglehold
or bottleneck on technical innovation
when it comes to mobile apps that should
be a concern for you because Google and
Apple decide which app is distributed
and which app isn't that's concerning
now an html5 app free of any App Store
is more of a meritocracy but let's talk
about some of the practical issues pros
and cons here we go first let's talk
portability html5 apps are portable
across different os's and device types
an html5 app written with responsive
design methods would also scale
appropriately depending on the size of
the device it is currently being viewed
on when an update is required this
single app is updated and tested and is
available for all devices you need
Italy ah now see all of you waiting for
your more recent Android update should
be gushing at that now native apps by
definition are unique to each operating
system and so to support multiple os's a
separate app must be written for each OS
when an update is required each app must
be updated independently and tested
independently Android apps do not modify
the layout to match the size of the
device automatically however during
development different layouts can be
specified for different screen sizes and
orientations this usually results in
layouts that are more aesthetically
pleasing compared to an automatic
responsive design on an html5 app now
the winner here is html5 now let's talk
cheddar and the costs of development
html5 apps are generally cheaper to
develop and maintain than native apps
since just the single app is required
for multiple OS support this single app
can be developed by a single web
developer however native apps for all
major os's would typically require a
specialized developer for each OS Java
for Android Objective C and Swift for OS
c-sharp for Windows which would
significantly be more expensive than a
single web developer now the winner here
is html5 now you speed hogs are
wondering yeah but what about speed and
efficiency native apps are almost always
more efficient and faster than html5
apps
despite the strides made in increasing
the speed of JavaScript interpreters and
html5 app cannot execute at the same
speed as a native app of similar
functionality Apple's App Store can
reject apps for being too slow or not
feeling native enough which is more
likely to occur with an html5 app than a
fully native app and the winner here is
clearly native now what about hardware
native apps can interact with a wide
range of the hardware available on a
device including location camera
accelerometer speakers screen and more
html5 apps do not have the same ability
to interact with the hardware which can
be a major deal-breaker depending on the
desired functionality of the app here
the winner is clearly native but what if
you could fuse the two into a hybrid
that'd be a beast
hybrid apps are built using a language
framework and are then wrapped with
native specific code for each desired
mobile OS for example you build an app
using html5 CSS and JavaScript and then
generate a wrapper around the app for
Android iOS and Windows devices the
final product is to all intents and
purposes a native app for each platform
however they share a single codebase now
that sounds pretty cool right in most
cases you can take your codebase and
port it to multiple platforms pretty
fascinating stuff however you still are
under the yoke of Google and Apple hmm
now the obvious thing to be said here is
that if you are planning to make a
graphic intensive game or app of some
sort you absolutely want to go with a
native app html5 is just not fast enough
to support that kind of intensive gaming
so why talk about this at all well this
is going to have a pretty profound
effect on how you consume and we produce
media for decades broadcast media had
the infrastructure to make hundreds of
billions of dollars off their sinead
work shows now there's no infrastructure
we're figuring it out
how is it going to work in a way that's
good for both you the viewer or reader
and us the publisher so let's talk about
it in the comments below how best do you
think we can make money or how best will
new media make money in the future we'd
love to hear your feedback I'll be
reading them in the comments below so a
quick update on my brother and Android
Hindi you see Joe didn't actually know
that I used our own coupon code Android
to buy the domain name don't be cute he
threw fruit comm because I have faith
that when you take a dot-com and the
Android army both magic can happen why
because no domain name extension tells
your story with the same level of trust
as a.com or.net domain name dot-com and
dotnet domain name extensions and Jack
credibility into your online presence
and who doesn't want more credibility
you can save 15% on domain name and web
hosting when you use our coupon code

don't forget 15% off when you use our
coupon code
Android when you think domain names
think domain.com thanks for watching
android army my name is Jace I'd love to
connect with you right here on Google+
or Twitter and I'll be following you in
the comments below you don't want to
forget about my brothers nandroid all
