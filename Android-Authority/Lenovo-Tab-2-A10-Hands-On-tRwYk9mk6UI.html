Android authority and we are hanging out
with Lenovo at Mobile World Congress
2015 taking a look at their latest
tablets this is the tab to a10 and it's
a very simple very minimalist tablet and
it's a 10-inch tablet as the name
suggests so what you're looking at is a
10.1 inch display on the front here with
1920 by 1200 resolution and it's also an
IPS panel so it has some really great
viewing angles great colors as well but
just to recap some of these specs really
quickly you're looking at a media tech
64-bit 1.5 gigahertz quad-core processor
8 megapixel camera on the rear with a 5
megapixel camera on the front 2
gigabytes of RAM and 16 gigabytes of
internal storage expandable up to an
additional 64 gigabytes via a microSD
inside is also a 7,000 milliamp hour
battery which is good to up to 10 hours
and right now it currently runs on
Android 4.4 KitKat but it will be
upgraded to Android 5.0 lollipop in June
there's also going to be a 4G LTE model
available and you're looking at a price
of one $99.99 and it will be available
starting in the month of April but one
of the biggest drawing points of this
tablet here is the speakers so it's a
multi speaker setup with Dolby Atmos so
you're going to get that Dolby Atmos
sound audio experience and basically the
speakers do a really awesome job of
creating that sort of surround sound and
immersing you in the experience and you
sort of hear it all around you like
you're actually in that particular
environment so it does a really great
job with these speakers themselves and
you'll also get that same effect through
listening to headphones so you're going
to get even better audio quality out of
this particular tablet so that's
basically the biggest drawing point of
this tablet and it actually works quite
well from what we've heard here today
just by hanging out with Lenovo and
watching the demonstration it actually
works really well but other than that
this has just been a quick first look
the tab to a10 stay tuned for the rest
of our coverage here at Mobile World
Congress 2015 there's definitely a lot
more to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
