brought to you by domain.com Oh imagine
the mischief you could get in if you own
the domain name even temporarily of
google.com well that actually happened
just last week former Google employee
San May Fed bought google.com for twelve
bucks on September 29th 2015 he owned
the domain name for a while before
somebody somewhere realized this
probably wasn't a good thing and revoked
feds backstage access ved said that he
was up late browsing Google domains
which is Google's web site buying
service while there he saw that
google.com was available for purchase at
the incredible reasonable price of $12
and for those of you don't know the
obvious this domain name is the most
heavily trafficked domain name on the
planet bed then added google.com to his
shopping cart completed the checkout
process and for all intents and purposes
became the proud new owner of the
Internet as we know it rather than
getting the usual email notifying him
that he had completed his purchase feds
Google search console dashboard was
updated and he began receiving messages
intended for the google.com domain owner
he also began receiving emails with
internal information which vet said he
later turned over to Google's security
team the scary part was that I had
access to the webmaster controls for a
minute said vet beds tenure as god of
the internet was fleeting however Google
domains reversed the sale soon after the
purchase went through and sent him a
message that claims someone had
registered the site before he could that
was were front of the twelve dollars for
the domain name cost and he went back to
being a mortal however for a moment ved
flew now the painfully obvious question
is how did this happen from a technical
perspective and we don't exactly know
but I gotta say it you know it's coming
that is the power of a.com because no
domain name extension tells your story
with the same level of trust as a.com
or.net domain name
dot-com and dotnet domain name
extensions and Jack credibility into
your online presence and who doesn't
