be said that HTC has seen a bit of a
rough patch after a couple of releases
of their flagship line that fell just
short of taking on the competition the
10th tribe might hopefully be the charm
is it truly the HTC phone we've been
waiting for
while it's Josh with regard from Android
authority what's going on everybody and
this is the HTC ten now before we get
into the full review of the HTC 10 why
don't we go ahead and get through all of
the specifications first
the all-metal construction that HTC has
been known for returned with some
refinements and additions to the overall
design at its thickest portion the HTC
ten is about nine millimeters which
makes it just a little bit thicker than
the competition and it is also a little
taller and wider than other flagship
devices when looking at the front of the
device it almost reminds us of a Moto X
2014 edition but really this isn't a bad
thing it's just that there is a
noticeable bezel around the 5.2 inch
display as we focus on the front you
will notice that there is the absence of
both boomsound speaker setups and the
HTC bar that used to be on the lower
third of many HTC phones now boom sound
is still around but it consists of a top
speaker and a subwoofer that backs it up
that is now found at the bottom near the
USBC port the main change HTC made
appears on the backing where the same
great metal material remains the
companies calling card but imagine this
for a second the HTC One m8 except now
you add an extra little bit around all
sides this is basically what HTC did and
it is the chamfered edge that provides a
silhouette type of look these new
chamfers all around add a bit more and
also add a curve to the device and this
means that the phone sits along the
contour of the hand helping with the
handling but as we already mentioned
before it is just that little bit wider
and taller than maybe it needed to be
and speaking of handling we will mention
that this phone is pretty damn slippery
this isn't anything new with you've used
HTC One devices before but to be fair it
was a bit of a nuisance ultimately HTC
proves in the 10 that it is still
capable of making an attractive phone
and for fans of previous HTC devices
some of our distinguished those phones
from others has been removed like the
busan front-facing speakers or even the
HTC black bar but these updates and
additions are just different enough to
please anyone that wanted a different
looking device from the past as we've
already mentioned before the display is
5.2 inches in size but now comes in a
quad HD resolution this is a Super LCD 5
display that performs quite well with
good brightness even in very bright
situations and good amounts of
saturation to keep the colors looking
nice now this won't be as vivid as an
AMOLED display but HTC has made sure
that this display adheres to the NTSC
standard and have done well to note that
overall however text
it's very sharp due to the high pixel
density and games like Kingdom Hearts
Unchained X or Final Fantasy 9 have all
been a blast to play and much like other
flagships coming out this year the HTC
ten comes with the expected high power
package the Snapdragon 820 backed by the
adrenal 530 and four gigabytes of RAM
now we just mentioned gaming and it has
been a smooth experience and good
performance has been the case across the
board
HTC did mention that they wanted to have
the touch latency be as low as possible
simply to add to the snappy experience
but probably more important to notice
how HTC streamlined to their software
instead of having multiple versions of
the same application since now just
keeps the company's own version or
sticks to Google's iteration and this
consolidation does help overall with how
the software feels even without the
claims that HTC makes about how they
made the software and performance
experiences better it is pretty clear
that the HTC 10 is a good phone to have
as a daily driver and proves very
reliable thus far which then brings us
to hardware which there is quite a bit
more to talk about we'll start off with
the fingerprint reader found in the
capacitive home button now this one is a
lot like the HTC One a9 s fingerprint
reader from a while back and it can
sense the fingerprint when in standby
and unlock straight to the home screens
it is easy to set up but just like in
the a9 it poses a little bit of a
conundrum the motion gesture sensors are
still a thing in the HTC 10 where the
phone knows that it's been brought up by
the hand and then will react to a number
of different commands the newest of
these is a double swipe downward in
order to open up the camera which is
nice but when you have to use your
fingerprint to unlock the device even
when swiping in any of those other
directions it just feels like these two
features are a little bit disjointed
once opened up and unlocked to the phone
pretty much has everything you would
expect including NFC and call quality
has been very good thus far
using that full speaker up top as the
phone grill has been useful for example
but of course you can go to speakerphone
and take advantage of the boom sound
setup the only real thing missing here
is an IR blaster which we know some of
you guys really enjoy on the smartphone
but HTC did mention that it's not a
widely used feature anymore
audio remains one of the cornerstones of
the HTC experience and boom sound is
still here even though it's been changed
a bit now the top phone speaker is
backed by
a bottom mounted subwoofer unit that
helps provide richer lower tones it's
not going to be as loud as typical
front-facing stereo speakers even from
previous HTC devices but we will admit
that the sound stage has been improved
because of a better lower end just don't
expect to be easily sharing the sound
with everyone around you but plug in a
good pair of headphones and that's where
the magic really begins a good pair of
cans or even the bundled high-res earbud
headphones will make you hear the
difference that the 10 really makes HTC
put a 24-bit DAC or DAC and a headphone
amp in here to really make the boom
sound go well boom this is also due in
part to the dolby enhancements which
come in the form of user controllable
audio profiles in which a number of
questions might be asked of you in order
for it to figure out what best listening
profile to give you you can also change
the equalizer bit by bit if you so wish
to but ultimately it really amps up the
sound while providing a much more wider
soundstage depending on what you answer
to those questions the bottom line is
that the HTC 10 has a lot of power to
drive headphones and it's very fun to
get lost in the sound especially with
good headphones like audio Technica's
there's no need for a separate DAC or
amp anymore but overall listening in
headphones results in some of the
loudest yet best audio that we've ever
gotten from a smart phone which brings
us to the battery life which depends on
a three thousand milliamp hour unit in
our testing with up to 13 full hours in
our days the phone has been able to
stretch out to four and a half hours of
screen on time your mileage may vary of
course but with slightly more frugal
usage it should certainly be possible to
get a couple of days of longevity out of
the HTC 10 it also helps that the boost
plus application assists in a couple of
key ways for example it can scale down
games to full HD resolution so that the
game doesn't take up so much power but
couple all of that with the quick charge
3.0 capabilities and power should never
really be that far off
HTC does boast two days worth of battery
life from this phone and according to
their claims about half an hour on qc3
should provide one of those days a USBC
type port helps in this regard though it
is a standard that we haven't totally
gotten used to yet there have already
been a couple of times when the phone
hit the single digits and we forgot to
bring the right cord but now we can talk
about the cameras and HTC has had a
rough go
with it for the last couple of years
with their camera is falling short of
the competition this year however the
ultrapixel returns and reaches its
second generation much like a couple
other phones we've seen thus far this
year HTC prioritizes larger pixel sizes
over the sheer amount of them so you get
12 this time around at 1.5 5 micron
sizes an aperture of 1.8 further
bolsters the low-light capabilities as
does optical image stabilization the F
has been so much streamlined with a lot
of the different modes just all on the
side in one easy to slide over menu and
a number of the other controls are found
on the right side so you can use the
phone in one hand in auto mode so you
can get a shot off pretty quickly
the only real big hole in the usage of
the app is the pro manual mode which
overlays all of the settings over the
viewfinder covering the frame unless you
pick a setting and then put the slider
away other modes include slow motion
video capture panorama and a hyper lapse
feature the changes to a lower amount of
large pixels seem to do the job details
are captured very well in highly lit
shots and colors are accurately depicted
and most of these pictures the results
are plenty adequate and taken on their
own they do look quite great zoom into
any of these photos and you'll see the
noise appear but that is the nature of
having less detail due to the lower
megapixel count of course in lower light
situations this can be exacerbated where
the exposure might be more decent than
before but the details still suffer
further HTC also still has a big problem
with backlit subjects or just about any
blown out area of a scene and this is
something that even HDR can't fix in
most situations basically just expect to
have a lot of flares in situations like
these HDR though does do a pretty good
job as long as you're using it in a
situation where it's actually called for
and whether or not you are using HDR in
lower light situations the HTC software
will usually opt for a slower shutter
speed so you have to make sure to have
steady hands that are still required
even if the OAS is already helping out
but for what it's worth it the
consistent quality in most normal
situations makes this a worthy shooter
to have in the pocket you just have to
know what you're getting when you're
shooting indoors or at night but perhaps
the best Edition and the camera
experience is in the front-facing
shooter which is a 5 megapixel camera
that can also record high res audio when
you want to do selfie videos but this
time HTC is bringing a first to the
smartphone game
putting optical image stabilization in
the five megapixel front facing shooter
and while this might help with
self-portraits in some lower light
situations I personally found that its
main application is in improving videos
like vlogs stabilization is a great idea
for anyone who wants to make selfie
videos on social media or even use the
Full HD footage for longer form video
content this o is edition is a good move
by HTC as it is a distinguishing feature
compared to the 2k video capture of the
Samsung Galaxy s7 and the wide reaching
wide-angle lens of the LG g5 overall the
camera experience of the HTC 10 is the
best that HTC has put out in quite some
time it may not kill the other flagships
that we have seen thus far in 2016 but
it does certainly deserve to be
considered among those ranks and finally
in software we have Android marshmallow
with HTC Sense and before we get into it
yes there is an app drawer in this
version of Android so many of you
readers and viewers can rest easy sense
is about the same as it's always been
and due to some major changes Android
has been going through recently this can
actually be a very good thing home
screens might have a little bit too much
space between the apps and widgets but
it's still pretty clean and the app
drawer is a simple paginated vertical
scroll that is simplistic
yet functional blinkfeed is still around
and is one of our favorite built in
second homescreen experiences providing
a good glimpse at the headlines and more
if you want to dig deeper additions to
the software and include boost plus an
application that can among other things
find and clean out junk in the phone and
manage the RAM a favorite function of
ours is a toggle to make certain
high-performing games play at full HD
rather than quad HD resolution which
seems to help with the battery
consumption the other addition is in
themes which as robust as it is now
includes a freestyle layout that doesn't
adhere to grids the way typical Android
home screens do it is an interesting
concept that requires special icon or
image packs that are then tied to
different functions of the phone but
there's only one of these freestyle
themes currently available and it's
still a young feature that needs to be
further hashed out now aesthetic is
always a personal matter
but for most diehard Android enthusiasts
function is king and sense provides a
lot of it
the app drawer is a fan favorite that
already elevates this version of Android
and without any overly cartoonish
elements or flourishes since is a UI
simply no pun intended makes sense the
HTC 10 is available for pre-order now
and will be shipping in May unlocked
versions will go for six hundred and
ninety-nine dollars
now obviously the main competitors
include Samsung Galaxy s7 and LG g5
phones that we have already reviewed and
are available for comparison so stay
tuned for head-to-head verses videos
pitting these three phones against one
another and so there you have it the HTC
10 it really feels like this phone has
been a long time coming with the metal
construction returning once again with a
more refined look the HTC 10 actually
looks and feels like a proper flagship
phone and with all the bits and pieces
underneath that you would expect from a
flagship device the HTC 10 is worthy of
being called a true contender this year
the sound experience is so good this
time around improves that boom sound is
not only back but it is here to stay and
the camera which has been a stumbling
point for HTC in the past now rivals
that of the competition it might not
necessarily be the best camera out there
but we feel pretty comfortable
recommending it as a good daily shooter
for fans of HTC this might feel like a
dream come true but the true success of
the 10 is in the fact that HTC just
might have gotten your attention once
again keep it tuned to Android or t4
