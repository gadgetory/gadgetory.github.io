figured it out smaller form factors
aren't a fringe product but are in very
real demand however many versions of
flagships tend to lose some of what make
their bigger siblings appealing in the
first place well Sonya wanted to come
along and buck that trend with a compact
offering that literally just shrinks
down their best device is this the
excessively sized phone we've all been
waiting for
well let's find out because it's Josh
regard from Android Auto what's going on
everybody and this is the Sony Xperia z1
compact Sony quite literally took the
shrink ray to the Xperia z1 and brought
everything down to size the glass finish
with an aluminum frame takes the look
and very premium feel that only Sony
really puts out consistently and brings
it to a small easy to use and handle
form factor the button layout takes on
the now classic Sony motif as the big
silver power button the volume rocker
and the dedicated camera shutter button
are on the right side now one thing I
did want to mention in terms of the
button layout is just in regards to that
dedicated camera button it is really
small and really thin given that this is
a small device to begin with so when
you're trying to take pictures sometimes
pressing the button down easily in order
to snap your shot it's not as easy as
you would want it to be the opposite of
the phone has the microUSB charging port
the micro SD card slot and the SIM tray
covered with pieces of plastic signaling
the phone's IP certification for water
and dust resistance now of course the
main story here is the overall size of
the phone as you can see in my hand
right here it just fits very nicely in
my hand with a 4.3 inch screen that
actually does have a lot of Sony's
pretty much signature girth that goes
around the screen they do like their big
bezels but luckily with a 4.3 inch
screen it still makes this phone not too
small but also not big enough for it to
be difficult to handle at all as far as
the handling goes I have one
particularly great experience I can use
as an example and it had to do with
typing the already pretty great stock
Sony keyboard allows for easy swipe
typing but especially on the z1 compact
in one hand it works so well for this
smaller device that typing was really
just a breeze and with one
and you could get everything you needed
done and I was able to really type as
fast as I could
now as we mentioned the 4.3 inch display
brings 720p resolution to the z1 compact
with 342 pixels per inch
the colors are expectedly very good
coming from Sony as its x-reality engine
behind the triluminos tech makes this
look like a very tiny Sony TV with deep
blacks and very vibrant colors all
around however in the past this might
sound like technical talks surrounding a
screen that unfortunately had pretty
poor viewing angles when it comes to the
z1 compact though these have actually
been quite improved as you can see here
the viewing angles are actually a lot
better at certain angles you still get
that gray hue that goes over everything
but it's not at every angle like before
now such a small screen does pose a
couple of problems however as some
programs originally made for high
resolutions don't really translate as
well here but in all other instances
even the small stature can't keep this
screen from performing very well now
here is where the no compromises notion
really comes into play for the z1
compact Sony quite literally took the
high-powered processing package of the
z1 and was able to put it into the small
body of the compact the Snapdragon 800
clocked in at 2.2 gigahertz is backed by
the audrina 330 and two gigabytes of RAM
so performance is really no problem at
all for this little ball of lightning in
my hand and the very minimalistic Xperia
U I does somewhat help with the user
experience again I have a great
experience in terms of playing games on
this phone as an example I played
Riptide gp2 a lot on this phone and they
were all at the highest settings and
there was nary a hiccup as I crashed the
waves now much of what was offered in
the z1 is offered here as well 16
gigabytes of on-board storage is
bolstered by the always welcome addition
of a micro SD card slot now the speaker
on the bottom despite looking quite
meaty with that large grille
unfortunately still doesn't provide the
kind of full and rich sound we'd like to
hear and we feel like we should be able
to hear from some call quality from the
phone speaker on the other hand did come
through expectedly well and then
connectivity to t-mobile's 4G LTE
network brought very nice speedy and
reliable internet now battery life does
get a bit of a boost as this phone comes
with a 2300 milli amp hour unit
side that might sound a little bit
meager but a lot of power saving
features are found in the Xperia U I
that should be able to eke out as much
power as you need however from a day's
worth of work and play with somewhat
heavy usage I was still able to get that
solid day out of it so this phone should
still be able to go the distance for you
whether it is for work or for play and
finally I wanted to talk about the
accessories that come with the phone yes
that was a USB OTG cable that was in the
box but I had not used one in such a
long time that it really just sort of
flew over my head but it does beg the
question for me though I have only seen
a USB OTG cable included with this phone
and maybe one other offering in Sony's
camp with much larger offerings like the
z1 and the Xperia Z ultra out there it
makes me wonder why dual shot
connectivity was a thought for the
smallest in the bunch and not for the
larger ones in Sony's camp and the trend
continues with the z1 compact as it
comes with the same G lens 20.7
megapixel shooter that made a bit of a
splash with the original z1 as far as
the app goes much of the same
functionality remains including the
superior auto that does a good job of
getting the correct settings for your
shot and also all the add-ons for
further enhancements like augmented
reality so you can really have some fun
with your smartphone photography here
war as the z1 camera did have some
trouble with low-light shots and overall
the darkened portions of pretty much any
photo the processing seems to have been
improved in the z1 compact noise levels
remain quite high but at least those
darkened areas have a little more detail
and aren't nearly as smudgy aside from
the trouble of easily pressing the
dedicated camera button at times the
easy pocket ability of the entire phone
and the speedy performance of the app
itself makes this powerful shooter a
viable companion for all of your
photography needs and finally in
software there isn't too much to say
about the Xperia U I which I actually
would argue is probably the best part
about it the mostly stock like
experience of Sony's take on Android
keeps the homescreen simple the app
drawer is stacked with only the addition
of a quick pull over on the left for
some extra options and the notification
drop-down with a very simple power
widget
Sony's media apps remain pretty great as
General Apps ago with some favorites
like the Walkman and also the album
gallery include
and of course there are the small apps
which help with simple multitasking
which are easily found in the recent
apps area but what is best about the
mostly stock Android build is simply how
fast it goes as transitions and moves
through pretty much everything on an
absolute breeze it just goes to show you
how when you keep it simple you keep it
fast
now an update to KitKat will definitely
improve the experience even more
especially if our time with the Xperia
z2 is any indication and finally we make
it over to price now generally when I
look at a smaller device I try to see if
it is really the device for the everyman
in every morning and when it comes to
the Xperia z1 compact it really does
seem like it's too good to be true
unfortunately when it comes to the price
that is definitely the case this one
will come in at at least $600 unlocked
and thus you have to pay the price for
all of the power you get in here as well
as the ease of use that you have with it
in one hand no compromises it really
seems to be the real trope surrounding
the z1 compact not only on the power to
size ratio on the device itself but also
on the price you have to pay for it if
large devices are in your bag plenty of
smaller offerings are available out
there now but if you need the absolute
best the cream of the crop well you have
to pay the high price point here
Sony undoubtedly created a little ball
of lightning here and it is one hell of
a device technically it might not stand
alone
in the smaller device space but once you
get the Sony experience you want compact
in your hand you're going to find that
it certainly feels like it does so as
always thank you guys very much for
watching and I hope you enjoyed this
review of the Sony Xperia z1 compact it
just goes to show you that Sony is
continuously improving their game not
only being able to make a small device
with all of this power but also
improving on their camera optics we are
really excited about the Xperia z2 but
if the large phone is not your thing
this one might be for you so keep it
