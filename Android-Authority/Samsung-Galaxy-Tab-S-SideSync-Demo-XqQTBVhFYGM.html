what's going on everybody and I wanted
to show you just one feature that came
up in the integration between the
Samsung Galaxy Tab s tablets and the
Samsung Galaxy s5 that I thought was
really cool and I wanted to sort of give
it a dedicated video just so I can
really show you how it works and it's
called the side sync as you can see that
icon right there and the one that's here
on the phone I'm gonna go ahead and
start off with the phone real quick it's
going to connect via Wi-Fi and will
connect between the to be using Wi-Fi
direct so that's what's going to be used
and when I click on the side sync right
there it will show already Wi-Fi direct
up top so if I click on that the Samsung
Galaxy s5 in my left hand right now
should go blank because what's going to
happen is you'll have this display right
here and it will basically allow you to
control the phone completely from there
and there you go you basically have the
entire Samsung Galaxy s5 available on
the tablet now which really gives the
tablet a lot more functionality in terms
of really becoming a replacement when
you're let's say at home and this phone
let's let's say just sitting around
anywhere and you don't really want to
use it a whole lot
maybe it's charging but you still want
to be able to get all of your
notifications all of your calls all of
your messages well this is more than
just notifications this is the actual
phone itself so if you were to have a
call coming right now
show up here and if I were to answer it
we would be able to get the call through
the actual 10.5 tablet right here and be
able to do the voice call through it not
only hearing the audio but actually
saying capturing the audio and sending
it through to the call so when we have
here also is the ability to cheat to
move files between the two apparatuses
so I'm going to find the gallery little
quick and we'll use the gallery it's
univers demonstrate that all right there
we go we have the camera and we have the
actual file right here select the first
and then if I hold and drag you see it's
right all right I get over to the other
side of the tablet and it will tell me
to choose which folder I want to put it
in so it's going to pick one of them I'm
going to probably just make pictures
it done and it looks like we're good to
go the actual window itself is able to
be customized so maybe you have the
button layout here at the bottom so if I
wanted to go home on the actual phone I
could always do that but if I wanted to
go fill spring with it you can also do
that as well so now I'm literally just
working with the phone at this point and
it allows me to do everything I need to
do on the phone and then always be able
to come right back to the phone it's a
lot to the tablet itself rather in order
to do anything else like media
consumption minimize when it comes
becomes a little chat bubble right there
that way you have easy access to the
phone ever you need it and there it is
so that was just a look at the side sink
for the Samsung Galaxy Tab as tablets
when they integrate with the Samsung
Galaxy s5 it allows you to get a lot of
functionality out of the phone even when
you're only using a tablet and maybe
you're too lazy to go and grab the phone
when it is going off on some of this
card I would suggest X out of side sink
right now you have control over phone
back in our hands so keep it tuned to
Android Authority for all of the best
coverage including our coverage of the
Samsung Galaxy Tab s line on tablets I
was just announced today in New York
City so keep it tuned here because we
are your source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
