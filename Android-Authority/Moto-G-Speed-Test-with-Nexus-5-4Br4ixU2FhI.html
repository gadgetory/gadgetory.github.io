authority what's going on everybody and
right now we're revisiting the Moto G
which is quite frankly the most
affordable Android device that you can
get right now at $179 for an unlocked
phone you have a real steal here and it
could be the best bang for buck phone
available today so what we have here are
for the most part what are considered
mid-range specs however what we have
been learning over the past let's say
five or six months is that you don't
need high-end specifications to provide
a nice smooth performance so with that
in mind we're going to put this up
against one of the top dogs in the game
and obviously that would be the
Snapdragon 800 and the most recent
iteration and probably the best
benchmark for this would be the Nexus 5
after all that is running stock Android
4.4 KitKat and while the Moto G won't be
getting KitKat until January we can
still pick these two together because
they do provide very similar experiences
after all the Moto G is somewhat stock
Android pretty much as close as you can
get without actually being stock Android
like on the Nexus 5 so for the purposes
of this test I had both of the phones
turned off and then turned on again
restarted if you will so that none of
the apps that were opened in this test
were kept in the background
they were freshly opened from scratch so
here I am restarting either device I
will also say that both of these tests
were done on the particular phone
separately not together in the same shot
the reason why is because I wanted to
sync up the very time that I press the
button for whatever app or whatever
function on either device so what you're
seeing here are two shots that are
synced together to show you what the
speed would be like for either one check
my Wi-Fi and make sure that I'm
connected to it
and there you go so here is the first
test I had Android Authority already
somewhat typed into the browser so I
just got to the browser and we see how
long it would take to load as you can
see here it is actually very comparable
and when I move on to the desktop site
version of Android authority it does
seem to kind of load up about the same
in about the same amount of time for
either phone however the Moto G did
somewhat get stuck trying to load maybe
one or two last elements however for the
most part the majority of the page was
loaded up about this
time for either one when it comes to the
apps on the other hand I did see that
the Moto G was just really a smidgen
behind the Nexus 5 now in very technical
terms the Moto G probably doesn't load
everything as fast but in just what you
see on both devices if you were to use
these in the real world you would see
that the Moto G is just a little bit
slower than the Nexus 5 but not by so
much that you would really notice now
that's very impressive
now here the same thing goes for
Instagram as I said before the Moto G
just lags right behind the Nexus 5 lag
is probably even too strong of a word it
really is just directly behind it and
finally here is the loading of plants
vs. zombies - now as you can see here
the Nexus 5 does load it up just a
smidgen faster and also when you get to
the loading screen it does seem like the
Nexus 5 just loads the game a little bit
faster to where you can just hit play
and get going and what we found in this
test is that even though the Moto G
empirically is a little bit slower than
the Nexus 5 it really wasn't so slow
that it would hinder from your
experience literally if this was a
neck-and-neck race you would see the
Moto G losing by really just that much
so while this test may not have been
completely scientific what I did want to
show you was in the best of
circumstances when a real-world
situation might look like when you're
loading these particular apps or this
game or browsing the web and from what
we see here the Moto G really isn't that
shabby at all and like I said my full
review is on its way and that will
explain to you why in that review I find
the Moto G after the last few days why I
find it to be a pretty nice breath of
fresh air stay tuned to Android or defer
to that and for all of our other
