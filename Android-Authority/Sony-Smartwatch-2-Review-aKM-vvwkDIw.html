name is Kevin aka the tech ninja and
today I'm reviewing the Sony SmartWatch
2 ready or not here comes the
smartwatches it seems that people are
not yet ready for smartwatches even in
the technology sector well as we all
know technology waits for no one
the market is still trying to figure out
what a SmartWatch should do some watches
are just Notification centers some have
cameras in some even have SIM cards and
microphones to make and receive phone
calls sony tossed their hat into this
arena last year with the sony smartwatch
one which was for all intensive purposes
a prototype for the SmartWatch 2 the
SmartWatch 1 was made out of plastic and
had chintzy hinges and springs that
could easily break the screen was a
miserable 128 by 128 resolution and it
made images and text grainy the software
was convoluted and just overall a poor
experience here is the SmartWatch 2
Sony's brand new revamped second try at
a SmartWatch just in time to compete
with the Galaxy gear and it's $100
cheaper - coming in at a reasonable $200
the SmartWatch 2 is a very sleek looking
device it is 1.6 2 inches long 1.6
inches 4 for the width and 3.5 inches
thick light as a feather but still feels
extremely sturdy it also features a 1.6
LCD screen 176 by 220 pixels and it's
all encased in aluminum and plastic
construction which is also dust proof
and water resistant the watch also
includes a black wristband which is
replaceable the watch band is made out
of silicone and remains comfortable
during long usage it is equipped with a
live polymer battery it is rated for
seven days of light use but in my
experience I was able to get somewhat
between three and four days on a single
charge it also has a covered USB micro
port for charging and data transfers the
watch face can be easily seen in
daylight situations although the
reflection on this watch is extremely
intense there has never been a
where I had issues seeing the screen as
a watch where I'm accustomed to large
face watches the size of the Sony
SmartWatch 2 is perfect for me big
enough to easily see but yet not a
distraction it honestly feels like a
normal watch once it is on your wrist
before you're ready to use your watch it
first needs to be paired to your device
if you have an NFC enabled device then
this step is pretty simple simply tap
the NFC chips together and it launches
the Play Store then it takes you to
install the smart connect software the
smart connects software acts as a hub of
some sorts for your Bluetooth devices
more on this later if you do not have
NFC enabled then you connect the
old-fashioned way
using your phones or tablets Bluetooth
settings this watch is more of a
Notification Center type of watch that
allows you to install small applications
like a stopwatch a picture viewer and
other apps that are designed to run on
this watch these applications are called
smart extensions or smart extras and
here's where some of the problems begin
there are a lot of inconsistencies with
the functionality of this device for
example some of the watch applications
allow for a long press to access the
options just like a normal Android but
other times you do a long press and
nothing happens there's also a menu
button on the face of the device but for
majority of the applications this button
is not even active and these are
applications that are built by Sony out
of the box the SmartWatch 2 supports
notifications for the following
applications Gmail SMS default music
player Twitter thankfully there are
dozens of applications that are built by
third-party developers that fill in some
of the gaps even with that I am still
missing a true hangouts application
there are applications that push through
all notifications and you can filter out
what you want to display which is an OK
workaround but I feel missing some of
Google's core applications is a huge
problem and I'm not sure if that's
something that can be swept aside
general navigation on the watch is done
with simple swipe gestures when you see
the time on the face we can consider
this the lock screen press on the large
button on the side of the watch
and swipe to the left or right to view
the home screen the home screen stores
all of your applications and a familiar
grid view there is a notification bar
that acts similar to Android but it's
missing a clear all button after reading
an email or responding to a notification
on your mobile device or computer the
watch still shows it as unread that will
end up leaving you with dozens of unread
notifications every time you look at
your watch when a new notification comes
up the watch lights up and there's a
slight vibration that occurs after this
vibration happens the application pops
on for a few seconds and it shows
notification from there if you do not
interact with the watch it goes back to
the time which is a dimly lit clock
there are a few different ways to use
the Smart Connect software the first
usage is the application allows you to
pair your SmartWatch to your phone
secondly it manages all your Bluetooth
peripherals that has been paired to your
device and what I mean by manage is
being able to set up profiles that
launches tasks when you are connected
for example when I plug in my headphones
launch my music player I'm not sure why
this is there since it's not as complete
as other automation software's and it
seems somewhat out of place and the last
action is actually the most useful this
is where you can actually manage your
SmartWatch and applications on it from
this location you can find applications
that work with your watch even though it
just launches the Play Store it filters
out applications that are just made for
the watch and are compatible once the
application is installed on your device
you're able to go in each specific watch
applications and make adjustments and
configurations that directly affect the
watch for example you use the Smart
Connect software to authenticate to
Facebook Twitter and Gmail this prevents
the user having to find a way to type on
the device directly to log in the Gmail
all in all I feel this watch hardware is
top-notch the aluminum and plastic
design is elegant sleek and the screen
although may not have the highest
resolution in the world is still
viewable in all scenarios please
understand that there will be an initial
setup period to get the watch to behave
in a matter that works best
are you smartwatches are not a very
popular item nor are they seen as a
necessity the Sony SmartWatch 2 will not
change that point of view for some
people however we cannot forget that a
SmartWatch is still new to the game
still trying to figure out its niche in
this ever-changing world some people
aren't ready for smartwatches and I get
that but smartwatches will never catch
on unless they become easier to set up
but all in all this Sony SmartWatch 2
might be the best SmartWatch we've seen
today just a quick update Sony released
an update to their software that should
alleviate some of the issues I was
having in the review they said that it
should fix the scrolling issue between
pages and also the choppiness of
scrolling between the list of icons so
we'll see how that works out any updates
