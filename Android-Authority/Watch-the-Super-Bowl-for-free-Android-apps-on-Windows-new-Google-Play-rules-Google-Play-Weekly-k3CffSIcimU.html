handy the Android authority app guy and
welcome back to another episode of
Google Play weekly your first bit of
news this week Microsoft is talking once
again about allowing Android apps on
Windows Phone this is a rumor that
circulates pretty frequently so it's not
a surprise that's popping up again now
by allowing people to use Android apps
Microsoft would effectively shore up
Windows Phones biggest weakness which is
app supports those married to the
Android ecosystem would be able to stay
there while still having access to
Microsoft services and hardware it's an
interesting idea and it'll be fun to see
if it actually plays out this time
Humble Bundle 10 is out now and you guys
know how much I love a good Humble
Bundle this time around you can pay
whatever you want and get buddy and me
line and doodle Kingdom if you beat the
average which is three dollars and 92
cents at the time of the making of this
video you'll also get sorcery to king of
Dragon Pass and OTT DD along with more
games coming soon it's a great way to
pick up some games on the cheap and
donate to charity and we'll have that
link in the video description below if
you're interested
so Android owners who wants to watch the
Super Bowl for free NBC has got you
covered this year they'll be streaming
and intense 11 hours of Super Bowl
coverage including the Super Bowl the
halftime show and an episode of the
black list all totally free all you have
to do is pick up the NBC Sports live
extra app and start streaming we'll have
a link to that in the video description
below if you want to pick that up
what's up had a busy week this week with
a new release and some crack downs the
first order of business was whatsapp
releasing a desktop version for those
who would want a desktop version it's a
little screwy to get into because you
have to use a QR code to sync everything
but otherwise it seems to function
fairly well then whatsapp turned around
and sent a cease and desist letter to
the developers of whatsapp Plus
effectively destroying the app according
to whatsapp the application they shut
down had some questionable code but
longtime fans of the app have defended
it in any case it's gone now their last
bit of news this week Google updated the
rules for naming Android apps and it was
a change that was much needed this is
something that needed to happen for a
long time Android apps use big keywords
and their app titles to deliberately
drive search traffic their way this is
why we had so many terribly named
applications like Android news or
Android media player or Twitter easy
connect
in an effort to make application
developers stand on their own two feet
instead of cashing in on keyword
searches they can no longer put the
product brands or names at the front of
their app name this is great news and
I'm happy to hear it
soon was to see some trending
applications as usual if you want to
check any of these applications out you
can find the links in the video
description below
next lockscreen is a lock screen
replacement application from Microsoft
that received a huge update this last
week the lock screen now has music
player controls MMS support instant
messaging support for Skype line and
Google Hangouts and the usual array of
bug fixes and performance improvements
it's still totally free with no in-app
purchases if you want to check it out
cloud magic received a bit of an update
this week that has had some mixed
reactions they have started a new
subscription service for $4.99 per month
that users can get in on to access new
features and functionality for now the
feature list is pretty short for the
developer says it will get longer as
time goes also all of the features of
the free version remain free but we
still remain dubious about spending $60
a year on an email clients asana is a
task management service that aims to
help people stay organized you can
organize tasks and assign tasks to
people on a larger scale this last week
they released a huge update to their
android application it is now a native
android app instead of html5 and it
comes with material design just your
controls and more features it's still
not amazing but it's definitely a big
step forward libreoffice viewer beta is
a document viewing app that is now on
android people have been clamoring for
libreoffice on android for some time and
this seems to be the first step to
making that happen it is in beta and it
is very rough so we recommend that you
steer clear unless you want to help test
aside from that it's nice to see
LibreOffice on Android even in this
limited form for right now last up this
week is the Niantic labs app field trip
it's essentially a guidebook that shows
you interesting landmarks and tidbits
about the city that you're in it
received a big update this last week
with more material design new content
and the boilerplate bug fixes and
performance improvements if you play
ingress or you just like to explore you
