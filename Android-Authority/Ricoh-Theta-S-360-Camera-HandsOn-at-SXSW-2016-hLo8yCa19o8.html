Samsung's 360 cameras but did you know
that there's one that's been around for
about three generations now it's judge
of a guard from Android authority what's
going on everybody
and this is the Reiko theta s the third
iteration of the Reiko theta comes to
South by Southwest and we got to take a
look at it and see how it stacks up to a
couple of the other 360 cameras that
we've seen in the mobile space today
but the Reiko theta s is a high spec
model that complements the irregular
theta and comes with high resolution one
by 2.3 12 megapixel CMOS sensors that
both stitch together a 360 capture now
it can do a 30 frames per second Full HD
video capture as well and a low-light
performance should be okay with a F 2.0
lens as we are going through the specs
the camera is able to take still images
or long movies at a max length of 25
minutes long and be able to provide the
360 type of video that will be played on
YouTube Facebook and even VR headsets
the theta s connects to any smartphone
using the Reiko app and you are able to
send the images and the photos and
videos to the smartphone when you need
to but inside of the theta S is a 8
megapixel internal memory storage that
is not bolstered by a micro SD card slot
however but the connections on the
bottom can be used to stream at the
content that is being captured by the
theta as live to either a laptop or to a
display the live streaming capabilities
were really fun to look at as they had
an installation on the trade show floor
at South by Southwest showing off the
capabilities of live streaming when it
was connected to a macbook and we have
more information about that in the
interview that you're going to be seeing
in just a bit
overall the device is actually really
sleek with a matted finish but a high
quality feel all around and it's really
easy to use and you just have to point
it up and press the shutter button after
you select the mode over on the button
to the side all right and actually you
can probably just see us on the field
we're all in frame here including the
camera so there is a live streaming
component to the theta yes it will
stream via USB to
any laptop device what you're seeing is
the raw feed here from the camera
unstitched so what you see on your
mobile device through the app is a
stitch together component where both
sides are connected and the just lens
distortion is corrected for so you watch
my hand here you'll see it rotate from
one side of the image to the other side
of that plane because that's that's the
360 where the image is divided yeah so
this is what it would look like in a
video editing software I mean I could
see myself changing exactly yeah that's
it yes if you're looking if you're
editing still or video the file formats
are JPEG and mp4 can be used in any
editing software but this is what you
look like the image looks like in a
native form without stitched together
through the application so do you see a
live streaming especially for events for
example like South by Southwest becoming
a very common thing I mean I'm already
seeing it yes we are I think it's that
we still have to have the software catch
up with the hardware affair so you have
to have stitching in here for most
people to perceive it correctly do we
have a feedback here is this one ah yeah
that is a new website that has come up
that does have the software built on the
back end called hug this is a Japanese
co-workers oh nice page so that that's
what it would look like on YouTube 360
site for instance all right yeah this is
yeah this is very similar but we're
waiting to see that integration happened
on more and more platforms out there oh
well that's great well yeah as Mike just
mentioned the streaming is done via USB
to this laptop currently right now in
this case and then it could be streamed
like to this website right here which is
great so for for consumers do you think
that this is going to become like I
don't know we were talking about
vlogging earlier it just keeps I just
keep thinking to myself for certain
events it seems like they're going to be
so many different people vlogging the
same thing from driving perspectives it
just seems really interesting than
anything with video is you can be your
own director you can choose your point
of view as an end user and watch what
you want to watch so exactly I think
you're right I think a lot of people
that are doing a vlog you want to get as
many eyeballs as they can and being
unique can certainly help help with that
Dever yeah definitely the Ranko theta
has been recently released on retails
for $349 so if you're looking for a
camera from a company that has been
doing a 360 video for a little while now
Reiko may be the great alternative that
you have to upcoming peripherals like
the gear 360 and the LG 360 keep it
tuned to Android 34 even more from South
by Southwest as we bring you all of our
coverage from Austin Texas but also
remember that we are your source for all
things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
