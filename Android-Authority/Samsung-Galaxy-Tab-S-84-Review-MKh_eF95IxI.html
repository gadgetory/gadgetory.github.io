flagship line of tablets on top of all
of the other ones they already have in
their arsenal but if this is supposed to
be the best tablet that they offer well
what does it offer for you well let's
find out because it's Josh magar from
Android authority what's going on
everybody and this is the Samsung Galaxy
Tab s 8.4 if you think that the design
of the Galaxy Tab s looks pretty similar
it's because you're pretty much right
but thankfully Samsung has had a lot of
tries at the tablet game and they seem
to have gotten it right as ever this
time pretty much like a blown-up Samsung
Galaxy s5 what you have here is a tablet
that pretty much is supposed to be used
in portrait mode denoted by the button
layout that is on the bottom with the
tactile home button flanked by recent
apps and back in this white version of
the tablet aligning with a subtle gold
hue goes all the way around though
you'll notice most how thin this tablet
is six point six millimeters thick makes
this one of the thinnest tablets around
beaten only by the Sony Xperia z2 tablet
in portrait mode the speaker grills are
found on the top and bottom of the
device though this could be considered
the sides one in landscape mode and on
the right side you have the power button
and the volume rockers above the microSD
card slots down on the bottom are the
microUSB port and the headphone jack the
back takes on the material choice of the
Galaxy s5 smartphone the dimpled vacuum
that is not removable added on to this
rather controversial design choice are a
couple of circles that take the plastic
nibs that attach the various cases to
the tablet it's really the thinness of
this tablet that dictates the handling
experience which is actually pretty
great gripping the tablet in one hand is
not hard at all and reaching elements on
the screen is pretty easy even in typing
holding the Tab s without activating the
screen is also not that difficult in
landscape mode as the bezel up top gives
a safe spot for resting your thumb
ultimately Samsung might not have
changed the formula much at all but at
least in this iteration of their tablets
they've really gotten it down making it
a very sleek device that is actually not
too hard to handle
of course the marquee feature of this
tablet is the addition of a Super AMOLED
screen this is a high resolution display
at 2560 by 1600 yielding 359 pixels per
inch
while we have seen high-resolution
displays on tablets before this may
arguably be one of the highest quality
ones out there
the colors are incredibly punchy as is
the case with AMOLED leading to a high
contrast that definitely helps one
you're consuming media binge watching
all whole season and a half of Breaking
Bad was incredibly enjoyable here as
such a high spec display on a pretty
accessible body for this size made from
one of the most enjoyable experiences
I've had on a tablet and in other uses
like one using the paper garden great
brightness and wonderful colors make the
magazine viewing experience about as
good as it can get without looking at
the actual magazine itself you can cater
the color temperature to your liking and
it is possible to put it on in Auto mode
in my experience however this is one of
those features that you will not really
notice especially if you keep using your
indoor lighting with the tab s
underneath all of this is a performance
package that you would want powering
your Netflix your games and anything
else you might throw at this version of
TouchWiz the XE knows 5 octa is
Samsung's tried-and-true in-house
processing package and brings the Molly
T 628 along for graphics processing
aside from any loading hiccups and areas
like the magazine UX or one apps like
the paper garden are trying to load all
of the things at once I ran into very
few instances of Sutter and lag that
kept me from getting around blasting
through applications using the recent
apps screen brought no issues at all
although of course you can have the
multi window available if you really
need to multitask and it works about as
well as you would expect from a Samsung
flagship the media consumption is
something that you will likely do most
on here the Galaxy Tab s is capable of
taking on everything from web browsing
to remote PC access with ease now
Samsung has always made it a point to
put in as much as they can in their
devices and the tab S Line is no
different especially if media is your
main usage for this device the inclusion
of microsd expandable 'ti is always
welcome LTE versions of both the tab s
tablets will be made available so if you
need mobile internet access well those
are the choices for you and as far as
connectivity goes NFC is their only real
hole here but you do still get things
like Wi-Fi Bluetooth of course and also
an IR blaster making this one of the
better second-screen experiences that
you can have on watching TV the finger
scanner actually makes it onto the
tablet line embed it into the home
button and set up the exact same way as
it was in the Galaxy s5 the dual speaker
setup is very welcome
is great to use on the fly though it
still isn't the loudest or the richer
sound available the sound in the
headphone sounds expectedly good though
and then there's the battery which I
decided to test by really taking on what
this tablet was marketed to do so I got
on Netflix on Wi-Fi and played Breaking
Bad straight for as long as I could I
got down to 25% battery life in just
under 8 hours but the better way of
measuring that is by counting the number
of episodes I got through 15 episodes of
a spectacular one-hour show so there's
no doubt that you'll be able to binge
watch up to two seasons of a typical
show no problem here and if you lower
that screen on time you'll have one hell
of a long-lasting tablet the camera
setup on a tablet is often a requirement
rather than a defining feature that
continues to be the case even on this a
so called flagship tablet but that
doesn't mean Samsung doesn't try to make
it as good as it can you can see it in
the settings as features like software
stabilization for photo and video as
well as modes like HDR and burst modes
bolstered the 8 megapixel optics that
actually default to 6 were 16 by 9
aspect ratio photos picture quality
isn't too bad though it pales in
comparison obviously to its flagship
smartphone counterparts unsurprisingly
colors do pop a bit and detail is decent
in good lighting but it's really nothing
to write home about I don't see anyone
consistently using the camera of a
tablet still unless in this case you're
perhaps wanting to share what you're
eating while you're binge watching
orange is the new black and finally in
software we might see a familiar
operating system that continues from
Samsung's pro line of tablets but there
are a couple of additions here that
sweeten the pot first off despite the
new circle motifs that you can find
mainly in the quick settings area and a
flatter look overall in the colours this
is still TouchWiz but has been given a
second home screen experience with the
magazine UX the magazine UX is largely
the same as the one found on the pro
line and is a grid made up of
specialized widgets it's still a very
lean ecosystem providing only so much
functionality that has to piggyback
either on Samsung's own applications on
Flipboard as the backend to any news or
social media sources that are available
we didn't really find it a game changer
by any means as it didn't really
penetrate the day-to-day routine well
enough but then there are applications
put in to not only help showcase the
Super AMOLED capabilities but also to
help
consolidate your experience across
devices sidesync isn't necessarily new
but it's still an interesting way of
accessing your phone when you don't want
to go reaching for it and it doesn't
just give you your notifications it
gives you full access it is not the
smoothest implementation but for a
number of smaller general tasks it does
get the job done
built-in remote PC capabilities tie into
your Samsung Account to get you remote
access to your computer at home and it
works quite well when used on the same
Wi-Fi network it was actually really
smooth and I imagine that with a fast
enough Wi-Fi connection you can get
similar performance outside of your home
network and finally there is the paper
garden the magazine front end that
brings a print replacing way of getting
your magazine subscriptions downloading
a couple magazines was easy enough and
you get the entire publication complete
with every single ad and cater to a
touch interface
I found the Super AMOLED screen did
justice to the magazine's zeal making
text easy to read and pictures enjoyable
to view though I will admit at times I
didn't always know I had to scroll down
to read the rest of the page its
Samsung's gateway to further
partnerships with companies but if
you're a magazine reader you may greatly
benefit from this digital way of reading
the rags ultimately TouchWiz is well
still TouchWiz it does come with more
features on here especially ones that
are more cater to the tablet experience
but all of those features can tend to be
either useful or not so useful but
that's something we expect from Samsung
already and so the Galaxy Tab s 8.4 will
come in at the price of three hundred
and ninety nine dollars while its bigger
brother the 10.5 inch a Galaxy Tab s
which I will be reviewing very soon will
come in at $4.99 instead while its main
competition includes every other 8 inch
tablet in Samsung's camp the Tab s as
the flagship and deserves the title
because of how much it offers over them
the LG G pad does come to mind and with
it somewhat lower price point it also
comes with lower resolution but the true
budget tablet is still the Nexus 7 which
for a much lower price does provide
lower specs overall but can still
provide a comparable media experience
across the board despite losing a lot of
features in the transition from TouchWiz
none of these competitors have the Super
AMOLED screen however which along with
the magazine and media partnerships that
it does bring could be enough of a trump
card for some and so
we have it's the Samsung Galaxy Tab s
8.4 I'll admit I've been a little
disillusioned with tablets as of late
especially as our smartphones continue
to grow while I do love a large screen
experience that's what my 60-inch TV is
for and I still get enjoyment from let's
say five-inch screen phones but Super
AMOLED isn't hard to get caught up in
and with the sharper higher resolutions
quality screen it makes all media quite
fun ecosystem consolidation might not
necessarily be perfect yet but it's
taken a step forward with built-in
remote PC access and side sync and I'm
not much of a magazine reader but if I
was the paper garden would be a great
alternative to the paper editions
I love the battery life that can go for
at least a couple seasons of a TV show
and the overall package proved an
enhancement to the typical watch in bed
experience is my fire for tablets
rekindled perhaps not completely but the
Galaxy Tab s 8.4 is definitely Samsung's
best foot forward in the tablet game
thus far and I will admit that overall
it was a very enjoyable experience as
always thank you guys very much for
watching and hope you enjoyed this
review of the Samsung Galaxy Tab s 8.4 I
will be reviewing the 10.5 inch version
of the Galaxy Tab s line very soon so
