previewed a whole host of great
smartphones at mid-range price points my
conclusion you can get a heck of a lot
these days without needing to pay those
flagship prices what about a phone at a
real budget price point the real me one
is a device from Oppo and partner Amazon
India their aims to deliver a great
experience for a very modest price
indeed starting at 8990 Indian rupees up
to thirteen thousand nine hundred and
ninety rupees well that's about a
hundred and ten dollars to two hundred
and seven dollars depending on the setup
in terms of RAM and storage that you go
for that significantly cheaper than the
initial rumor of seventeen thousand nine
hundred and ninety that are reported in
my initial hands on and I'm very sorry
for that
so I'm Adamson Itsuki and I'm ash to get
hold of this slightly more expensive six
gigabyte variant and I thought something
a bit different for this review of BT
recount a typical day with the real mean
one to see whether a 100 or 200 dollar
device can do everything I need it to in
that typical day and if it can do
everything I need it to then maybe it'll
be enough for you as well to find out
how it fared here's my full review so
starting the day with the Oppo VL me one
is nice enough I tend to spend my first
10 minutes of the day sitting up reading
blogs and checking emails and the screen
here is nice and bright with a decent HD
resolution of to 169 by 1080 P it's also
plenty large at 6 inches and with an 18
by 9 aspect ratio I really appreciate
having that kind of real estate on a
device this cheap you should probably go
without saying though that this is an
IPS LCD panel and not an OLED but it is
perfectly bright and colorful and had no
problems enjoying media on it I would
say though the screen feels a little
cheap actually I found that my finger
would drag when swiping which wasn't a
great feeling for an export of cool I'll
usually make breakfast and pack a lunch
whilst watching YouTube again the screen
is perfectly up to this it looks very
nice and the sound is actually decent as
well
although this is a single speaker grill
affair down the bottom of course it's
loud enough to be heard over a boiling
kettle or chopping bread and actually
fills the room pretty well it's probably
better than a lot of the competition of
this price and then I'm often out first
dropped my wife off at work with Google
Maps doing just fine as a GPS letting us
know which traffic jams to avoid and
then to set up shop in a cafe somewhere
to get a spot of work done later on on
we've home and carry on what make
actually I have passes by as I roundish
my real me one is the interesting
polygonal effect on the back of the
device this subtle pattern is visible
only when it catches the light the right
way but it does give the real me one a
bit of a unique personality it certainly
looks considerably less impressive in
real life than it does in press photos
and you could achieve the same effect
very easily with a decal but hey it's
better than nothing and it's definitely
preferable to the bland appearance of
most budget devices I'm glad this isn't
just another black brick I will say that
during use the real me ones price is
apparent in the build quality this
device feels pretty cheap and hollow
which is due to the mostly plastic body
and it is incredibly light in the way
that might lead someone to mistake it
for a toy phone at first it's also very
by the numbers in terms of design from
the front I said in the initial hands-on
I would have liked to have seen off
their go for the original not design
that it showed in early images that went
down well like a sack of to be
honest but I stand by it not because I
like notches I actually agree with a lot
of you guys I don't really like them but
just because it would have been nice to
have something interesting and a bit
more flagship II for the front of this
otherwise very dull device it's not a
beautiful phone by any stretch of the
imagination there's no IP rating either
as you'd probably expect and I would
consider getting a case as it doesn't
feel the most durable before I get stuck
into work I'll often begin my day by
calling my mum my sister or my pilot
buddy Nathan who likewise is available
during the working week the real me once
serves its purpose as a phone with a
decent call quality and no issues there
from there it's on with work these days
I'll actually use my smartphone quite a
lot during a typical working day I use
it to respond to messages on slack for
instance which is a chat app that undred
Authority uses I use asana I use email I
respond to YouTube comments obviously
with its Helio p60 this isn't the most
powerful device on the block but is
actually more than ample for the vast
majority of tasks this has helped a
great deal by the pretty hefty six
gigabytes of RAM in
version the cheapest model only comes
with three gigabytes of RAM they're
still probably gonna be fine for most
uses and six gigabytes is actually
really generous at this price point
you're on a 10 which I praised for being
a great bang for your buck device only
gifts four gigabytes in the UK model and
that'll set you back 399 pounds
switching between apps is breezy
navigating the UI is nippy and even
multitasking works just fine and is made
easier thanks to that larger screen that
chipset brings with it a Marley g7 2 MP
3 GPU which isn't a top-of-the-range
performant by any means but it's
perfectly capable of playing most things
on the Play Store you should have no
problem with the majority of 3d titles
for instance and that's increasingly the
story with android gaming there aren't
tons of games out there that push
devices to their limits and so most
things that you want to play on the Play
Store you can do even with a cheaper set
of hardware so the argument for spending
more on a more performant device is
getting harder to defend in that respect
that said there are some use case
scenarios where you might want a bit
more power for instance if you wanted to
do VR I tried using the real me one to
have a go on Google cardboard and it was
really slow really laggy and nauseating
so if you want to do bi you might want a
bit more horsepower if you want to do
emulation you might want a bit more
horsepower but for most gaming scenarios
on Android even this setup should be
perfectly fine what makes the Helio P 60
a particularly notable inclusion here
though is that it happens to come with a
built-in NPU for those of you not
familiar with all the acronyms and
jargon that's a neural processing unit
and bring some onboard AI type features
unlocking the real me one is very fast
for instance thanks to the affected face
detection and apparently the reaction
time is nought 2.1 seconds and I can
believe that based on my usage the only
big bummer there's no fingerprint sensor
here and that means I have to use
passwords on PayPal like a schmuck I
should say at this point that I don't
love the UI either is Android 8.1 or EA
which is good but it's got the color OS
UI layer on top which I don't like as
usual any cosmetic imperfections can be
eradicated to the fresh launcher it
doesn't seem to slow things down too
much although it does come with some
bloatware and ultimately this will come
down to personal preference whether it's
a big issue for you or not don't get me
wrong this isn't gonna be a buttery
smooth performer but it didn't stop me
doing anything
I wanted to do and that's pretty
remarkable really for the price I
imagine it'll be the same story for the
three gigabyte model as well storage
comes in at 32 64 or 128 gigabytes and
that's expandable up to 256 gigabytes by
an additional SD card slot so that's a
lot in total if you want to go all the
way often what really is noticeable in a
very budget device is the compromises
that companies make in terms of the
camera so around lunchtime I'll often
hit the gym this is when the camera
becomes an important feature for me as
I'll typically use the selfie shooter to
capture my workouts and share on
Instagram I have no shame in my line of
work I'm called to vlog fairly off and I
post to social media a lot so for me
it's really important to have a good
front-facing camera if a phone doesn't
have that then that's a bit of a
deal-breaker for me so on the real me
one this is the front-facing camera it's
8 megapixels which is fairly generous
and as you can see it's after I home
about the focusing isn't great doesn't
have up my Google image stabilization
and it's got the same 2.2 aperture but
you know gets the job done and there's
nothing wrong with it in fact it's a lot
better than the front-facing cameras on
lots of slightly more expensive devices
in fact the capturing antics in the
evening the rear camera is also
serviceable it's a single lens setup
which these days is actually bucking the
trend now but at 13 megapixels it should
be capable of capturing some decent
detail the aperture is quite narrow
though f 2.2 and the photos are
distinctly average there are some fun
features including the now compulsory
portrait mode and some dubious beauty
modes but low-light performance is
definitely subpar and there are
occasions where the photos looked either
washed out or a bit soft if you live on
social media you may want to look for
something little beefier in this regard
but it's perfectly capable of handling
most everyday requirements and it can
produce some nice photos it's definitely
better than it has any right to be
really by the end of the day the 3410
million power battery still had some
juice left in it you can easily make it
through a day and a half under moderate
to heavy use and this is at least partly
thanks to some more AI trickery which is
supposed to improve the battery
management and I can believe it again
from my experiences
it has quick charging but plugging in
come evening I am forced to get a
microUSB cable which is unfortunately
one of the backwards-facing compromises
here for thirteen thousand nine hundred
and ninety rupees then I'm able to work
game and take some decent photos it has
a unique appearance and even a little
AI magic thrown in for good measure
that's a very compelling offer and it's
hard to imagine how Oppo and Amazon are
actually making any money at all from
this one is it worth to buy look the
plastic build lack of modern features
middling processor an average camera
mean that this was never destined to be
the must-have device of 2018 it's
pointless to compare this to current
flagships but against other devices in
this price category it fares very well
it actually offers more bang for your
buck sand a lot of similarly positioned
Xiaomi devices and it certainly beats
the new line of lower end and Nokia's
that I recently covered that said those
Nokia's and the shammies also have
significantly nicer build qualities than
this one this does feel quite cheap but
if you're willing to cover that up with
the sturdy case and in terms of
horsepower and features for the money
you're paying this is a fantastic option
on a budget still I'll be glad to go
back to my Galaxy s8 plus though so
