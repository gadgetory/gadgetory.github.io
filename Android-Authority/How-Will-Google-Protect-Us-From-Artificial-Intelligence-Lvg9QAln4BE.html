been don't be evil but maybe it should
have been don't be Skynet science
aficionados will be familiar with isaac
asimov's three laws of robotics one a
robot may not injure a human being or
through inaction allow a human being to
come to harm number two a robot must
obey the orders given by a human beings
except when such orders would conflict
with the first law and third a robot
must protect its own existence as long
as such protection does not conflict
with the first or second laws although
when it comes to technology things are
never so simple and there's no doubt
that Google has been contemplating these
concerns for quite some time the search
giant recently published a paper
outlining some practical approaches to
solving what may turn out to be one of
the most important problem Society will
face in the coming decades in their
paper titled concrete problems in AI
safety Google is careful to give a
relatively harmless negative
repercussions as examples a robot
attempting to mop an electric outlet a
cleaning AI deciding to cover up messes
rather than take care of them etc but a
failure to solve the control problem
actually presents much higher risks such
as an existential catastrophe google has
identified five sub parts of this
problem the big one is avoiding negative
side effects which is essentially making
sure that the AI doesn't knock over a
vase or worse kill a human being other
problems include avoiding reward hacking
which would prevent an AI from working
around its intended task to achieve an
easier method of producing the desired
result though they differ from the
instructors intent next up is scalable
oversight and this addresses how to
appropriately monitor an AI without the
output of data becoming overwhelming and
safe exploration ensures that AI will be
free to search for more creative
solutions without violating the quote
avoiding negative side-effects tenant
and lastly distribution ille this
addresses the concern that an a is real
world environment will differ
substantially from its training
environment like a college graduate it
will be important for an AI to enter the
real world
and get a job done and not end up in
their mother's basement arguing with
strangers on the internet yes I'm
looking at you troll today nearly
anything is possible if you can dream it
your team can build it makers of
collaboration software that helps your
team work better together create and
share content organized results with the
flexibility of confluence they even have
instant messaging and video chat with
HipChat you can also manage code in real
time with the power of bitbucket visit
atlassian calm and see how JIRA
confluence HipChat and bitbucket can
give your team everything they need to
succeed so what are your thoughts and
fears about Google AI or just AI in
general is iRobot our future or are we
just over blowing it let us know in the
