new all-glass design better specs and
you know what let's take a step back the
one plus six is new but it's not new new
it's an evolution sure but this is
almost entirely an evolution of hardware
look oneplus needs to follow the trends
they're still hip and cool they only
sell one phone on their website but they
still have to keep up with the hardware
trends to stay relevant
everyone's doing dual cameras one plus
five small bezels one plus 5t glass one
plus six you could say that oneplus is
copying everyone else's hardware but
it's really the software that sets them
apart look the point I'm trying to make
here is that oneplus delivers a
consistent experience the minute I
picked up this phone I thought huh this
feels like a oneplus device but why is
that well it turns out it's all in the
software now I could sit here and tell
you what it's like to use this phone but
if you've used a oneplus phone before
you probably already know that it's fast
it's clean it's nearly stock Android and
that is what makes the oneplus 6 the new
Nexus the oneplus X is running on oxygen
OS 5.1 3 which is based on Android 8.1
Oreo that is the latest and greatest
that Google has to offer and that is no
mistake it's becoming more and more
apparent that people want more control
of their mobile experience and isn't
that the whole point of Android oneplus
even announced that the one plus six is
getting the and repeat beta at launch in
a way this is one plus letting Google
update their software but is that a bad
thing not in my book software might be
one of the most defining features of
oneplus phones but this thing has some
of the best specs available on the
market today
now specs are kind of leveling out so
you're probably not gonna notice a huge
variance over performance of the 5 T but
as a recap this thing has stopped
they're gonna be 45 6 to 8 gigabytes of
RAM 64 128 and 256 gigabytes of storage
6.2 a inch AMOLED display knotch
16
20 megapixel F 1.7 rear cameras 16
megapixel f/2 selfie camera 3300
milliamp hour battery bottom firing
speaker USB C headphone jack okay now
that we're done with that let's continue
the camera hasn't really improved over
the 5 t but that's not necessarily a bad
thing the images come out sharp and with
really accurate color they've even added
optical image stabilization and slo-mo
video so your photos and video should be
a lot more stable I would have liked
that telephoto lens to make a comeback
but oneplus decided to outfit this with
19 percent bigger pixels for better
low-light performance that 3300 milliamp
hour battery that I was worried about it
actually holds up really well
I got about five-and-a-half hours of
screen on time with this thing and -
charging makes it charge extremely
quickly now I'm not really sure why they
didn't include wireless charging in this
thing since it's made completely of
glass and I would have liked to see it 1
+ implement that here sum of all these
specs and what do you see the 1 + 6 was
built for enthusiasts now where did
these enthusiasts previously get their
fix that was the Nexus line these phones
aren't sold in carrier stores they are
available exclusively online and you're
only probably gonna get one if you are
super hyped about Android if you
followed the evolution of the Nexus line
you probably saw that those phones were
getting nicer and nicer over time the 5x
and the 6p we're long held is some of
the best designs in the history of
Android this is exactly what oneplus is
doing here year-over-year these phones
have gotten more premium and
year-over-year they've become better
than the last the oneplus 6 both looks
and feels solid it's made almost
completely out of Gorilla Glass 5 and it
has a weight that makes me feel like it
can really take a punch it's probably my
favorite one + design to date and I
actually like it quite a bit more than
the 5 t1 plus even gave each different
color of this phone a different special
coating which makes each variant pretty
unique powder white model feels like
it's covered in well powder and the
mirror black model bends light
reflecting off its surface these phones
feel just about as premium as you're
going to get in a phone today and I'm
really surprised with what oneplus was
able to deliver at this price point oh
right that price
well it is too low for flagship
standards but it is creeping the 1 + 3 T
was 439 dollars the 5 was 479 dollars
the 5 T was 499 dollars and the 6 yeah
that's five hundred and twenty-nine
dollars prices are hiking every
generation just like the Nexus line did
which resulted in the Google pixel
oneplus has created a cult-like fanbase
and for good reason
these phones are fast they're clean and
they're almost always certain to get the
latest and greatest version of Android
in a way this is Google's doing
not one pluses these phones deliver a
consistent experience which is just
about as close to the Nexus or pixel as
you're going to get but it won't cost
you an arm and a leg don't be surprised
if they do at some point though because
oneplus seems to be following Google's
trajectory to teeth so that's been the 1
plus 6 if you have any questions don't
