authority what's going on everybody and
i'm here coming to you live from CES
2015 live on the floor yes we do have a
full youtube team today but we kind of
split up for a little bit and actually
in reality a lot of the stuff that we
saw today didn't really pan out in terms
of android if you've been following the
CES coverage from all of the different
channels including ours you would know
that maybe this isn't there going to be
the main CES 2015 in the case of android
we do have the G flex 2 which we already
talked about in the previous recap but
we also have today we did get a chance
to look at HTC's new phone the desire
826 which was announced a little bit
while a little while back but it now has
a standard ultrapixel camera up front it
require it it brings the same type of
design from the desire i which is
actually one of my favorites i do like
this two-tone color design and I really
enjoy what I see from HTC in terms of
their design but other than that we were
able to get around and take a look at
the zenfone 2 which you probably are
seeing a video on if not now it's cut if
not already it's coming very very soon
the zenfone 2 was a very nice phone
especially for the price point there are
actually a few different versions of the
phone and that 199 version is the one
with set 1080p resolution with 2
gigabytes of RAM so that four gigabytes
of RAM is not quite going to be
available for that very very very easy
price point but nonetheless we've been
running around all day today we're here
at showstoppers and it's another one of
those big events much like kept calm
which you saw yesterday and usually
there's a lot of food there's a lot of
drinks around here and one of the best
parts about being able to come to CES
and different shows like this is well
generally you are as a media person
working for the most part alone
especially if you're a telecommuter and
stuff like that but we do get and you
just saw Edgar from mobile geeks coming
around he's way over here hey but that's
one of the best parts about being on
shows like this is the fact that you get
to meet up with all of the other
personalities if you haven't noticed
already over in the background we have
Nicole for mobile geeks who is working
with Macau with Edgar over here but we
also had hi mayor davetta over back
there with pocket now we're out at the
show floor and it's just an absolute
madhouse we did get a couple of videos
over at Sony but as Kevin and lon told
me on the way there it was just
crazyness getting past all the mobs of
people and trying to traverse the Las
Vegas Convention Center nonetheless they
were able to bring you some really great
footage of the SmartWatch 3 now with a
metal band but also a 4k android-based
curved or not curved sorry sony has a 4k
bravia based TV that has android now and
those look really great and we're
looking forward to seeing even more over
the next coming days no CES is not the
biggest if not when it comes to android
iterations and mobile in general if you
didn't notice already we didn't see too
much from Nvidia like I said already but
we also didn't see too much from Samsung
and we did talk about a little bit
already yesterday how disappointed we
were that Samsung wasn't really doing
anything really all that big even
mid-range devices they didn't really put
out but LG was able to pick up the slack
for that and we were able to see other
stuff from people like alcatel and HTC
but nonetheless it's been already a
great time and we hope that you've been
enjoying all of our best coverage here
of CES 2015 will have even more for you
over the next coming days including
exclusive interviews with a number of
different companies that pretty much put
together what is the android experience
that we know you guys love and we love
to that's why we're android authority
because we are your source for all
things android we want you to stay tuned
and stay subscribe to our channel and
subscribe rather subscribe if you
haven't already because we are bringing
you all the best from CES 2015</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
