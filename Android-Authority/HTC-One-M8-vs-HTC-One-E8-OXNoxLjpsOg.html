name is Kevin the tech ninja and today
we're going to take a look at the HTC m8
versus the HTC e8 now keep your eye on
the corner of the screen so you know
which device I'm using what I'm showing
images of video you ready let's begin
when it comes to the e8 and the m8 the
big difference comes in the design
department the aircraft-grade aluminum
build from the m8 has been seen as a
favorite within the Android communities
the metallic build screams quality and
durability the material at times can
feel a bit slippery and more susceptible
to sliding out of your hands the brush
stroke aluminum shows HTC's attention to
detail when crafting this device the EI
went with a different approach one is
more wallet-friendly
HTC with with a carbonate material this
material is smooth to the touch and
provides a light feel for the e8 the
material choice allows for multiple
color options and textures there's also
a gloss and matte variety with accent
colors to choose from as well the matte
addition is grippy and sits well in the
hand
however the glossy and matte both suffer
from excessive fingerprint residue when
it comes to the form factor both devices
are relatively the same size the m8 is
one forty six point four by seventy one
point six by nine point eight
millimeters in the e8 is one forty six
point three by seventy point six by nine
point three five millimeters the EI
edges are round and this is said to
enhance the ergonomics when holding the
device when laying the device on his
back it rocks when tapping on the screen
the EI edges are more so tapered which
doesn't allow it to sit flush on its
back but you can still interact with the
device when it's laying on a flat
surface it does rock and sway a little
bit but it's actually something that's
much more manageable
since the e8 is using the aforementioned
polycarbonate material it allows the
device to be much lighter as well and it
comes in at 145 grams versus the 160 the
volume rockers sim and microSD slots are
located in the same spots the power
button is located on top of both devices
on the ma is located closer to the side
bezel on the e8 is located towards the
middle I presume the reason for this
move is that on the e8 is no longer the
IR blaster taking up the spot the m8 has
two cameras on the back of the device
with a duo flash that's located by the
first camera to the left the e8 has a
single traditional camera and a single
LED flash on top when it comes to the
hardware both devices are nearly
identical they come with a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 801 processor 2 gigabytes of
RAM the Adreno GPU and they come with a
microSD slot for expandable storage now
the m8 has an option for 16 gigabyte or
32 gigabyte onboard storage versus 16
gigabytes with the e8 the camera is one
component that is significantly
different between the two the inmate has
the ultra pixel 4 megapixel camera and
the e8 has the standard 13 megapixel
camera the sensor on the m8 is a six by
nine ratio and the e8 has a four by
three ratio now the difference doesn't
stop just at the sensor the flash is
completely different as well you can
find a dual tone LED flash on the m8 and
the e eight is stuck with a standard one
LED flash as soon as that HTC has
scrapped their imaging plans completely
and want to try something else as far as
the images that are produced out of both
cameras they're still below the industry
standard now we all know that megapixels
is not the sole reason for images to
look better so with that being said the
13 megapixel still does not look that
great
both camera still has a hazy fog around
the images and the color reduplication
is inaccurate
and low-light the cameras really have a
hard time pulling out any color so the
images look flat and grainy now we all
know the m8 has the two cameras on the
back and this allows you to adjust the
focal levels after the photo but other
phones are showing you that two cameras
are not needed for this and besides it
ends up being a gimmicky feature that's
not used often shockingly enough the
four megapixel m8 was able to pull down
images better but compared to the e8
that's not really saying much
overall I prefer the HTC m8 the
aluminium build is fantastic to hold and
it makes it feel like a premium device
the performance is top-notch and even if
it has a lower megapixel the camera
still grabs better images than the e8
now price is an issue that comes in at a
much lower price inspect wise it's a
fantastic phone that can still go
toe-to-toe with any flagship out there
once again guys my name is Kevin O tech
ninja and this is and your authority
your source for all things Android take
care guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
