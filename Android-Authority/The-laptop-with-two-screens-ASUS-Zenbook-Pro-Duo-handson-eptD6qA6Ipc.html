ASUS Zenbook Pro Duo hands-on</b></h2><h5 class="post__date">2019-05-27</h5><div class="container"><div class="video-responsive"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eptD6qA6Ipc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class="post__text">hey guys were here at Computex 2019 and
today we're at the asus event we're
checking out the Asus Zenbook Pro duo so
the concept here is that they had this
screen pad that they put into their
touchpad in their old laptops but now
they've expanded this into like half of
the bottom of the laptop right so
they've moved the keyboard down and
they're using all this extra space as
this giant screen so on the top you've
got this 4k panel it is really really
high resolution and it's actually OLED
and on the bottom here you've got an LCD
display and there are two models of this
laptop one of them has the OLED and it's
4k with the LCD there's also a 14-inch
which has an IPS panel on top and it's a
little bit lower resolution but
basically the idea here is that if you
want to be able to multitask you can put
multiple different windows on this
little touch bar down here so you can
have something like the Microsoft start
open and a quick toggle panel open while
you're browsing a website or if you're
doing something like premiere editing or
Photoshop you can also have a bunch of
different elements down here that you're
interacting with with your finger now
there's also this pen accessory so if
you're actually an artist and you want
to be drawing you can have a reference
photo down here and your main image up
there or you can use it as like a
drawing pad like a Wacom tablet so you
can draw down here and see it update um
now these actually are pretty high spec
laptops too you can have an up to it
Intel for a nine eight core processor
and you can have up to in an NVIDIA GTX
2060 GPU so if you want a game multitask
be doing a lot of art stuff you can
pretty much do everything with this
laptop now I can feel it from here it is
getting pretty hot because you've got
two panels one on the top one at the
bottom of course there's an OLED up here
and then an LCD down here it is getting
pretty warm but it has this interesting
design which allows it to kind of have a
lot more airflow in the bottom because
it's angling the keyboard which makes
the keyboard a little bit more
comfortable to type on and they've also
got another accessory that is a wrist
pad accessory so that you can just do
that a little more comfortably as well
and because they've moved the keyboard
lower on the device you're probably
wondering where the track that is well
that's to the right here which is
actually pretty nice it's kind of a more
comfortable natural mouse position and
if you want to make it a numpad you can
actually hit this little button
and it will turn into a little number
pad so you have a full-size keyboard on
the bottom that's been it for these
