set to release a foldable smartphone by
2017 but they're also coming out with a
smartphone that has a whopping weight
for it
five thousand milliamp hour battery
South Koreans ET News reports that
Samsung is working to mass-produce a
foldable display by the end of this year
with market availability set for 2017
the report cites industry sources noting
Samsung's good progress but it's light
on details
back in January samsung confirmed that
the development of a foldable display is
coming along nicely
but did not offer time for
commercialization one thing to note is
that the development of curved flexible
and foldable displays has been beset
with delays it's been three years in
samsung first presented the vision of a
foldable device and all we've got so far
is a number of tantalizing patents
presumably showing a foldable device
known by the code name project valley
this technology has been in prototype
for a while now but rumor has it that
Samsung is partnering up with several
different manufacturers and distributors
to mass-produce a seven-inch foldable
device this device would have an OLED
display that can fold in half like a
wallet which could mean that it would
effectively be used as a 5-inch
smartphone or a 7-inch tablet now let's
talk the Samsung Galaxy a nine pro for
some weeks now rumors have been floating
around that suggested Samsung had a pro
variant of its recently released to
Galaxy a9 2016 edition preparing for
launch now the product has been
officially announced for the Chinese
market the Galaxy a9 pro will be
released with the product number sm99251
a pure I against 652 system on a chip
for gigabytes of RAM and 32 gigabytes of
on-board storage it also comes with a 16
megapixel rear cam and an 8 megapixel
front-cam as well as a whopping five
thousand milliamp hour battery
it also supports dual SIM microSD card
expansion
an embedded fingerprint sensor on the
home button and also runs Android 6.0
point one marshmallow the Galaxy 9 Pro
will be sold in three colors white rose
gold and pink and will retail for
approximately 3491 or roughly 540 u.s.
dollars alright let's talk the LG g5
controversy and there was a little bit
of drama here we're gonna sort it out
for you
you see LG made a big thing in their
marketing about presenting and building
anticipation for a metal unibody
flagship and they did a very good job of
that because many of you were very
excited about it and jerry-rigged
everything a YouTube channel you're
seeing right here created a teardown
video recently in which he demonstrated
that it was not quite what he had
expected you see he starts to scrape
away the surface of the device and
reveals what he thinks is plastic until
he finally gets to a thin layer of metal
and he makes the argument that that was
perhaps misleading marketing that it
wasn't the metal unibody that he was
expecting now LG did respond officially
they responded to us at indoor Authority
when we approached them and they
responded to other publishers as well
and they made the case that this is not
a plastic covering on the aluminum or
metal unibody it is simply primer paint
it's a thin lightweight paint and they
were painting their metal just like car
manufacturers paint their cars we don't
accuse four-door Toyota of false
advertising because they paint their
metal cars right and that is a fair
response I understand it but the bottom
line is that the textile feel of their
so-called metal unibody device is not
what many people were expecting so my
question to you is did you feel a
difference when you bought your g5 was
it the feel that you would expected or
did it feel less premium I'd love to
hear your opinion I'll be reading them
