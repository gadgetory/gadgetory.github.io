is Jace and this past week saw google
i/o Google's conference for software
developers and they showed us lots of
Android goodies like Android L Android
wear Android auto end right one but
perhaps most interesting was the news
that the rumor surrounding the death of
the Nexus line was perhaps greatly
exaggerated don't worry i won't
exaggerate about how many times you
search no need to get nasty now Google
has now given us the first look at
Android L the successor to Android
KitKat now there's no word as it yet as
to the candy flavored naming convention
could be licorice lollipop personally
I'm voting for life-saving so what's new
here well tons the entire look of the
platform has evolved significantly with
Android L in large part thanks to the
new design language what we refer to in
the past as quantum paper is now called
the material design language the new
language will bring tweaks to grid space
color and topography el release comes
with a flatter look with rounder
elements and softer edges an example of
the new language in Android can be seen
by looking at recent mobile apps like
Google Plus Android L notifications will
now be presented as cards using the
material design interface notifications
on lock screens and shade will be
organized in order of importance instead
of just an order of when they show up
allowing you to address the most
pressing notifications as quickly as
possible now good news for the geeks
among us is that Android L will have its
own power saving mode looking forward to
that now for those of you who got
excited about Android where you'll be
surprised to learn that at Google i/o
google announced that the G watch and
the new Samsung gear live will be
available for order on the Google Play
Store Google provided an on-stage demo
of voice commands notifications and
other actions using devices from both LG
and Motorola we also learned that the
platform will have support for heart
rate monitors pedometers and watches
running the platform will even be able
to activate a music app on your phone
you'll then be able to control your
tunes
using your watch key features of the LG
G watch include a Snapdragon 400
processor a 1.6 5-inch display a four
hundred milliamp hour battery and an
ip67 waterproof body the gear live is
similar in specification and aspect to
the Tizen powered gear neo complete with
a heart rate monitor on the back you get
a 1.6 3 inch AMOLED display 1.2
gigahertz processor 512 megs of ram 4
gigabytes of storage and a 300 million
power battery with an ip67 verification
the gear live will be available in black
and burgundy now personally I'm looking
forward to the Moto 360 which apparently
will be launched later the summer now
we've talked many times about the need
to get quality Android devices into the
emerging markets that's where Android
one comes into play the basic idea
behind Android one is offering the
billions of consumers and various
emerging markets around the world easy
access to a quality smartphone the first
step in this process involves Google
building a set of hardware reference
platforms where OEMs can then build
affordable components for smartphones
giving OEMs a way to provide consumers
with great devices at affordable price
points beginning with the device
manufacturers in india the first Android
one smartphone will be made by micromax
with features that include a 4.5 inch
display dual-sim support a microSD card
slot and FM radio all less for one
hundred dollars now I know what some of
your thinking you're saying Jace what
about Android silver that sounds a lot
like Android silver well we don't really
know for sure because we're not given
all the details we would like but one
could surmise that Android silver is for
more established markets where Android
one is for the emerging markets look
forward to finding out more now we also
found some goodies that suggest the
rumors that HTC is building the next
Nexus tablet might be true according to
android police a device codenamed
volantis is indeed a real Nexus tablet
developed by HTC that will feature
high-end specifications and an aluminum
body it is said to have an 8.9 inch
display an NVIDIA Tegra k1 64-bit
processor two gigabytes of RAM
to 32 gigabytes of storage and 8
megapixel camera and a 3 megapixel
front-facing camera it is expected to
also have front-facing speakers the
rumors suggest the device will cost 399
+ 4 99 respectively thanks for watching
