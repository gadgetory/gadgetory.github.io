a Samsung Huawei Oppo honor you probably
don't know what you're looking at
because as the smartphone industry
matures smartphones look a lot like each
other more and more well that was the
elephone 7 the so-called explosion-proof
phone what has happened to smartphone
design lately
honestly the problem of everyone copying
everyone else has gotten so bad that we
now have phones that look basically the
same as every other phone is it Huawei
vivo Samsung honor Oppo you know the
design world has turned upside down when
xiaomi of all companies has the most
unique design around the world check out
the me mix of course enter the
familiar-sounding and more familiar
sounding looking ella phone 7
notwithstanding what some might consider
a blatant ripoff of the galaxy s7 design
and name the elephone s7 does look
pretty good on paper with a starting
price of just 139 dollars you'd be
hard-pressed to find a better looking
phone for the price especially one with
a curved display now let's talk about
what Sammy might have in store for the
authentic galaxy s 8 now the most recent
rumor of the galaxy s 8 confirmed what
we already knew that the s8 will
probably get a qHD Super AMOLED display
but the latest rumor out of Chinese
blogging site Weibo has it rocking a 5.5
inch 4k display likewise 6 gigabytes of
RAM was always seem to be given other
perfectly logical rumors put a
snapdragon 830 chip which Samsung is
ironically manufacturing for Qualcomm or
Samsung's own Exynos 88-90 5 chipset in
the galaxy s 8 which will vary depending
on the market which you live the s8 is
also expected to arrive with support for
Google's daydream VR as well as of
course Samsung's own USB type-c gear VR
headset the Galaxy s8 is expected to be
unveiled during the Mobile World
Congress 2017 in February with a March
release date what do you guys think
about that rumor 5.5 inches the sweet
spot or
too big now let's talk about more
Samsung rumors and we have an exclusive
render of the Samsung Galaxy a5 2017
these new CAD renders obtained
exclusively by Android Authority in
collaboration with on leaks show the new
design direction Samsung has in store
for the next year's galaxy a5 the render
shows that next year's mid-range err
will inherit the high-end design of this
year's galaxy s7 according to our source
the display of the galaxy a5 2017 comes
in at 5.2 inches
this makes the a5 2017 s footprint
nearly identical to the current a5 but
with a half a millimeter thicker body
hopefully for housing a larger battery
perhaps most interestingly is that the
galaxy a5 2017 will have a side mounted
speaker and it completely flush camera
lens on the back the headphone port is
there but it has switch sides
but the 2017 a5 will make the switch to
USB type-c now a war has been waging
over the past year between messaging
apps they are fighting tooth and nail to
be your number one choice and the latest
want to take a swing for the fences is
Facebook by adding video calling to
whatsapp whatsapp smutch anticipated
video calling functionality is now
rolling out the new free video calling
feature appears to be available only in
the latest whatsapp beta version for now
accessing whatsapp video calls works
much the same as accessing voice calls
tap on the call button in a conversation
and a dialog box will pop up asking you
if you'd wish to place a voice call or a
video call hit video call and now you're
good to go the integration is intuitive
and the new dialog box has added the
bonus of preventing accidental voice
calls so I'd be curious to know from you
guys what is your favorite messaging app
for us it used to be Google Hangouts but
that's less and less so now now that
almost everyone and their dog is on
Facebook people by default are just
using the messenger app what do you guys
think let me know in the comments below
you guys remember from like 15 years ago
when people were making money hand over
fist in the.com bubble
remember we didn't call it a dotnet
bubble or dot-org bubble we didn't call
them dot biz billionaires we called them
dot-com billionaires because that's the
power of a.com now why is that because
no domain name extension tells your
story with the same degree of trust as a
dot-com or dotnet domain name.com and
dotnet domain name extensions inject
credibility into your online presence
