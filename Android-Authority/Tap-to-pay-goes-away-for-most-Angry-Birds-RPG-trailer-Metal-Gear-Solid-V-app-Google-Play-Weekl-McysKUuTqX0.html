Hindy the android authority app guy and
it's Friday which means it's time for
another episode of Google Play weekly in
this week's episode we're going to talk
about the Angry Birds RPG gameplay
trailer a new rumor that suggests that
Google Hangouts and google voice is
going to be merged and finally Google is
killing off tap to pay in Google Wallet
for all devices that are not running
KitKat without further ado let's get
started last week we talked a little bit
about the new angry birds RPG that's
coming out and this week we have some
actual gameplay footage to see alongside
the teaser trailer of the game has had a
soft launch in a few countries around
the world on iOS so we've got a glimpse
of what the game is actually like early
reports are that the in-app purchases
include lives which you lose when you
lose a battle and lucky coins which
start at six dollars and fifty cents for
a pack of 100 and range to 3,000 for a
hundred and twenty four dollars and
ninety-nine cents as usual people are
divided into those who are curious about
the game and those who hate it already
thank you to the in-app purchases I'll
be reserving my final judgment until
after the game actually comes out a not
so new rumor has been circulating around
the internet that states that Google is
going to be killing off google voice and
integrating it directly with google
hangouts this story really shouldn't
surprise anyone because logic dictates
that this is where google was kind of
headed anyway hangouts has already
replaced Google+ messenger as well as
Google Talk and it already allows for
SMS support really the only thing
missing at this point are the features
you get from google voice such as phone
calls and voicemail service the popular
guess is that this will be announced
officially at Google i/o this year and
will likely roll out in the months after
even if makes all the sense in the world
and it does we won't know anything for
sure until google officially announces
it earlier this month we celebrated the
second birthday of the Google Play Store
and this week we're going to be
celebrating the third birthday of the
Amazon Appstore to celebrate amazon is
offering 60 percent off a number of apps
and games over the course of the next
two weeks according to reports the apps
that are on sale will rotate out daily
so those looking to take advantage are
encouraged to check back every day to
see what's on sale in addition select
titles such as sonic dash and The Hobbit
will award those who make in-app
purchases with fifty percent of their
purchase given back to them in the form
of Amazon coins which you
then spend on other apps and games it's
a fairly good offer for those who use
the amazon appstore and the next two
weeks mark an excellent opportunity to
beef up your app library google released
google play services 4.3 this last week
and like most releases it won't have too
much of an impact on the end user just
yet but it does have a whole bunch of
new features for developers the new
update includes a few brand-new api's
for developers including google
analytics tag manager and a new API that
will allow people to autofill their
stored addresses an addition new
functionality was added to invite
friends to multiplayer games and virtual
gifting is now also available of course
it will take app devs a little while to
implement these changes into their games
so for now there's nothing for the end
user to be expecting but keep an eye out
down the road for these new changes if
you use Google Wallet stap to pay
feature and it's on a device that isn't
running android 4.4 kitkat you're about
to get really mad okay so here's what's
going on google announced the whole host
card emulation thing that essentially
negates the need for a secure element
unfortunately this feature was never
backported so the only devices that can
use it our devices that run KitKat since
the secure element is no longer needed
in Kit Kats google has decided to no
longer support it this has made a lot of
people quite angry because about ninety
five percent of people aren't running
KitKat devices and will therefore lose
the ability to use tap to pay we've no
doubt that this will iron itself out
eventually but we agree that Google may
have pulled the trigger a little early
with this one so who wants to see some
trending applications as usual if you
want to check any of these applications
out you can find the links in the
written companion which is in the video
description below pocket casts is among
the most popular and highly rated
podcast apps in the Google Play Store
and its first up this week they recently
updated their application to version 4.5
which includes the all-important to
chromecast supports also included are a
range of fixes and smaller features it's
one of the best out there and it's worth
all four dollars that the developers are
asking for it paypal has done a lot to
their app over the last year or so any
recent update has added even more
security and other features users of
their mastercard feature can now see
their available credit within the
application and paypal will now link
your phone to your account for improved
security all that's needed is the
additional SMS permission some people
may not like that but we tried it and it
only
% the one text message to confirm that
your phone is in fact your phone if you
don't use the app but do use paypal we
recommend you give it a second try
pebble beta 11 is out now and if you
have a pebble and are actively looking
for the latest improvements we recommend
you give it a shot included in this
release are various improvements in
performance and other activities like
side loading applications various
developer oriented improvements and the
app itself apparently loads faster there
are still some issues but like the
Beatles always say it's getting better
all the time so metal gear solid 5 was
released and with it came what could be
one of the best game companion apps
available today if you bought the game
you should definitely check out the
application you can use it as a
standalone app or you can sync it to the
game for more enjoyment it's worth
checking out anyway but if you have the
game on console then you should probably
try the app out as well last up this
week is an app that focuses on finding
all of the apps that are compatible with
the chromecast it's called cast store
and it's a fairly simple premise since
the Play Store is kind of unorganized
for chromecast users this app provides a
place for people can search for apps for
their devices that have chromecast
support if you have a chromecast then
you should probably have this
application to once again I'm Joe Hindy
