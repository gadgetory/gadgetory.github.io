back to Android QA my name is Jason this
is where we try and answer your most
pressing Android questions like when
your teenage son tries to pull you in
the popular game rustling revolution but
if you don't understand how to make your
device flash enabled you can't play that
game on your device and putting that
teenager in his place might mean playing
it out in real life first stop is that
very question regarding flash what is
the best app to watch flash content it's
a very common question Rob and all you
have to do is download this app and have
some CM Punk fun the next question is
you guessed it we always have to have
more battery questions Cyrus asks hi
Jace love your shows I was wondering if
unofficial extended batteries are
trustworthy and reliable for my galaxy
s4
and if any of you are having RAM
problems this next question is for you
Faisal asks why is the RAM on my android
device always near full do I have to
kill the apps from the task manager well
faisal Android is a multitasking
operating system which means the apps
don't really turn off until you tell
them to turn off so when your Samsung
device you hold down the home button
until you get those apps there and then
you can swipe them to close them this
was particularly true with TouchWiz
enabled devices because there's so much
extra going on in the OS but for HTC
Sense there's the home and back button
and for Nexus devices there's a
dedicated button for that but some of
your hardcore geeks out there I can hear
you're saying what about task manager
apps like tasker they're very popular
and yes but you know you need to know
there are some downsides to that they do
kill apps in an unnatural way and some
developers do not support or refuse to
deal with bugs that come from users who
are using task managers because they
kill their apps in an unnatural way they
do not allow the user to use the app in
the way that the developer originally
designed or intended so for most people
the easiest way to simply use the recent
app manager like I demonstrated earlier
thanks for watching a droid army my name
is Jason I wanted to tell you I got lots
of help today from my man the android
authority app guy Joe Hindy you can
check it as great content over here as
you can with Josh and Kevin the tech
ninja but you won't want to know what
your homework was for this week and I
wanted you to answer this question from
Crytek jasa have a question I've got a
nexus 5 but I realized I can't change
the lock screen wallpaper to something
else like I could have with my atrix 4g

without rooting my phone or installing a
custom lock screen app i love the stock
google you I that's your homework for
this week android army the first person
to answer Crytek's question conclusively
