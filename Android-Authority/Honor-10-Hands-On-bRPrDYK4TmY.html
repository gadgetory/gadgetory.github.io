and light catching handset from honor
that seemingly offers a lot of features
for a decent asking price for those that
like the looks of the wire way P 20 Pro
but don't quite have the necessary
budget this could be the answer first
thing you'll notice is that appearance
which in keeping with the other Huawei
and honor devices is achieved through
the incredibly shimmery and really quite
beautiful aurora glass he uses an
industry-first colour reflection coating
with 3d glass and 15 different layers to
achieve the effect the handset comes in
a host of aspirational sounding colors
to phantom blue phantom green midnight
black and glacier grey they sound like
superheroes also interesting from a
design point of view is an ultrasonic
fingerprint sensor that works even when
your fingers are wet for those secret
service members with no fingerprints
though face unlock is also present of
course you've already ever notice the
notch here which sits at the top of a
five-point 84 inch IPS LCD full view
display with a 19 by 9 aspect ratio and
to 280 by 1080p resolution the good news
for those that anti not which is more
than a few of you is that there's also
the option to hide that notch in the
settings this will add black borders on
either side which will essentially make
it invisible own there's a headphone
jack
inside is a Kirin 970 processor with 4
gigabytes of RAM that's right the same
Kirin 970 found in the p20 pro with all
of its NPU goodness but for a fraction
of the price you'll get 64 gigabytes or
128 gigabytes of storage though there
may be some regional variations here the
operating system is Android 8.1 Oreo
though it's running the divisive Mui UI
layer on top of that and a three
thousand four hundred million power
battery will keep all of this running
but of course after the p20 pray what
you probably really want to know about
is that camera well while the 10 loses a
lens and that lights your branding it's
still an impressive showing it's a 24
megapixel rear camera backed up by a 16
megapixel secondary lens and you'll get
a wide F 1.8 aperture and three-in-one
faster focusing likely on a v10 and the
why away P 20 s you'll also benefit from
all the fancy AI photography features
like seen an object recognition and an
AI portrait mode
thanks to that NPU and Instagram lovers
will be pleased to know the front-facing
camera is no slouch either with 24
megapixels and a host of features all
its own in short then this is a
remarkable sounding device on paper
considering the very low 399 pound
asking price here in the UK that
affordable premium category is starting
to get pretty darn competitive whether
or not it backs all this up in practice
remains to be seen but you can be sure
we'll be putting it through its paces in
