and this is the new cat phone the s60
one now let's get this out of the way
right now it isn't what I would call a
pretty phone but that's fine because it
isn't meant to be you might know
caterpillar from their giant yellow
construction vehicles but they're not
new to the smartphone game the original
s60 was the first smartphone with a
thermal camera and the s60 one is an
upgraded version that improves upon that
functionality in a few significant ways
the first is that it's simply a better
camera so the image quality in the fli
our thermal imaging camera is a little
more refined than in the previous model
the range was also increased so that it
can pick up temperatures up to 400
degrees Celsius that's 752 degrees
Fahrenheit for Americans like me it's
pretty cool to use but the experience
wasn't as snappy as I would have liked
before I was able to go full snake mode
and seeing thermal vision I had to deal
with the app crashing twice but once I
got it going it was definitely one of
the cooler things I've seen here at MWC
the slight lag is probably because the
phone is running what I can only assume
is some pretty resource-intensive
software all on a fairly mid-range chip
the Snapdragon 630 now the phone is
running Android Oreo and Caterpillar
promise that it's going to receive an
update to Android Pop Tart when it gets
announced but we'll have to wait and see
how timely that happens
besides thermal vision there are also
some other pretty nifty tools built into
the phone like a laser distance
measuring tool and air quality sensor
not exactly features that the masses
will be rushing to the stores to get but
for people that work in particular
fields they're really useful features
that you can have right on the phone in
your pocket speaking of which if you
haven't noticed already this phone is
big and bulky and it feels like you're
holding a small brick in your hand but
it also feels built like a tank it's
aluminum edges and hard plastic
construction is not only durable with an
IP 68 certification that means it's dust
proof and can be submerged for up to an
hour in 3 meters of water but it's also
surprisingly grippy which should help to
minimize drops though even if you do
drop it Kat claims that it will survive
falls on solid concrete up to 1.8 meters
in height
the display is 5.2 inches and made of
Gorilla Glass 5
but don't expect any breathtaking
visuals it was a good screen but not a
great one at least from what we
experienced on the show floor by default
the phone comes with 64 gigabytes of
storage but next to the SIM card tray on
the left side is a micro SD card slot
for expandable memory under that there's
this yellow multifunction button that I
find to be the best part about the phone
design-wise
I'm all for colored buttons like the
ones on the pixel 2 and the fact that
this one is the same orange yellowish
color that you see at construction sites
is pretty clever the selfie camera is 8
megapixels while the back camera is
rocking a 16 megapixel shooter that's
also capable of shooting 4k video now
again this phone isn't much of a looker
but I really didn't like the weird hump
that it has along the top it could be
because of the CIT branding but I found
it to be a little obtrusive in a way
that's too much even for a giant phone
like this as far as actually using the
phone I found the buttons to be clicky
and responsive and they're spaced apart
nicely so that even with gloves you
probably won't have a problem doing what
you need to do speaking of which the
screen also works if you're wearing
gloves so there's that now there are a
bunch of other useful applications that
we weren't able to set out on the show
floor like built-in vehicle diagnostics
and asphalt monitoring but overall
everything that we tried worked pretty
well now if this sounds like the perfect
phone for you then you better start
saving your pennies because it's going
to cost 899 euros that's basically a
thousand US dollars but I can't see
construction companies buying these
without a second thought just because of
the durability what you sacrifice and
aesthetics you gain in hardware saved
for the chipset but it's good to see
that sneech continued to be filled what
do you think of the cat s60 one let us
know in the comments down below and

haven't already and of course click that
