brought to you by domain.com so now
you've seen the Samsung Galaxy s6 and s6
edge and probably the HTC One m9 but
there's a whole lot more going on at the
Mobile World Congress so let's start off
with Sony Xperia z4 tablet which looks
like a lot of raw power in a crazy thin
device in terms of design they
experience that for tablet looks a lot
like its smaller sibling the Xperia z3
tablet compact the same design language
features rounded edges and is used to
great success on the 10.1 model and
amazingly SONA managed to make the
tablet that four even slimmer at 6.1
millimeters compared to the six point
four millimeters on the previous
generation the device weighs just 389
grams which is pretty impressive for
this class and yes the device is still
water-resistant
the thinner body doesn't bring a
decrease in battery capacity however the
Zed 4 tablet features a six thousand
milliamp power unit the same is on the
z2 now the screen is quad HD which is a
welcome change but that may take a
slight hit and battery life unless sony
has found a way to mitigate the issue
the experience that for tablet is the
first slate to feature a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 810 processor featuring four
fast cores and four power-saving cores
arranged in a big dot little
configuration as well as an adrenal 430
GPU there's three gigabytes ram 16
gigabytes or 32 gigabytes of storage and
microSD support the main camera has been
switched to an 8 megapixel sensor down
from a 13 megapixel in the previous
generation now google has also confirmed
at the Mobile World Congress that there
will be an Android pay API Google
intends for Android pay to become the
standard for mobile payments with the
API allowing for other parties to take
Android pay and integrate it into their
own services and apps essentially
Android pay will be the backbone behind
transactions and software meaning that
it can continue to work with Google
Wallet 2 as you may expect Android pay
makes use of your phones NFC connection
to transfer payments and will eventually
support biometric security measures to
act as a confirmation as well speaking
about security though Android pay also
implements token
card numbers to prevent stolen data from
causing a problem and card data is
stored locally on your device meaning
that you can use it without a network
connection and there's little risk of
someone intercepting vital data
over-the-air no although Google didn't
give us an exact date on when Android
pay will roll out we do expect to hear
more news in and around at Google i/o
now what could quite possibly be the
biggest news at the Mobile World
Congress is that Google announced that
they're entering the carrier market sort
of do you hear that I hear angels
singing we've heard rumors about how
Google might get into the wireless game
for years now but last month these
whispers started to gain more momentum
and several big publications claimed
that Google was launching its own
carrier service now at Moga will
Congress 2015 sundar Pichai has
confirmed that Google is gearing up to
launch its own MVNO which stands for
mobile virtual network operator in the
coming months during an on-stage
interview pachai was asked about the
rumors regarding a google MVNO and
decided to shed a little light while he
didn't get into specifics but I said
Google has no plans to be a carrier at
scale and we're working with existing
partners he further iterated that they
had talked to carriers like Verizon and
AT&amp;amp;T and are working to ensure that
Google's efforts don't get in the way of
existing relationships with big carriers
Pichai says the goal is to merge Wi-Fi
and cellular service in interesting new
ways and isn't necessarily about
changing Wireless pricing structures
although that could still be at play
Google wants to do new things in this
space like eliminate some of the
frustration caused by dropped calls like
creating a way to automatically
reconnect calls when one or both lines
are dropped unexpectedly and in an
unexpected partnership Samsung and IKEA
have joined up to help you charge your
devices on your couch literally Korea's
largest OEM and Sweden's most famous
furniture store are bringing a brand new
partnership to your living room and
bedroom and just about any room in your
house or office starting next month IKEA
will begin selling furniture with
wireless charging capabilities in Europe
and North America with a global rollout
thereafter this coincides nicely with
the April tenth release of the Gow
see s6 and the s6 edge the possibilities
are endless really imagine a table or
one or more corners containing a hot
spot to place your phone for power
regeneration consider a sofa with
wireless charging module built into the
arm sounds pretty cool I don't seem to
