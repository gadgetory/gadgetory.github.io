its biggest challenges one of Samsung's
finest phones to date this is Joshua
Carr from Android authority what's going
on everybody and this is the oneplus 2
versus the Samsung Galaxy s6 design is a
big button topic for both of these
devices as both companies made some real
changes to their formulas the Samsung
Galaxy s6 is still a Samsung device
through and through in shape and button
layout and it includes the fingerprint
reader embedded in the iconic home
button though no real surprises to be
found until material choices are put
into play a metal chassis frame and dual
glass panel construction make this one
of the first galaxy s devices to no
longer sport a removable backing which
has been a bummer to most this is
because the removable battery and the
micro SD card slot have gone by the
wayside
that said however this is one of the
most premium and sleekest feeling galaxy
s devices we've seen in health now five
point one inches in the screen size keep
the phone from feeling either too small
nor too big which is a boon to those who
require good handling experiences from
their high-end smartphones and though
the glass construction might make this
phone one of the most fingerprint prone
this phone is now considered the
beginning of Samsung's past year of good
design
now the oneplus 2 also made some changes
mainly in adding a metallic frame of its
own the metal does a good job of making
this phone feel quite premium and the
stock sandstone black material
differentiates it from basically any
other phone in the market the 2 now has
a slightly smaller footprint compared to
the original which helps in handling
because the 5.5 inch screen does toe the
line of comfort buttons and design
elements around the device deserve
mention especially the alert slider on
the left side the slowest slider works
as a notification toggle and an easy way
of silencing the phone the home button
is recessed now and flanked by back in
recent apps buttons though the real
story is the fingerprint reader smack
dab in the middle that is always firing
this makes for an easy way of unlocking
the phone even when the screen is off
and finally on the bottom the move to
USB type-c for the charging port is a
change that might take some getting used
to the new cord means that all microUSB
cables go in a drawer or more commonly
the oneplus cable is always on the mind
just so you don't forget it the galaxy
s6 despite being pretty different now
still
has a classic Samsung feel the metal and
glass does remove a couple of key
features but the result is still one of
the most attractive yet accessible
packages available even if it might be a
little delicate oneplus does make the
backing removable in the two with
replacement materials available for a
customizable look but even it cannot
boast microSD card support or
replaceable batteries but it is in
display is that we see some real
differences between these devices as the
Samsung Galaxy s6 sports quad HD in a
5.1 inch screen the Super AMOLED display
brings incredible colors and makes
everything look great from gaming to
text to videos and with a 2560 by 1440
resolution in the conventional size of a
screen performance and enjoyment or
where a flagship smartphone should be
now it is true that the s6 edge and the
larger s6 edge+
bring curved sides to the phone but
aside from helping with handling their
additions don't add much to what is
already a pretty good display experience
compare that to the 5.5 inch screen on
the oneplus 2 which does not come with a
quad HD display likely to keep the cost
down for this year's iteration people
may not have been very happy with this
choice for the oneplus 2 but that
doesn't mean that the display isn't
great still a bit more color and
brightness has been added in for an even
more enjoyable experience which does
just as well with all the same tasks as
the galaxy s6 does typical users will
not be able to tell the difference
between full and quad HD so there is
little reason to think that the oneplus
2 is so far back from the s6 in the
display department unless you are really
speck hangry the main thing the galaxy
s6 has over the oneplus 2 is higher
color saturation because for many users
more coloration means more enjoyment so
Samsung definitely has that portion
locked down but we will give the oneplus
2 marks for still being a really good
display experience even if quad HD is
the flagship box that it just cannot
tick off performance though is really no
problem for either of these phones as
the current best of Qualcomm Snapdragon
Series goes up against a very powerful
Samsung made SOC the Snapdragon 810
powers the oneplus 2 which includes 4
gigabytes of RAM and the audrina 434
graphics now there's no doubt that sheer
power is available due to the a-10 and
oxygen OS can mostly be to blame for any
of the little bugs and stutters that we
have thus far seen in use
which games don't have any trouble
running and the same goes for pretty
much any other tasks for work and play
moving around various apps in the recent
apps screen is as much a breeze as it
needs to be the same can be said for the
ik sino 7420 that is found in the galaxy
s6 the coming out party for Samsung's
own processing packages now found across
the board Samsung is putting faith in
its in-house processor to bring the
performance that users need with 4
gigabytes of RAM multitasking is not
hard at all even with features like the
S window and the multi window demanding
more than just moving in and out of the
recent map screen and with the tone down
TouchWiz software suite it isn't hard to
see just how fast this phone can go when
everything Samsung used to throw in your
face is finally removed or at least
hidden from view performance is one
place where we do see the oneplus 2
really standing toe-to-toe with current
flagships as it manages to keep up with
the powerful XE notes found in the s6
oxygen OS still needs a few bug fixes
here and there but once it is optimized
we have no doubt that the day-to-day
experience of the two will be as sublime
as it is in the Samsung phone now a
flagship killer has to provide the same
overall features as the competition at
the very least and the oneplus 2
definitely has a lot to offer in its
extra hardware it starts with the
fingerprint reader embedded underneath
the recessed home button which works
quite well to unlock the phone without
having to wake it while we did have some
trouble with pressing the home button
and getting the fingerprint to register
properly these issues only happens from
time to time
the second big addition is the alert
slider which basically does what it sets
out to switches among the different
notification modes of lollipop which are
all priority or none if you aren't
already the kind of person that keeps
the phone on silent all the time the
alert slider might be your best friend
as it is easy to feel for and toggle
when on a table or in the pocket so
silencing the phone is a quick and easy
task dual-sim capabilities might be a
little lost on users in the West but
when you need to take calls on one card
and receive your data on the other the
oneplus 2 is able to handle such tasks
out of the box Travel will be the main
use case scenario here but we already
have a couple of people in the Android
authority ranks that require a sim for
data and assume for everything else and
the oneplus 2 has delivered for them USB
type-c is the new charging standard but
there are some issues with the
implementation
mainly the fact that it is not fast
charging yes despite the Snapdragon 810
built-in quick charge is not available
for usage wireless charging and NFC go
by the wayside
making this a phone that requires a
tether for any and all related tasks
that said though we have seen some great
battery life from the oneplus 2 the 3300
milliamp hour battery brought us as much
as five hours of screen on time in a
typical day but taking the long time to
charge the device might be the
compromise that users will have to make
the galaxy s6 brings its own suite of
features and it starts with all the
wireless capabilities wireless charging
is available out of the box and fast
charging is a benefit many users have
come to rely upon you may have to though
as the 2550 million power battery brings
a pretty standard amount of longevity to
typical days the compromise here swings
the other way as the average battery
life can easily be replenished in about
an hour
Samsung's own fingerprint reader is
embedded in the tactile home button
meaning that waking the phone by
pressing it is required that said it is
just as fast as oneplus as iteration and
posed its own infrequent reading issues
making both of our devices pretty much
tie in testing and as Samsung tries to
make phones that do everything the heart
rate sensor on the back of the phone
returns and comes with an updated
version of s health it is nice to check
heart rate or even stress levels from
time to time though we will stop short
of calling it a complete health tool for
anyone really serious about fitness so
its heart rate monitoring or ringtone
monitoring fast charging or larger
battery capacity and finding a dual sim
model or having it out of the box in
hardware it's a toss-up but we do give
oneplus a lot of credit for closing the
gap in this particular aspect the
oneplus 2 had one place to truly excel
in order to be considered a real
flagship killer the camera and at first
glance it isn't off to a great start the
camera app is a modified version of the
Google camera and misses a number of
modes and manual controls that have
become commonplace and plenty of this
year's high-end releases manual controls
and perhaps a raw capture mode would be
needed to make this a true camera
companion for anyone serious about
photography and even then the camera app
isn't the fastest we've seen despite the
additions of OIS and laser autofocus in
the camera package autofocus does see a
little bit of an improvement
despite the Oh is getting stifled by the
camera app which typically goes for
slower shutter speeds and that basically
stifles the stabilization we have been
told that an update to the camera
software will include manual controls
and further optimizations
but honestly those don't seem to come
soon enough now before we get into
picture quality let's contrast the
camera applications the galaxy s6
benefits from a long pedigree of
full-featured camera packages and with
optical image stabilization this 16
megapixel shooter boasts not only manual
controls but plenty of other modes that
can take advantage of what has
historically been very good camera
quality the manual mode does add quite a
bit of control even if it isn't as
granular as a couple of other cameras
we've seen in the market by far the best
part of the galaxy s6 camera is the
speed of opening and using it DoubleTap
the home button and you're ready to go
with capture speed pretty much where it
needs to be for fast shooting the
oneplus 2 delivers some good photos
without really going for and beyond for
most pictures when zoomed out the
pictures look great for a myriad of uses
like social media but zoom in even a
little bit and the lack of detail can be
observed the galaxy s6 manages to get a
little more detail out of its pictures
though its coloration can be a little
much for any photography purists HDR is
often up to interpretations by all
companies and in the oneplus 2 we do see
quite a bit more dynamic range as dark
areas or brightened and vice-versa
though the s6 might not be as drastic in
its HDR mode it is still more detailed
than the shots found in the oneplus 2
and in low-light shots the main issue is
the oneplus 2 application choosing those
really slow shutter speeds over anything
else
OAS is unable to do its job if the hands
have to remain steady for longer than a
fraction of a second and as a result the
already very grainy low-light shots are
not only motion blurred out but more
importantly tougher to capture though we
would like to see someone surpass even
Samsung in the smartphone camera
department we definitely are not going
to see it getting killed by the camera
of the oneplus 2 and finally in software
we see a stripping down of user
interfaces starting with Samsung there
was a renaissance of sorts when much of
what we called bloat in TouchWiz simply
disappeared gone are the large amount of
tutorials that we'll get in the users
face and quite a few of the built-in
extras can
actually be disabled like the briefing
on News homescreen what results is
probably the most accessible version of
Samsung's software to date but the
usable features are mostly from
multitasking like the multi window which
brings the same abilities as before for
anyone that needs to do two things at
once the S window is still available by
dragging down from the top corner but
TouchWiz actually isn't in a hurry to
make you use it for most intents and
purposes oxygen is a modified stock
Android interface with a few additions
built in these include the gestures for
the turned off screen and the ability to
change up the capacitive keys for
on-screen soft keys app permissions do
come in oxygen ahead of the marshmallow
release and though they may not be used
all the time anyone interested in
security will appreciate the insight and
finally for the daily use case the Shelf
is oxygens version of an extra
homescreen that houses a number of
user-defined widgets under frequently
used applications and frequently
contacted contacts now don't get us
wrong we love stock Android and oneplus
has done a good job of leveraging it to
Oxygen's advantage but TouchWiz has been
through a renaissance that brings tons
of functionality and as Spartan a
package as we've ever seen it oxygen
does have some issues with certain bugs
and stutters but they should be fixed
with upcoming updates but we'll make the
oneplus package even better is software
that is as different on the inside as
the phone already is on the outside but
price has the potential to be a real
trump card one that oneplus has been
able to leverage before at $329 the two
is almost half the price of the galaxy
s6 which can go as high as $700 for the
s6 edge and 579 for the s6 proper but as
far as being a flagship killer that is a
name that the oneplus 2 just doesn't
live up to this year while it is able to
match the performance and even the
hardware packages of many current
flagship smartphones it doesn't do
enough to really excel and surpass
phones like the galaxy s6 the lack of
quad HD is a small difference in
hindsight but for us here at Android
authority the lack of quality in the
camera simply puts the oneplus 2 behind
not to mention a few other features that
Samsung's phones can boast fast charging
wireless charging and the ability to
leverage upcoming Wireless forms of
payments despite some forward-thinking
in the new USB port standard and the
inclusion of the alert slider and either
our killer features that really put the
oneplus 2 higher than any of the rest of
the competition now the price of the
oneplus 2 makes it a compelling choice
if the extras of the galaxy s6 don't do
it for you
but you get what you pay for and what
the oneplus 2 lacks makes its price
point makes sense rather than making it
the killer that it claims to be as
always thank you guys very much for
watching and I hope you enjoyed this vs.
between the oneplus 2 and the Samsung
Galaxy s6 if there was one flagship that
the oneplus 2 had to be pitted against
it was the s6 now even though the
oneplus 2 is unable to live up to the
name flagship killer it did stand
toe-to-toe to the s6 in a number of key
aspects but the overall quality of the
s6 package especially when you consider
its camera are really what we put points
into in favor of the s6 that being said
however the lower price of the oneplus 2
is pretty compelling so if that is what
you require out of your smartphone then
more power to you as the oneplus 2 is a
pretty good bang for bug smart phone
still with all of that make sure you
stay tuned to Android for even more and
