brought to you by domain.com hello again
ladies gentlemen I'm Joe Hindy the
android authority app guy and welcome
back to Android apps weekly let's jump
right into some headlines nintendo
announced this week that they'll be
partnering with DNA to bring nintendo
games to mobile some are happy about it
others are not but we also heard that
nintendo will be developing a lot of the
games in house as well which is really
exciting news the latest humble bundles
out now and includes seven titles for
you to buy with more to come there are
one hundred and thirty-six dollars worth
of games in the bundle and it's a great
way to get cheap games and donate to
charity Square Enix and DNA are teaming
up to build Final Fantasy record keeper
which is due out this spring to promote
the title there's a contest where the
winner will become part of the game
itself that's practically every Final
Fantasy fans dream come true google has
implemented some new changes to the Play
Store this week the first is a new age
based rating system to show what age
ranges apps and games are suited for
they also now manually check every
application that makes its way into the
google play store to make sure that it's
safe in our last bit of news this week
Microsoft has announced that Cortana
will be headed to both iOS and Android
most probably won't jump ship from
google now but this is an interesting
move by Microsoft that may make people
actually want to try it out for a
complete list of all the headlines app
updates and app releases don't forget to
check out our newsletter I curate it
myself every week and it goes out to
your inbox every Friday or you can
simply bookmark it and check it out
yourself every Friday the choice is
yours okay folks let's take a look at
some new apps and games that were
released this week as usual if you want
to check any of these out for yourself
you can find the links in the video
description below fun fit is an
application developed by HTC that pretty
much anyone can use fun fit as a workout
application that helps you plan daily
workouts count steps count calories and
more there are charged to track your
performance facebook integration and
personalization options we wish there
was Google+ support too but overall it's
a solid workout application for those
who need something simple Angry Birds
Stella pop is a new time waster out of
rocio this one is a bubble popping game
that uses characters and some gameplay
mechanics of prior Angry Birds titles as
per the norm levels get more difficult
to further a bladder you get and there
are a few different puzzle types to keep
things fresh it's not amazing but it's
it especially for kids motion tennis
cast is an Android game that uses your
chromecast to play this unique concept
uses your phone like a controller and
your TV as the main screen and you play
tennis by swinging your phone around
it's very much like a wii game and
definitely one of the more unique
android games that we've ever seen it's
a work in progress will be patient with
the bugs but otherwise it's a fun play
Lego Marvel Super Heroes is a pseudo
hack and slash game where you play as
one of 91 characters including the
Avengers and a lot more it comes with 45
mission battles against well-known
supervillains and there are even
multiple sets of controls so you can
find one that suits you best the only
caveat is that it's rather large
weighing in at 2.2 gigabytes so do be
aware of that Dungeon Hunter 5 was
released this last week and it contains
many of the same elements as prior games
including online co-op play at
single-player campaign events and the
action RPG style game mechanics it is
freemium and that may upset some people
but most of the consumer complaints are
due to release date bugs and not the
freemium content which is a good sign
it's a good action RPG if you're
interested thanks again for watching
everybody but let's get down to some
business if you ever think of starting
