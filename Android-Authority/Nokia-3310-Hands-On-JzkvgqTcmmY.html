authority and it's an oldie but boy is
it a goodie it's a phone that's been
memed countless amount of times and it's
a classic that refuses to die this is
the Nokia 3310 revamp for 2017 and
designed purely for fun and nostalgia
and when I say nostalgia I mean that in
every sense of the word it's got super
fast 2g data the ability to text or good
old fashioned t9 make a phone call do
some basic web browsing and that's about
it
oh yeah and because it doesn't do much
this thing can last you up to a month on
a single charge went on standby pretty
incredible considering in this day and
age we're happy if our phone glasses
just a single day this phone was also a
phone that could literally fit in the
palm of your hand and with phones
getting thinner and bezels getting
smaller the 3310 still makes the
modern-day smartphone look gigantic a
3310 of course would not be complete
without the game of snake and I have to
admit this game brings back so many
memories it's back in better than ever
it's about as classic SD phone itself
and you know you were good at this game
when you can fill up the entire screen
with the snake however we are not
savages and there were a couple of
upgrades to modern nicely 3310 it's got
a colored screen now instead of black
and white a new glossy paint job a
microUSB port for charging a whopping 2
megapixel camera on the rear and even
has a micro SD card slot unlike some
phones out there it also comes with a
headphone jack if you want to get your
hands on it it will be available in q2
of this year with the rest of Nokia's
new lineup for a low low price of 49
euros and if the price that's totally
worth it solely for the memories and
nostalgia that this phone brings as
