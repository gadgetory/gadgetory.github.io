Authority and I'm here at the Google
event taking a look at some of the new
home products that Google just announced
we have the Google home Mini and the
Google home max these are complementary
devices to the original Google home
we'll start with the Google home Mini
which is as the name suggests it's a
smaller version of the Google home and
it's pretty much meant to be a direct
competitor competitor to the echo dot
from Amazon so the Google whole Mini
it's really tiny Google says it's the
size of a doughnut but you should not
eat it because it's not edible
it's made of a combination of plastic
and fabric so it has a plastic base and
then fabric on the top and Google says
this is made purely from scratch and it
comes in three different colors so you
have the gray that you see here but you
also have black and red as well and
there's four LED indicators on the top
here to let you know that it's actively
working and it's also touch controlled
as well so the fabric is where you'll be
conducting all of your touch gestures
and things like that there's only one
single speaker on the inside of the
Google home mini so it's not gonna be
quite as loud as the original Google
home but if you want even louder sound
you can actually hook this up to a
chromecast enabled device and if you
want even more sound you can get the
Google home max which is basically the
Big Daddy of the bunch here it has two
speakers on the inside it's super loud
it sounds incredible and Google says it
has this smart surround technology or a
smart sound technology that will
actually analyze the area that it's in
whether it's in the corner of a room or
whether it's in the middle of room it'll
optimize the sound to give you the best
sound quality possible and there's also
a touch bar up top here where you can
slide across and control the volume and
things like that
the smaller Google home Mini has a micro
USB port on the back which I thought was
kind of weird that if they went with mic
USB but it is what it is and it's going
to run you $49 so it's really
inexpensive it's available pre-orders
start today and it'll be available
and retailers starting October 19th and
the Google home max will be available in
December for 399 so you have a variety
of options now with the Google home
devices you have the mini the regular
Google home and the Google home max so
that's pretty much it that's a quick
look at the new Google home devices that
were announced here at the pixel event
