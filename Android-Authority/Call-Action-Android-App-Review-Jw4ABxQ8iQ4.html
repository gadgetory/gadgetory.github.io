authority today we will be looking at
call actions call actions as an app that
helps you stay organized from call to
call after each call you make and pop up
will fill your screen giving you options
such as add color to contacts text them
share their contact information and marv
as you can see there are many options to
choose from playing with it as the best
way to figure out how it works call
actions is ready to go after you install
it no adjustments are necessary I do
recommend tweaking the settings though
in settings you can choose the colors
you want to use in the pop-up gives you
many options choose from especially with
colors otherwise you can use the random
colors also you can turn the app on and
off four times you need you don't need
call action in more settings you can
really fine-tuned app to your liking
here you have actions notifications and
reminders in actions you can set up call
actions behaviors when it will close
when call action will show up and so on
in notifications the options are a
little limited last call notification is
the only option not grayed out here you
can activate a persistent notification
in the pull down menu of the last call
made I like this feature but I think it
would be more helpful if it called back
the last number missed dialed or
received not just the last call made
either way i like the feature and
reminders it again lets you fine-tune
some of the behavior of the app when
certain windows pop up and how they look
in more settings you really can get this
app to behave how you want it call
actions really helped me stay organized
and save time it helped me streamline my
after call routine generally down to one
click my only complaint is that the app
had plenty of customization but living
of presets for color layout otherwise
the app was stable and had no effects on
battery life I highly recommend you give
the app a shot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
