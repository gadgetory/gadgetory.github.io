Clayton representing Angela 30.com today
I'm bringing you an unboxing of the
Samsung Galaxy s3 in white this is the
Sprint version the 16 gigabyte ma mind
you this is just the unboxing we're
gonna have a full review on our website
and YouTube coming up shortly but this
is just to give you an idea of what the
device looks like coming right out of
the box if you happen to order one of
the sprint model okay guys we'll just go
over some of the cool stuff that's here
on the back of the box the specs we've
got 4G capable of radios we've got our
four point eight inch HD Super AMOLED
display we got the 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core processor that's the
Snapdragon s4 now these US devices also
come with two gigabytes of RAM anyways
we've got an 8 megapixel rear-facing
camera that the AllShare Play app it's
NFC enabled and this device actually
came with some of Samsung's tech tiles
which will demo in the full review
they're NFC tags is we've got our other
aspects such as a full HD 1080p video
recording and yeah let's just get into
the unboxing slide the top off here that
our Samsung Galaxy s3 here's our sprint
model take it out of the box we've got
all our plastic on here a little bit of
instructions
got a carrier branding right here on the
back and we didn't have anything on the
screen now I've got my international
version of the samsung galaxy s3 as well
as the pebble blue t-mobile version will
just compare those really quick first
this is the international version on the
left as you can see there are absolutely
no visible differences besides the
carrier branding the location of the
galaxy s3 logo everything is just the
same and then we have our pebble blue
version with t-mobile everything is the
same there as well anyways we'll just
remove the backing on this to show you
the expandable memory now this has an
internal SIM card we don't have the
actual SIM slot that'll be the
difference between the international
version of this as you can see we have
our SIM slot on the International
Version and we even have the same slot
on the t-mobile pebble blue version but
we will just pop the back on and we'll
open up the contents of the box
now in the box we have our getting
started manuals with Sprint everything
we need to know we've got it in our
languages here got important information
the samsung SP hl7 10 then we have a
little box here you have our old cell
phone away to sprint well it looks like
it's for a good cause
help kids stay safer in line anyways
deeper in the box we've got our AC
adapter for charging our USB cable pair
of earbuds and some different adapters
for the earbuds different size earbuds
that is just screwed everything out of
the way and power the device on for the
very first time
just hold the power button
powerup Samsung Galaxy s3
at our sprint boot up animation of
course 4G LTE feels nice lightweight got
a chrome accents we'll just get her
booted up real quick
don't even have to go through all the
Google stuff and we'll just compare it
once again to our international version
as far as lockscreen
I'm not going to activate that real
quick bring it back here the same
widgets come pre-loaded okay so in the
app tray you guys we can see some of the
stuff that a sprint puts on here we
don't have too much we just have the
voicemail the Sprint zone and they
sprint hotspot as well as a few widgets
not too much below where it's nice to
see actually but we'll get into our full
review here check back you guys to our
YouTube and our website and we'll have a
comparison between all the galaxy s3s
and a full review individually so keep
tuned with Android authority comm guys
