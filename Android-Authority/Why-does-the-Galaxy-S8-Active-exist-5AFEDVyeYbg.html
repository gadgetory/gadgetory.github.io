ro what's going on everybody
and I actually don't really mean to be
so harsh when it comes to this phone the
Galaxy s8 active it's available on AT&amp;amp;T
and you can of course get it on that
carrier if you're looking for a
ruggedized version of the galaxy s 8 or
the SI plus but I wanted to go through a
few reasons why I think the active line
has kind of lost its way it finds itself
in a very interesting position because
it's trying to provide features that are
different from its original counterparts
but the original counterparts are kind
of already stellar so before I kind of
rant about a couple of the pet peeves
that I have with the galaxy s 8 active I
do want to give you guys a bit of a
story back in 2015 I went to e3 and I
was fulfilling a bit of a personal dream
by going to one of the biggest gaming
conventions but I was distracted the
entire time because just a couple of
months prior to that
they announced the Samsung Galaxy s6
active now the galaxy s5 active did come
out just a year prior so the active line
wasn't necessarily new but I loved the
look of especially the stealth of black
s6 active and I knew I just had to get
my hands on it and once I did I realized
why I really did love that device it was
at that point that Samsung changed their
design language with the galaxy s6 to
glass on glass with a metal body whereas
glass on glass bodies were going to
become the future of our smartphones I
was trying to cling to a past where we
had sturdier meteor plastic phones in
comparison to all of the phones we have
let's say today which kind of go for a
slimmer let's say more delicate design
and I still kind of feel the same way
about phones today we have so many glass
on glass designs right now that plastic
phones like this are incredibly rare and
if you saw my daily driver video
regarding the BlackBerry key one you
could tell that I gravitate towards
phones that don't really follow that
pack but then there comes a bit of a
problem while the Galaxy s8 active is
still continuing everything that the
active line does putting great
specifications from the original Galaxy
S device and putting it into a meteor
body unfortunately the original galaxy
line has already perfected its own
design Samsung has made the infinity
display not only a great piece of eye
candy but one of the main features and
the main ways that Samsung can put a
larger screen on a smaller device so
it's because of that that the Galaxy s8
active doesn't really put off the same
good vibes that the Galax
the s6 active had one I bought it the
bezels are so much bigger than we're now
used to with all of the phones that have
very minimal bezels and the phone has a
hep to that while welcome is contrary to
the kind of slim and light bodies that
were once four and a few years ago but
are now the norm now there are very
valid reasons to go for a phone like
this because if you're going to drop
your phone and you have those
butterfingers or you just really clumsy
all the time and you drop this phone
you're just gonna get scuffs on the back
or on the sides and it's probably gonna
bounce right back unfortunately when it
comes to all of the other phones in
Samsung's camp if you were to drop the
phone one side of glass could
potentially crack or shatter now don't
get too ahead of yourselves I won't be
dropping this phone yet there is another
phone out there that has protection
despite not needing a different kind of
body and that is the LG v 30 now we
don't have our full production news of
the LG v 30 yet but what we do know is
that it is supposed to be not only IP
certified but also have milspec
protection and when the time comes we're
probably going to pit the Galaxy s8
active against the LGV 30 and see which
one actually comes out on top and if a
body like the s8 active is actually
required anymore but not all of it is
bad like I said I'm not trying to just
trash on the galaxy s 8 active there are
just a few things that made me think
about whether or not a phone like this
but they used to love a couple of
generations ago should even exist
anymore but a lot of what people love
about the active line does return you
get this kind of body with all of the
great specifications underneath and one
of the main features of these phones
because they're heavier and thicker is a
bigger battery and 4,000 milliamp hours
is what you get in the Galaxy s8 active
500 over the si+ and a thousand more
over the original s8 no matter how you
slice it longevity like that is
something that everybody wants and the
active line was able to provide that but
up until now I've been talking about how
other devices have been kind of
encroaching on the galaxy s active line
and its territories but there's one
significant loss in this phone that I
just could not get past and that has to
do with my favorite feature of the s6
active and the other phones before and
after it up until now the active key
anyone who has followed me for the last
couple of years knows that I love
physical keys and you're probably sick
of hearing me talk about the BlackBerry
key one well the Galaxy s6 active was
one of my favorite phones because it had
an extra key that you can program for
tap
or holding for two different
applications you could easily open no
matter where you are in the phone it was
such a subtle but incredibly powerful
tool and I used it for so many different
app combinations not just for
convenience but for productivity and
when you couple all of that with the
long battery life the s6 active was
actually a phone that could just get
stuff done but in the s8 active the key
is gone replaced by the bane of many a
current samsung user's existence bigsby
now hold on I do know that Bigsby has
been getting better over the last number
of months and that users could kind of
go through the learning curve and get
quite a bit out of Samsung's assistance
however there are still some bugs with
it and I even experienced some in the
Galaxy S eight active when I press the
Bigsby button and it tries to open
Bigsby actually crashes quite a bit at
the time and if you look at all of the
people who tried to customize the Bigsby
button to make it do something that they
wanted instead well that's exactly how I
feel about the s8 active because in
previous versions of this phone we
literally got a button that did just
that I was really excited to use the
active line again and I was actually
having a good time with it but I
couldn't get over the fact that I didn't
have that active key anymore because I
was so used to it in the s6 active that
I personally bought there are a lot of
people out there who probably really
want an active version of the Galaxy S a
and more power to you if you're looking
specifically for features that set the
s8 active apart like its rugged looks
and bigger battery then go and have at
it
but unfortunately for a user like me
that used to love the active line for
way more than just those features the
list of reasons has shrunken under the
ever-expanding list of things that
Samsung is trying to do it's a jump
forward followed by just a bit of a
stumble back head into the comments down
below and let us know what you think
about the Galaxy s8 active or any of the
active phones if you were like me and
you actually got one in the past and
then stick around because we're going to
have so much more here in Android
authorities so you can subscribe to the
channel if you haven't already and don't
forget to drop us some likes on these
videos because we love to see those
thumbs up from there you can stick
around and head on over to android
authority comm for even more because we
are your source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
