by Toyota thanks in part to a
partnership that is now formed with
tmobile the best of the Sony Xperia line
is finally coming to the United States a
stressful guard from Android thought it
what's going on everybody and this is
the Sony Xperia z1s now for most intents
and purposes the Xperia z1s is very very
similar to the original Xperia z1 the S
moniker just denotes that this is the
version made for the US carriers and the
one in particular is t-mobile as you can
see down here but there are a couple
changes in here mostly in aesthetics but
also in a little bit of the build
quality now that's not to say that this
phone has a lower build quality than the
original aluminium built Xperia z1 it's
just that the frame here is now of a
nice hard plastic now the reason why
that came about is because t-mobile was
hoping to alleviate some of the
connection problems that the aluminum
might cause or the metal my cause rather
so having plastic here will probably
make this phone a very very good one to
have when it comes to getting good
reception and getting calls and texts or
just fine earlier we were actually at a
teardown that was conducted right in
front of our eyes but it was actually
the phone was already torn apart and
then a gentleman was able to put it back
together in about 20 minutes showing us
all of the different components that go
in I'll tell you this much when looking
at the Sony Xperia z1s taken apart like
that and seeing all of the little bits
and pieces that really create the great
user experience this little bad boy
right here definitely packs a lot of
power and is seriously one of the nicest
built devices that I've ever seen
obviously we still have the great 5-inch
screen up front that uses the triluminos
display with x-reality engine software
that provides a very good experience
with a very nice color gamut that allows
for some very very very lovely user
experiences on the screen whether it's
media or gaming or whatnot and around
the back we still have the same G lens
with 20.7 performer that provides a lot
of great pictures and is one of the best
performers out there with especially
that high megapixel count
the sony experience the one comes with
all the same bits and pieces on the
inside what we have here is the
Snapdragon 800 that powers out very very
nice Timescape ey or the Xperia U I as
it some time is called and what you have
inside is basically the same exact
experience except some t mobile
applications have been added in as far
as aesthetics go aside from the plastic
that I told you about the headphone jack
at the top has been moved / just
slightly over a little bit but we still
have all of the covers on the device
that pertain to protecting the different
ports when it comes to the IP
certification and that means that this
phone is able to be underwater and is
dustproof and still be able to bounce
right back so the Sony Xperia z1s is
coming to t-mobile so you'll be able to
take advantage of the no contracts and
whatnot and be able to get your hands on
one of the best phones of 2013 now
updated for a 2014 audience in the
United States so this is josh of a guard
from android authority once again coming
to you live from the sony booth here at
CES 2014 make sure you stay tuned
because we have all of the best coverage
for you your source for all things
android and once again thank you to
toyota for sponsoring our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
