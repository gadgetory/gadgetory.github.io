with Android authority in this sponsored
video we'll be taking a look at the
honor tens a I camera and why other
manufacturers should take note just a
couple of months ago honor
updated their flagship line with the
honor 10 we've already posted our review
but for now we'll stick to talking about
the strengths of its camera if you're
unfamiliar the honor 10 features a 16
megapixel F 1.8 primary camera and a 24
megapixel F 1.8 secondary monochrome
camera as part of its dual camera setup
but what's all this talk about ai hi why
did Honor even print out that it has an
AI camera to clarify the honor 10 uses
artificial intelligence or AI for short
to produce better looking photos usually
when you take a photo with your
smartphone's camera the software uses an
ordinary algorithm to process the light
being received by the camera sensor the
software may not make important
adjustments that would improve the look
of your photos since it doesn't use
contextual information like what you're
trying to take a picture of let's see an
example this is with AI mode off now
take a look at what the AI mode was able
to capture as you can see the AI really
bumped up the saturation so the colors
appear richer the increased level of
contrast really supplements the beauty
of the scene the same thing happened
when I took a photo of the same building
outdoors the non AI mode photo looks
pretty good but it's a bit flat the AI
mode here increased the dynamic range
and also made the colors pop out more
the AI mode is great at recognizing when
a subject is under bright lighting so it
can then offer greater details in the
shadows when the AI mode is off images
taken in bright conditions can come out
overexposed with less dynamic range
since the AI dynamically adjusts based
on what you're taking a photo of
contrast isn't always increased when we
turn AI mode on here you can see the
contrast is actually reduced this makes
the photo look less dramatic and more
casual here's another example this photo
was taken with AI mode off but when AI
mode is turned on you can see the same
scene appears cozier thanks to a warmer
color tone and reduced sharpening we can
observe similar changes when staying in
the library and taking a photo of some
stacks with AI the scene appears less
cool and sterile there's more detail too
if you look closely at some of the books
clearly AI can really improve the look
of your photos the general trend is also
of course to improve the richness of
colors without AI mode images just
aren't as exciting and now please enjoy
this quick montage of some of our other
camera samples
but if you were thinking honor stopped
up photos think again as video capture
is also improved by AI stabilization we
were quite happy with how well the
camera software was able to stabilize
footage without the need for expensive
hardware components there's also a few
extra features built in with the honor
tens camera app the built-in scan
feature lets you scan QR and barcodes
without having to download any extra
apps you might also find it's Amazon
powered shopping assistant helpful as it
can identify certain products and
potentially help you find a better price
all of this technology is powered by an
MP u which is a dedicated piece of
hardware for fast AI processing we
really hope that other manufacturers
will implement similar technology in
their upcoming releases if the honor
tends a I camera has you impressed
definitely check out our overall
thoughts of this eye catching smartphone
in our full review linked below priced
at just 400 euros it might just be the
perfect affordable flagship smartphone
for you well I suppose that will be all
