weekly show is brought to you by viraj
sale hello again ladies and gentlemen
I'm Joe Hindy the android authority app
guy and welcome back to android apps
weekly this is episode number 127 so
let's get started we managed to get a
hold of the official reddit beta
application last week and wanted to show
you what it was going to look like it
seems to have full-on material design
along with a few other fun features we
don't know when it will be released but
it seems to work pretty well to us
soundcloud announced a new stations
feature that will give users a chance to
listen to music similar to how they do
on pandora this comes not long after
announcing signing deals with a couple
of major record labels and announcing
that they'll be turning into a
legitimate streaming service to battle
the likes of Spotify Nintendo has
announced that people can start signing
up for the closed beta of me tomo their
first android games starting on februari
17th we know a lot about the game
already and how it will emulate social
media to an extent however we won't know
everything until we get our hands on it
and that maybe sooner than later even
though most of apple's applications have
received a slew of terrible ratings in
the Google Play Store they seem to be
doing pretty good how good well Tim Cook
announced this week that even more Apple
apps are likely making their way over to
Android we don't know which ones yet but
our guess is likely iCloud and other
productivity apps perhaps the biggest
app news from the last week was
Microsoft purchasing swiftkey for 250
million dollars there hasn't been a lot
of information from either company yet
but the popular guess is that Microsoft
is after Swift keys legendary predictive
algorithms and AI for now nothing is
changing but after seeing what happened
to sunrise calendar and a comp lie we
wouldn't blame you if you were a little
bit worried for even more Android apps
and games news and new releases don't
forget to check out this week's
newsletter which is linked in the video
description below we have a metric ton
of news that we didn't have time for
here if you want to sign up you can use
the form in the written companion which
is also linked in the video description
below and we'll send you the android
apps weekly newsletter every single
Sunday all right folks is take a look at
the apps and games that made a big
splash this week as usual if you want
check any of these apps or games out you
can find those links in the video
description below Sundance VR is a newer
application released with the idea of
showing you full VR content including
short films music videos and other types
of VR stuff it's a newer application and
there aren't a lot of selections yet so
you may not find the app overly
enjoyable right now however if you own
google cardboard or you're interested in
VR I would keep this application in your
crosshairs because it should get a
decent selection of unique be our
content very soon the latest lego game
has hit the google play store and like
many where before it this one is
entirely free with no in-app purchases
this one continues the Ninjago series
where the prior game left off and
includes a lot of the same graphics and
mechanics as prior Ninjago games there
is a stealth element where you can hide
in the shadows instead of engaging in
fights and the controls are very simple
to use it's a great title for kids or
adults and it's especially great if
you're low on money Marvel Avengers
Academy is the latest adventure
simulation game from tiny code they are
the same developers who did Family Guy
the quest for stuff so you may be
familiar with their work already the
game lets you play as your favorite
Avengers as teenagers who are just
beginning to find their abilities you'll
battle bad guys level up your characters
and even do teenager stuff like go out
on dates it's a mixture of adventure and
simulation so there will be some
management here and there and then some
action here and there it's free to
download but it does have in-app
purchases with promo codes is a new
application that is meant to take
advantage of the new promo codes
featured in Google Play it's actually
very simple developers sign up for the
service and once per day people using
the application can check and see if
they win a free promo code if they do
they get a paid app for free and if not
well better luck tomorrow it's a fun and
unique way for developers to utilize
their promo codes and even if the users
lose out they get a chance to see a new
application every day this should be on
every smartphone and you should get it
Adventures of mana is a classic RPG that
was originally released on the Game Boy
in the early 1990s don't worry though
because Square Enix has updated the
graphics and sound track to make it look
and sound way better than it did back
then the storyline and content remains
intact and you'll once again play as the
hero try
to keep the Dark Lord glaive from
reaching the sacred mandatory and
destroying all life it has simple touch
based controls and there is also a steep
price tag but at least there are no
in-app purchases this week's Android
apps weekly show is brought to you by
viraj sale garage sale is a craigslist
style of application where people can
post things they want to sell and then
you buy them unlike craigslist you'll be
required to create an account before you
can interact with the site which is a
mechanic we liked a lot from there you
simply search around find the stuff you
want and then you buy it during our
testing we found all kinds of stuff from
clothes to electronics and even an
engagement ring you can browse various
categories in areas near you and you can
even leave seller feedback which helps
show which sellers are the most reliable
it has a lot going for it and it's
definitely worth a shot if you're
getting ready to sell some stuff or you
just want to look around it's totally
free so check it out and show your
support for the Android apps weekly show
