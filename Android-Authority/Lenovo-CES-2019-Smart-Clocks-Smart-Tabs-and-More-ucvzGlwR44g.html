with Android authority we're checking
out Lenovo's new products revealed here
at CES 2019 first up we have the Lenovo
smart clock with Google assistant it's
basically this cool little companion for
your nightstand since it works with
Google Assistant you can use it to do
everything from listening to music to
controlling your smart home make sure
you check out our dedicated coverage for
this device as we were quite impressed
by it
next up with Lenovo's smart tabs this is
actually a brand new category of
two-in-one devices on its own it's an
Android tablet but when placed in Lenovo
smart dock it becomes a sort of smart
display with Alexa what's great about
this product is that it's a tablet when
you need the portability and a smart
display when you don't Lenovo was also
showing off some new yoga devices the
yoga s 940 for example is a new laptop
with a few a I powered features for
example it automatically locks when you
look away from it for a while to prevent
any malicious actors from accessing your
data physically we really like the
design to the glass wraps around the
bezels and lenovo has cleverly
implemented a tab at the top with the
webcam this is pretty cool as it makes
opening the laptop easier and doesn't
sacrifice on webcam placement there's
also the yoga a 940 which is an
all-in-one desktop perfect for artists
and designers you can configure it with
a 27 inch 4k touchscreen display with
Dolby vision for the ultimate viewing
experience the rotating hinge makes it a
perfect device for those who need
something to sketch on as you can see
lenovo has really put a lot of thought
into this machines design there were
also a few other random products that we
got to check out including this large
widescreen monitor which should be
perfect for gamers during the show
lenovo emphasized their vision of making
products that help you unlock your full
potential and we think you'll agree that
this is a very promising lineup we're
looking forward to getting a closer look
at these devices once they're released
