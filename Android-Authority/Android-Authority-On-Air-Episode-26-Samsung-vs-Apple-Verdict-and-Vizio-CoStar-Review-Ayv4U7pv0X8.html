authority on here the original android
hangout show on google+ I'm Derek Ross
i'm scott anderson in this week we are
joined by returning guest Johnathan
Franklin a fellow android enthusiast and
new special guest Chris Hollis from
google TV friends welcome guys what's up
guys he's going glad to have you guys
here so Scott what we have on the agenda
this evening besides technical
difficulties besides the tentacle
difficulties we're going to talk about
the vizio co-star google TV and how it
kind of matches up to the competition
kind of first impressions a little bit
more in depth as well know when we
talking about what everybody's talking
about right now samsung verse apple and
the verdict of the jury and then we're
going to go over some nexus rumors you
know how you love your next devices
rumors right yeah so yeah so yeah we had
some technical difficulties were a
little bit later for those of you
watching us live for those of you that
listen or watch the recorded show you
didn't miss anything we had some some
audio problems we had some video
problems computer problems you know what
we made it so thanks for thanks for
waiting or we're glad to have you here
and as Scott said we're going to talk
about vizio co-star the $99 google TV
that started arriving this week for many
many people that pre-ordered it and
thankfully yours truly got his about all
about three hours ago so i'm very
excited to announce that i have it and i
got to play with it for a couple hours
not as much as I'd like but I did get to
poke around here in there but Chris
Hollis is a resident google TV expert if
you will he knows a lot about Google TV
devices and it has been using them that
review the device from Logitech is
Sony's Google TV devices as well as the
new co-star so
we have him here on the show with us
tonight to to basically talk all things
google TV is Scott was saying maybe talk
about some first impressions uh yeah the
the setup accessory software you know
just uh what was it like out of the box
compared to other devices and so forth
so Chris you recently did a review for
your site Google TV friends on the vizio
co-star correct yes so what were your
initial impressions compared to past
devices know anything shine anything not
shiny you were expecting to shine my
first impression is and was it blows all
the other devices away Vizio did a great
job changing the layout on this version
compared to the Sony in the Logitech
where you always had to hit home and
then you would lose your screen and
you'd have to scroll through everything
now everything's on your left hand side
it overlays so you're not missing any TV
it just blows the other devices away it
really does I love the Logitech but this
it just blows it away well that's good i
mean this is my first google TV device I
have friends that have them I've seen
them I played around them a little bit
here and there but never anything more
than just a few minutes and I've read
about pretty much everything I could
read you know about the the sony blu-ray
player the LG TV 2 has given people to
be embedded into it as well as their the
logitech revue and that was my general
thought to that it was not where it
should be there was a first generation
device you know like android was not so
good you know a few years ago and look
at it now so uh inlet my understanding
was it could be getting better and from
the reviews that i'm reading they
reflect pretty much what you said is
that yeah it's not bad i mean for 100
bucks i'll tell you what my TV has the
samsung Smart Hub built in
right and that's I know that that's
that's okay i guess um but it's an
ecosystem you know its content its apps
that i'm not used to so compared to that
I think it's you know head over heels
better it's it's so much better than
what i had for smart TV now I my initial
to our impression of setting it up and
getting things to work is it's pretty
awesome so far I mean I have a lot more
to do i'm probably not going to go to
bed tonight you know i'm gonna stay up
all night playing with it but yeah it
i'm excited so what did you uh what do
you think else you know stood out from
previous devices besides just you know a
little better do I learn and will faster
device well it's it it all boils down to
this device is the game changer for
Google TV the other two versions the
logitech in the sony i just bought the
sony the newest one for 199 bucks and
all that is is it dressed up version of
the logitech revue so i paid 199 bucks
for a new box which it's not worth it
but I this it's just faster like I said
the the UI they the way they changed
everything it's going to impress
everybody the remote is so much more
easier to use than the sony remote the
logitech keyboard that you could break
your leg on if you tripped over it but
it's just it's just so much better the
remotes a little thicker than i had
anticipated i am used to a very slender
thin remote that my samsung TV has and
even my my comcast cable box remotes you
know a little bit thinner than this it's
it's very boxy I wasn't expecting I mean
I'm not saying it's a bad remote but it
uh it's it's almost I forget who said it
but it reminds me of a 1970s first
remote with one of the older TVs because
it is Boxxy and you know it
it doesn't have a backlight either and
four of the buttons that are around the
the trackpad i'll call it you know
they're they're just plastic buttons
they're not rubber buttons you know they
have a different feel to them so i don't
care you know you only use the remote to
press a few buttons anyways so it
doesn't have to be gold in your hand but
it would have been nice if it you know a
few things were a little different with
it well this thing they might I'm sorry
had Scott I think boy with having a
title a keyboard I think that they chose
that with for a reason and I mean
because it seems so light that they
could have made it a lot smaller if they
wanted to but I think that was a design
feature that they wanted to so it was
comfortable with people tiger had maybe
I and you also gotta remember I haven't
played with it yet but there are buttons
for gaming we have you know we have the
up-down left-right arrows on the back we
have an a/b when we thought I was it YZ
I believe my yeah yeah actually why
whatever yeah so there's four buttons
for game so it's a game control or two I
haven't played around with it yet I
haven't gotten to that yet but I'm
excited to try that out I'm excited to
try out on live now I as well as any
other game and it's compatible I don't
know if there are any compatible games
in the Andrew her in google play and the
play store uh that's that's a tough one
right now there's really not any games
available for that kind of control but
you can jump right into on life and play
games with the with the controller so
have you done that have you tried out on
live the that was the first thing I did
when I hope the device up I went to a
lot and I played a Darksiders 2 I got a
free trial for 30 minutes and I was able
to move around I did everything with no
problem it would have been better with
with the online actual controller but
you can find games that you can use the
regular remote
for not one thing to notice that I
noticed right out of the box the one of
the first things I did is I hit Search
and i typed in the show name and you
know I found TV shows that i could the
old seasons of the show i could buy or
rent you know through the the Play Store
I found shows that we're going to be
starting soon on TV Guide in YouTube
videos and related web searches and so
forth so it was pretty neat it's nice to
have a connected TV to be able to do
that now I don't know yet because I
haven't set that up but if I hooked up
an app that worked with a dnl a server
would it search that for that content as
well believe it what is ok that very
exciting Harry that that is that's
pretty awesome not a lot yeah or two as
the streaming media and for cutting a
little bit more that I happen now I have
a comcast DVR it would be very cool if
the search feature searched my shows on
my DVR does it do that I have not tried
that in that I can't answer that is it
that's something that we went when i'm
up at 5am tonight i'm gonna be doing
that on ABC you know I'm gonna I want to
know how this thing can do everything
for me and make my life so much easier
when it comes to watching TV which I
don't watch a whole lot of any more so
but but hey I can you know I installed
the the Google Music app and I was
listening to some music on my TV which
is not you know it's it's you know when
you have a party or something you have
people over you can play music right
there I was thinking about getting some
nice screen savers you know for for the
TV no but besides that I mean just
regular eye candy I think I think I
think it's gonna be great I can't wait
to have more time to play around with it
I don't know how how you store your
photos or anything like that but there's
one app called floating images for
Google TV okay that will draw all your
pictures from Picasa Flickr photobucket
 anything and you start your google
music in the background then you start
floating images in all your pictures
will just float across the TV and it's
nice it's nice for a party or if you're
entertaining family and they want to see
pictures that's rad so I guess that
leads me to an important question for
people that are new to Google TV such as
myself do you have a list of apps that
are will say must-have apps that are
apps that you gather your go-to or
actually recommend everybody at least
try or that you need to have uh well the
first step i have to mention is able
remote because everybody complains about
the remotes that come with the google TV
enable remote works on your your android
device so you control your TV you can
set it up any way you want right from
your android phone so so i shouldn't use
the google TV remote that i downloaded
and tried to use in the company was last
updated 2010 of just under a stock i
sold that lift install i sold like
december two thousand ten was like
really this thing's that almost two
years old well i hope it works good in a
date i'm working on it though they
they're working on it look i like to see
something that's been updated least in
the last you know six months let alone a
year and a half especially some goofy
yeah almost like it's gonna bandit i
hope i hope with the next iteration of
google TV that comes out is you know
second gen software i guess so people
are calling it i hope that the remote
you know updates happen but so able
remote why did what I want that what's
so much better about it than the other
room worked uh because it's fully
customizable you can create macros you
can pick you put your favorite channels
on there you can play your favorite apps
on there you can change the layout of it
it's you won't need your regular remote
anymore you really won't and as far as
the original google TV remote if you
watch any of the google TV developer
hangouts they let it out little hint
every now and then so they're working on
it the engine one though is I don't
think about anything about Abel remote
what I've heard is that you can
customize all her favorite so you can
just put it all on your phone and you
can go to whatever jail you want yes and
that's pretty cool I think yes you don't
need you you don't need the TV remote
anymore with Abel so in line so
basically you're te your mode will just
be there for playing on live and
everything else will be on your
smartphone yes okay I like that I like
that I need to write that down that that
is something I'm going to do it too am
to my 1 i'm up all night fine and then
there's there's three apps i have to
mention that they don't get any
recognition but they're probably three
of the best apps to have one is social
life Stevie the other one is social gtb
and the other one is TV tweets with the
two of them you can overlay they overlay
your TV screen so if if you want to the
football game basketball sporting
anything you can put in the hashtags and
those whatever hashtags you put in
they'll come up on your screen when
people are tweeting right and off he
goes alive TV well socialized TV is the
only app and it's only available on
Google TV where you can actually tweet
from your live TV as you're watching TV
you can tweet from your teammates it's
hard to explain you have to look at the
app or watch the video but oh so you're
watching the season finale of an episode
of main character dies you can tell all
your twitter friends what happened in
the in pis'mo office are you saying yeah
yes and you think is that light from the
TV so they so there you go you can do
you control people on Twitter throughout
about their favorite TV shows I don't
those three apps there they don't get
any attention you know they're buried
within the apps of the google play and
but they were three of the original TV
tweet apps so check them out i'm not a
huge twitter user anymore this new
social network came up buddy
year ago called Google Plus pretty much
a murder I'm pretty much each to
everything used it exclusively since
then but that's that's cool though you
know I I think that's very cool now now
only if I can people you know get on
google plus from google TV that would be
the next thing well it works it works
great in the browser it really does okay
now but the future are they gonna
combine the Q and Google TV you think
that would be the foreseeable future of
Google TV uh I haven't heard one thing
about the the Q since they pulled it I
mean no rumors no nothing no one's
discussed it it's it's like a forbidden
word you know so i don't know i think it
needs to something has to converge there
Oh rumor has it that Google TV team did
not know about the queue until it was
you know too late to stop the engines
will say and they were said once again
rumor has it that they weren't too
impressed with each other and book but
you know that would we'll just leave it
at that we'll see we'll see what happens
now that now that they're redesigning
adding features whatever to to the queue
so uh I think some type of integration
will be pretty neat no man you walk up
to your google TV box and ping it with
your smartphone or something yet there's
only your content you know your videos
your music or something for people over
or something like that some type of an
aggression i guess i would be neat so uh
Chris we got a question it comes from
Josh I do you do any of you know
anything about the Sony teeth the sony
google TV experience versus the vizio
experience i have a vizio tv but it
looks like the sony player works better
for my deal on a needs he has a sony TV
or a Sony devices he has a vizio tv but
it looks like this
sony player works better for dland and
needs so basically he has a vizio tv and
he's debating on whether to get a sony
google TV or a vizio so this this is the
sony blu-ray player google TV i'm
assuming right now they're trying to
push an update from what they what vizio
said i tested some some files with t TV
box one of the another google app that
everybody loves and there are some
problems with some of the files that
vizio port so i would say either hold
off because they're going to push an
update out or go with the sony if you
want the sony so this is this is me for
me to say but right now we're being
watched live via google TV oh yeah so
that that's very cool one of our viewers
watching us from their people TV their
actual vizio co-star from a youtube back
right now so that's cool i know people
were people usually very cool quickly
yeah and don't forget this is busiest
first device and you know if this is
where the google TV is going it's only
going to get better with music i'm
curious a vizio is going to bake this
into their their tvs in the future you
know with the next generation no I'm I
don't know why we would need you know
Vizio has a specific marketing and
dimming nice quality TVs for a fraction
of the cost they're cheap in terms of
price but quality they're all right you
know that they're not bad and that's how
you that's why we have our father's
first remote control twice I really you
know who those things we overlook
exactly I think in that situation Derek
I think it would be more so they want to
have compatible backwards compatibility
with older TVs and that's a huge market
as opposed to selling new TVs yeah but
but look at somebody like me I needed a
new TV a few months ago because my other
one died so
I need to buy a new TV and I knew I
wanted to get google TV and the LG at
the time wasn't getting the greatest
reviews so i said well so i'm going to
buy it a smart TV you can't buy a 3d TV
that isn't a smart TV so I'm going to
buy a smart TV and I'm going to overlay
and not one not even use its smart
capabilities for another provider smart
capabilities that seem kind of dumb
because I'm paying for a smart TV
probably an extra hundred bucks or two
hundred bucks or whatever to have all
these features but now i'm not even
using them and I'm okay with that but it
just I would have rather bought it
built-in if I could have and like I said
the LG wasn't getting the hottest
reviews at the time so I I didn't go
with that I went with a higher quality
product and i love my TV but if i could
have got baked in I would have I would
have fought that so young baby I'd like
to see in the future hey you know what I
need a TV well and the one of the
bedrooms a little small so maybe in six
months you know I'll be able to buy that
yeah we'll see yeah and my legs are you
a little bit go ahead I'll just ethic is
perfectly viable that they often you
know a separate solution an integrated
to you means pretty similar hardware
wise anyway as to what the reason to
power the TV's already so yeah and yeah
Michael made a good point his vizio got
an update tonight and mine right out the
box got an update no I don't know if it
was the same update and Michael got but
I got an update so I um yeah so I got an
update tonight and yeah pretty
interesting the detector do the edge the
the vizio actually not I filed a bug
report so if I get disconnected I'm
gonna send this to teach you that's
great every single time I've signed up
for the bug report I I haven't actually
got disconnected so that was actually
good that that happened anyways um was i
saying so yeah there was two updates
actually for the coast
are there is one there was one big one
and then there was one that was
supposedly fixed I guess 5.1 sound
issues I guess there's two of them oh
yeah all right well guess the the last
app would have to be uh I'm sorry let me
just get this in would be MIDI it's it's
for download and peer-to-peer on the
Google TV and it
that would be have to be the last step I
could recommend to anybody okay I'm ID I
am I TTYL right TTYL oh yes midi
interesting okay so um I also want to
say about the vizio setup was a cinch uh
I need another cable in order to get my
cable running through it I have a table
top box that goes from composite to
composite so i plug it into composite
but it still HD but I need is there such
thing as a composite HD from I I've read
a couple things and it wasn't pretty so
I I'm gonna answer that one I'll have a
look for in near box upgrade them yeah
I'm sure it's out there but from what
people have been saying that's okay uh
and then the USB port what can the USB
port be used for I've music movies any
kind of files you want just a bit and
it'll sink in a heartbeat so you can
narrow half ability as well excuse me
general half ability as well I don't
know about that but but I plugging
everything into it you know every remote
every controller I had xbox you know the
ps3 the US regular nothing works but it
but the music in the movies so cool yeah
I'm going to be figuring out some
options for that little be punk so next
we can get to hear your opinion on Scott
yeah oh and it's been my first week with
a rooted galaxy nexus so a little
sidebar for those of you that watch our

benefits in reading oh my we you know
what we have changed Scott Anderson
because of this guy letters in about two
weeks ago Reno routing was bad it was
evil you never wanted to do it ya ever
said that I never said believe I just
said that it was the nature of the
device in the way that Verizon intended

thank you guys have a good night okay
yeah okay so let's talk about some small
news this week before we get into the
big guy here the samsung vs apple trial
that just has me so happy ah so next
Nexus rumors right we're getting the end
of song you know it's the end of August
falls just right around the corner and
that means Nexus devices right so it's
about that time to rumors to stuff so
earlier this week to not let anybody
down we had some Nexus rumors remember a
few months back I believe in may not
hold that against me if I'm wrong we
heard that Google might be partnering
with multiple vendors this time around
for multiple Nexus devices so to further
confirm that rumor I guess to play along
with that rumor to help push it around
the rumor mill we heard about
the Xperia Nexus possibly coming out
which would be made by sony we heard
about the Galaxy Nexus to possibly
coming out obviously I by Samsung and
the Optimus Nexus which would be made by
LG now those three devices were will say
leaked on a spec sheet for upcoming
devices in the upcoming fall upcoming
winter from a major carrier in Japan so
take them however you wish but three
devices from three major manufacturers
one carrier yeah well I mean they're on
their way to five devices now we could
we could further speculate and say well
you know there might be a motorola one
and that would be you know for you know
there might be an HTC one lb five but
let's say there's just three phones we
have a nexus 7 that makes the fourth
Nexus device if that's true and then we
have the rumored Nexus 10 tablet which
would make five devices no that's my
take on it I don't know you know I'm
just guessing but we might see that two
different tablets and three different
phones so i guess my question is for
those of you watching listening later
watching listening now what would you
want your neck next Nexus device to be
who do you want who do you want to to
make it what what manufacturer what
vendor you want are you going to be
looking for you know the Experian
excellence you know you big Sony fan or
the Galaxy Nexus which we'll talk about
that in a second you know is the current
phone now it's just a slight bump or you
know the Optimus Nexus you know G fan
you want the LG version so personally I
have zero problems with my galaxy nexus
now even though the next one the rumor
is it's just a slight bump inspection a
little better screen it's a Super AMOLED
HD screen processors just a very slight
jumped 1.5 gigahertz over the 1.2 right
now
no just a little bit better camera a
little front-facing and rear camera a
little bit bigger become megapixel
ability to 84 the rear end was a 1.9 or
two point O for the front-facing camera
so it's a little bump in specs I'm okay
with that it doesn't need to be you know
something amazingly awesome that if I
show somebody they're gonna have a heart
attack because the specs are so cool no
we're really at a point where he can
make it mind so fast but and again I do
like my specs so you know maybe i would
want done optimus Nexus or nxp react to
something that has a little more power
to it but then that brings me to my next
point is that generally Nexus have been
you know powerhouse thumbs so how's me
have three powerhouse phones are we
going to have a are we gonna have a
super duper high end phone a mid-range
phone and then I I don't know you know I
mean it seems kind of weird how we're
going to gauge them this you know we
could have a three different tiers and
Nexus phones are they all going to be
the same specs just made by different
manufacturers name oh I think I'm I've
heard it before obviously there's no way
to really know what goes on behind the
scenes when it happens but when it comes
around for the presentations I think all
the manufacturers actually present to
Google a rumored you know what they
would produce it for a nexus and kind of
compete with each other quietly above
mean obviously not in the same room at
the same time but maybe Google came to
the point where they just said okay well
we just go ahead and let it you know let
all of them make one you know just like
they planned on doing and they were
competing with each other is just what
would just turn them loose yeah curious
you know my biggest concern is carriers
you know what my great you know I want
to want to make sure that my carrier
verizon is getting another nexus which
after the last yea after the current
debacle that's going on right now I
don't know if that's going to happen I'd
like to have I'm gonna keep my fingers
crossed you know
confidence how I but I don't know if
that will happen like the two things
that are going to be huge selling points
is the stock google experience that's
one so spec sir okay um but it'll be
that and battery life I think the
biggest battery would would win for me
would because thus the one that's the
only thing I would change about the
Galaxy Nexus and a lot of this because
the first generation he'll te hardware
but a just having the same phone let's
say a Snapdragon s4 it would be a
gigantic improvement yeah as empty
reefer stimulation LTE is just terrible
I agree Derek what would you need in
your next one but what I needed my next
phone yeah if it was a it was a nexus
well I I'm perfectly happy with my phone
right now my my galaxy nexus I mean a
better camera and better battery life I
it I really don't need to get any faster
it already is fast and does everything i
need to do in terms of speed a better
screen you know a little higher you know
pics a little higher DPI maybe so a
better screen better battery life which
might boil down to you know LTE radio
code or a bump in the camera megapixel
so the galaxy nexus two of those specs
are right as long as battery holds up
I'm okay with that better screen better
camera yeah I'd be okay with it I'd buy
into that again I would I would I don't
have any problems with my card phone but
you know I mean for a better camera and
better battery life yeah so well so if
you have the option between let's say oh
you know something magical happens and
verizon just happens to get all five and
these rumored phones which was they get
well thats hot person personally i would
take a motorola or sony nexus first
period
rolla probing the top well I've never
held it seems kind of liberated me I've
never had a next period device or any
sony phone in my hand because the last
sony phone i held my hand was an
ericsson from like eight years ago so i
don't know what their android phones are
like I personally never used one I would
compare them to a somewhere between HTC
and motorola feel wise uh hardware wise
I guess no I'm not talking about the
software because the software's up to
you as far as whether you like it but as
far as it they generally go with Paul
calm they journey have good build
quality they have good quick good
cameras but it's a i'd say somewhere
between motorola and HTC as far as how
the phone is hardware implemented good
radio from here so let it move one knot
to a few couple more tidbits android
news this week and then we'll we'll wrap
up the last 20 minutes or so talking
about the trial verdict so i don't use
facebook i haven't in over a year
because there's new social network out
there people plus do a lot of letters
yeah we don't know what that is but
apparently the facebook app is bad um do
do those do they use it you might know
what I'm talking about maybe you Scott
John maybe we do apparently apparently
it's so bad facebook they're making all
of their employees switch over to
android phones so they see actually how
bad it is an actual dog food you know
and use it so they're taking dog look
dog food to an extreme which is very
cool i mean i mean that that if i was a
facebook user i would i'd be a big fan
of that a company knows they have a
problem and the only way to really
determine what their problem is to is to
actively use it to experience it to go
through it so that that's good news for
for you Facebook addicts out there on
I'm happy for you I thing i think that
uh they can solve that very quickly
through
and just like Fran castor does a great
job just buy it out fix the bugs put
your name on it and be done with it I
think they gotta make it from the ground
up if they want it to be their
experience performing experience is
horrible only enjoyed me it's just I
agree but I want to take them a long
time yeah you come up with a new too bad
that's salvageable all right so the
galaxy note came out about two weeks ago
on t mobile tmobile fans were happy
they're able to get that the phablet the
phone tablet whatever people are calling
it and then after two weeks t-mobile
said well the next ones coming out soon
it's right around the corner we're gonna
we're gonna remove it from our website
we're not going to be actively selling
it anymore so gonna get the note sorry
about your luck but hey there's none
coming students may be tmobile be a
carrier for that in the beginning and
not have to wait an extremely long time
for it to show up on that carrier like
it last time let's talk about a couple
weeks for phones and then we'll get into
the trial so we still have an Ice Cream
Sandwich leaks no phone no which is
funny because ice cream sandwich came
out was announced October 15th it don't
got no butter so those of you that have
the HTC incredible too I can guarantee
you that ice cream sandwich is coming
because this week a ice cream sandwich
firmware was leaked for it and people
installed it in loved it and rejoiced
that ice cream sandwich was coming
following that the HTC Thunderbolt
verizon's bastard LTE phone latest
stepchild redheaded not only their very
first LTE phone is getting ice cream
sandwich soon and a rom was leaked for
it this week people installed it
of it it got both HTC phones got a major
bumpkin sense from was it what sense 2.1
a sense 3.6 i believe so they got a
major you i bump as well as ice cream
sandwiches UI changes and then last but
not least the samsung galaxy s3 is
rumored to get jelly bean very very very
soon and it was a it's been having
multiple leaks like three or four now
over the past two weeks the latest ones
this week click on a new jelly bean rom
for the international version as well as
the t-mobile version so if you have the
t-mo or the international version you
can go ahead and sample those at your
own risk obviously be careful um anytime
you do something like that no be extra
careful make sure you know what you're
doing good doing that isn't for
everybody so let's get into the samsung
vs apple trial that's been going on for
the past few weeks and blew up the
internet a few hours ago um John what
are your initial thoughts on that isn't
it have I mixed in some areas um as far
as Apple's claims to a lot of
intellectual property I think are bogus
and but on the other hand I think there
are a lot of things that Samsung has
done to just kind of stir the pot there
um a good example my mom has a samsung
fascinate which is basically a galaxy s
clone that Verizon made even worse by
slapping being on top of it other things
but as far as a lot of the verdict from
the trial is relative to Hurley touch
with that doesn't exist in touch with
now how like the rounded icons the
square icons the belts back um this if
you use a phone like that the Galaxy S
series in general there are similarities
and there are some things that Samsung
still does that makes you
question kinda like s voice things like
this it's almost like they're just
provoking Apple to come after them even
even in situations where google gave
them warning to not kind of look at
trade dress yeah they did now beyond
that I think that the patents and apples
arguments for the most part are complete
most of it should be invalid completely
software patents I don't agree with
Microsoft and Apple a bit bullying the
biggest problem I guess I have is you
have samsung and your Motorola's and
your Qualcomm's and your nokia has come
along and they spend billions of dollars
of researching and getting cell
technology where it is today and then
make that standards-essential which is
true it should be standards-essential
then companies like Microsoft and Apple
come in late and then act as if what
you've done in the past 15 years is
completely you know of no value
whatsoever and they put in to me it
takes a lot more effort to come up with
a cell radio then it doesn't touch
gesture yeah Scott what are your
thoughts on on the villainy verdict
initial reactions initial thoughts um my
initial thoughts were and throughout the
trial my thoughts were Samsung why are
you doing this and it just kind of
became apparent that Samsung in certain
aspects is trying to you know not
necessarily copy but try to mimic other
products and I mean with the icon design
I don't agree with that that's
ridiculous you know people have become
accustomed to a certain looking Hall
icon and you know like a universal call
icon so I don't know I Samsung did a lot
of that a lot of this for themselves and
they they kind of dug their own hole I
think you know yes there's similar
products because in terms of
looks because that's that that's what
the consumer wants I mean I really think
samsung said it best today and i'm going
to read their the reaction statement
they said today's verdict should not be
viewed as a win for Apple which they're
gonna play on the people's feelings here
saying that but it was a loss for the
American consumer which that is true
they said it will lead to fewer choices
West innovation and potentially higher
prices which when a company is allowed
to create a monopoly and ruled that
they're allowed to have a monopoly then
yes this does happen they continue to
say is unfortunate that patent law can
be been manipulated to give a company a
monopoly over rectangles with rounded
corners and and yeah that that is a
hundred percent it I mean are we gonna
start am I gonna walk around with the
trapezoid is a phone from now on I mean
do i or am I gonna go for triangle as a
phone maybe maybe for google glass
doesn't shape like that and I mean Peter
people want I mean here's my wallet this
is pretty much the standard wallet it's
a rectangle so it's it's it's the
standard wallet I mean for hundreds of
years is the 100-year people use you
know saddlebags and stuff 100 years ago
but what I mean on your show i'm saying
so leather wallets haven't really
changed a lot I don't see you know Coach
suing louis vuitton every single day
that they designed the same rectangular
leather wallet it's it's a standard so
alright so they continue to say that i
lost my place consumers have the right
to choices and they know what they're
buying into when they purchase stamp set
of products they're not getting duped
you know they're not walking into a
store walking into a best behind coming
out with
a galaxy tab 10.1 getting home and sad
huh this isn't an iPad oh that's just
that's just consumer education right
there and that's also because right now
when I go blow my nose i say i wanna i
want a Kleenex I don't say i want to
tissue i say i want to clean it clinics
is actually a brand name I want to clean
my ears I don't use a I know what it's
calling with cotton swab I don't use a
cotton swab you know I use a q-tip you
know I eat popsicles you know you know
that these are all name brands that when
I want to make copies of something you
know I sell it gave Xerox that for me
these are name brands in America have
become synonymous to their their
products it's a social to get your hands
to push exactly the very first one
became popular so I have all the time
people send me all is that an iPad and
they're not really actually saying is
that an iPad computer made by apple
that's just what it's called because it
was the first one so everything's that
ipad ipad means tablet so that's what I
did with my galaxy nexus asked me if
it's one of those iphones but this
journalist i'm here today it's what came
out first that's so that's what people
call it all is that an iphone oh yeah
yeah it's similar to an aqua know it's a
it's a then you say some crazy long
android games that makes you hang your
head and change I'm comin oh no
this is the HTC photon q 4g LTE okay you
know but but names aside names me all
night well I think the perception and
it's kind of funny because they're
making it out as if Samsung is a cheap
knockoff and it's really not the case
because if you look at the historically
look at all the mp3 players that try to
copy the ipod and get nothing for sale
it's not the fact that it's subpar or
anything that's affecting that it's the
fact that they're putting out a product
that is at least as good is their
product and they're getting sales based
upon their
if it was just a cheap knockoff that
wasn't that wasn't worth anything then
the consumer wouldn't react on it at all
and that's really where the big issue
that from Apple sign of it that's
because they're just not getting out
innovated by everybody and that's open
source that's the speed of open source
working against them but so Samsung
continues to say that this is not the
final word in this case ruskin
chattering continues orang-orang battles
being waged in the courts and tribunals
around the world which we know that
patent wars continue patent wars
continue in South Korea where Samsung
was actually recently you know they were
found to not infringe so the you know
and as well in New York and these cases
are going to continue and they said that
some of which have been already rejected
of apples claims which yes in many parts
of the world apples planes have been
rejected and they they closed it by
saying that samsung will continue to
innovate and offer choices for the
consumer and we can see that they're
already starting to change that with the
galaxy s3 which you know looks nothing
like an iPhone they and maybe the net
the next major tablet from samsung will
look nothing like you know an ipad
they're getting yelled exactly notice
you to use to that's a different that's
a different topic i think i think that
the note is probably the first example
of a tablet that they designed with that
in mind yeah i think that they're gonna
just completely go after them um using
moral yes good yeah yeah i think more
role and Google's going to use them to
their advantage and hopefully they do um
and hopefully motorola comes up with
some good devices
on I know that they've used some devices
in the past that have been yeah and
they've made some bad decisions with the
razr maxx i'll tell you that the band is
the razr maxx aside from the display is
a pretty good phone yeah but the amount
of variations that they made to that
phone yeah yeah yeahs coming out with
you know different fault like it's not
cool well i can raise our buyer you were
just absolutely livid when they came out
with the max two months later exactly i
mean you can't do that to your consumers
yeah just completely you know oh there's
a better one out now i will give them
the credit they have been doing this
long and haven't put out a device where
is back when it was a droid 3 android
for never coming out with something
every three months and it's been a good
almost a year we're coming up on a year
since they put a device out so i think
they're finally kind of starting to put
their money where their mouth is and I
wonder if and that's what makes me
wonder about the next Nexus device that
if if more role will be contributing to
that because they need to come up with a
bang and they need to say hey we're
still in it and we're in it the way you
know I think that and if they unlocked a
bootloader on verizon I'm all over that
device period because I am just that's
me I have a zoom it's probably you mean
it's older now but the thing to tank I
can't say that about you know when my
Nexus is well built too but Motorola
just has built quality down to yeah i
will definitely give them that no it's
not the prettiest girl the primary aim
but i don't even care about that so yeah
definitely well built devices and
hopefully they can bring that the next
access that'd be really cool now the
last thing about patent wars that i want
to talk about is google / motorola last
Friday filed suit against Apple to ban a
slew of Apple devices
ipad the iphone ipod touch as well as
mount a mac the netbooks for for patent
infringement we didn't actually know
what patents uh seven different ones
were outlined this this week some light
was finally shed on the subject so
Google is fighting back to help android
we'll see what happens in Anyang this
coming week with that in the UH that
injunction see if it actually happens um
it would be nice for Apple to get a
taste their own medicine and in my
opinion but it would I don't see it
happening kind of like a motor world I
have that injunction ban on the Xbox and
yeah did really good band or and to me
fair's fair you know they blunt the One
X you know things on those lines it may
not be HTC's only device or anything but
it was a significant device for them
that they delay to release on well my
opinion being nowhere near a lawyer nor
understanding patent law but my opinion
would be to patent attempt to patent
everything though anything and
everything if you can patent a shape
then you can patent anything in my
opinion so no matter how many spoilers
any managers need to do that and in OEM
s need to do that to ward off somebody
deciding well because this this
rectangle is now has rounded corners
well we designed that so whoever's going
to make the first trapezoid android
phone I want you to patent it so Apple
does not do that does not come out with
this awesome that's quite a feat I think
Google is kind of a newer company to the
legal side of that we're Apple in
Microsoft a very old school I think
they're finally realizing how seriously
they have to take it so I think they're
starting to escalate down a little bit
