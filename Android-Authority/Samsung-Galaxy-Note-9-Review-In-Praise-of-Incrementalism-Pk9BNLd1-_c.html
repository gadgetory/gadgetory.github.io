changed what a smartphone should be and
the galaxy note 9 doesn't do that what
it does do is take the best of what made
the Galaxy Note line great and make it
bigger and better than ever actually I
just wanted to take a second and give a
big shout out to the moment for
sponsoring this video
the moment makes really cool smartphone
cases and lenses that can really take
your smartphone photography game to the
next level you can check them out on
Shop moment comm and tell them we sent
you all right now back to the video
buddy of the galaxy note 9 is really
similar to the Galaxy Note 8 but they've
added a few refinements that just make
it a little better
you've got flatter sides so it's easier
to grip in your hand they've added some
chamfered edges where the glass meets
the metal and they've actually
repositioned the fingerprint reader
which I really personally like because
it's right below the camera lens now
which makes it a lot easier to press
without accidentally putting your finger
directly on top of that lens the screen
on the gussy no.9 is big bright and
beautiful just like we're used to seeing
on Samsung phones but if point one
inches bigger than the Galaxy Note 8
which is nice because it just kind of
adds to that whole refinement thing it's
really saturated and punchy and honestly
this is one of the best displays that
I've seen on a smartphone and if you use
the Samsung phone before it you won't be
disappointed
and of course like on any galaxy no
device you're gonna find all the
essentials like speaker grille the USB
type-c port the s-pen and yes the
headphone jack is still here and I just
want to iterate this to other
manufacturers if Samsung can fit an S
Pen in this phone which is like three
quarters of the length of the entire
phone then you other guys can fit a
headphone jack in your phone do better
on the inside you've got pretty much
everything you've come to expect from an
Android flagship you've got welcome
latest snapdragon 845 a ton of RAM but
honestly there's not a lot to say about
performance on this phone you can run
pretty much any game on it you can
multitask like crazy and I didn't really
notice any stuttering between apps or
anything else the biggest things we
really need to talk about here are the
storage and battery capacity so the
baseline model this phone comes with 128
gigabytes of storage you could actually
get another model with 512 gigabytes of
storage and that's a ton of storage
don't get me wrong but we are using our
phones as more of our daily pocket
computers and I do like to put a lot of
Netflix shows and music on my phone to
use that places like the gym and when I
don't have service and I really
appreciate the fact that Samsung is
giving people this option I mean it is a
note device after all
you shouldn't have to make compromises
there's a new battery in the galaxy note
9 and it's actually way better than it
was last year it's 4,000 milliamp hours
this time which is a lot more than the
no-date and I got about 7 hours of
screen on time out of this phone on any
given day now that is really good
because not a lot of other Android
phones really hit that mark on a daily
basis now those are some insane specs
but if you want it all you're gonna have
to pay for it the no 9 starts at a
fallacy bucks and that is a lot of money
but you have to consider that your phone
is the computer that you use multiple
times day now when I'm not reviewing
phone I use the one plus 6 and I love
that phone it's nice it's fast it's
clean but it does skimp on some things
that make the note 9 great like the fast
wireless charging IP
60 water resistance expandable storage
and of course the S Pen now the S Pen
has definitely the most defining feature
of the Gulf's and no line and I've got
to admit I've never actually owned a
Galaxy Note one before they're using
after the last week or so I've really
come to enjoy using them our selection
screen right features this year
Samsung's added low-power Bluetooth
functionality to the s-pen it allows you
to do things like using it as a remote
shutter for the camera changing songs
and apps like Spotify or even switching
slides in a PowerPoint presentation and
it's fine it's not a make or break
feature for me but I am really glad to
see that Samsung is iterating on a most
defining feature of the note series also
the ocean blue model comes with this
really bright highlighter color S Pen
and doesn't really do anything but
dictate the color of the ink on your
display if you want to get a different
color you can always just buy a
different color resume whenever anyone
asks me for a smartphone recommendation
I always start with asking them what's
important to them in their phone and
overwhelmingly they always tell me it's
the camera I usually use my phone's
camera just for basic information
transfer but a lot of people use their
smart phone camera as their primary
camera every single day and Samsung's
not skimping on any of the features here
they've got the optical image
stabilization in the dual aperture lens
system from the galaxy s 9 but they've
actually added a couple extra features
that should theoretically make this
phone's camera just a little bit better
it's got a new scene recognition mode
kind of similar to what you'd see in
like a huawei phone and in theory it's
supposed to be able to take like a
landscape or plants or food and just
make the image look
better but in my testing it just kind of
saturated the colors and didn't
necessarily make them look that good I
took a picture of food here and it just
made the image look a little
oversaturated which might be good enough
for Instagram but personally I'm not
really digging it the other new feature
here is called the flaw detection
essentially what this is supposed to do
is recognize when someone in your image
is blinking or if the picture is
slightly ahead of focus now this is
great when it works but I found that it
was pretty inconsistent this is machine
learning base so we can hope that would
get better over time but for now it's
not all that great
overall the quality of this camera is
really good it's pretty natural unless
you turn on that AIC recognition mode
though it is a little bit warm but I
think most people will really enjoy this
camera the selfie camera is a little bit
soft but it actually does really good in
low-light circumstances which I think a
lot of people are gonna appreciate so we
have to talk about software the galaxy
note 9 is running Android 8.1 Oreo which
is not the latest Android Pi update from
Google but Samsung isn't really good at
updating their devices so I wouldn't
necessarily expect either a guy to come
to the no 9 anytime soon probably the
biggest software update here is the
addition of big suite 2.0 and what this
update is supposed to do is allow the
virtual assistant to understand
contextual conversations but it really
doesn't work that way let me show you
what I mean
who was the 15th President of the United
States
when did he die what are some good
Chinese restaurants around here
what about Mexican that was close but I
wanted Mexican restaurants not recipe if
you use the sampling phone in the last
couple of years you'll be used to this
UI it's pretty clean and it's not really
that different from stock Android
besides obvious Samsung any type of vibe
that it's got going on but the one thing
that really did annoy me was the fact
that I had Facebook pre-installed
and you can't actually uninstall this
just hide it now if you're paying it
that was in bucks for a smartphone you
shouldn't have to deal with blow air
like this and I would like to see
samsung and remove that next year you're
probably wondering if I would actually
recommend this song and I really like it
it's probably in my top 5 Android phones
of 2018 lists so far but look I get it
a thousand bucks is a lot of money for a
smartphone and if you don't need those
note 9 specific features you probably
get 90% of the power of this phone and
something like the 1 + 6 or a galaxy s 9
for about 50% of the cost but the note 9
was defined by refinement and with the
note 9 you're going back to the power
user phone that the note series was
always meant to be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
