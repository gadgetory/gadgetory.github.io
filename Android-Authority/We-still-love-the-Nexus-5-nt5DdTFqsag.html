time but I have to admit after using it
for a couple of days I really did miss
this little device Haeju Tasha Vergara
what's going on everybody and this is
why we still love the Google Nexus 5 now
over at Andrew authority calm Scott
Gordon did an article saying why the
Nexus 5 was still so fondly remembered
even until today and you should head on
over to Andrew 30.com or use the link in
the card or in the description down
below to read that great article but I
wanted to take that and kind of use the
Nexus 5 for a little bit so I got lon Z
units which is actually still in pretty
good condition and I used it for the
last few days and I have to admit I kind
of missed it now of course the Nexus 5
is the successor to the Nexus 4 if you
guys even remember that phone it was one
of the first phones that I ever reviewed
and it kind of signified a bit of a
shift in the Nexus program the Nexus 5
was supposed to be the way that Android
KitKat in all of its vanilla glory was
supposed to make it out to the masses
and it did a pretty good job of it
especially when you consider its 349
dollar price point and for that money
you got some pretty good specifications
the Snapdragon 800 which yes doesn't
even sound like that old of a processor
I was able to power the phone really
well and with the streamlined version of
stock Android well it was a very speedy
and snappy device unfortunately for the
rest of the specifications they might
make a lot of you spec hungry people out
there today well kind of sad the 5-inch
1080p display was really nothing to
sneeze at but it still is going to make
anybody who wants to K display is really
pine for the higher resolution and also
you get 2 gigabytes of RAM 16 gigabytes
of on-board storage without any
expansion and of course that small 2300
milliamp hour battery even with the
capacity that seemed ok back then this
phone was not going to be powered on for
much more than maybe about a day maybe
even less and I'm also going to talk
very briefly about the camera now the
optics looked really great on the back a
nice addition to the aesthetic however
this 8 megapixel shooter ended up not
really being all that great when you
compare it to other shooters like the
Samsung Galaxy s4 of its time
however the Android 4.4.1 update did
come out and it did up the picture
quality a little bit but it wasn't going
to make this phone anywhere close to the
best camera of 2014 much less the best
camera of really any phone so what did
work well overall the aesthetic did the
Google Nexus logo right here was
actually a really bold choice by Google
and LG as they partnered up to make this
film and it signified that the Nexus
program was not only different from the
rest but it was also kind of here to
stay
after all we got this design aspect in
pretty much every Nexus device that
followed and if you know me as a
reviewer you know that I love devices I
know exactly what they're about and they
wear them on their sleeve with the
design of the Nexus 5 you got not only a
device that looked different from the
rest
but even until today with all of the
glass and metal devices this is still an
aesthetic that you don't really get in
flagships or even mid-range devices a
whole lot today
this black soft plastic with the Nexus
logo again is definitely one of the more
iconic phones that has been out there
and thanks to Google and LG it is also
one of the most memorable but I will
admit that this material wasn't
necessarily the sturdiest if you
remember my drop test in front of the
Android statues at the Googleplex I was
actually able to get the screen to
shatter pretty easily and the circuits
were exposed underneath and of course
the soft plastic body would get scuffed
up incredibly easily now of course the
Nexus 5 also benefited from one of the
best marketing campaigns for Android
ever KitKat now you're able to get
KitKat on this device out of the box but
when it came to updates we were able to
get this phone updated to Android
marshmallow now I will admit I thought
that I was going to be able to get
nougat on this phone but it took me a
while to remember or really to figure
out that Google already stopped updates
on the Nexus 5 so it was only going to
get to Android marshmallow
but that said Android marshmallow has
been working just fine on this phone I
was able to get to all of my different
applications especially for work without
any problems and since the phone was
very fresh out of the box with
marshmallow there was a pretty speedy
experience I was even able to play Final
Fantasy 9 without too much trouble even
if it loaded pretty slowly and there
were some slowdowns in the middle of
gameplay so the phone was pretty easy to
update at least in Long's case as he
sent it to me with
Android marshmallow on it but it's also
really easy to mod roms are still really
popular with the Nexus 5 and there are
people all over the XDA forums and also
even in the subreddit that still mod
this device and found ways of getting
features at least of Android new get
onto the Nexus 5 and they're still using
this phone proudly to this day and we
can't really blame them so after using
this phone for the last few days I will
admit I had a lot of fun with it and if
you're still using a Nexus 5 unless
you're a huge ROM er I would probably
say it's still time to upgrade there
were plenty of great found after the
Nexus 5 including the Nexus 6p which
only came a couple of generations later
but there really haven't been that many
phones since the Nexus 5 they have been
that memorable and with this type of
aesthetic with the type of performance
that it had for its time and also with
its price point it's kind of something
that we haven't had since that and
that's why we still very fondly remember
and in a way still really loved the
Nexus 5 I was very happy and kind of
privileged Thank You LAN to be able to
use this one for the last few days and I
might hold on to it for a little bit
I'll send it back to you a little bit
later on buddy but until then you can
keep it tuned to Android authority and
watch our old coverage of the Nexus 5 we
actually had a lot of it including my
drop test my review and you can even
take a look at the color comparison as
there was a white version of this film
that actually did look pretty awesome
but you can head on over to Andrew

stuff and then subscribe to the channel
