by Toyota and we're live here on the
ground at CES 2014 here in the wonderful
fabulous LG booth
I'm here with Brandi of LG we're looking
at the LG life band touch it's a
sophisticated product that's designed to
actually help you in a lot of ways this
is Brandi's the true expert I'm gonna
let her take us through all right so
first of all it comes in three sizes it
comes in medium large and extra-large
and also come in three colors red silver
and black the coloring will just be on
the outer edges and the LG part and
spendable on the side so it's easier to
put on so you flip it on very easily
and this button is kind of like your
menu so it'll take you through different
menus the first one is pretty much your
basics it's going to be your time your
date and your battery life you press it
again that's how many calories you've
lost throughout the day that's your goal
and that's how close you are to your
goal the closer you get the light will
slowly turn from a red to a yellow to a
green and there's your miles how many
steps you've taken and let's say you
want to go to the gym and you want to
start a separate set of data so you're
going to workout mode and then from
there you'll also be able to see your
stats and you can pause and stop that at
any time and also it can sync with your
phone so you can control your music as
well as get call and text notifications
very cool so how exactly does it read
all that data that allows it to you know
come to the determination so it uses an
accelerometer and Ultimatum the only
reason we don't have the heart monitor
on the life and touch is because it
would have to be really tight around
your wrist and then be really
uncomfortable to wear all day but we
have it in actually actually have it in
the heart monitor or the gear button
okay I'm just so it's in the right side
of the ear and it can communicate with
the light bend as well very very cool so
when a consumer is going to be able to
get it um it will come out spring 2014
any idea on the price point for us
brandy no no price point yet hopefully
it's gonna be a reasonable one I'm sure
well and in terms of the battery life
and everything how much are we looking
at between two to five days three to
five days depending on
let you use the blue moon wonderful the
future of Fitness wonderful well thank
you so much for your time Randy you're
welcome thank you you're welcome
and once again thank you to Toyota for
sponsoring our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
