Jason this is where we try and answer
your most pressing Android questions
like Google Play services stopped it's
okay
we've got you covered so some of you may
be in the same position as Naveen where
you receive this message my phone keeps
getting this message unfortunately
Google Play Services has stopped what do
I do well all you have to do is follow
these simple steps first go to settings
then application manager then Google
Play Store and then select uninstall
updates after that reboot your device if
that does not work for you Naveen you
can check out the link below where
there's a number of different options to
solve that problem
good luck the next question is all about
how to put your phone into recovery mode
hello Jace how can i reset my galaxy s3
to stock recovery I'm using clockworkmod
and my phone is rooted while Behar
entering recovery mode and a Galaxy s3
is pretty easy all you have to do is
shut down your device and while booting
hold the volume button up the home
button and the power button
simultaneously there's a video in the
description below that shows you exactly
how to do it next question deals with
those who really want a good smartphone
but have a serious budget hey Jase
people talk about flagship phones a lot
but what do you think is the best a
budget phone maybe around $100 recently
we've seen an impressive wave of smart
phones for both entry-level and mid tier
phones from Alcatel specifically the
Alcatel OneTouch hero and the OneTouch
Idol lines now depending on where you
live this phone may cost more than $100
but it just goes to show
Alcatel is really helping the market
mature in providing decent smart phones
on a budget and for me I think this is
really exciting because in the near
future we may be able to buy entry level
or mid tier phones you know two or three
hundred dollars and buy a new one each
year and not have to be wedded to a
carrier because the only decent phone
available was a $700 phone that's good
news for all of us so the next question
deals with how to restore storage to a
new phone my friend Pierre asks what is
the best way to restore apps after
making a clean installation so I did
this thing quite often I'll just Reece
my phone you know three or four times a
year to speed it up if I've got too much
gunk on it I'll just do a factory reset
now the easiest straightforward way to
do this is just install titanium backup
now titanium backup is not a sponsor
here I'm not necessarily trying to pimp
their app but it's just so simple and
straightforward so after I do a factory
reset I don't have to install apps
individually I don't have to transfer
music back or my podcasts or audiobooks
and believe me those things are very
important to me I just did a factory
reset a couple days ago and it just kind
of all went back to the way I originally
had it I like that good stuff check out
titanium backup it has great reviews
it'll save his medics thanks for
watching Android army my name is Jason I
know many of you will be anticipating to
find out who won the t-shirt contest
question from last week where I asked
about the original inspiration for the
SmartWatch a true SmartWatch and I was
referring to an obscure at least I
thought was an obscure cartoon from 30
years ago called battle of the planets
and the team was called the g-force and
it was hard to ascertain actually who
answered the question first because we
had so many questions come in right
after the video went live via Twitter
Google+ and YouTube comments so I did my
best to ascertain who was first and the
first answer that I can find was correct
with six minutes after the video went
live and that was from Michael Francis
so Michael you can get in contact with
me and I will send you a t-shirt
wherever you live in the world you know
the drill
you don't want to forget about my
brothers in Android Josh Joe in the tech
ninja Kevin and Chris now if you didn't
win this week's t-shirt there will be
another Q&amp;amp;A coming out later this week
where I have another question for all
you Android aficionados connect with me
here on Google+ or Twitter I read
everything all the @replies all comments
all that kind of stuff and I shall see
you later on this week on Android Q&amp;amp;A</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
