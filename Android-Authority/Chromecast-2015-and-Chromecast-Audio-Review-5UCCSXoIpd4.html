bring one of our favorite media products
into this year's holiday season it's
Joshua freghar from Android authority
what's going on everybody and this is a
review of the chromecast 2015 edition
and chromecast Audio so here we are with
a review of the chromecast and
chromecast Audio these are the two brand
new peripherals if that Google has put
out to make media very easy to put on
your TV and in the case of chromecast
audio to your old speakers now I say old
speakers for a reason and we're going to
get into that a little bit later
replacing the original chromecast is
obviously a plug and play situation it
does look a little bit different and at
first we weren't too sure about the
actual design of this device it looked a
little bit odd to us and the fact that
it actually had to dangle down from that
HDMI port was a little bit odd but I do
think that there are some benefits to
having this particular design as you can
see in this shot right here it kind of
gets out of the way of any walls that
might be right behind your TV in which
the original chromecast might actually
be pressing up against this time around
it actually is a little bit space-saving
even if it dangles around and it is a
little bit odd in terms of the type of
aesthetic that they've picked for this
year's chromecast but I do think that
the chromecast takes its design from the
other peripheral which is Google's focus
for this year's lineup and it's
chromecast Audio now essentially
chromecast Audio takes the same concept
of chromecast and makes it a audio-only
device this is the kind of device that
you put into let's say an old set of
speakers which I'll get into again a
little bit more later or really any set
of speakers that you have and it becomes
a full-fledged audio streaming service
it will breathe some new life into any
of these regular RCA or even optical or
just the regular headphone jack type
speakers that you might have in your
house the chromecast Audio has the same
exact design this puck design that
doesn't have anything sticking out of it
because the cable that you use for the
audio can be adapted to other formats
but the one that you get is the regular
3.5 millimeter audio jack then of course
it does have to be powered by a wall
plug or if you happen to have a place
that has a USB connectivity you can plug
it into that as
setting up the chromecast and the
chromecast Audio require only one thing
your Android or iOS smartphone the
majority of smartphones will work with
chromecast and that's development that's
been great over the last year and a half
but on that phone you're going to just
have to install the chromecast
application and it's within that
application that you see in updated
design not only is it an aggregation
system for all of the different
applications you could use with the
chromecast it will also point you
towards any Content that it thinks you
would be interested in but there is a
little bit more to it you are able to
customize the backdrop on the chromecast
this time around with more options that
include not only the pictures you could
get from websites like 500 pixel but you
can also add in Google newsstand
capabilities so you'll get a ticker full
of pictures and also quick headlines of
the top news stories that are happening
right now the backdrop is nice to have
and if you have your TV on all the time
then it is pretty useful to have and it
makes it look really nice
when you're not actually using your TV
with your chromecast performance using
the chromecast is supposed to be updated
because underneath that kind of odd
design that we mentioned earlier there
are some updated internals mainly the
wireless signal has been updated from
the 2.4 gigahertz variety to 5 gigahertz
the 5 gigahertz variety does happen to
be a little bit more opened up and it
should also make it a little bit faster
when it comes to buffering the content
that you're streaming and in our testing
it does seem to do the trick
while the presentation at the Nexus
event that told us that the content was
going to be preloaded in the background
as you are selecting it making for
almost instantaneous streaming is not
really something that we've observed now
one thing I will say is recently I
signed up for HBO now and HBO now has a
pretty substantial portion of the
chromecast application right here
especially if you have it installed it's
going to show you all of the different
content that you're going to have and
one thing that I will say in terms of
the speed of performance is that on HBO
now with the original chromecast I did
notice that I had to try buffering again
multiple times the content tends to get
a little bit fuzzy when it goes to lower
resolution so we can keep up with the
speed but with the new chromecast I've
had no problems having HBO now and it
has been crystal-clear the whole time
now it is true that 1080p resolution
video is all you're going to
with the chromecast with nothing above
it but that's not that big of a deal
when a majority of TVs out there are
still not even 2k at the moment which
brings us to chromecast Audio now this
is the type of device that is a little
bit more specialized it may not be
something that all of you out there are
going to be buying but if it fits your
needs that this just might be the
perfect product for you let's imagine
for a second that you might have some
old let's say college days speakers that
you used in your dorm and you still have
them and they perform really well but
you don't really have them connected to
anything but your laptop or from time to
time you might have it connected to a TV
that has that type of output chromecast
Audio is the kind of device for you that
you could really make those speakers
actually be viable these days
chromecast Audio allows you to have a
singular source for streaming music
which won't get interrupted by all of
the things that your phone would do on
the side you can still do things on your
actual device while the music is playing
on the speaker that chromecast Audio is
connected to and the streaming service
on chromecast Audio happens to be pretty
instantaneous especially if you're using
a music streaming service it will fire
up right away it was only when I was
playing podcasts like on pocket cast
that it actually had to buffer
especially if I happen to be positioned
later in the podcast that I had to
download most of it and get to that
point first that we not to know
not to mention the fact that when you're
using Bluetooth your actual
notifications might interrupt the audio
that you're already streaming to your
speaker other than that however audio
quality from the chromecast Audio is
kind of standard maybe a little bit
above average you're paying $35 for an
audio peripheral device so you can't
really expect it to have the kind of
quality that a high quality DAC would
have but it is still very viable for
anybody out there who has a good set of
speakers and just need them to be as
smart as their TVs are with chromecast
probably the best part about the
chromecast is that it is available for
pretty much any platform if you have an
iOS device you're still good to go
Android of course you have it but even
if you don't have either of those for
whatever reason you can still stream
content from your computers using a
Chrome browser you can stream not only
all of the different streaming services
but you can stream a tab from Chrome or
the entire desktop and even then for any
one of you who have smartphones in the
Android space you can also stream your
entire screen to the chromecast so there
are a lot of possibilities here and as
far as the gaming goes we haven't really
been able to test out too many games
because the library is still pretty bare
but we do look forward to seeing how the
second screen experience on chromecast
might be able to benefit the daily user
and when compared to a lot of other
peripherals out there like Roku and even
Amazon fire TV this is still one of the
cheapest but also easiest to use
peripherals that are available for this
kind of content streaming and also it's
pretty easy to use you just have to hit
a button in the corner of your
application and you're good to go when
you press play so keep it tuned to
Android 34 even more and I hope you
enjoyed this review of the chromecast
and chromecast Audio less of a full-on
review but more of a way of showing you
how the chromecast and chromecast Audio
are bringing this type of content to
2015 just wanted to give you guys a
quick look at it and my thoughts on it
and I do think that at $35 these are
definitely the devices that are
available this year for an easy entry
point into smart television and smart
audio so keep it tuned to andr 30 for
even more check out more content from my
colleagues in android and stay tuned for
even more in the android thority
application where you can find all of
our content including our podcast and
then once you're done with all of that
subscribe to this channel if you haven't
already and when you're done with that
head on over to Angela thorny calm
