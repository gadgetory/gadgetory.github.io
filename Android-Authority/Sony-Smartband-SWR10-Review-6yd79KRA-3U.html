Android authority and if you're looking
for a fitness tracker there doesn't seem
to be any shortage of them and Sony is
getting in on the craze with their own
fitness tracker which we first saw back
at CES but let's go ahead and take a
closer look at the sony smartband and
find out what it's all about
the Sony smartband is the company's
first product to be powered by their new
core fitness tracker and in terms of
design the band is comprised of two
parts there's the actual band itself
that's made of a textured silicone and
Sony includes a small and large one in
the box
they're both adjustable via a two
pronged metal fastener so it's made to
fit virtually any wrist size the metal
fastener feels a little bit clumsy when
trying to put it on so I would have
liked to maybe see a magnet or a clasp
instead to make it easier to put on but
once it's on your wrist it feels very
secure and I haven't had any problems
with the coming undone by itself the
band does absolutely nothing but this is
where the second part comes in this is
what Sony calls the core which is
basically the heart of the band and it
essentially is a plastic white rectangle
with a microUSB on one end for charging
a power button on the side with three
LED indicators and a sony logo on the
bottom the core slips into the underside
of the band and once is on your wrist it
looks like a normal band
nobody would probably think anything of
it if they saw you wear it and it sort
of reminds me of those LIVESTRONG
bracelets people used to wear all the
time
by default the smartband only comes in
black but sony is selling colored bands
separately if you want to switch things
up a bit or if black is just a little
too bland for you it's also extremely
lightweight so it's very comfortable to
wear and after a while I pretty much
forgot that I was even wearing it oh and
if you want to wear it in the shower you
can do that too as it's rated IP 58
making it both dust and water resistant
in order to first start using the
smartband you'll have to pair it with
your smartphone via NFC or bluetooth the
only requirement is that you have a
phone running Android 4.4 KitKat the
process takes about five minutes or so
but it requires you to download three
separate apps the sony smartband dap
sony connect and life log it would have
been nice to see Sony integrate them all
into a single app but once you have it
all set up it'll automatically start
tracking your activity since the band
doesn't have a display pretty much all
of these smart band settings and
activity tracking has to be viewed on
your phone within the smart band app you
can adjust a few different settings like
Auto night mode which will automatically
put the phone
into night mode at the time that you
specify turning off all notifications if
you have notifications turned on and
once in night mode it'll also start
tracking your sleep you can select
virtually any app to have notifications
sent directly to the band but the only
thing the band does is vibrate letting
you know you have a new notification so
you'll still have to pull out your phone
to find out exactly what it is there's a
couple of other features like the smart
wake up which will wake you up if you're
lightly sleeping and the out of range
alert for when you leave your phone or
tablet behind there's a few other
applications that you can control from
the smart band like your music player
and camera but the implementation is
rather clunky
for example controlling your music
player requires you to double tap to
skip forward a track and triple tap to
go back a track and more often than not
when I wanted to go back a track it
registered my triple taps as double taps
making it easier to just pick up the
phone and change the track myself if
you're more interested in just tracking
your daily activities the life log app
can help you do that what makes it so
many smart band different from other
fitness trackers is that it tracks more
than just your fitness activities on top
of walking running in how many calories
you burned it'll also keep track of
other activities like social interaction
media consumptions like music movies
games reading browsing the web and how
many photos you've taken provided you
did it all on the phone that the band is
paired to the app is laid out in a very
clean and visual manner and the timeline
at the top does a nice job of giving you
an overall picture of your entire day
you can also bookmark parts of the day
should there be anything memorable that
you want to keep track of there are some
things that the smart band doesn't track
that other fitness bands do like biking
and hiking but Sony isn't necessarily
advertising it as a full-fledged fitness
tracker as it's meant more for tracking
your daily activities and overall
lifestyle when it comes to the battery
life it's got a tiny 35 milliamp hour
battery inside and sony promises five
days out of it and that's exactly what I
got so I think five days is pretty good
for a wearable device like this and it
also doesn't take long to charge either
it takes about 30 minutes to an hour to
charge and you'll be good to go for
another five days so I was very
pleasantly surprised that it lived up to
its claim and I think it's quite
impressive
can actually last that long you can
purchase the sony smartband now it
retails for $100 but you can already
find it for cheaper through websites
like Amazon and I think it's pretty
fairly priced putting it directly in
line with other competitors like the
Fitbit and it's certainly cheaper than
something like the Nike FuelBand the
sony smartband isn't perfect I do think
there's room for improvement but if
you're looking for a band that can track
your fitness and various other
activities throughout your daily life
the sony smartband is a great option and
with all the information that it can
track it becomes more than just your
average fitness tracker but that is it
