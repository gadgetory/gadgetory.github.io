from Andhra Authority what's going on
everybody
and I'm here in Temecula wine country
but before I get my wine taste on I'm
getting my drop test on and today we're
talking about the Sony Xperia z1 now
this is a metal casing that is
surrounded by almost completely glass
but the feel is incredibly premium so
we're going to see how it holds up to
our drop test it's going to be the same
deal as always we're going to drop it on
its back on its bottom right on its face
Sonia says that the glass on the exodia
Xperia z1 is supposed to be shatterproof
and scratch resistant but let's see what
happens when we drop it about five feet
off the ground I think is drop test time
first drop test onto its back making
sure all the cameras are okay and here
we go so right from about my chest level
about five feet up in three two one
and as you can see here the experienced
d1 seems to have done really well in the
back test there really isn't that much
damage if at all and you can't even
really see it but the only piece of
damage that you can see is in the very
corner over here where it pretty much
landed so far the tempered glass seems
to be doing it doing the trick and the
metal chassis seems to be holding up as
well all right here we go have it from
about chest level just going to drop it
right on to his bottom let's see what
happens in three two one
once again Sony is really proving that
it is good at making its phones this
premium feeling phone seems to have a
very premium build and it's holding up
very well to our test the only thing
that really starts to happen when you
drop this phone is those covers on the
side do tend to pop out but that's
really about it when you get to the
bottom here you do see some scratches on
the metal chassis on the metal frame and
it looks like everything still looks
just about as good as when we start it
so Sony Xperia z1 still holding up very
well final test right onto its face
let's see what happens
alright right from chest level in three
two one whoo that was a very square hit
and there you have it the Sony Xperia z1
looks great still it landed pretty
squarely on its face I got a pretty good
impact but nothing happened to the
screen really the only damage we see on
the phone itself is from the two test
that we did before but even then it
really wasn't that much so I'm going to
head over to the shade and see if the
phone will turn on after these three
tests we're going to go in the shade
that way we can see the screen a lot
better because it just doesn't work very
well in this daylight
let's see if we can turn it on yep and
this is the issue here
there might have been so much of an
impact on the inside that either the
battery got dislodged or something
actually got damaged on the inside so
while Sony does have a shatterproof
scratch-proof whatever you want to call
it glass on both sides all around the
phone it does still provide impact on
the inside and that would cause the
innards to not work anymore as you can
see I'm pressing the power button as
much as I can it's not turning on the
phone and so there you have it for this
drop test you can hear it in my voice
that I'm actually kind of sad and it's
true we had high hopes for the Sony
Xperia z1 and for the most part it held
up really well but the final test and
the drop test is making sure the phone
can still turn on and after three drops
we tried to turn it on and it just would
not I'm going to show you some footage
right now that I'm gonna have to film
later because the daylights just not
allowing me to capture it that the
screen actually does still turn on you
see a little purple hue over on the
right side even though the screen turns
on though it is not displaying anything
but that little purple noise over on the
side so unfortunate a Sony Xperia z1
fails this drop test and that one key
element the element that's most
important that it still works after you
drop it it might still look like a great
piece of hardware but that's about all
it is at this point so once again this
is Joshua Vergara I hope you enjoyed
this drop test stay tuned for all of our
Sony Xperia z1 coverage we have a full
review coming up you can check out my
