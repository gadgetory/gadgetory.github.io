is the 1 + 5 t we're gonna put these two
head-to-head and see exactly how they
stack up and at the end of it all I'm
gonna tell you which one I think is the
winner and why let's get right into it
kicking things off with these
specifications the pixel 2 XL and 1 + 5
t are both being powered by the
Snapdragon 835 processor with 4
gigabytes of RAM on the pixel 2 XL and
either 6 or 8 gigabytes of RAM on the 1
+ 5 t depending on storage both devices
are incredibly very snappy and I never
noticed any slowdown on either one the
extra ram on the 5 t is pretty nice
especially for multitasking purposes but
I never felt like this gave the 5 T at
performance edge over the pixel at least
not in real world use everything from
launching applications browsing the web
watching videos and playing graphically
intense games all felt very smooth on
both phones and these are probably two
of the most fluid Android phones on the
market right now you can thank a lot of
that smooth performance - the clean and
lightweight software experiences the
pixel to excel is running the latest
version of Android with 8.0 Oreo which
is just an absolute pleasure to use it's
the most refined version of Android yet
and it's all the small and subtle
touches like the new animations
notification dots picture-in-picture
support etc that makes this version of
Android so great to use I also love the
more pixel specific features like the
now playing feature that shows song
titles on your lockscreen and these
squeeze functionality to access Google
Assistant the biggest software advantage
of the pixel or any previous Google
device is that it's 100% stock
completely bloatware free and you're
always going to be first in line to get
software updates with the 1 + 5 t you
have oxygen OS which is currently based
on android 7.1.1 nougat we should be
seeing an update to Oreo soon but oxygen
OS is basically stock Android but with a
lot of really great features and
customization options that let you
personalize the OS however you want
there's a built-in dark theme that looks
awesome on the AMOLED screen and I love
that you can pick from a variety of
different accent colors there's a bunch
of other things that you can do like the
status bar for example can be custom
with different battery icons and you can
pick and choose which icons you want to
appear in the status bar so that it
doesn't get cluttered you do get a few
new features with this version of oxygen
OS like face unlock which isn't going to
be as secure as the fingerprint sensor
but it does unlock the phone extremely
quickly
you also have what oneplus calls
parallel apps and this lets you run two
instances of the same app which is great
for apps that don't support multiple
accounts this isn't exactly a
groundbreaking feature since several
other phones have something similar but
it is nice to see this feature popping
up on more smartphones on the outside
the pixel to XL + 1 + 5 t are both
constructed out of metal but their
approaches in design makes them look and
feel completely different the pixel 2 XL
has a more industrial design with
rounded corners and some subtle tapers
but the flat sides and back makes it
feel pretty blocky in comparison to the
5 T's curvy pebble like design it's also
taller thicker and wider than the 5 T so
it's not quite as easy to use in one
hand it has sort of a two-tone look with
a glass window on the back which I'm
personally a fan of and I like that the
metal is coated with a textured finish
and attracts fingerprints and gives a
lot more grip over the smooth metal
finish of the 5 T but I do think the 5 T
is the more comfortable feeling phone
because of its heavy use of curves small
bezels and 18 by 9 screens were all the
rage in 2017 and Google + 1 + were no
exception to that trend the pixel 2 XL
has a 6 inch AMOLED screen with quad HD
resolution and the 1 + 5 t also has a 6
inch AMOLED screen but has a resolution
of 1080p instead the pixel 2 XL is
obviously the sharper looking display
but the 5 T's 1080p display is a very
good-looking panel it's very contrast II
and vibrant and I like that the 5 T's
display has much thinner bezels than the
pixel 2 XL the thicker bezels of the
pixel aren't that sexy to look at but
they do at least serve a purpose
you get stereo front-facing speakers
which are very loud and crisp and the 5
T single bottom firing speaker just
can't compare you do however get a
headphone jack with the 5 T what you
don't get with the pixel - even though
the phone is still thick enough to house
one on the plus side the
to excel is ip67 certified against water
and dust whereas the 1 plus 5t is not so
you have to be a little more careful
around the pool or sink both devices
have fingerprint sensors on the rear
which is where I personally prefer it
and they're both very fast and accurate
at unlocking but the 5 T does feel ever
so slightly quicker due to its lack of a
wake-up animation one area where the
pics are 2 XL and 1 plus 5t perform
extremely well is in battery life the
pixel to excel has a 3,500 20 milliamp
hour battery and the one plus 5t has 8
3300 milliamp hour battery and I can get
through a full day with both of these
phones extremely easily with a
consistent 6 hours of screen on time no
wireless charging on either phone
unfortunately but you do get quick
charge 3.0 on the pixel to excel and
dash charging on the 1 + 5 T which is
incredibly fast at charging and also is
a lot more efficient than quick charge
when it comes to delivering power and
regulating Heat last but not least let's
talk about those cameras the pixel 2 XL
has a single 12 megapixel rear shooter
that's equipped with OAS AIS and an
aperture of f-18 the 5 T has a dual
camera setup like the 1 plus 5 but no
longer do you get that 1.6 X optical
zoom it still has the same megapixel
count with 16 on the main sensor and 20
on the secondary but this time the
secondary sensor is designed to help
improve low-light you can still do a 2 X
jump zoom within the camera but it's
purely digital meaning you're getting a
cropped image both of these cameras do
offer a portrait mode but the way they
go about achieving this is very
different and each of them have their
respective pros and cons because the
pixel to excel only has one sensor it
actually uses machine learning to
separate the subject from the background
this also means that portrait mode is
possible on the front-facing camera what
you don't get on the 5 T what I like
about portrait mode on the pixel is that
it always gives you a version with the
blur and one without which makes it
pretty easy to gauge how much of a
difference the bokeh makes and it's
always nice to have the image without
bokeh just in case you prefer this look
better
there is a crop factor with the portrait
mode on the pic
so your photos are going to have a much
more zoomed in look whereas with the 5t
you're getting the entire frame of the
image the bokeh isn't perfect on either
camera and depending on how complex the
subject is you will get photos where
they blur bleeds onto the subject but
overall I prefer the pixel to excels
portrait mode better because the bokeh
looks a lot creamier and more convincing
than the 5 T in good lighting situations
you can get some really nice shots out
of both cameras but the pixel to excel
does fare a lot better when it comes to
contrast sharpness and overall dynamic
range color reproduction on the pixel to
excel is also much more natural while
the 5 T tends to produce more saturated
looking photos in certain situations the
extra saturation works well and makes
the images pop but sometimes it can feel
a little too aggressive low-light is
where the pixel to excel really comes
out ahead of the 5 T the pixel to excels
photos are brighter with more details in
the shadows and highlights look a lot
cleaner and better exposed you can also
see a pretty significant difference in
sharpness and detail when zooming in so
obviously when it comes to these two
phones price is going to play a big
factor
and if you're looking for the best bang
for your buck flagship smartphone
there's really no better deal than the 1
+ 5 t it's a couple hundred dollars
cheaper than the pixel 2 XL and with an
all-metal build a bezel screen dual
cameras a blazing fast fingerprint
sensor and oxygen OS it provides
incredible value it's a very similar
experience to the pixel 2 - the high
price tag if we were to take price out
of the equation the pixel 2 XL would be
my choice between these two phones and
it all comes down to a few reasons the
camera performs better especially in low
light it's ip67 certified you get stereo
front-facing speakers and you'll always
be up to date with the latest software
which to me is a huge perk and that
makes the pixel 2 XL worth the extra
cost so that pretty much wraps up this
comparison between the pixel 2 XL and
the 1 + 5 t which one would you choose
