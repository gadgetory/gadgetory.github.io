handy the Android authority app guy
usually our lists are riddled with
utility apps tools and other apps
directed at adults today we'll be taking
a look at a few of the best apps for
kids even though there are a billion
people who like Angry Birds and
seemingly a billion people who don't
like Angry Birds there is little doubt
that as a kids game Angry Birds is
awesome it's a colorful cute game with
virtually no content that would make a
parent blanch at the idea of letting
their kids play it we won't go into the
game mechanics since everybody knows how
Angry Birds works suffice it to say
there between 6 Angry Birds titles there
are hundreds of levels so if you want to
keep your child occupied for a very long
time this is a great way to do so also
they're all free next on our list is
duolingo this fun and simple little app
teaches adults and kids of all ages how
to speak a second language with the only
prerequisite being that you can read it
offers Spanish French German Italian and
Portuguese and it even teaches English
if your child cannot yet speaking each
lesson is broken up into a bunch of
smaller exercises as adults it takes
very little time to shoot through them
which means it'll take the kids a little
bit longer this is a great way for
parents and their kids to bond while
learning a second language it's also
educational to boot that's a win-win
most kids enjoy drawing and doodling
especially in bright colors if you're
looking for an app to do just that then
we recommend kids doodle like most apps
on this list it's quite simple so little
minds can grasp it and it's actually a
pretty fun little doodling app each new
canvas is a different color and you have
about a dozen options for your brush
don't worry about colors since the
brushes change color on their own
there's even an option to play back all
the strokes so kids can watch themselves
draw the things they drew get mode
sounds like a kid's app but it's
actually a whole launcher so it's quite
a bit more complicated than some of
these other apps once it's set up though
kids can navigate through it easily and
access games a drawing pad books and
even local content if it's kid approved
as mentioned inside there's a doodle pad
kids books kids games and a bunch of
other stuff for your kids to play with
perhaps the best part is it locks them
out of the rest of the phone so you
don't have to worry about leaving your
phone with your kid and having them
screw things up
turbo kids is a deceptively fun little
racing game you play as either a little
boy or a little girl and you race
against a bunch of aik
to try to win instead of the classic
three star point system like Angry Birds
you said earn stars based on how you
place fifth is one-star third is two
stars and first is three stars during
races you can pick up power-ups to help
you run faster jump higher and restock
your freezing bullets from there you
jump run and shoot your way to victory
the controls are as simple as tapping
the screen and it's even fun for adults
as well if you take a look at our
leaderboard you can see how all these
apps stack up against one another as
always this is how you guys rated them
and there is no bias on our parts if you
want to check them out we put the app
links in the video description as the
saying goes kids are our future so we
try to include not only fun apps but
also some educational ones it should
also be noted that we stayed away from
those simplistic little arithmetic games
because those are really a dime a dozen
if there's an app that you think should
have been included but wasn't let us
know in the comments
once again I'm Joe Hendy the Android
authority app guy feel free to subscribe
to our youtube channel and check out the
written version of this video and our
social media links in the video
