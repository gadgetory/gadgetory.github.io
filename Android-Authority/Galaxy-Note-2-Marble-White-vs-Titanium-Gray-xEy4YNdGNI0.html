android authority we're taking a first
look at the Galaxy Note 2 we're doing a
color comparison for you in this video
to the right we have the titanium gray
Edition and to the left we have the
marble white particularly what's worth
mentioning for the first thing is that
on the marble white we do have a more
pronounced black border both feature a
5.5 inch Super excuse me HD Super AMOLED
display with the resolution of 1280 by
720 other than last on the back we have
a white encasement and on the right on
the titanium gray we have a horizontally
etched titanium gray type coloring on
the side vessel we have a silver eyes
type v design now but it still is rather
continuous throughout and on the marble
white we have a silver type bezel very
very similar to the galaxy s3 and for
many it just essentially looks like a
larger galaxy s3 both feature eight
megapixel cameras on the rear so it's
worth mentioning also that these do
feature Samsung's next generation AMOLED
technology with that we're going to have
more pronounced whites so for webpages
and things like that it is going to make
the colors pop color Pyrrhus were always
decrying samsung's technology saying
that it never really had good enough
right the whites and you know devices
like lg optimus 4x HD had a stronger
white color but it seems to have been
almost virtually eliminated with this so
we still have all the great color but we
also have really really strong clean
bright whites for me and for what we're
hearing from consumers and from Samsung
there is stronger demand for the
titanium gray Edition most people are
demonstrating a preference towards that
one and it is experiencing stronger
demand for guys who like show maybe the
white Edition the Marvel white will be
more appreciated and don't forget of
course too that the black is completely
user replaceable and there will be a
large variety of third-party options so
you will be able to customize the look
of the device so this is just a first
look at the galaxy note 2 we have the
titanium grey and the Marvell white let
us know which one you like below in the
comments and subscribe thanks for
checking out our videos guys it's Darcy
