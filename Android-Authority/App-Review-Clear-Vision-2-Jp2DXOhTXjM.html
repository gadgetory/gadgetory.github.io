this is joe hindy from android authority
calm and today we'll be taking a look at
clear vision too it's a game about
sniping people you can find it in the
google play store for 99 cents to start
you'll have the main screen and the
bottom left is a link to the play store
for the original clear vision game which
is actually quite popular in the bottom
right is a facebook share button from
there you can start a new game continue
a saved game or view the credits once in
game you can view the newspaper which
can sometimes show stories about the
people you kill on missions you can also
view your laptop which serves as an
email machine where you can find and
accept new missions to snipe people from
your living room you can use the door to
leave the house which is where all the
minigames and weapon shops are you can
also check out the TV which is just
another prompt to see if you want the
original clear vision game when you're
ready to accept the mission you open
your laptop and accept the mission
usually it comes in email form once you
accept the job the next screen will ask
you which gun you want to use you'll
have to upgrade every so often as the
gun eventually becomes too weak to use
once the gun is selected you start the
mission during the job gamers will view
a number of people through the scope of
a sniper rifle using the info from the
email gamers have to find their target
and kill them sometimes out all the info
is given and you may get transmissions
midway through the mission giving you
Clues the funnest part of the game is
you have to adjust for distance in wind
speed only during the first few missions
will there be a dead-on shot the
measurements are not always exact either
so gamers won't be able to just start
popping off rounds like a gangster movie
once you've locked on you shoot the
target collect your money and move on
the game features a bunch of missions
there are some minigames and cutscenes
to keep the game fresh but you'll mostly
be shooting people in the head in this
game it's very easy to play and that
makes it quite entertaining the game
progresses forward at whatever speed you
feel like playing it with the cutscenes
and minigames it stays fun so we gave
gameplay a 4 out of 5 stars if you used
to visit the classic website stick death
calm then you've seen the graphics in
this game everyone is a stick figure the
guns are black silhouettes and the
buildings and such are all simply drawn
this game will win no awards in this
category there is some music in the game
and it fits the scenarios pretty well
the snipers make your usual sniper
gunshot sounds the game's focus is
mostly on how inform what is lots of
goofy graffiti on the walls lots of
swearing and definitely a game for the
17 and up crowd if you're looking for a
graphical musical delayed this game
doesn't really bring it but for the kind
of game it is the graphics get the task
done so we gave it a rating of 2 point 5
out of 5 stars clear vision too is a
short game if you sit down and really
hammer it out you can get it done in
under an hour so playing the game over
and over again is pretty much the only
way you'll get your bucks worth out of
it if you play straight through only
upgrading guns as you mean to then
you'll miss out on most of the content
in the game if you want all the weapons
and all the house is unlocked you'll
have to do things like bet in the
underground boxing minigame our trade
stocks in the black market minigame
sometimes the payoffs are quite large
and can even help you upgrade to a
better weapon earlier in the game even
with the minigames and all the
unlockables it's still a pretty short
game if you're in the mood to shoot
someone in the head and frankly who
doesn't feel that way sometimes you can
open this game and do it digitally so we
gave it a replay value of 3 out of 5
stars when it's all said and done clear
vision too is a really fun game it's
also a really short game and that keeps
it from being a truly wonderful gaming
experience it's quick gameplay and
progression make it easy to open and
play around if you have a minute but the
fact that it's so short means it'll get
boring eventually the graphics are met
but the game is supposed to be taken
line heartedly so that's no big deal
there are things that are unlockable but
a couple of lucky rounds and minigames
and you can buy pretty much all of them
when it's all said and done we gave the
game an overall value of 3.5 out of 5
stars once again on Joe Hindy from
