Android Authority and within the last
year or so budget smartphones have
become more and more competitive and
nowadays you can get a phone with a 720p
screen a quad-core processor + 1 to 2
gigabytes of RAM for less than $300 and
in some cases even less than $200 2 to 3
years ago these phones would have been
considered flagship smartphones so we've
come quite a long way in such a short
amount of time and here in 2015 we've
already seen quite a few budget-friendly
smartphones hit the market and we can
only expect to see more as the year goes
on but the latest one that we're going
to take a look at here today is from a
Chinese OEM called ZTE so with that
being said let's go ahead and take a
look at the ZTE Blade s6 and see how it
stacks up when looking at the ZTE Blade
s6 it doesn't take long to figure out
where ZTE got their inspiration from I
know many of you are going to say it so
I'm just going to say for you it looks
like Apple's latest iPhone 6 with its
gray colored body rounded corners and
curved sides the placement of the ZTE
logo all the way down to the designed by
ZTE in California assembled in China
stamped on the back it's all too
familiar of in appearance the key word
here though is looks because the actual
build quality and the way it feels on
the hand is a whole nother story the
entire body of the phone is made of
plastic and plastic doesn't necessarily
make a phone feel cheap if it's used
right but in the case of the Blade s6
it's not the plastic is coated in a
smooth satin finish and while I haven't
dropped the phone it does tend to slip
around in the hand quite a bit my
biggest gripe with the Blade s6 is the
amount of give on the back of the device
giving it a very hollow feel this could
just be a defect with my review unit but
it was something I noticed pretty much
immediately on the bright side the phone
is fairly thin at 7.7 millimetres and
when you combine that with the 5 inch
display thin side bezels and rounded
corners and sides you get a phone that
for the most part feels very easy and
comfortable
to use in one hand taking a tour around
the rest of the device the power and
volume keys are located on the right
side exactly where they should be for
easy access on the left side is a dual
SIM card slot and micro SD card slot
followed by a 3.5 millimeter headset
jack up top and the micro USB port on
the bottom the blade s6 also utilizes
capacitive keys but they actually have a
pretty unique look to them the center
home button is denoted by a blue circle
that also glows a nice bright blue when
you touch it receive a notification or
when the phone is charging two separate
LEDs flank the home button which
represent back in menu by default back
is on the left with menu on the right
but if you prefer it the other way
around you can flip it in the settings
the speaker can be found on the backside
denoted by a tiny slit and it's a
speaker that simply just gets the job
done it sounds fine but it pales in
comparison to phones with front-facing
speakers and being located on the back
it can easily be muffled when laid flat
on a table or by a misplaced finger
as mentioned earlier the display upfront
measures in at five inches with a
resolution of 720p and utilizes IPS LCD
technology for pixel junkies the 720p
resolution might not be enough but to my
eyes that look just fine for pretty much
anything including games and video the
IPS panel itself looks great
colors are nice and vibrant but not
overly saturated viewing angles are also
quite good and it gets pretty bright as
you would expect from an IPS LCD the
blacks on this particular panel was also
surprisingly good they're not as good as
the likes of an AMOLED screen but
there's certainly some of the best I've
seen for an LCD without exhibiting light
bleed one of the best parts about this
display actually has to do with the
glass itself the edges of the glass are
curved similar to the Moto X and iPhone
6 creating for a very smooth and
seamless experience when swiping general
performance on the blade s6 has also
been a great experience inside is one of
Qualcomm's latest 64-bit chipsets the
Snapdragon 615 awed meant advise of Ram
the blade s6 is responsive snappy fast
and performs about as well as some of
the higher SPECT flagships out there
that you probably wouldn't notice that
this wasn't a top tier processor
animations are nice and smooth apps open
quickly and multitasking can be done
without skipping a beat the adrenal 405
onboard also provides for a great gaming
experience from the most simple games
like clash of clans to more intense
games like Nova 3 while maintaining very
playable frame rates despite how well
the Blade s6 performs I did notice that
dragging the brightness slider up and
down resulted in some choppiness
this most likely is a software-based
performance issue so I have no doubt
it's an easy fix but it was a little bit
jarring to see what the rest of the
hardware 16 gigabytes of storage can be
found on board and the micro SD card
slot will allow for an additional 32
gigabytes
if the built-in storage happens to not
be enough LTE and 3G connectivity is
also available but only Asian and
European markets are currently supported
if you live in the US like me you're
going to be stuck on edge connectivity
and I have to admit it made this
pretty difficult to use especially if I
was out and about and didn't have access
to Wi-Fi this could change in the future
if ZTE decides to release a u.s.
specific model but as of right now this
is how it stands moving on to the camera
ZTE is claiming that the blade s6 will
deliver DSLR like quality which is a
pretty bold claim but essentially what
you're looking at is a sony made 20
millimeter wide angle lens coming in at
13 megapixels when you jump into the
camera interface you're going to notice
two modes simple and expert simple is
basically just automatic if you'd rather
just snap photos and not worry about any
additional camera settings expert mode
will bring a few additional controls
like white balance ISO metering and
exposure but that's about as extensive
as it gets
various shooting modes like HDR panorama
and a few others are also available but
one thing to note is they're only
accessible when you're shooting in the
automatic or the simple mode while I
don't think the pictures are DSLR light
quality I will admit that they are
actually quite good pictures are sharp
and vibrant in color but not overly so
that it looks unrealistic and in most
situations where lighting was adequate I
was able to get pretty much any shot
that I wanted the F 2.0 aperture is also
great giving off that bokeh effect that
you can normally only achieve what they
do sell our camera dynamic range however
isn't the best and as you'll notice in
some of these photos it tends to crush
the darks quite a bit causing a lot of
detail to be lost HDR does help in most
situations but I found that it works
best indoors in outdoor situations it
does bring out more detail as you would
expect but it tends to create a very
cold and unnatural looking blue cast to
the images with indoor shots it was a
lot more reliable and what I really
enjoyed about the HDR post-processing is
that it also bumps up the saturation
giving off a very vibrant look that I
thought was pretty pleasing to the eye
in low-light performance was pretty
shoddy which was very surprising
considering the f 2.0 aperture the noise
levels are extremely high making it
impossible to capture much detail and a
maximum ISO of 800 doesn't help improve
the situation either all in all the rear
camera is
pretty solid but it's a far cry from
what you can get from a DSLR if you're a
selfie lover you'll enjoy the
front-facing camera as it comes in at 5
megapixels the quality isn't spectacular
by any means but just like the rear
camera it is a wide-angle lens meaning
you can easily fit you and a couple of
your friends into a single shot now
before I talk about battery life one
thing to be aware of is that I was
connected to Wi-Fi the majority of the
time simply because edge connectivity is
slow and it makes this phone practically
unusable so I can't really comment on
what battery life might be like if
you're on 3G or LTE connectivity so just
keep that in mind that if you're in a
region or market where you can actually
take advantage of the 3G and LTE speeds
your battery life may vary but with my
usage which is fairly average the most I
was able to get was 15 hours off the
charger and four-and-a-half hours of
screen on time which isn't bad but
considering I was connected to Wi-Fi all
the time I was expecting a little bit
more so it does have me somewhat
concerned as to what battery life might
be like on LTE the good news is the
blade S six is running lollipop which
includes a battery saving mode by
default that can greatly extend your
battery life when you're low on juice
with Android 5.0 lollipop out of the box
this makes the blade S six one of the
few phones to be running the latest OS
you get all the great features of
lollipop with a few additions from ZTE
but I hesitate to call their
customizations to Android a skin outside
of the custom launcher a few pre
installed applications and some extra
features it's a mostly stock build of
Android
elements like the lockscreen
notification shade overview and
applications like the Settings dialer
and clocks still preserve the material
design from Google like most Chinese
OEMs the custom launcher is colorful
with squared icons and does away with
the standard app drawer in favor of
having all applications reside on the
home screen leave you with folders as
the only option for any type of home
screen management however this is still
Android so if you want a more standard
Android experience third-party launchers
from
Playstore are always an option swiping
up from the bottom of the screen or
simply hitting the menu button will
bring up a panel of customization
options for the launcher itself you can
select from a series of solid colored or
abstract wallpapers and more can be
downloaded from ZTE s online library or
you can simply just use your own there's
also a built-in slider to give your
wallpapers a blurred look which I
actually thought was a really nice touch
desktop transition effects are also
available if you're feeling fancy and
once you're satisfied with all the
changes that you've made you can create
a backup within the launcher preferences
so you never lose them gesture and
motion features can also be found in
these settings and some of them are
gimmicky and some can be pretty useful
but you do have the option to disable
them if you don't like them gesture
features include things like air gesture
cover phone screen and shake it air
gesture allows you to control your music
by holding volume down and drawing a V
or an O to start and stop the music it's
a very awkward thing to do but it does
seem to work pretty consistently
cover phone screen will silence any
incoming calls or alarms just by waving
your hand over the phone and shake it
will open either the flashlight or
camera by shaking the phone when you're
on the lock screen the motion features
are a little bit more self-explanatory
with features like auto call auto answer
pocket mode and flip to mute the device
the rear camera can also be activated by
holding volume up and bringing the phone
up horizontally and the same thing can
also be done with the front-facing
camera when bringing the phone up
vertically towards your face and finally
you have me pop which puts a bubble
consisting of on-screen navigation keys
on your home screen for easier
one-handed operation the blade s6 is
already pretty easy to use in one hand
but this is a very handy feature to have
just in case you need it the ZTE Blade
s6 will be available globally on
February 10th directly through
Aliexpress and on Amazon and eBay for
select regions the price is very
affordable at - $49.99 and from the way
things are shaping up this year
especially with some of the phones we
saw at CES like the blue vivo air and
zenfone 2 the budget landscape is
looking to be extremely competitive in
2015 to be perfectly honest though this
isn't a viable option if you live in the
US unless you're willing to put up with
the edge data speeds but if you live in
an Asian or European market that can
fully take advantage of the LTE
connectivity then this is a pretty solid
budget smartphone to consider but there
you have it for the ZTE Blade s6 the
design might be pretty uninspiring but
once you get past that you'll find a
phone that delivers great performance
64-bit hardware a solid camera
experience and Android 5.0 lollipop
right out of the box at a very
affordable price as always guys thank
