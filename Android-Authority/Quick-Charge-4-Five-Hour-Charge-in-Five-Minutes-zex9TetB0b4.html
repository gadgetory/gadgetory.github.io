because not only did they announce their
Snapdragon 835 but perhaps geekier yet
is the reveal of their quick-charge 4.0
which claims that with just 5 minutes of
charging you can get 5 hours of battery
life you hear that
that's android gigs gushing over this
battery feature like louis c.k gushes
over Cinnabons dude i'm eating man
that's what's gonna happen next
you decide if we're going to be in the
paper tomorrow but that shit's going in
my face now over a hundred mobile
devices from companies like Samsung LG
Lenovo ZTE and even Google have used
versions of quick charge and there are
over 300 accessory products like wall
and car adapters battery packs and
docking stations that also support the
technology now for the new quick charge
for Qualcomm states that it charges
smartphone batteries up to 20 percent
faster compared to quick charge 3.0 at
the same time the new version is up to 5
degrees Celsius cooler while also
offering up to 30% more efficient
battery life quick charge for also uses
the third version of inos or intelligent
negotiation for optimum voltage this new
iteration of the company's power
management algorithm includes real-time
thermal management Qualcomm called this
a technologically industry-first
and claims it offers advanced charging
optimization by automatically
determining and selecting the optimal
power transfer level for a given thermal
condition I know non-geeks be like
quickly
that just means at least so they claim
that the phone will be able to cool
itself down if the phone starts to
overheat little not so subtle nod to
Samy there will also be a new standalone
charger with 6a of current that still
operates at 95% efficiency at 3 a
Qualcomm says their quick charge for
standard will offer intelligent thermal
balancing with high current charging
handled on the companion chip in the
wake of the concerns about exploding
smartphone batteries that caused the
recall of the discontinued samsung
galaxy note 7 this year qualcomm made an
effort to promote the many safety
features and improvements it's putting
into devices that will support quick
charge for both the smartphone and its
power adapter will feature protections
against higher temperatures currents and
voltage Qualcomm added that it is adding
an extra layer of protection to quote
help prevent battery overcharging and
regulate current throughout every charge
cycle unquote sensors and monitors will
be put in the chip battery and PM IC for
keeping things cool now the question is
when will you be able to get your hands
on a quick charge for compatible device
sometime in the first half of 2017
no-brainer there but the real question
is how will this change your behavior
with your smartphone could be pretty big
I mean for me I got two charges in my
bedroom two in the car at least one on
my computer and I'm always charging
every chance I get
trying to keep it between 10 and 90
percent ideally because I'm a bit geeky
that way but with this only five minutes
of charging and you keep one in my bag
and just have one and not worry about it
how will this change your behavior let
me know in the comments below I know
there are some serious battery geeks out
there
come on geek ease let's hear what you
think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
