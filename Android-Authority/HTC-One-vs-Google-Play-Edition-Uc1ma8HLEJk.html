jellybeans hey it's Josh the guard from
Andhra Authority what's going on
everybody
and this is the HTC One versus the HTC
One Google Play edition just like what
the previous GPE vs we're gonna coast
through many of the different aspects of
this review because both of these phones
quite frankly are very much the same
everything from the design down to
battery is the same if you need to know
more about the HTC One see our full
reviews here at Android authority I'll
have links in the description below now
these are the well-regarded aluminum
clad HTC One smartphones in black and
silver personally I'm a big fan of the
South black edition but only the silver
version is available in Google Play the
middle feel might slide around easily in
the hand but it is a sturdy feel for an
easy to handle 4.7 inch screen speaking
of those screens both are 1080p
performers capable of 469 PPI these LCD
screens handle everything very well and
jelly bean 4.2 looks very nice on the
gve stock Android elements don't quite
jump out of the screen but it is a
refreshing change from the darker toned
Sense UI performance wise you get the
same package between these two the
Snapdragon 600 CPU clocked in at 1.7
gigahertz and backed by the
tried-and-true Adreno 320 and 2
gigabytes of RAM both are speedy through
their elements as I have never had
problems with sense and blinkfeed and
the stripped-down jelly bean shows no
lack of optimization you don't get a
removable anything on these phones so
the 32 gigabytes of on-board storage is
what you get
while 64 gigabytes is available for the
original 32 is all you get for the GP e
an IR blaster is still available in the
GPE but obviously you don't get a
built-in app to use it now we all know
that the boomsound front-facing speakers
are awesome and the same goes for either
of these devices just this time I won't
be blasting music for this video the
non-removable 2300 million power battery
makes a return in the google play
edition of the HTC One you lose the
power saving features found in sense but
I can tell you that I never saw a
drastic increase or decrease out of the
way in the general battery life for the
Google Play edition rest assured that
cents or jelly bean on the HTC One will
get
you a good full day of work okay so we
get to the main differences between
these phones the camera and the software
obviously with the change to the
stripped-down stock Android operating
system you lose the added in Zoe that
HTC put in the original but it isn't all
bad because putting together video
collages and compilations can definitely
be found in other apps found in the Play
Store if you prefer the HTC flavor of
putting together your pictures and
videos though obviously go for the
original one when it comes to the apps
there actually aren't too many changes
between these two cameras both
interfaces use the entire screen as the
viewfinder with button overlays in the
original HTC one you are given some
filters and the ability to change the
ISO the original stock Android camera
app is more simplistic opting for just a
few buttons on the side and a touch and
swipe interface using arches you also
get HDR and some scene modes here but of
course there is also the photosphere as
far as quality goes the for ultra pixels
do their job pretty well either way when
zoomed out you see that both of the
pictures look largely the same and then
when you zoom far in the story doesn't
change too much if you look very closely
you can see a little more sharpness and
color depth in the original HTC one
these shots in the Sun both looked nice
and then in lower indoor ambient
lighting both pictures still looked
comparable I suppose it is best to say
that the GPE performs just below the
original HTC one but in reality the
ultra pixel still do a good job of
flooding light in for low-light shots
and for producing good photos and
finally we have the software we're gonna
start with the original as it saw a big
change with this new release due to an
updated Sense UI even if it is based on
Android 4.1.2 Sense 5 was a big upgrade
that brings the added blinkfeed into the
overall dark interface personally I love
blinkfeed because it is easy on the eyes
but it's still a good built-in way of
getting your news and social media feeds
and if it is too much at once you can
always hunker down to get just what you
need and of course you can easily get to
a more traditional Android interface the
app drawer is a vertical scroll and you
don't get power widgets in the
notification drop-down over all the boxy
look with you rigid lines works well and
since five is really a very worthwhile
upgrade
and now the Google Play edition the
stripped-down jellybean stock Android
operating system is on the menu here and
works well on the attractive HTC One
Hardware now first off I will admit that
I got so used to jellybean being devoid
of extras that I overlooked Beats Audio
but it is there tucked away in the sound
settings good on you Google there isn't
too much to say about the more
simplistic jellybean operating system as
you get your usual home screens app
drawer and notification drop-down that
does include the settings shade luckily
the extras available in the HTC One can
for the most part be replicated on the
GPE if you miss HTC Zoe there are plenty
of quirky camera apps in the Play Store
blinkfeed withdrawals can be satisfied
with a slew of aggregator apps like
Flipboard
honestly I don't view this as too
dramatic of a change it comes down to
how you want your interface to look and
what few extras come with the HTC One
blinkfeed and Zoe primarily obviously
the stock Android experience can be a
little more user friendly because it
provides less and blinkfeed can have a
small learning curve finally we make it
over to price the HTC One has been out
for a little bit now so it can be found
for around the same price that the
Google Play edition was introduced with
599 dollars unlocked and so there you
have it
HTC One versus HTC One Google fight like
I said before I don't view this as too
much of a dramatic change much of what
the original one offered can still be
taken advantage of in the GPE
and if you miss some of those apps
included you can always find
alternatives in the Play Store in the
end it comes down to your personal
preference
perhaps here more than ever stock
Android works very well on this device
and there's a fine choice for anyone
that is looking specifically for this
experience but for me I do prefer the
original in this stealth all black
