Authority and this is the Nubia red
magic Mars it's a gaming phone that
launched in China about a month ago and
it's here at CES 2019 the red magic Mars
looks exactly like what you would expect
from a gaming product it has a lot of
sharp lines and angles and this
particular version comes with red
accents which is something that is
typically associated with a lot of
gaming products
there's even an RGB LED strip on the
back because it's a gaming phone so why
not the red magic Mars uses a Snapdragon
845 processor and comes in three
different configurations you have six
gigs of ram with 64 gigs of storage
eight gigs of ram with a hundred and
twenty eight gigs of storage or ten gigs
of ram with 256 gigs of storage it also
has a six inch full HD plus display a
3800 milliamp hour battery and it even
has a headphone jack now there are a
couple of things that makes the magic
Mars a quote-unquote gaming phone one it
uses a hybrid cooling system that uses a
combination of both air and liquid to
keep the phone performing at its best
when you're gaming too it comes with
these capacitive shoulder buttons or
triggers that you can use when you're
playing games you can map the shoulder
buttons to whatever functions you want
based on the game that you're playing so
for example in this pub G demo I had my
right trigger map to aiming down the
sights of my gun and my left trigger to
shooting the gun I think I would have
liked these buttons better if they were
physical but it does make the phone feel
a little more like a gamepad and keeps
your fingers off the screen there's also
a switch on the left side of the phone
that launches you into a game mode where
you can quickly launch and flip through
your entire collection of games and also
do things like boost performance while
gaming the best part about the red magic
Mars is that it's available globally and
you can buy it in North America starting
January 31st at a starting price of
three hundred and ninety-nine dollars
not a bad price at all if you want a
phone with high-end specs and is
oriented towards gaming but what do you
guys think about the red magic Mars let
me know down in the comments section
below if this was a gaming phone that
you would be
sit in and keep it tuned here to Android
Authority there's a lot more CES 2019
coverage coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
