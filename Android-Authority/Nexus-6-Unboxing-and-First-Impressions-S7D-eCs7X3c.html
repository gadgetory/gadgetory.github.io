into it this is the unboxing and first
impressions I have on the Nexus 6
alright well here we are with the actual
Nexus 6 in this large box I actually
have my lens pretty wide out because I
have to have it that way in order to
have this box fit in the damn frame but
in any case we do have the Motorola logo
here on the bottom with all of the
information the actual book box itself
doesn't really have anything to it it's
literally just a 6 on the front but
without any further ado we're gonna jump
right in and here it is the Nexus 6 you
can race you right there it's a pretty
big phone we already knew it was going
to be but what is it going to feel like
in the hand we're gonna find out right
now that's a pretty big phone with a 6
inch screen from diagonal right here we
have a large body that has the same look
as the Moto X that's pretty much the big
takeaway here is that it is a larger
Moto X but this time around we do have a
indentation here for the Motorola logo
that is a lot like the original Moto X
but of course we have Nexus on the side
right here I have the white version here
and it does look pretty nice but like I
said already a couple of times this is
just a blown-up Moto X that's the main
takeaway here we're gonna go ahead and
put that on the side and let's see what
we have in the rest of the box
Nexus right here finally a little bit of
color with the orange right here and
what we have are the pieces of
documentation that are available
probably the sim tray tool that's third
yup there it is let's see what that
looks like yep this entry tool right
there and then of course a little bit of
documentation inside this box alright
get that squared away let's go and put
that right there and then under here we
also have a micro USB charging cable and
the brick for the charging adapter right
there it's kind of a larger brick I'll
confirm and you'll see in the annotation
right here on the corner if this is
exactly as if this is actually a fast
charger for the Nexus 6 because it does
the brick looks a little bit bigger than
I expected it to so it's entirely false
that it might be but nonetheless very
simple very easy those are the end
contents of the box including the Nexus
6 itself and here we are taking a look
around the device again you can see
already that this is a very large phone
six inches is what you get in the screen
size and it makes for an entire device
that is pretty pretty hard to handle in
just one hand for plenty of people out
there this might be okay as a lot of
people out there really like larger
displays and larger phones but for me
it's gonna take some getting used to I
have not used a six-inch phone as my
daily driver in quite a while but what I
will tell you is that as far as the
handling goes it is actually not that
bad moto has a lot of prowess when it
comes to their ergonomic on their
particular devices as the Moto X has
proven and in the Nexus 6 actually does
help a little bit to have that curve on
the side and this metallic frame is
pretty thin on the sides which allows
for pretty easy grip and especially when
you consider that this is a very big
device when compared to the Moto X which
kind of slipped around in my hand
because of its somewhat smaller size and
thinner sides because of its that being
said though what happens underneath are
all of the big specifications that make
this one of the most powerful phones
available including a quad HD display
out on which we have some plastic and
I'm going to remove that right now and
with that we have the phone in its glory
and the buttons over here still have the
volume rocker below the power button but
nonetheless we're going to reach that
pretty easily because it's lower on the
device and get this thing powered up
right away
as I go through the initial set up I'm
already going to be seeing some
differences in Android after all this is
Android 5.0 lollipop that we're going to
have and you can already see that the
welcome screen is a little bit different
and I actually hit the volume rocker
over here and you can see that the
volume indicator is actually different
as well being right at the top flat
design as has been androids case in
previous iterations most recently but
we're gonna go ahead and just jump right
through everything looks really nice to
be honest I'm really excited to put
lollipop through its paces home screens
here we are in the actual home screen
itself and wow look at that Android L
does seem to have a very nice look to it
everything seems to transition
beautifully and there should be
optimizations across the board when it
comes to this let's look at the
notification drop-down there it is the
one that UE we're all kind of looking
forward to no notifications means that
you can still see everything behind it
it's not just a huge shade and then if
you swipe down even more from the top
you'll get a larger version of the time
at the top a shortcut to the settings
and here are all of the quick settings
and even easier fashion and you can see
how that just moves in and out it just
looks really nice I really do enjoy that
Google camera is the camera that we have
there and here's recent apps we have the
cards right there very nice and you are
still able to do a google search from
right there
Google now is still up from the bottom
and you can see that little animation
looks really nice as well so keep it
tuned to Android authority I just wanted
to bring you this first look and quick
unboxing on the Nexus 6 we finally have
our review unit we're actually
absolutely excited to get our hands and
to really put this phone through all of
the tests and we're going to see how
this large version of the Nexus Fairs
when compared to the rest of the market
and this is pretty much Google going all
in with all specifications and pretty
much every detail when it comes to their
new Nexus smartphone and we're really
excited to see how it stacks up so keep
it tuned to your two android authority
drop us some likes on our videos and
subscribe to our channel if you haven't
already we do already have some
preliminary thoughts available for you
on the Nexus 6 and you can see one of
those videos over on the side right now
after that check out my moto X review
which in a way is a smaller version of
this Nexus 6 so you can check that out
to see if that's something that's better
for you but nonetheless the Nexus 6 is
an exciting phone and we're ready to put
it through its paces so keep it tuned
here because we are your source for all
things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
