everybody and these are our final
thoughts on the one plus 5t now I say
final thoughts because we've already
done an initial review on the 1 plus 5t
and we wanted to spend a little bit more
time with it to make sure we brought you
our real final thoughts and that's what
you're getting today if you want to
check on the initial review you can see
the card that's appearing right now or
go to the link in the description and if
you want even more detail on this device
you can head over to Andrew thority comm
and read the full written review written
by myself and David and Mel we are still
enjoying the design of the 1 plus 5t and
that's mainly because of the screen that
now takes up all of the front there were
a couple of changes that had to be made
but the vast majority of this design
still takes cues from the original 1+5
that includes the alert slider and all
of the buttons are in the same place and
of course you still have the headphone
jack which is still a thing here on the
1 + 5 t and the USB C charging port down
on the bottom the main change that
occurred here is that the finger per
meter is now on the back it's still the
ceramic reader though which means it's a
very fast and a very reliable
fingerprint reader for just unlocking
the device really easily by simply
tapping on the small circle now found on
the back but speaking of security there
is another way of unlocking the device
now and it is comparably quick to the
fingerprint reader and it's called face
on lock after putting your data into the
device you will be able to just look at
the phone and when you hit the power
button it will go straight into the
interface it is a bit scary quick but in
our testing so far we haven't really
been able to fool it which is nice to
know however the face unlock will not be
used for all of the different functions
for security as in applications and
certain other functions you will still
have to use either a passcode a password
or your fingerprint as they are much
more secure and oneplus knows that so
there really isn't too much else that we
can say about the design of the 1 + 5 t
but there is one not that we want to
give to 1 + is dedication to first party
accessories and that's because we got a
bunch of cases with our review units and
to be honest they're all pretty high
quality there's a red case that we used
for a little while that really makes the
phone stand out but we did go back to
the sandstone material for that case and
that's the one we've been using on our
review unit it's a bit of a throwback
and reminds us of the time when these
materials used to be what you actually
got on the phone itself so we can talk
about that display but it's a 6-inch
display coming in at full
HD resolution and it is an AMOLED panel
which means that the colors look really
great and oneplus has done a great job
of tuning it for its version of Android
oxygen OS if you do want to change the
way that color is displayed on this
screen then you can go into the settings
and go to color calibration it does
include a mode for srgb an adaptive mode
and you can actually get a slider that
allows you to go completely cool or
completely warm it's nice to have this
level of control over the display but
there are also some extra features that
return from the oneplus 5 one of the
favorites is a reading mode which I've
already used for the Amazon Kindle
application and has helped in making a
long reading session even more
comfortable aside from not moving to
quad HD resolution there's really only
one other missed opportunity when it
comes to the oneplus 5ts display and
that is the ambient display it looks
great but we think that just a little
bit of tweaking could have made this a
great always-on display as well but
maybe not having an always-on display on
here is one of one pluses ways of
ensuring good battery life and to be
honest our 1+5 teams have had great
battery life with the 3300 milliamp hour
unit in here we were able to get an
average of over 5 hours of screen on
time but in my experience in particular
I actually got a few days where I had
about seven and a half hours of screen
on time throughout an entire 12 to 16
hour day and of course you can use -
charging to get the phone back up and
running in no time at all the rest of
the hardware is still high quality like
in the oneplus five and they are the
best specifications that are available
now the snapdragon 835 is backed up by
either six or eight gigabytes of RAM and
then 64 or 128 gigabytes of on-board
storage you can also use dual SIM on
here but there is no SD card slot some
quality has been good across the board
including with calls on facebook
messenger or otherwise where we had
clear calls and the people on the other
side of the line said that we sounded
loud and clear the headphone jack
returns which is probably going to be
good news for a lot of users out there
and it's a pretty good yet standard
experience if you have a good pair of
headphones that are going to sound fine
on here but you do get a little bit of
control in an audio tuner if you want to
change that up a bit and when it comes
to Bluetooth headphones you can even
select what kind of codec it outputs to
your Bluetooth headset one thing I do
want to give another nod to is the
speaker it's a bottom mounted speaker
which is not ideal but it still gets
really loud without piercing the highs
are muddling the lows now I actually
tested this while like taking showers
what
I think a lot of people do from time to
time and the one plus 5t turns out to be
the loudest one that i've used without
having a bad sound profile but i did
have to make sure the phone was outside
of the shower doors because this phone
does not have an IP certification so
finally we can get into the camera and
this dual lens here does not have a zoom
lens like before on the one plus five
which had a two times optical zoom this
time you have a 20 megapixel F 1.7 RGB
sensor that is activated in low-light
situation so that it can group four
pixels together for even better
low-light shots now that's a really
lofty claim to make and we wanted to
test it against other phones like the
original one plus five but also mainly
the pixel two now in our testing we
found that the secondary lens simply
does not activate unless you're in the
darkest of situations which means that
low-light performance doesn't
necessarily live up to the claims that
oneplus made now the reason why that's a
bit of a bummer is because in all other
situations the 1 + 5 t actually performs
quite well ranging from decent to
actually pretty great in broad daylight
situations photos are nice and sharp the
dynamic range is pretty adequate and the
color saturation is not too far off the
deep end the front-facing camera is a 16
megapixel shooter and it does not have a
portrait mode but it still gets some
pretty good selfies for those of you who
prioritize that but speaking of the
portrait mode it is still a good
performer on the rear camera that you
can use whenever you want to take a nice
shot of somebody with a bokade
background but without that optically
zoom the lens there is a wider angle to
it so you're gonna get more in the
background behind the sharp subject we
also tested the 4k video recording which
yielded some pretty good footage that is
helped along by EIS so that shaky
footage will actually be stabilized a
little bit better this time around so
the 1 + 5 T remains a good and reliable
shooter to have in your pocket but those
claims about low-light performance go
largely unrealized and that's a bit of a
disappointment and probably even more so
for those of you who wanted to keep that
zoom lens we're gonna end us off with
software and oxygen OS which pun
intended it's a breath of fresh air
oxygen OS has become one of our favorite
versions of Android simply because it
doesn't try too hard a new feature in
this version of oxygen OS is parallel
apps where you can have multiple
versions of the same social media
application if you do want to be able to
change between them for different
counts but aside from that there are
some other features that return here but
they've been refined and overall just
the look of oxygen OS has been further
polished
it's as if oxygen OS is coming of age of
you with the app folders have a distinct
but simplistic look and the entire
interface provides some customization
options that are equal parts powerful
yet subtle for example changing to the
dark mode completely changes the way you
look at oxygen OS and then changing the
accent colors
provides just that little bit of detail
that makes it a personalized experience
back at the home screens you still have
the Shelf which is a great place to put
some widgets so that they don't cover up
the wallpaper and one plus includes a
bunch of wallpapers that look wonderful
on this AMOLED display on top of
pictures that were actually taken with
one plus five T's that double as great
backgrounds as well and finally if you
need some extra customization you can
actually change the function of the soft
keys so that you can change what they do
if you hold on either of the buttons or
double tap them oxygen OS refrain from
having too many features or applications
and thus it also keeps from having
redundancies so it's a breath of fresh
air to be able to say again that oxygen
OS is simplistically elegant and this
entire package comes in at a price that
undercuts a lot of the main flagships
out there at five hundred dollars for
the base model you will be able to get a
wonderful Android experience with a good
camera and good hardware that screams
premium and you won't have to pay an arm
and a leg in a world where we're paying
up to $1,000 for phones that have so
many features in them that we might not
ever use it's great to be able to go
back to the basics and just provide an
experience that is incredibly reliable
and something that you might be able to
use for the better part of the next year
or two and you only have to pay 499
dollars for it so yes we do think that
people would have a great time with the
1 + 5 t especially since it won't be so
hard on the wallet keep it tuned to
