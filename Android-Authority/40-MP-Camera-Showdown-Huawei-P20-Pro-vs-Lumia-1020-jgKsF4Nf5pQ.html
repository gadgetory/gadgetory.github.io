camera phones
despite being 5 years old is 41
megapixel rear shooter is still top of
the class but now there's a new
challenger in our midst
the Hawaii p20 pro with its 40 megapixel
sensor and a host of other features even
with the advantage of youth though this
is no whitewash while the p20 Pro ups
the game in some respects with it's
lighter branding and a wider F 1.8
aperture versus the Nokia's F 2.2 the
1020 hits back with a larger one and 1.5
inch sensor versus the 1 and 1 point 7
inch as well as larger pixel sizes at
one point 1/2 microns versus 1 micron
and the Lumia 1020 also boasts optical
image stabilization but the huawei makes
up for these apparent downsides in
creative ways
it features optical stabilization and at
least one lens AI stabilization for the
rest and potentially even more hidden
optical stabilization according to some
tear downs the p20 pro also supports
something called pixel bidding
technology which combines 4 pixels into
a single 2 micron pixel this creates a
10 megapixel image that captures more
light and reduces noise as a result and
the why away p20 pro also gets some more
hits in with its 3 times optical zoom
made possible by an 8 megapixel
telephoto lens the Lumia 1020 instead
has a lossless 5 megapixel zoom which
works by cropping in on the original 38
megapixel image up to 2.7 times to
preserve more detail than your
traditional digital zoom as an Android
Authority Loyalists you'll no doubt know
that the p20 pro actually has a whopping
three different lenses another first
that other lens is a 20 megapixel
monochrome sensor which is used to
improve the dynamic range capture it
also uses its AI in a range of creative
ways to offer things like scene
recognition but as anyone who's used a
smartphone camera can attest numbers and
buzzwords can only terse so much the
proof is in the pudding as they say or
in this case the photo of the pudding so
Rob put both these cameras through their
paces and this is what he found
to kick things off we're looking at the
high-resolution performance and the
amount of detail that each camera can
pick out while keeping noise to a
minimum we're really looking for clarity
here looking at outdoor shots shows a
very similar level of detail at medium
ranges
however the p20 Pro is able to resolve
finer details at a distance there is a
close call the p20 Pro also manages to
handle outdoor exposure and white
balance a lot better and was the least
noisy sensor but that said the p20 pros
aggressive post-processing also added in
a fair amount of over sharpening in some
shots it appears as though there's
almost a white border around some of the
details
certainly not to everyone's tastes macro
the p20 pro also managed to produce more
detail in macro shots that said it's
also still guilty of that harsh
sharpening pass which is a little
overbearing in some cases the Lumia 1020
has a softer look for better or for
worse but it's also a little noisier
there's also little color smudging with
certain details getting lost in
translation on the whole then when it
comes to getting the most out of those
huge mega pixel counts it's the p20 Pro
that comes out on top that said both
these phones take outstanding pictures
and you have to give the Nokia props
considering its age next up is low-light
performance this is a tough test that
any smartphone camera especially those
with smaller pixels packed into high
resolution sensors it's also pretty
important though as many of us we use
our cameras to snap pictures on nights
out or to capture cozy evenings at home
with a good book both phones do a
tremendous job here once again the Lumia
manages to pick out a little more color
and brightens focal objects nicely that
said the why away p20 Pro is a little
less noisy upon closer inspection the
post-processing is overachieving in that
area though this does once again result
in some / sharpening and harsh looking
edges overall it's a very close call
here that p20 pro has less noise and
greater detail but the Lumia offers are
slightly more lifelike result but before
we can call this one the p20 pro has
another trick up its sleeve
thanks to that pixel bidding mode and it
clearly pays off too as combining four
pixels into one results in even greater
noise reduction while preserving plenty
of detail finally let's get a little
closer and see how the zoom features
hold up under scrutiny both use very
different technologies and both have
very different results despite not being
a true up
zooom the Lumias 5-megapixel crops look
good and certainly preserve plenty of
detail of course you could just crop the
14 megapixel images yourself though so
it's only really useful for saving space
or saving time the YP 20 pros hybrid
zoom technology is able to capture great
detail - thanks to that higher 10
megapixel resolution but once again that
over sharpening rears its head but on
the whole is no arguing that this camera
produces the cleaner looking images when
zoomed it can also zoom in considerably
further before quality starts to drop
thanks to that telephoto lens even the 5
x hybrid zoom manages to preserve a
remarkable amount of detail for a
smartphone so to wrap things up then the
why away p20 pro emerges victorious and
that's before we consider things like
video with slow-motion portrait modes or
front-facing cameras and that's pretty
much the outcome you'd hopeful and
expect considering the 5 years of
technological innovation that it has
over the Lumia 1020 but with that said
it's not quite the whitewash that you
might have expected the p20 pro is
certainly technically superior and
capable of capturing more detail with
less noise but the sharpening will be
somewhat divisive the Lumia software
images lend themselves to more flexible
editing and result in a less harsh final
product the Nokia Lumia 1020 was clearly
well ahead of its time then and it's
still a competitive shooter even today
with its flexibility low-light
performance and extra sensors the p20
pro takes the win but the Lumia 1020 can
still hold its head high having put up
one heck of a fight it's like Rocky
at the end of Rocky Balboa so thanks ton
