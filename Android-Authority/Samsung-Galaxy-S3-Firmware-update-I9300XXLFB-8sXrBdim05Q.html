this is clay Youngberg coming at you
from the best Android site on the web
Android authority calm so they've got a
quick review of the brand-new OTA update
also flashable via Odin for the Samsung
Galaxy s3 GTI 9300 reports have also
said that it's available for the
t-mobile UK version of the samsung
galaxy s3 this software update is called
the i-90 300 xx lfb it has a few
improvements some cool stuff added with
it and we'll just get right into the
features included first off one of my
complaints about the galaxy s3 was its
lack of a master brightness control that
is fixed with this software update is we
have a brightness slider right here in
the pull down notification menu can
simply I choose automatic brightness or
we can choose our selected brightness
right there just like that
now the brightness is also no longer
available in the browser I did it as it
is now called
colors and we have default then we have
level 1 level 2 and level 3 default
actually sets it in line with the master
brightness you set from the notification
bar we have an additional digital clock
widget available in the widgets here as
we can see here emails are also
available with conversation titles now
also if you press and hold the power
menu we have some new options for sound
here we have silent vibrate and then
your regular sound profiles just like
that now the cool thing is we have an
AccuWeather fix we have a brand new
weather notification fix if we go down
to our device and see that we are
running the base baton version 990 300
xx lfb this until Android 4.0.4 Ice
Cream Sandwich but for everyone who
wanted a brand new brightness control a
few more improvements go ahead and check
your keys also you can check to see in
your software update if you have the
available download and you can flash
this via Odin it will unroot your device
if you are rooted but you can get the
stock firmware on xda-developers I'll
provide a link in the description to the
YouTube video and I also have a video
tutorial on how to flash stop firmware
and unroot your Galaxy s3 so if you
liked the video guys subscribe to our
youtube check out our website and stay
updated with all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
