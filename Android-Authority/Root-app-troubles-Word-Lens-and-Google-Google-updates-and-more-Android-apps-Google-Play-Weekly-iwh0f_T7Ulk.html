Hindy the android authority app guy and
happy Friday everybody this week we're
going to talk about a whole bunch of
stuff out of Google as well as some
potential issues for root apps down the
road along with a bunch of app news
without further ado let's get started in
our first bit of news this week google
along with a lot of other places could
be getting fine soon for their freemium
apps this time around is the antitrust
and competition authority that comes out
of Italy according to them Google Play
having apps that show is free but
actually costs money is apparently
confusing customers so much that Google
needs to be fine for it if successful
Google could be facing 5 million euros
and fines it's not just google play
either the Apple App Store Amazon App
Store and others are all under fire for
the freemium app model it presents a
unique catch-22 in the application world
because freemium is not the most
preferable way to do things but on the
other hand ad blocking and piracy have
made other forms of revenue more
difficult than ever to take advantage of
it's definitely had an impact because
147 of the top 150 grossing applications
currently use in-app purchases so they
are obviously working well for
developers another big piece of Google
noses squeak came when they acquired the
application Word Lens word lens allows
you to translate words through your
camera in real time ok so here's how
word lens works you point your camera at
words you do not understand and the
application will automatically translate
them into words that you understand this
is wildly useful for travelers
especially but it's still a handy app to
have along if you need it now it belongs
to google when Google up and buys a
company it's usually left to the
imagination what they'll be using it for
after all no one is quite sure as of yet
what they plan on doing with timely
however word lens is fairly obvious
eventually this technology will be
integrated into google translate and
frankly that's going to make google
translate way more epic than it already
is for now though you can still get word
lens as it is now if you want it's in
the google play store last week we
didn't have all that many Google Apps
updates to talk about and that is not
true this week ok so Google Chrome
Google Maps gmail and google+ all got
updates this week and we'll talk briefly
about each one of them gmail got a save
to Google Drive option embedded in the
email
options along with some extra stuff in
the overflow menu Google Maps now has
elevation profiles for cycling routes
google chrome now has support for multi
window devices you can undo close tabs
now and there are some new html5
features lastly and our winner of the
google app that got the most update love
this week is google plus the new app has
a serious you i redesigned and it's
likely the first of many redesigns we'll
see in google apps also included are a
new stories feature auto awesome movies
better support for large photo libraries
auto awesome gifs and finally it shows
your profile views it really was a
gigantic update our next bit of news is
about you guessed it google and it's the
first time i've gotten to talk about
android wear on camera so google is
going to be showing off their new
platform at this year's google i/o and
as per the norm they want some other
stuff to show off with it a fungal thing
that google is doing is asking app
developers to submit their applications
to google for use at Google i/o when
they demo Android wear if they do and
Google likes the app still get
practically free advertising at Google
i/o as well as prime placement in the
Google Play Store so if you start seeing
these apps to pop up you know where they
came from so a while back XDA developer
chainfire stated that rooted apps are
going to have a little bit of a problem
in the next version of android this last
week he said it's going to be just a
little bit harder than he originally
envisioned okay so here's the deal
originally it was known that the next
version of android would restrict how
apps interacted with the data partition
and thus would require root apps to work
around it however this week we also
learned that a number of other under the
hood changes could further complicate
the lives of those who use and develop
root apps some may think it's a
conspiracy theory to kill off root
access but when you look at what's
actually going on it's simply Google
making Android more secure and that
means things like root access will
require more work to get through the
security chain fire has been able to
successfully update his supersu app and
has stated that for most fruit apps
workarounds should be relatively simple
so you can exhale root users everything
is going to be okay so who wants to see
some trending applications as usual if
you want to check any of these
applications out you can find the links
in the written companion which is in the
video description below first up this
week is summoner wars it was a popular
game on iOS and it's finally made its
way to android word has received a sub
amount of press it is a digital card
game with a board game mechanic baked in
you collect cards and then play a sort
of modified chess game with them against
either artificial intelligence or real
life components there is quite a bit of
gameplay cross-platform support and app
purchases and it's accumulated over
5,000 install so far the app is a little
buggy though so do beware quick click is
a very simple application that allows
you to set either a volume button or a
sequence of volume buttons to perform
certain actions for instance you can set
it to turn on your camera after you
click the volume up once and the volume
down once in quick succession and then
when you do that later the camera will
open it's a fairly nifty application for
those who want more out of their
hardware buttons and it's free so check
it out if you've been a longtime fan of
the Google Play weekly show you've no
doubt heard about all cast is developed
by koushik Duda and it streams local
content to chromecast's now he's
released the all cast receiver once you
install this nifty and free application
you will be able to use all cast to play
media to that device so let's say you
want to play something from your phone
to your tablet's install all cast
receiver on the tablets all cast on the
phone and you can stream it easy-peasy
next up is a nifty little camera
application called whistle camera the
premise is simple you whistle and it
takes a picture that's essentially all
that it does we know there are times
when your hands are preoccupied or
covered in things like gloves that make
it difficult to capture images and with
this application you can whistle to get
it done in the demo video has suggested
taking photos while driving which I
personally think is a terrible idea but
the app is free and for the love of God
don't use it while driving last up this
week is a fun application called
beautiful icon styler what this app does
is let you change icons on your stock
launcher now for those of you who don't
know usually you need a third party
launcher like nova apex or action
launcher in order to use custom icon
packs what this app does is let you use
those icon packs on your stock launcher
and you don't need anything special like
root access you can try it for free to
see if it works for you but so far
people seem to be really enjoying it now
