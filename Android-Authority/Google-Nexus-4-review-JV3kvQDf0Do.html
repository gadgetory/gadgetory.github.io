the latest and greatest Nexus device yet
but does LG live up to the Nexus name
age Joshua regard from Android authority
what's going on everybody and this is
the Google Nexus 4 by LG the Nexus One
the Nexus S the Galaxy Nexus as you see
here and now the Nexus 4 not only is it
the fourth iteration of Google's Nexus
it also supports a 4.7 inch screen what
a coincidence
ok jokes aside LG has spared no expense
in making their top-tier devices for
this year you probably saw the lg
optimus G already and now you have that
Google Nexus 4 it has been difficult to
get our hands on one as they have been
and are still sold out at the time of
this taping but we finally got our copy
and I've spent some time with it the
first thing you notice is that the Nexus
4 it looks very very familiar it looks a
lot like its predecessor the Galaxy
Nexus some might call this blatant
copying but I had a second glance it is
obvious that LG has thrown in its own
vision of the Nexus I have to say though
I mistook the Nexus 4 for my own Galaxy
Nexus on more than a few occasions the
button layout is as expected the power
button is on the right opposite the
volume rockers you see here next to the
volume buttons is a slot to insert a
micro SIM card which is accessible with
an included tool the tool pops out a
tray for your SIM card and it becomes a
semi-permanent part of your phone once
installed the headphone jack is on the
top this time
and the microUSB charging port on the
bottom is flanked by wah has become LG's
device motif two Torx screws like on the
optimus G this is a nice addition to the
overall look but these Torx screws also
mean that this phone isn't supposed to
be opened as such the battery is built
in and not replaceable and in an
increasing trend with smartphones the
Nexus 4 comes with no memory expansion
Nexus is across the back with the 8
megapixel camera just above the end the
back panel is covered in Corning Gorilla
Glass which is an aesthetically welcome
change from the plastic backs of
previous devices underneath the back
panel is LG's other unique infusion a
crystal reflection design that shows a
block design at certain angles though
you should try not to drop your phone
anyway you might want to take extra care
of the Nexus 4 being primarily made of
glass means
accent chatters are definitely possible
even with gorilla glass a number of
users have reported that a good drop can
still break these panels coming around
to the front another change from the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus is the screen
instead of it being curved LG has put
their true IPS display behind a flat
panel because it is flat the entire
phone feels like a well-constructed
block with curves around the corners in
the hand the phone is easy to grip and
handle the true IPS display from the lg
optimus G makes a return in the Nexus 4
coupled with the Adreno 320 graphics
processor which makes the colors vivid
the text crisp and the overall viewing
experience an absolute joy capable of
1280 by 768 resolution at 320 PPI
LG has put one of the best displays
found on any current phone on the Nexus
4 the zero gap technology seems to do
the trick here not just with display but
also with touch as content slides right
with my finger and navigation is a
breeze now there have been some reports
of some delay and primarily the pinch to
zoom function as apparently the Nexus 4
sometimes doesn't render multi-touch
perfectly while I did find this to be
the case in Chrome I didn't quite have
the same experience in the gallery
supposedly this is a software issue and
updates will fix this SN Civet e so zero
gap and the screen are not solely at
fault honestly general touch and swipe
worked wonderfully for me and if
pinching to zoom ever had a bit of lag
it was just a matter of time before I
was used to it and it became an
afterthought far from a deal-breaker in
my opinion
performance is top-notch the same
quad-core Snapdragon s4 pro processor
found in the Optimus G is in this Google
device and brings with it the same
awesome power to gigabytes of RAM allow
for great multitasking and apps log
quickly and smoothly you can notice the
difference with my Samsung Galaxy Nexus
as this game loaded up on the Nexus 4
well before it did the animations and
transitions of the newly updated
jellybean are rendered beautifully in
the Nexus 4 and make the Android
experience feel seamless benchmark tests
put the Nexus 4 at the top of the
rankings thankfully a high capacity
battery on the Nexus 4 is capable of
going through a typical day without
running out of juice a dedicated battery
drain clocked in at about 7 hours with
general usage though you should be able
to get through a full day without having
to worry about plugging it in
connectivity in the Nexus 4 has been a
hot topic as Google's latest device does
not fully support LTE while it is
possible to enable 4G LTE deep within
the settings the results have been mixed
and have certainly brought little to no
success in the United States instead the
Nexus 4 uses HSPA+ networks which are
slower than LTE after testing
connectivity to the t-mobile network
I did find HSPA+ to be indeed slow but
still adequate for most tasks however at
full reception strength on the Nexus 4
I felt that t-mobile's mobile network
did well to keep up with my Verizon LTE
running on my Galaxy Nexus which was
only at half reception strength but that
was just my experience and to be honest
having adequate speeds is way better
than not having mobile internet at all
one thing I did find nice about the
Nexus 4 is that its beam still works
with previous devices it's good to know
that some sort of continuity and
backwards compatibility exists with the
Nexus line as you can see here NFC Beam
works both ways with my Galaxy Nexus
simply touch the two backs of the two
phones together and when you are
prompted touch the screen of one of the
phones in order to beam on the other
side on the other phone you should see
that the beam is complete and that
whatever you're transferring has gone
straight through
the camera of the nexus 4 is an
improvement from before bringing a few
more megapixels for a total of 8 more
importantly the interface has been
overhauled replacing the traditional
menus with touch and swipe settings this
is a great way of controlling the camera
that works well for touchscreen devices
the quality of the pictures is quite
good even slightly beating out the 13
megapixel Beast of the lg optimus G
colors are rendered quite well and this
camera should be adequate for general
shots photosphere is included in this
iteration of the Android camera which
allows for the device to capture 360
degrees shots much like those found in
Street View a blue dot makes it easy to
find where to position the camera around
the grid but you do have to be a little
careful and take things a little slow or
else the resulting image will have some
jagged transitions the camera may not be
an extraordinary performer but it is
most definitely an improvement in just
one part of an otherwise exemplary
package as this is a Nexus device it is
important to remember that this phone
comes with the latest and greatest that
Android has to offer just as important
is the promise that these Nexus devices
will receive updated operating systems
before all others and this is a big deal
new features bring new experiences an
updated notification drop-down has been
introduced in jelly bean 4.2 that allows
easy access to your most used settings
this drop-down can be accessed by using
that button at the top right of the drop
down or by using a two finger swipe down
an updated keyboard brings gesture
typing to Android a feature usually
found in replacement keyboard swipe it
is a useful addition that may or may not
make you forget about your replacement
keyboard I do like how it shows you the
word right above your finger though the
lockscreen is improved as well widgets
are now part of the lockscreen and are
displayed as separate pages you have
widgets to open up the camera to see
calendar entries and even look at text
messages or emails
these help make your important data
easily accessible without having to
unlock your phone Google now has also
been updated with some new cards to
bring you even more information at your
fingertips it remains as a useful and
very pretty auto populating hub that
should continue to get better
and finally I will mention the new
daydream feature which displays a clock
some photos or even just some colors on
the screen while your phone is docked or
charging it really is a nice way to
utilize your phone when it's just
sitting on the desk or on your
nightstand aside from all that some new
design updates are included in the nexus
force updated jelly bean 4.2 there are
plenty of new things to discover
throughout the operating system and all
in all it is a worthwhile update that
further increases the appeal of Google's
newest official device and so there you
have it by staying true to the Nexus
roots while bringing new ideas to the
table LG has solidified its comeback
story with their take on the Nexus a
quad-core processor a beautiful screen
and a search giant's backing make this
phone the one to beat while not
reportedly without its few flaws the sum
of its parts makes the Nexus 4 one of
the prettiest most powerful and most
important current devices the specs
should help the phone hold up for quite
some time while the software updates
will keep it on the cutting edge the
Nexus 4 is out now for $2.99 at 8
gigabytes and 349 for the 16 gigabyte
model unlocked t-mobile also has the
phone on contract for $199 so for my
full written review head on over to
