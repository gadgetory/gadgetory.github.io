most popular line of smartphones and
it's pretty obvious to see why the
recent moto G 5 plus offered a really
nice hardware experience in a very
simplistic software experience at a
pretty affordable price but Motorola
definitely thought they could do better
I'm David ml with Android authority and
this is the review of the Moto G 5s plus
if you compared the Moto G 5s plus to a
lot of other options on the market right
now and you probably wouldn't realize it
was a budget phone its unibody aluminum
shell and chamfered edges give it a
really luxurious look and it is actually
pretty reminiscent of the 1 plus 5 the
distinguishing factor here is the camera
bump and signature badge on the back
reminding you that this is really a
Motorola made product now Motorola never
really said exactly what the S stands
for but I like to think it stands for
sports the g5 s plus feels a lot more
refined than the previous iteration of
the Moto G right down to the click enos
of the buttons and the divot in that
signature Motorola logo I like to think
that this phone is a lot like a Kia
Optima it's great to use and as fun as a
daily driver but you're not gonna
impress anyone with that branding this
isn't a Porsche design after all well
the body shape is actually really
similar to the g5 plus Motorola's
shifted the headphone jack to the top to
make room for bottom firing speakers in
the bottom of the device
these speaker sounds okay they're really
nothing special and they definitely lack
bass but they get the job done and they
do get pretty loud right next to the
speakers on the bottom of the device
you're gonna find a micro USB port well
always advocate for USB type-c in 2017
motorola is including their fast charge
technology in this phone which should
get you about 6 hours and 15 minutes of
charging speaking of power this phone is
rocking at 3000 milliamp hour battery
which is more than a lot of flagships
can sport these days because motorola is
using a 1080p display in this phone it
lasts a really long time I took my phone
off the charger Sunday morning and it
only died on Monday night right when I
got home from work that's two full days
which equated to about 4 hours and 45
minutes of screen on time
pretty impressive since I just mentioned
the screen let's talk about it again
it's a 5.5 inch 1080p LCD panel and it
looks just fine 401 PPI was
honestly just fine for everyday use and
everything but the lowest brightening
setting was clearly visible outside
I think 5.5 inches is a great compromise
between the usability and media
experience so I'm really glad Motorola
bumped it up from the 5.2 inch screen in
the Moto G 5 plus there's a fingerprint
reader sitting right below that screen
and it is fast like really fast well I
love the fact that I was able to wake my
phone from sleep pretty much instantly
it also means that it activated a lot
sometimes I would just be sitting in my
pocket and if I put my hands in there
for any reason it would activate and
think that I was trying to unlock it
just got annoying pretty quickly and I'm
really hoping that Motorola fixes this
feature once they eventually update this
phone to Android 8.0 Oreo like I
mentioned earlier the Moto G 5s plus is
sporting that classic Motorola camera
bump well it's essentially the exact
same size as the one in the g5 plus
Motorola was actually able to stuff two
camera sensors in there
I'm really glad they were able to do
this because I'm really not a fan of the
whole dual camera aesthetic that's on
most flagships today almost nice having
two cameras in your phone the quality of
said cameras is another story well a lot
of these dual cameras give you the
ability to do two X optical zoom and
white angle shots motorola only really
reserves this for a depth of field
effect and well that's a cool effect to
have it's pretty bad even in great
lighting the depth of field effect looks
pretty fake and it really doesn't even
look as good as something shot out of
the 1+5 the regular camera is also
pretty so-so even at 13 megapixels
it looks pretty washed out and even in
decent lighting you're gonna get some
muddy soft images it's pretty sad to see
a phone so obviously focused on the dual
cameras deliver such a subpar experience
but that's one of the things you have to
sacrifice when you make a budget
smartphone oh right this is a budget
smartphone you're getting a pretty nice
body for just over $200 but what's
packed inside the Moto G 5s plus is
supporting a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625
processor 3 to 4 gigabytes of RAM and 32
to 64 gigabytes of internal storage
depending on the model you get yeah it's
not Qualcomm's latest snapdragon 835
chip but it runs this version of Android
really well and I hardly ever saw any
skipping or stuttering oh yeah speaking
of
version of Android is actually one of
the best in the business it's pretty
near stock with just a few tweaks but
these tweaks are actually really useful
moto display and moto actions are the
main changes that Motorola added to this
phone and they allow you to do things
like interactive notifications while the
screen is off double chop to get the
flashlight or twist to open the camera
there are quite a few more actions baked
into Motorola software but it would
probably double the length of this video
to talk about all of them so that's the
Moto G 5s plus at 229 dollars you're
gonna have a hard time finding anything
quite this good and if you've been
searching for the best experience on
Android this is definitely a top
contender if you like this review make
