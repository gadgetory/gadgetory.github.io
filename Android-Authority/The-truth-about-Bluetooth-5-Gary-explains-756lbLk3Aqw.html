authority now Bluetooth five has been
announced for quite a while now the
specification has been published and
it's going to start appearing in our
smartphones pretty soon probably most
notably in the galaxy s 8 now the
question is is once you strip away all
the hype or just rip away all the PR
talk what is the truth about Bluetooth 5
well let me explain ok Bluetooth 5
claimed two big things first of all it
claimed that it is going to boost the
overall data speed of the Bluetooth
protocol so it actually claimed almost
double the speed over Bluetooth
low-energy 4.2 and the second thing it
claims is much larger distances now at
first when this was announced it was
announced in a kind of a way that you
think that you would get both the double
data speed and the longer distances all
actually wrapped up in one package which
is not actually quite like that now I've
done some testing and I've been looking
at this and I'll just explain to the
truth about Bluetooth 5 now don't get me
wrong I think Bluetooth 5 is brilliant
and I really enjoyed my time
experimenting with it and doing some
testing about what you can achieve is
Bluetooth 5 but it's important to
understand from inky truth some key
characteristics of the Bluetooth file
specification now to do that I've got
hold or two development boards one for
sending data and one receiving data
because there are no consumer they will
gadgets available yet that I could play
with and now those boards I've got one
here hold on this board here is from
Nordic semiconductors is the RF 5 to 8 4
oh it runs a arm cortex-m for
microcontroller
and then it's got all the Bluetooth
circuitry built into it I've got two of
them so I can send data between the two
of them and then connected to a laptop I
can get some information out of it
telling me the speed and that I've been
able to achieve what the Bluetooth 5
specification does is it adds at the
lowest level that's what we would call
the physical level because it's talking
about the radio waves that goes through
there the physical level they've doubled
the speed of the data packets so under
balloon
low-energy 4.2 the data packets were
sent at 1 megabit per second now in
Bluetooth 5 that's been doubled to 2
megabits per second now it doesn't mean
you'll get actually 2 megabits per
second of data because there are a few
things that happen in the protocol
including gap between different packets
that are sent and those gaps are of a
defined size and the gap between the
packet has remained the same form
Bluetooth 4.2 - Bluetooth 5 so the
overall speed is actually about 1.7
times faster and we'll I'll show you
some figures go down a minute now that's
the new 2 megabit per second of physical
connection but there's a separate type
of connection this is the key thing here
it's a separate type of connection is
the long-distance connection so you're
not going to get 2 megabits over the
longer distances which may have been the
way that it was kind of initially
suggested in fact there's a special kind
of connection which lowers the bitrate
deliberately to be quite low maybe to
only 800 kilobits a second but it's able
to achieve maybe 4 times the distance
and it does that using a special
encoding method which I'll talk about in
a minute but let's start with the 2
megabits a second stuff so what I did is
I got an example program from Nordic
semiconductor who provide examples for
developers on how to get the Bluetooth 5
stuff running I modified it to meet my
particular needs and basically what I
did was I ran the throughput test which
tells you how my States you can get
through from one board to the other
around my house so the one board stayed
connected to my computer over USB cable
and then the other board I moved to
different locations now here's a map of
my house and as you can see in the
bottom left hand corner is where the
computer is and where the third board
was and then the little blue stars that
you see around the place there are
different places that I moved the second
board so the first one just above there
is I moved it into the hallway outside
of my office and then I moved into
another room then I moved
to the far corner of the house and then
I moved it back round to another place
in the house so basically that I measure
the kind of throughput in those
different places now my house is made
mainly out of partition walls so there's
not much to in terms of concrete and
bricks but it's all kind of plaster
border that the Americans called drywall
and you've got wound you've got
insulation and you've got some metal
frames and but basically we're not
talking thick concrete walls now you may
get different results depending on the
structure the internal structure of your
house now with the two boards next which
other I was getting around 1.3 almost
1.4 megabits a second between the two
boards and that really is a significant
increase around 1.7 times faster than
what you get with Bluetooth low-energy
4.2 now as I move the second board
around the house and the first point is
out there in the hallway just through
one wall about five meters away the
speed seeds start to change but to
compare it to how well Bluetooth 4.2 did
as well I also ran the same test over
the oldest stack which would then give
us a comparison to see how the two are
doing so as you can see as I move the
board the second board to point number
one which is at five meters away at 16
feet away then the throughput on
Bluetooth five dropped to one point two
megabits a second which is still very
very good and as a comparison we can see
that Bluetooth 4.2 was working at 372
kilobits per second so really that is or
double there now once I move the board
to its second point which is 11 meters
away that's 36 feet away went through
two walls you can see the Bluetooth 5
dropped down to 900 kilobits a second
now that's quite a significant drop from
1.2 megabytes a second but we can see
that Bluetooth 4 dropped from 622
megabits in 629 megabits of things that
would drop Oh from Bluetooth 4 was much
less than the drop from that you spirits
in Bluetooth 5 now once I move to point
number 3 which is really the other end
of my house diagonally opposite to where
my desk and the PC are we can see the
throughput drop significantly on
Bluetooth 5 we can see it's now
70 kilobits a second and on Bluetooth
4.3 - it was 386 kilobits a second so
it's four hundred and something or other
and three hundred something other so
Bluetooth five is still faster but you
can see that actually the difference
between the two has been reduced
significantly and what that tells it is
the further you get away the further the
range between the two devices the less
benefit there is to Bluetooth five when
they close to each other within a few
meters of each other Bluetooth five is
really fast double almost double the
speed but when you get to like ten
eleven meters away inside the house now
then that drops down and the difference
between the two becomes less noticeable
now the fourth test was a different
place in the house as you can see here I
had five hundred eighty four kilobits a
second and five hundred and thirty three
kilobits a second now although that
that's closer than point number three I
think when I'm talking about the
internals of households are talking
about furniture you're talking about the
layout of that they know the walls how
they're made the wasting signals bounce
around and clearly that the route that
had to be taken there between point that
the sender and point number four is
actually different to the way the
signals went through the house from the
sender to point number two and again
yours if your measurements will be
different depending on how the building
that you're using when you're testing it
so to recap what I tell it is that when
Bluetooth five have a clear path when
there's maybe only a short distance or
maybe just one wall between them you're
going to get good Bluetooth 5 speeds
much better than what you're getting
with Bluetooth 4.2 but as that range
increases as the obstacles increase the
difference between four point two and
five is less obvious as you can see the
way the Bluetooth 5 were described as we
get double the performance and four
times the distance or you can see that's
actually not true because Bluetooth five
actually has a kind of the same distance
in two megabit mode adjust as Bluetooth
4.0 has been one megabit now in fact
there are some mathematical calculations
that would imply but actually the two
megabits per second mode of Bluetooth
five actually has a shorter slightly
shorter range than that of Bluetooth
- but the difference is this in
Bluetooth five there is a new kind of
connection that's been defined the
special kind of connection that says I
want to make a long-distance connection
here so speed is ultimately reduced
right down to only a hundred kilobits
per second but way down from one point
three megabits down to a hundred kilo is
what that means is that in each packet
there's more energy being used more
power transmitted for each individual
bit that gets sent along and they also
use another trick now there's a thing
called hamming codes now I've tried to
explain this very very quickly if you
send me one thing zero that's how
network communications works if a one
gets changing to a zero along the way
that can be disastrous because you
thought you're receiving a while in fact
you received a zero and then of course
the whole everything just goes horribly
wrong now there's a way of sending
multiple bits to represent only one bit
now if you go really simple example it
isn't the Hamming code but it may give a
really simple example senator names one
let's say I sense for one zero one one
one one now if in the communication one
of those bits gets chained so now we've
got one one zero one we can be pretty
sure because there are still three
wandering there but actually that would
need to be one and so there's a way of
correcting an error correction and the
same works for zero if you send zero
zero zero zero and actually you receive
zero one zero zero you're pretty sure
it's still meant to be a zero because
it's one bit corrupted but if two bit
gets corrected using this system I'm
explaining to you then things fall apart
because you don't know that it's one
zero one zero did that come from zero
zero zero does it come from one one one
and two bits have been changed but
thankfully there's a whole area of
computer science called information
theory which defines how you can send
these packets and be sure even if there
is some corruption on the way that the
packets that you know what arriving
right now in Bluetooth five is called
forward error correction it uses a type
of Hamming code and basically for every
one bit was sent as another four bits
are actually so that means you also
bring down the throughput significantly
because you're sending more data but
you're more assured
I arrived at the other end now to test
how this long-distance connection works
because I don't have 100 meter house 300
foot house and how to see how Bluetooth
5 work sort of outdoors or I took my two
balls down to a local shopping center
with a friend of mine and we tried some
experiments now this segment is a bit
kind of wilder than me here in the
studio because I'm kind of doing it
there in the shopping center but I hope
you find interesting
ok so I've come to a shopping center to
probably test out some these Bluetooth
stuff over long distances I'm with my
friend here Juergen hi
ok so I've got the two boards here one
kick it up to my Mac and the other board
is technique here to a battery pack and
you're going to take it for a little
walk
and we're going to see how far we can go
okay off we go then yo can you go down
there and we'll see whether we can talk
to it ok so first of all should try a
standard Bluetooth 5 connection two
boards are in connection and the test is
running at managed 461 kilobits a second
ok so now we've come outside he's got
the other Bluetooth receiver in his hand
if you can we can spot him
all of the boards are advertising guys
running if I dare leave my laptop here
for a second just step out and see if we
can show you where how far away is four
there's my kid and he is all the way
down there underneath that parking
disabled parking sign I think it's worth
mentioning lots of people walking around
here and so I think as they're walking
sort of crowds kind of walk between me
and Jurgen that the bit late there seems
to be changing sometimes the LED is
flashing quite quickly sometimes it's
slowing down so just sort of
interference bodies cars that does I
also have an impact and here comes yoga
and we're going to ask him how far away
it was so yo good how far away is it 111
111 big paces yeah what's the
redirecting so that's about only 100
meters I would say yeah at least so it's
a hundred metres outdoor and that's got
a stable connection and today we have it
the truth about Bluetooth 5 the truth is
that it is faster than Bluetooth 4.2
there will be some great possibilities
but loads of applications that can be
made for using this heart faster
throughput and yet with that still that
below battery usage however don't expect
four times the distance coverage with
Bluetooth five using that to make a bit
of second connection if you want the
long connection then you have to put
your the Bluetooth has to be in a
special mode which they call CODIS
because of that forward error correction
system which allows the data to be
transfers slower but over a third isn't
as great put another thing that's great
for home security Great for home
automation but it's not the same stuff
you're going to be using when you're
sending audio to a speaker or something
like that so there we go I'm looking
forward to it now one thing just to
mention is that actually the two megabit
a second connection and the Kodi
connections are not mandatory in
Bluetooth fires so actually a
manufacturer can make a Bluetooth 5
piece of equipment with only one megabit
per second connection just like Blu
four-point-two but it has to understand
all of the Bluetooth fire protocols
include expanded advertisement packets
which I talked about in my other
Bluetooth video and that's great for
beacons and so on but actually we I am
hoping that when these Bluetooth 5 hits
our smartphones is a full stack and I'm
hoping they're not gonna just cut away
bits and just leave it with basically a
Bluetooth 4.2 stack with a new
understanding of the protocol packet I
hope they actually going to put in the
full Bluetooth 5 stack with the greater
distance and the greater speed we'll
have to see when we come to do that
testing so I'm going from an authority I
