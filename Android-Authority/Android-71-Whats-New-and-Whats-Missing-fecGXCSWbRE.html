authority here to take a closer look at
the brand new features in Android 7.1
nuga as you know 7.1 arrived on the
Google pixel phones but they have quite
a few software features that no other
phone will be getting so today we'll be
taking a look at the Android 7.1 on the
Nexus to see what features have filtered
down and which ones we've missed out on
now as you no doubt will have noticed
this is just the regular google
experience launcher this is not the new
pixel launcher you'll see we still have
our shortcut to the app tray at the
bottom there rather than an additional
app shortcut and of course our
navigation buttons at the bottom here
are of the old variety and of course we
don't have access to the Google
assistant we just have screen search
which seems to be the new name for
Google now on tap now perhaps the most
exciting new feature in Android 7.1 on a
nexus is the presence of launcher
shortcuts which you'll also get on the
pixels basically you just long press on
an app icon to get a contextual menu of
quick shortcuts if there's a shortcut
that you particularly like or use very
often you can long press on the shortcut
itself and then add a shortcut shortcut
to your home screen now these work for a
variety of apps although at the moment
it's mostly just google apps because
obviously Google is trying to impress
with the new Android 7.1 feature but as
we go on more and more developers will
likely add them for their apps as well
and as you can see they also work from
the app drawer now the next thing I want
to show you is up in the quick settings
area you can see if we bring down the
notification shade we've still got the
same notification set up we know from
Android 7.0 but our quick settings
toggles across the top have gotten a
little bit more numerous we've now got 6
instead of 5 and that's because the
little caret here the little drop-down
arrow that expands the quick setting
Styles has now migrated up a notch and
it is now joined on this first view by a
shortcut to the settings menu if you
expand you can still have access to your
full quick settings tiles and of course
you can edit the list and
and whatever you need including having
multiple screens now display out the
Nexus 6p here being a huawei device you
don't have the fancy fingerprint scanner
control for the notification sheet that
you do get on the pixel and on other
Huawei devices unfortunately it looks
like Google has decided to keep that one
as a exclusive for the Google pixels and
right from the top of the list of
Android features that we cannot believe
it took this long to finally make it is
the addition of a restart button to the
power off menu may have taken forever
but I'm just glad it's here we jump on
into the settings you'll see a few other
changes here nothing much has changed in
the general look but we now have a two
tab view up the top here so everything
on the left and a support tab on the
right which we also have in the pixels
now you'll be able to launch a chat
straight away or request a phone call at
any time of the day from Google to
answer any questions you may have about
your Nexus or Android 7.1 nuga a couple
of things I did want to show you in the
settings menu though is for starters in
storage we have a new button up the top
here for managed storage this Storage
Manager provides two options one is
smart storage which is basically just an
automated version of the option you have
in Google Photos to free up space it
allows you to automatically remove
photos and videos periodically from your
device so you don't have to be prompted
to back them up and get them off your
phone every now and then so that's the
automatic storage cleanup and then
there's another one called free up space
now this is basically just a manual
version you've still got access to
photos and videos to clear up but you
can also choose to enable apps and
download cleanup which basically will
populate this list every now and then
with a bunch of downloads that you could
essentially delete as well as apps that
maybe you're not using so much and down
the bottom here you'll get a quick tally
of how much space you can free up if you
do so so the next thing I wanted to show
you is a little bit further down it's a
new section called moves which you will
have seen if you've been watching any of
our google coverage now moves is
basically a bunch of gesture shortcuts
there's the familiar one for a double
press of the power button to launch you
straight to the camera app then there's
of course the flip gesture that you
would know from Motorola devices to
switch between the front and rear facing
camera and then live to check your phone
also known as ambient mode where you
pick up your phone and it will display
your notifications on the lock screen of
course we're not going to get the fancy
new parallax wallpaper effect that you
see on the new pixel phones and the
wallpaper picker on Android 7.1 on a
traditional nexus is much the same as it
has always been follow Android 7.1 does
have support for round icons in the
Android 7.1 version you'll find on
nexuses you'll see that all of the icons
are still of the AA variety and not the
circular ones you'll see on the pixel of
course if you're willing to read your
phone then you can always install the
Google pixel launcher and get most of
the features available on the Google
pixel phones including access to the
Google assistant so what else is new and
what else is missing unfortunately it
looks like access to the system UI tuna
has been removed in Android 7.1 on the
Nexus now if you long press on the
Settings icon up here that'll just take
you straight into the settings menu it
won't provide access to any of the
customization options we had access to
before that also means that things like
night mode and dark mode are not going
to be making an appearance until
potentially later on you'll see here
also that we're running Android 7.1.1
not just 7.1 alone so that was a little
bit of a surprise
of course you'll also see that nothing
much has changed in the East Egg you
still have access to the neko atsume cat
catching game which is rather fun and
one other thing you'll notice here is
that in the system updates of the top
eater when you press that you get a
splash screen that just tells you that
your system is up to date it will
actually check for an update at the time
but there's no longer that satisfying
button to mash when updates
start to roll out so that's about it for
the new stuff in Android 7.1 on the
Nexus devices there may be some
additional pixel features coming at a
later point there is one more Developer
Preview planned for later in November
before the final public will release of
Android 7.1 in early December
till then guys keep it locked to Android
