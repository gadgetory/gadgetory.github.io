Hindy the android authority app guy
happy Friday everybody this week we're
going to talk about some awesome updates
to Google search a questionable move
regarding Google Drive and of course
more awesome app news so let's go first
up this week is a new update to Google
search that brought a whole bunch of
features the first one we'll talk about
is the new parking feature you can now
ask Google now to keep track of where
you're parked and it'll let you know
where it is when you need to know our
own andrew grush took a look at it and
found that the results can be
occasionally spotty but we expect Google
to improve this feature over time
apparently google now also includes more
detailed restaurant information you can
filter restaurants by cuisine type cost
rating and other variables so you can
plan your dinner outing accordingly
there are also screenshots floating
around the web of Google now being able
to do more with places like malls where
you can search stores within the mall
which is also really cool well we're on
the topic of Google how about all those
standalone applications that got
released this last week when I reviewed
the Microsoft Office application a while
back one thing a lot of my comments were
saying is how Google Drive is better
because it bundles the cloud storage and
the office apps into a single bundle
unfortunately folks they won't be able
to say that anymore because google is
unbundling google drive from google docs
and now we'll see separate applications
opening a file on google drive will now
prompt you to use one of Google's Office
apps it actually gets just a little bit
worse instead of having a single office
application in a single cloud storage
app Google is releasing Docs sheets and
slides all in separate applications this
means that the functionality you have
with only one application before will
now require for apps to have currently
only docs and sheets are available in
the Google Play Store and slides is
coming soon it's questionable and I look
forward to seeing how people will
receive this move especially after the
visceral reception Microsoft got for
doing essentially the same thing with
office and onedrive so snapchat got an
update this last week that adds video
calls and text chatting okay so snapchat
now supports video and text chats it
still keeps that vanilla snapchat
experience but if you always wanted a
little more out of snapchat than this
update is a pretty big deal the text
chat is pretty bland right now but we
assume it'll get improved over time the
video part is actually way more
interesting snapchat will notify you in
both you and the other person are
viewing a conversation by showing a blue
pulsing button when
press it it'll connect to a video chat
and you can continue from there since
you can only video chat when everyone is
paying attention there is no missed
video calls and according to reports the
videos connect instantaneously now with
more mainstream features it'll be
interesting to see if people start
taking snapchat more seriously in our
last bit of news this week LastPass got
an update that integrates it with the
galaxy s5 fingerprint scanner and that
makes the fingerprint scanner actually
useful okay so here's how it works
LastPass lets you store passwords for
apps and websites and then automatically
log you into those apps and sites
typically you only need to remember your
LastPass password and then everything
else is handled by LastPass it's worth
mentioning that it's actually on our
list of the best password manager apps
for Android with the galaxy s5
integration it allows you to log into
lastpass with the fingerprint scanner
instead of the password this means you
can all sensibly log into applications
and websites directly through the
fingerprint scanner and let's face facts
that's infinitely useful and cool the
only downside is LastPass requires a one
dollar per month subscription but it's
always been that way for mobile users so
that's not really that new so who wants
to check out some trending applications
as usual if you want to check any of
these applications out you can find the
links in the briton companion which is
in the video description below first up
this week is faces in this unique
application lets you sign into a bunch
of social networks and when your friends
check in nearby it'll show you a
notification letting you know that
they're around this is great for
socialites who enjoy improv Jim meetups
and the app features a clean and sleek
interface it's totally free to use and
supports a range of social networks and
they're working on adding more it's also
free so why not right next up is a brand
new application called slide slide is a
fairly simple application that gives you
shortcuts to your five favorite
applications in the form of floating
icons it works pretty much like it looks
there's a little dock on the side of
your device that you tap once you do
your five favorite applications pop up
and you can easily switch between them
this is a nifty application that can be
really useful for people who use the
same apps all the time and it gets out
of your way when you don't need it it's
not an N sense in the Google Play Store
and you should give it a look buzz
launcher is a popular and unique
application that just past the seven
million download mark using this app you
can theme and organize your home screen
and a number of unique ways and has over
300,000 home screens to choose from
they've also updated their application
recently to include a few new features
it's free to download in the Google
Place
or clumsy ninja is a newly popular game
that is kind of cute and also enjoyable
you play as a clumsy ninja as you
complete various tasks like jumping on a
trampoline or catching chickens it's a
silly time waster so there's no real
gaming value but admittedly it was fun
to just play around with it from time to
time also it's free last up this week is
the venerable HD widgets that releasing
version 4.2 the google play store and a
staged rollout so some people may have
it while others may not have it yet the
update includes a completely overhauled
interface as well as completely
overhauled widgets there are also new
themes included including a more modern
flat theme as well as upcoming updates
to their theme add-on app called color
form if you haven't checked out HD
widgets yet now is a great time to do so
