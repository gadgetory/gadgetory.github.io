stats 315 million phones were shipped in
quarter 1 of 2014 and Android now has a
billion active users who sent 20 billion
text messages took 93 million selfies
and we have it on good authority that 31
million of them contained duckfaces
Android users took one point five
trillion steps and check their phones
100 billion times are about 125 times
per user per day the Android tablet
market share has increased to 62% and
that's not including the Kindle Fire
series tablet owners have downloaded 236
percent more applications than they did
at this time last year Android one was
announced as a platform to help emerging
markets grow more quickly by creating a
standard design using stock Android to
make phones that cost like nothing to
demonstrate they showed a Micromax
device with some pretty decent specs
that cost under $100 Matias Duarte took
the stage to talk about the new Android
L no they did not announce the new L
name the new Android L will have over
5,000 new developer api's to tap into as
well as a new design standard the
material design standard took center
stage for pretty much the first hour of
the presentation they showed how you can
use material design on web car wearables
mobile and tablet to get a truly
integrated experience that's consistent
across all platforms goodbye forever
holo you've had a good run the material
design utilizes a more 3d interface than
before and it comes with a host of fun
transitions and animation features to
make everything seem smoother and look
more enjoyable and colorful they also
announced polymer which is a tool web
developers can use to create web apps
with the material design standard you
can find more info on all of this at
google.com slash design next up was more
Android L stuff and they went even
deeper into detail about material design
and how it'll look in applications like
Gmail and the dialer app they also went
over some of the new features of Android
L which include a much improved
notification system that includes
notifications on the home screen and
heads-up notifications that pop up at
the top of the display that you can deal
with or ignore also mentioned is a
redesigned recent apps thing that is not
only more beautiful but more functional
and makes it easier
and more efficient to deal with your
open apps new app indexing allows you to
open content in applications instead of
in the web and we kind of knew that was
coming but it also allows for the
ability to search for things you had in
an app before which was really cool
the last Android L thing they mentioned
was the personal unlocking feature using
something like your Bluetooth watch or
other personal identifying marks your
device will only ask for a pin if it
senses that the person holding it isn't
you this is pretty nifty and it'll get
way more awesome once everyone has
wearables there will also be a new
factory reset protection mechanism so
people don't steal your phone and delete
everything oh and there's a new Android
keyboard at this point it was stated
that Android has had third-party
keyboard and widget support for four or
five years now
we have unconfirmed unreliable reports
that it was at this point in the
presentation that Tim Cook started to
cry okay I lied they talked about
Android L a whole lot more
the default new runtime will be arts in
Android L and they have tweaked it even
more to give apps up to two times the
performance which should effectively
take care of app stuttering they also
happen to mention that art is 64-bit
compatible which is great news they also
worked with arm Qualcomm and Nvidia to
create better handling of graphics which
includes tessellation various shaders
and a whole lot more the very last thing
they talked about is the battery life
there will now be a new way to monitor
battery stats shows things like
wakelocks and rogue apps and allows you
to more easily identify these things and
fix them they have also redone how apps
handle things like network connections
GPS Bluetooth and more to help squeeze
every last second of battery life there
is also a new built-in battery saver
mode should you need that next up they
finally announced Android wear the LGG
watch as well as a previously
unannounced Samsung gear live will be
available by the end of the day today
which is great news for you they demoed
where to show all the awesome things
it's capable of doing at one point
presenter David singleton ordered a
pizza in under 20 seconds using Android
wear awesome during the demo they made
it very clear that apps notifications
and Google now will sync flawlessly
between your watch and your phone so you
have full integration with both which is
nice they also put a pretty big focus on
voice control as you can respond to
messages with voice control many
applications with voice and do a whole
lot more with voice
next they announced Android auto and did
a demonstration of the kinds of stuff it
can do like Android where the focal
point is voice control as you can tell
Android auto to do pretty much anything
and it will do it where it is that there
are over 25 car brands working with
Google and Android auto right now and
some cars should be out by the end of
the year that use Android auto next up
is Android TV and we all knew this one
was coming
Android TV will come with support for TV
tuners cable TV and a host of
applications and games there are TVs and
set-top boxes from the likes of LG Sony
Razer and others due out by the end of
this year the demo shows how you can use
the interface and it turns out that the
leaks were correct on this one so it's
actually not all that new but it's still
awesome to see there was a short
presentation on the chromecast the
chromecast has apparently outsold every
other streaming device by a wide margin
and most retail outlets worldwide there
were a couple of new features announced
such as the ability to let people stream
to your chromecast without being
connected to your Wi-Fi don't worry
there are security features in place to
give you control of who uses it
lastly the chromecast will soon have the
ability to mirror any Android device to
your television as you can see from the
demo the latency is like nothing and it
looks really good next up is Chrome OS
some of the awesome features discussed
here is the ability to link your phone
and your Chrome OS laptop to have a more
integrated experience you can now run
Android apps from your phone to your
Chrome OS laptop as well as answer phone
calls and text messages also it's worth
noting that Google slides is finally out
Google Drive now has unlimited storage
for $10 a month and they are working on
data separation and security so you can
use your devices as both home and work
devices they did talk very briefly about
Google cloud and how they have worked
hard to create a better scaling product
for analytics especially in streaming
analytics they have also worked on
developer console upgrades cloud saving
cloud monitoring cloud tracing and a
whole lot more last up is the
application section Google will be
releasing google fit in the near future
as a way to help people get healthier
google fit will be available on
practically every device running Android
L which will include wearables phones
and tablets along with that Google is
now working to make testing applications
easier and they have announced that they
have joined with a purified to do just
that Google Play games is the fastest
growing game network on the face of this
planet currently and soon
see new gamer profiles saved games
inside of the Google Play games
application and new api's will be
launched to help game developers
integrate better with Google Android
Google Play games and Android TV well
that's the keynote in a nutshell head on

these things and stay tuned to the
