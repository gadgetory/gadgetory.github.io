and has a large selection of phones so
if that's your carrier you may need some
help making a choice at the top of list
has got to be Samsung's flagship the
Galaxy s8 NSA Plus this time around they
included a unique 18:59 aspect ratio
that allows for a much more comfortable
in hand feel the company even ditched
its famous physical a home button and
included an on-screen navigation
under the hood these devices come with
Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor or the
Exynos 88-90 5 depending on the region
of which you live 4 gigabytes of RAM 64
gigabytes of on-board storage and one of
the latest versions of Android 7.0
nougat Samsung also launched a few extra
accessories alongside the s8 that you
should definitely consider checking out
the new Samsung Dex dock that lets you
use your s8 as a desktop computer and
there's also the new gear 360 camera
that allows for shooting video in 4k and
live-streaming to YouTube of course
there's also the new Galaxy S a
compatible gear VR headset complete with
a controller for easier navigation now
when it comes to the LG G 6 the most
standout feature is the 5.7 inch quad HD
display with its interesting aspect
ratio of 89 and rounded corners it also
comes with a Snapdragon 820 1 processor
4 gigabytes of RAM plenty of on-board
storage and an ip68 rating for dust and
water resistance and dual 13 megapixel
rear cameras it's also worth noting that
not all LG sixes are created equal for
example the g6 that's coming to the u.s.
is the only variant that supports
wireless charging while the high 5 DAC
is exclusive to South Korea and certain
markets in Asia
what's more the g6 with 64 gigabytes of
storage is only available in a handful
of market now although the LG v 30 has
recently been released you should know
that if you're on Verizon the LGB 20 is
still a good option the LG v 20 has a
big quad HD display Qualcomm Snapdragon
820 processor plenty of RAM and onboard
storage dual 16 megapixel rear facing
cameras
removable 3200 milliamp hour battery and
of course the unique second screen makes
a return along with the addition of quad
DAC military standard durability and
it's also running Android 7.0 nougat now
although the next two devices have sort
of left the nexus heritage to the
wayside in this list I do have to add
the pixel and pixel XL under the hood
these devices sports some decent specs
both devices have AMOLED displays
Snapdragon 820 one processors four
gigabytes of RAM plenty of on-board
storage and long lasting batteries the
overall design however may not be your
choice and it may not be the most unique
but they do feel like premium phones
through and through now there may be a
couple things that will turn some of you
away for example they only have an IP 53
rating for dust and water resistance
meaning that they're not as waterproof
as some of the competition plus the
devices aren't known to be the most
durable ever so if you are prone to
being butterfingers you may want to get
a good quality case for your phone now
if you don't like any of those options
no problem contact Santa and tell him
you want an iPhone for Christmas and
while you're at it mail him your geek
