everybody
and we're taking a look at the tick
watch - and in this review we'll explain
why we think it's a compelling offering
with just a few shortcomings and price
is not one of them our unit is the oak
edition that comes with a brown leather
strap that is not necessarily ideal for
situations like fitness or anything that
involves water but the tick watch - is
IP certified for splash resistance and
comes with GPS and a heart rate monitor
the body of the watch is simple yet
elegant and the entire oak edition pairs
well with plenty of wardrobes formal or
casual a single button is used to turn
off or on the device and to go backwards
in the interface while there is a touch
sensitive area on the other side that is
used to tickle through the interface
this is the main unique function of the
tick watch - and mainly flicking up and
down is a fun way of navigating through
the different elements especially for
long form notifications it is really
nice to have a way to read everything
without covering it up with a finger
however it is not meant to replace a
full touch screen and instead complement
those existing methods of navigation the
1.4 inch OLED display allows for an
ambient display which is leveraged
pretty well via low power consumption
changes in the watch face underneath
that surface is a mediatek processor and
half a gig of ram with 4 gigabytes of
on-board storage that can be used for
listening to local music using a
connected Bluetooth headset speaking of
audio there is a speaker and microphone
combo included on the tick watch - this
means that when notifications come on
the watch the soft vibrational or it can
be accompanied by a chime this can of
course be turned off in vibration only
mode calls can actually be taken on the
watch as well with Bluetooth routing all
audio from the phone to the wearable
it's a nice feature to have in a pinch
but is far from the best way of
receiving a call when that very small
speaker provides far less clarity than
any alternative methods powering
everything is a full version of Android
that has been made into the tick where
OS in a nutshell the app ecosystem is
still in its infancy and lacks the app
support that you would easily find an
Android wear for example the lack of
applications may turn off anyone that's
coming from a more robust or developer
supported system where we were impressed
by tick wear was in its ability to
deliver the essentials swiping to the
left for example
the voice assistant that is actually
pretty effective for simple tasks and
searches while swiping up from the watch
face shows the Notification Center many
of the functions here are similar to
Android wear without the incessant
swiping and the unattractive cards and
finally the tick wear app on the
connected smartphone is capable of
customizing the experience including
which applications can or cannot send
notifications to the watch so the watch
manages to provide really good basics
with a couple of frills our biggest
problem with the tick watch too however
is battery life the watch is rated for a
full day of usage but even that can be a
bit tough to achieve with a lot of
notifications coming in and plenty of
the functions being used charging the
watch is also a little odd with a flat
charging dock included that moves easily
from underneath the device if the watch
were able to get closer to a day and a
half and possibly more that would have
been a real advantage for the tick watch
- and speaking of advantages the prices
for these watches start at 199 dollars
on Amazon making the tick watch to one
of the lowest barriers of entry in the
SmartWatch world this oak edition
retails for $249 which is still a good
price in comparison to Android wear and
the gear s3 and with many of the same
features of the aforementioned
smartwatches we think that this is a
good consideration for any users that
are either looking for their first
SmartWatch or are looking for an
alternative after the loss of pebble and
vector in the space battery life can't
really be helped but a growing ecosystem
can make this a SmartWatch you should
definitely keep your eye out for if your
wrist still isn't wearing smart yet in
2017 ed - and rathore decom for the full
review of the tick watch - written and
with a gallery showing off the watch
from there you can find even more about
smart wearables throughout Android
