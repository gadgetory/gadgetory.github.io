Hindy the android authority app guy
we're nearing the end of the month so
it's time to take a look at the best
android games that were released in
march of 2016 the highly anticipated
clash royale was released this last
month in fact it was so highly
anticipated that the game has already
garnered over 10 million downloads this
is a card collecting game that features
a ton of characters including some
cameos from supercells popular clash of
clans game it's a lot like hearthstone
in that you collect cards and then duel
them against other people over online
multiplayer you can also form clans
share cards and a whole lot more Disney
Magic Kingdom's is a collaborative
effort between gameloft and Disney your
goal is to build a new theme park after
the villains of Disney destroyed the old
one there are a metric ton of cameo
appearances from Disney characters to
give it that familiar feeling at its
heart the game is a builder simulation
game that's not altogether different
from other Disney builder Sims like ice
age village it is kid friendly and for
you to play Fahrenheit indigo prophecy
is a port of the cult classic pc game
from two thousand five of the same name
this game is an interactive narrative
game where you play through a story
making decisions that ultimately affect
the outcome of the game there are four
stories to play through complete with a
dark story line that is actually pretty
good the graphics are also pretty decent
and the game has received positive
reviews from players so far it's a
little expensive but there are no in-app
purchases futurama game of drones is the
latest TV based free-to-play game that
takes advantage of a fandom hungry for
more futurama that said it is a pretty
decent little time killer it's a match
for game similar to titles like candy
crush where you must match for objects
instead of three to remove them from the
screen and score points there are plenty
of puzzles to do obstacles to overcome
and a lot of the classic futurama wet
baked in for good measure pics defender
is a new tower defense game with a twist
literally on top of creating a defense
to keep out wave after wave of bad guys
you'll also be able to rotate your base
around so that only certain shields and
weapons can attack the idea is that
you'll have six colored turrets that are
effective against bad guys of the same
colors so you
twist around so the good weapons can
beat the appropriately colored bad guys
it's a fun little game and it also has
no in-app purchases Nintendo's me tomo
has finally been released for everybody
this game has been talked about ad
nauseam for months now and now you can
finally just try it out for yourself
it's a bit weird and I don't know if
it's actually a video game but you'll
get to create a little my character and
then fill it with knowledge about
yourself your friends can then interact
with your my character and learn more
about you despite its social media style
it does have pretty decent reviews and
people seem to enjoy it so far Rayman
classic was released to Android in March
for a bit of nostalgic gaming for those
who don't know Raymond was a 2d
platformer with a ton of obstacles and
it was a ton of fun now you can relive
the classic game and all of its glory it
has been updated to work with mobile
devices including a set of on-screen
controls but the developers have left
the graphics retro for a bit more of an
authentic experience it's four dollars
and ninety-nine cents but there are no
in-app purchases gnome drift is a sort
of racing game the idea is to drift
around corners and try to get the
highest score based on how well you can
drip the vehicle it has over 60 total
cars that you can unlock one finger
controls and leaderboards so you could
challenge your friends to the highest
score the graphics look pretty good and
sometimes it's more fun to crash the car
and make it go boom than it is to
actually race nevertheless it's free to
play and it's worth checking out the
total war battles Kingdom is the latest
game out of Sega and this one is really
interesting it rests somewhere between
clash of clans and age of empires it's a
strategy game with a builder sim element
where you build a city create an army
and then take on various foes there is
live PvP against online opponents which
is really engaging there is a lot of
control here to shape your area how you
want it and it's also a lot of fun to
play as hell tail games latest game came
out in early March and it tells the
story of the Michonne character the game
follows the comic series and deals with
where Michonne was and what she was
doing during her absence in the comic
between issues 126 and 139 it has a lot
of the classic telltale games elements
including excellent storytelling
mechanics and also graphics as per the
norm it's a point-and-click adventure
game and you can control how the story
eventually goes
it's four dollars and ninety-nine cents
with each additional episode requiring a
separate purchase and that about does it
