handy the Android authority app guy so
it's almost football season on September
5th the 94th season of the NFL will kick
off and today we're going to talk about
the best NFL and NCAA apps to help you
have a good season I would but I I am a
Browns fan of course the first on our
list today is the official app of the
NFL called NFL mobile this app contains
pretty much everything an NFL fan needs
for a full season this includes news
nfl.com fantasy schedules standings and
even a shop for merchandise and tickets
it's a solid app and a good all-in-one
solution for your NFL needs the news is
only from nfl.com so you don't get the
opinions from bloggers around the league
also some of the functionality like
watching live games is limited only to
Verizon Wireless customers so you can
only get the true value of this app if
you subscribe to big red next up is the
official app for the score the score is
known as a reliable source of sports
news and even though their official app
covers all sports there's still a great
option for football fans you can look at
scores and standings league leaders in
various categories and schedules this is
actually a very well-done app it's very
clean and easy to use so if you don't
want something complicated this is a
great option also a big plus is that
this covers other sports as well so if
you're not just a football fan you can
find news from other sports
score center is number 7 on our list and
if you're a fan of ESPN this is the app
you're looking for it's a well done app
that delivers scores and news from all
sports including NFL and NCAA football
you can find scores schedules standings
and all the news you need to keep up to
date the only downside is you have to
create an account to get all the fun
customization features you can assign a
favorite sport a favorite team and even
add notifications for those things if
you want them it's a great app on its
own but it's much better if you feel
like taking the time to sign up number 6
on our list is called NFL matchups and
it's the first game on our list if you
need to kill a few minutes between
quarters or commercials then this can be
a fun little app for you it's
essentially a simulation game with a few
minigames to make your team better the
game requires a facebook login which we
know isn't that great of a feature to
have anymore
also it's a little cheesy in terms of
content and graphics so it's not the
best game ever made that said if you
just need something to kill a few
minutes it's really not that bad for
most football is football but we know
there are some people who enjoy college
football more number 5 on our list is
for those people and it's called college
football scoreboard as you can imagine
it's an app that revolves around college
football the app contains pretty much
everything you need for an NCAA season
this includes news from a number of
sources standings and scores for more
than a dozen conferences in multiple
divisions the schedules haven't been
updated for 2013 just yet but the news
has been so we assume an update is
coming soon Yahoo is known for having
one of the best fantasy sports platforms
available and clocking in at number four
is their fantasy football app as you can
imagine it allows you to have complete
control over your teams in multiple
leagues so you don't need a computer to
play fantasy football using this app you
can create or join a league join a mock
draft or the actual draft for your
league and pretty much everything else
you need to do in a fantasy league there
is also access to a fantasy oriented
football blog so if you plan on doing
fantasy football on Yahoo this season
this app is a must-have do note it only
supports Yahoo fantasy sports not ESPN
or NFL com
the first app in our top three is
another game called NFL kicker 13 in
this simple game you'll create a simple
character and kick field goals the
premise of NFL kicker 13 is very simple
and it doesn't take long to master so if
you need something more in-depth you
won't find it here as stated the game
doesn't take long to figure out this is
a great little game you can use to get
through some commercials or any other
time you want to kill a few minutes with
some football the controls are easy the
graphics aren't terrible and best of all
it's free and you can't ask for much
more than that number two on our list is
far and wide the best football game
available for mobile devices currently
your only option is NFL Pro 13 by
Gameloft but as we reported last week
NFL Pro 14 is well on its way the good
news is both games are free so you're
not losing out on anything to play 1
while you wait for the other the
graphics and gameplay were surprisingly
good for a mobile device and that's
probably why people like this game so
much the controls take some getting used
to but that's pretty much how it works
for all video games if you need a
football game to keep you busy during
the week this is a great one to have
here it is our number one rated app for
football and it's NFL trash talk as you
can imagine trash-talking is practically
a pastime when it comes to sports and
now there's an app where you can let out
the rage during a game for people who
get vocal during games this app can be a
great way to let off some steam
this app is actually really fun upon
opening you're asked to select your
favorite team then you're connected to
to chat rooms one is a private chat just
for fans of your favorite team the other
is a chat room you share with fans of
the team your team faces that week it's
a great way to communicate with fellow
football fans and trash talk the other
guys if you check out the leaderboard
you can see how all these apps stack up
against one another as per the norm this
is how you rated them not us you'll find
no bias here if you want to try these
apps out the links are in the video
description we wanted to make sure this
list had all the essentials for an NFL
or NCAA fan you can find news standings
scores chat rooms with other fans and
even games so it was hard to put a value
on them since most of them do different
things for best results we recommend
down low
a few of these to get the full
experience if there's a great app that
we missed please let us know in the
comments once again i'm jo hindi the
android authority app guy feel free to
subscribe to our youtube channel and if
you like android apps

about the best Android app news the
social media links are in the video
description as well as a link to a

wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
