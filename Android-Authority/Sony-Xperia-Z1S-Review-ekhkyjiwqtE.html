smartphone might mean that there's a bit
of a tether maybe a ball and chain if
you will but for Sony it does mean new
horizons for their flagship device and
because of t-mobile the Sony Xperia z1
has made it to the US with a few changes
do they really change the experience all
that much though while we're here to
find out because it's charge of a guard
from Android I thought a what's going on
everybody
and this is the Sony Xperia z1s now for
pretty much all intents and purposes
this is very much the same phone as the
original Sony Xperia z1 with a couple
different changes underneath which we'll
get to in a moment
after all this is the same glass finish
all around the phone making for a very
premium feeling device in the hand and
the skeleton that puts it all together
and keeps it all together is instead of
metal now made of plastic this does make
for a lighter phone and if you look in
this particular shot there is actually a
little bit more length on this version
of the phone compared to the original
after that though you have the same
overall layout with the silver power
button and the ports and micro sd and
SIM card slots covered with small bits
of plastic after that the only real
changes are in the headphone jack which
has been moved more to the middle and of
course the t-mobile logo proudly stamped
on this phone's lower back overall this
is the same experience when you have it
in your hand it is a bit of a large
device for what is supposed to be
sporting just a 5-inch screen and that
is mostly due to the bezels around the
screen there's a little bit more real
estate at the top and at the bottom
particularly which makes for a phone
that's a little bit larger than most
other 5-inch devices out there the
display is the very same one that you
remember from the Xperia z1 this is a
5-inch display at 1080p resolution the
triluminos display that is backed by the
x-reality engine and in the end you do
still get the same great quality that
was there in the original z1 so if you
remember what that one was like is
pretty much the same here with great
display quality especially when you're
looking at it head-on
because as has become a trait of many
experiences recently the viewing angles
really aren't that great but as long as
you're looking at it head-on
this is akin to a small Sony TV in the
performance aspect the z1 s doesn't
disappoint because it continues the
tradition
that the z1 originally started with
having the fastest processing package
available today and that is the
snapdragon 800 with the audrina 330 and
two gigabytes of ram as a result power
is never in shortage and the already
minimalistic expiry you eye moves along
just fine without really much incident
at all in the hardware department so the
first thing we will talk about is the
fact that even though the plastic
skeleton in here is different from the
metal one that we saw in the Xperia z1
the reason why that happened is because
t-mobile was worried about reception
issues due to the metal with the plastic
you should get a you should get better
reception quality at least in the eyes
of t-mobile but also the certifications
that made the original z1
water-resistant and dustproof return
here as well so you this phone right
here can take a tumble or even take a
plunge and it will come back ready for
more after that we do have expandable
storage in that microsd card slot that
bolsters that 32 gigabytes built in at
least in this particular device and the
usual bevy of connection abilities is
included along with 4G LTE support so
you can take advantage of t-mobile's
high-speed network and then of course
there is the 3000 milliamp hour battery
that provides quite a bit of longevity
for this device there is a lot of power
underneath and that screen is quite good
so 3000 milliamp hours will get you
maybe about a day or a day and a half in
terms of moderate to heavy usage but the
Xperia UI does come with a lot of power
saving features so as long as you take
advantage of those you should be able to
eke out just enough from this phone that
you need maybe a little bit more and
then we move on to the camera which is a
twenty point seven megapixel camera that
brings very powerful optics in this G
lens and F 2.0 aperture brings initial
low-light capabilities and then there is
software stabilization found within the
app now speaking of the app it does
unfortunately come with the same
problems as the original Z 120 point
seven megapixels is a great number and
it does yield you very very large photos
unfortunately when you want to come down
from that number it goes straight to
eight megapixels even worse 20.7
megapixels is used in the four by three
aspect ratio and I'm a sixteen by nine
guy so if I want to use 16 by 9 aspect
ratio which is what I almost always use
I have to jump all the way down to a
pixels is just really a bummer and the
trump card in this camera is its app
enhancements as it does come with a lot
of smaller apps that can further enhance
your victory photography things like
adding dinosaurs to your scene modifying
your shot creatively and sharing your
view live to social media networks are
all possible with even more capabilities
in the pipeline with more applications
being developed for the camera on the
Xperia line unfortunately with all of
that goodness you do have to look at the
quality of the photos and unfortunately
it does suffer from lackluster
processing it's just an inconsistent
performance two really good quality
shots
the main problem comes in the darker
details or rather lack thereof because
the doctor area show up really fuzzy and
lack detail it's always in the darker
tones inside of a photo that things
start to get really smudgy and you can
get some low-light shots out of this
camera but they're not going to come out
very detailed like I just said and
finally make it over to the software now
what is actually called the time scape
UI is what I usually call the Xperia UI
and in that regard the Xperia UI is
actually a pretty classical type of
navigation when it comes to getting
around Android however there are some
enhancements that Sony put in that
really do sweeten the pot what we have
here is inside of the recent apps button
these small abs now these are very
familiar to any experience out there
these are small applications that show
up on top of your current workspace to
allow you to get some quick multitasking
done after that certain applications
that really give you that sony esque
experience or added in as well like
obviously the Walkman for listening to
your music and the album for looking at
your photos and videos PlayStation
mobile is available in here but from my
experience while some of the games on
there are quite fun they don't they
basically just pale in comparison to the
full offerings that you're probably
already enjoying in the Play Store all
in all what really makes us like the
Xperia UI is that it's pretty simplistic
while being very elegant it is
quintessentially Sony in its style and
its color scheme but for anybody that
has used an Android device before
especially ones that are more stock like
you should have no problem getting into
this phone and getting around quite
easily without
anytime at all and finally we make it
over to the price yes this is a t-mobile
exclusive phone and as such it does come
under no contract plans so you're going
to pay $0 down upfront but 22 dollars a
month for two years is on top of
whatever plan you're going to get and as
is the case with t-mobile's plans you do
have to pay off the entirety of the
phone in the time that you're using it
and that total in two years we'll come
at about five hundred and thirty dollars
and so there you have it the Sony Xperia
z1s the version that is now available in
the United States
courtesy of t-mobile this is very much
like the original Xperia z1 which we did
like even though we were a bit
underwhelmed mostly by the camera
despite the hype that it had it just
didn't perform the way that we were
hoping it would but the rest of the
experience is actually quite good and
for a phone as sturdy as this with the
glass all-around premium feel nice user
experience this is still quite a steal
when it comes to the Android space and
because of t-mobile pricing schemes you
can get this phone for zero down and get
an entry point into the Android space
into one of the best ones that might be
out there today so as always thank you
