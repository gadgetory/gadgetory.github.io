everybody and wanted to bring you guys a
look at the LGV 30 and it's video
recording capabilities now we did just
do a vs long did of the V 30 versus the
Galaxy Note 8 in terms of their camera
performance and the camera capabilities
so you can make sure to check that out
too the links will be in the description
below but I just wanted to give you sort
of my experience using the LG v 30 as a
main camera while I was in Berlin for
Aoife and also in China about a week or
so ago now standard caveat I do need to
tell you guys real quick that the LG v
30 that we're using right now is a
pre-production unit some things might
change when we get our final production
unit so hopefully within the next couple
of weeks but as I said I just wanted to
give you my experience and my thoughts
as to why the LGV 30 is one of the most
fun cameras that I've used in recent
memory so a quick rundown of what kind
of footage you might be seeing in this
video I did use it for a couple of trips
and I did use it mainly as a vlogging
camera so if you're looking at the LGV
30 as a potential main vlogging rig well
I do have a few tips that could probably
get you started and to give you the best
experience that you can get out of the
v30 all right so this is the vlogging
rig that you might see a lot of
youtubers use however I'm not using a
regular camera on the top here I got the
Joby Pro clamp in order to securely
fasten the LGV 30 to the top of this
gorilla pod one of the reasons why I
really love using this is because with
the wide-angle camera you won't be able
to capture log footage instead you'll be
using the regular angle camera so I want
to get some distance between me and the
camera so that I can still get my
framing just right and as long as you're
keeping the camera basically in the
right general area you will be in the
frame properly and with that distance
you'll be able to put yourself in the
middle without cutting off the top or
bottom of your subject also top tip if
you are going to be vlogging or using
the LGV 34 a lot of footage using the
rear cameras because let's be honest the
front-facing camera is just not all that
up to par when it comes to quality and
of course you can't do log footage with
a front-facing camera go to manual video
mode and the volume buttons become the
button force for triggering and also
stopping the recording kind of like this
but of course if you do want to use the
wide-angle camera it's still going to
get some pretty good color accurate
videos and with that wide angle you
don't have to worry about not having
your subject in the scene you can even
just hold the phone hit record and then
turn it right around and you'll pretty
much get everything in the scene even if
your hand is a part of it so let's talk
about one of the features that will dive
into more in our full review this is the
cine video mode where you get a flat
profile to begin with because that is
the log format profile and then you have
a bunch of different color filters that
you can put onto the video so that you
can record it using that color profile
already this is a little bit different
from the usual filters you might see in
plenty of other cameras or other
applications and they are very stylized
so you can get a very particular look
for your footage and it's pretty nice to
have it but it's really that wide-angle
first off that does a great job of just
sort of making the footage that much
more fun to watch you are able to turn
the phone around and then just get a
full-on perspective much like you would
with a GoPro because the wide-angle view
is a lot like an action camera but it's
just on a phone and if you want another
top tip you can record in 4k video and
just have a big micro SD card inside of
the phone so you don't run out of space
and the reason why I say that is because
you can record in 4k and if you render
out in 1080p you will be able to crop
into the 4k frame pretty easily if you
didn't necessarily get the framing that
you want now a couple thoughts on point
soom there are a couple of shots here
that I used four-point zoom but I found
the effect to be a little bit cheesy
it's kind of like those old kung fu
movies where it seemed into the actors
eyes like a little bit too tight in also
but I get that it is a useful tool
especially if you have the phone
stationary on something like a gorilla
pod like I'm using right now that way
you're able to zoom in to a particular
part of the frame without having to move
the phone itself as you're zooming this
camera is super fun to use and if you're
going to be using this phone for social
media for example then just have the
phone uprights for different areas like
snapchat or IG stories and it's going to
import right in perfectly and you can
use the wide-angle camera on the main
camera before importing that footage
into whatever social media platform you
choose you might actually recognize some
of these clips as they were on our
Android authority IG story but it was
during my trip to China that I decided
to use log footage as much as possible
you might be hearing this
a lot over the next number of weeks and
log footage is essentially a color
profile or rather a type of video that
is shot at a very flat profile you don't
get a whole lot of saturation in it and
also all of the different settings for
sharpness contrast anything to that
effect has been dialed down in order for
you to put that in during
post-production I use Premiere Pro for
editing video so you would be using
something like the loo metric colors in
order to do general correction and then
add some stylized colors or different
levels of contrast maybe mess with the
highlights and the shadows in order to
get a very stylized look but for the
most part I just tried to recreate the
accurate portrayal of the scene when I
do color correction I will say one thing
log footage has a steep learning curve
when it comes to getting it just right
and what I will also say is that it's
very important to get your settings just
right if using the manual video mode
when recording the log footage and the
LGV 30 the LGP 30 is good at
compensating for changing conditions but
when you're trying to grade log footage
you don't really want the exposure
jumping in and out throughout the video
and you obviously don't want to have the
white balance changing because that will
change your color altogether but overall
I couldn't really get over just how
detail the videos were there was a very
low level of noise and I really enjoyed
what kind of videos I was able to get
out of it it's just amazing the kind of
package you get in the cameras for the
LGV 30 you're able to do log footage and
then stylize the footage of yourself in
post-processing with color correction or
you can use one of the built-in color
profiles to get that stylized look as
you are recording and then of course you
have the wide-angle camera which is just
simply always fun and if you've never
used a wide-angle camera before this
might be the time to try it out on the
LGP 30 it is just an incredible amount
of fun so that's gonna go ahead and do
it for this video I just wanted to bring
you an example of the LGV 30 as we move
into what could be our main review
period when we get our final production
units I had hundreds of clips from my
trips to Berlin and China over the last
few weeks so I just wanted to share some
of that with you guys and give you an
example of what the V 30 can do we're
looking forward to getting our final
review units and we're going to bring
you that review and final thoughts on
the camera when that happened so
remember to stay tuned to android
authority for that and even more drop us

the channel if you haven't already and
from there stay tuned for more about the
LG v 30 and more
