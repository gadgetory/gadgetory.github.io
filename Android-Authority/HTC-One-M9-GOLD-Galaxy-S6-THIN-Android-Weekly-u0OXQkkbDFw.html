brought to you by Norton security so you
guys have seen pretty peeked over the
rumor roundups that we've done over the
past couple weeks so you'll be
interested to know that we've received
some more leaks that give credence to
those rumors and I'm going to do my best
to sort those out but you got to
remember that some of those rumors might
be a kick in the pants so let's start
off with the HTC One m9 otherwise known
as hema and this rumor is looking golden
now we're pretty sure that the HTC One
m9 is coming on march first to Barcelona
at the Mobile World Congress but
thankfully there are still a few details
trickling in this image is showing the
back of the m9 zylle edged gold version
that's surfaced on China's Weibo there
isn't much new to say about this shot we
do see the same square camera module
with rounded corners the well-known
1-series styling and no trace of the
depth sensor in sight there's a chance
we're looking at a prototype component
or something else but judging from the
many leaks showing the same general
appearance our money is on this design
being real now the same source also
shared what appears to be a version of
the dot view smart case adapted for the
one and nine though save the different
camera cut out it looks very similar to
last year's model now does this teaser
hint at a curved variant of the galaxy
s6 a new teaser from samsung's march
first unpacked event is starting to make
its way to the media showing off an
image with a curved line that is most
certainly a hint at what to expect from
Samsung when it comes to the company's
latest galaxy s flagship there's no
denying that 2014 wasn't the best year
for samsung at least when it comes to
mobile devices in hopes of returning to
greater profitability Samsung has been
talking big recently about how the
galaxy s6 will be a major departure from
the galaxy s5 in terms of design one of
the more persistent rumours is that
Samsung will deploy a dual edged curve
design on at least one variant of the
galaxy s6 said to be named the galaxy s
edge the new unpack teaser here could
very well via confirmation of this in
fact an image from the German site all
about Samsung further drives home the
point that this is likely look at the
side of a galaxy s6 edge variant as you
can see the image in the teaser looks
very similar to the side of the galaxy
note edge now the next rumor that's
gaining momentum is that the s6 will be
very thin indeed as you can see here the
device pictured is only 6.91 millimeters
thick which would make it very trim
indeed other notables include the volume
buttons which are now separated and the
rounded edges there also appears to be
what looks like a sim tray along the
right side of the device which would
substantiate the rumors that the galaxy
s6 will not feature a removable battery
finally the placement of the flash
biometric sensor to the right of the
rear camera matches up with the recent
spate of leaks we've seen of case
renders now speaking of cases check this
out well the two devices on the left are
believed to be the galaxy s6 the three
on the right are apparently the galaxy
ass edge to be sure the picture
certainly looks real and given that it's
showcasing cases made by a Korean case
manufacturer vs. it would seemingly be
all the more legitimate at first sight
the image may be a little bit confusing
because the right slope is invisible for
the rightmost device however the right
slope is clearly present on the second
device from the right it's very likely
that this apparent inconsistency is due
to the angle at which the device is
shown in the render after all multiple
leagues point to Samsung launching a
device with two slanted edges so if you
guys haven't already noticed I still
feel a bit burned over the rumors
surrounding the galaxy s5 launched a
year ago so tell me in the comments
below do you give these rumors credence
what do you guys think let me know
