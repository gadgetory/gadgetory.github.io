SmartWatch game with a round-faced
SmartWatch called simply the Huawei
watch it's Josh of agar ferment or
Authority what's going on everybody and
as you can see here like I said this is
the Huawei watch that I'm donning on my
wrist now this is going to be one of the
first Android wear watches to have
sapphire crystal which is really nice
but what you're looking at here is a one
point four inch round AMOLED display
that comes in at 400 by 400 resolution
making it a little bit sharper then the
other Android wear watches I have this
particular shape but nonetheless
underneath the surface we have Android
wear of course that will have some of
huawei's own additions to it namely a
custom is customizable watch face of
over 40 different types and from there
Android wear will be mostly what you
expect it to be but of course this demo
unit is going to show you that already
unfortunately we couldn't turn off the
demo on our particular unit as they have
just announced the watch and the demo
units usually are the ones that we end
up playing with but nonetheless the case
measures about 42 millimeters and it
comes in a few different colorations in
this case I'm using the gold one with a
leather strap that has a nice textured
look to it and is genuine leather but
the gold seems to have a different type
of hue to it it almost looked like rose
gold it seems to be somewhere in the
middle so I thought that was pretty
interesting but the black and silver
editions that were at the casings looked
really nice and can come with either
leather or metal bracelets I also 18
millimeters is the size on those bands
and bracelets and what you'll be able to
do is just replace them if you do want
to change the look pretty drastically
but it's not too big as to alienate
certain people who might not have very
large wrists but for a lot of people out
there this is going to be just right
because of its classical look that makes
this more of a watch that just happens
to have some smart capabilities
underneath on the unit itself the
hardware includes a heart rate monitor
on the back of it that will allow you to
have a little bit of fitness tracking in
there as Android wear watches all tend
to have but the button the single button
on the unit is a little bit off-center
and it doesn't feel pretty nice on there
but it's a very small detail that
actually does give this watch a little
bit of unique look ultimately this is an
Android wear watch but it's very nice to
see that Huawei is putting one out there
and they've sort of paid it for
word a little bit by creating a design
that's not trying too hard to show off
that it is a SmartWatch rather is trying
to really blend in with a lot of the
watches out there other than the fact
that underneath the surface you get a
lot of other functionality now we are
going to get our own unit and I am
looking forward to reviewing it and
telling you what it is like compared to
other Android wear smartwatches but
until then we have just this demo unit
so sorry about not being able to show
you the software a whole lot but
nonetheless this is the Huawei watch
here at MWC
2015 thank you guys very much for
watching this is Joshua car from Android
authority bringing you this new watch
from Huawei but make sure you stay tuned
for all of our other coverage because we
are your source for all things MWC</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
