stack up against the old one it's Josh
of Garf a man's Road Authority what's
going on everybody and here we have a
quick look at the Samsung Galaxy Note 3
up against its predecessor the note 2
while much of the note 3 has been
updated arguably the best changes come
in the design the s-pen has been
somewhat shrunken down but retains its
general aesthetic the note 3 might take
on a narrower thinner and lighter
profile than the note 2 making it even
easier to handle in the hand but it is
in the material choice that many people
might find something to really like this
is because the glossy feel has been done
away with for a textured plastic that is
easier to the touch doesn't slip about
and keeps finger printing at bay all of
which were issues with the note 2
essentially we see the next step in the
note evolution and this may be a welcome
one that hopefully makes it to other
Samsung devices yes the note 3 is
lighter and even if somewhat subtle
provides an overall better handling
experience it is balanced and though 2
handed operation is used here throwing
the note 3 around in one hand is
definitely easier this time the note 3
screen improves in its bezels making its
screen Point 2 inches larger than the
one found in the note 2 and since the
note 2 Samsung has gone even better at
its display game with the galaxy s4 and
now the note 3 those bezels are nice and
thin adding to the screens overall Real
Estate's
whereas the note 2 originally had a 1280
by 720 resolution screen capable of 267
PPI
we now have a 1080p screen on the note 3
capable of 388 it is truly an upgrade
that echos the success of the galaxy s4
screen in a larger form factor under the
hood the note 3 will come with either
the Snapdragon 800 at 2.2 6 gigahertz or
the Exynos octa-core that typically
doesn't get much play in the West given
the age of the note 2 it 16 O's 4412 is
definitely a far cry from the sheer
power that the note 3 is capable of
while its predecessor might have been
able to hold its ground the note 3
absolutely flies and can handle even
more multitasking as the first device
out with 3 gigabytes of RAM the battery
might not have gotten a significant
increase this time around but
optimizations and power consumption
could still give the note 3 the edge in
longevity while we don't have any camera
shots to show here we can definitely
expect the
13 megapixel camera in the note 3 to
outperform the a megapixel optics found
in the note 2 enhancements and added
features introduced in the galaxy s4
make their way to the note 3 as well
giving it a big boost over the more
simplistic app of the note 2 and finally
we look at software as the s-pen enabled
TouchWiz has been updated to Android 4.3
this brings along with it the new
navigation options originally found in
the galaxy s4 while adding new functions
to the s-pen Air Command helps you to
streamline the s-pen experience and new
ways of using the pen like action memo
enhanced scrapbooking and even a full
device search program really bring this
new version of the smartphone into the
limelight while the note 2 remains a
very popular device it's clear that the
note 3 continues the evolution of the
note line and so there you have it it's
not hard to see that the note 3 is a
real step forward for the note line and
while the note 2 remains perfectly
viable as a pen enabled tablet phone
Samsung has added in quite a lot to make
the upgrade very much worth it we have
much more for you on the Galaxy Note 3
coming up so stay tuned to android
authority because we're your source for
all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
