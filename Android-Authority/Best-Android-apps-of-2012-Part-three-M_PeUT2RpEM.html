this is clean at android authority calm
with the third installment of our best
apps for 2012 so without further ado
let's check out the weather channel
application
I'm just going to type in my area code
here so we can check out what it has to
offer for auto Falls Idaho now on first
inspection you can see that it gives us
our forecast and it has also our weather
and it has a hourly as well as a 36-hour
and a 10-day forecast now also down here
on the bottom it has maps so you can
actually view this on a Google map like
interface and check out surrounding
cities and weather advisories from your
area it has pinch to zoom functionality
and you can actually tap on one of the
tabs to open up the notifications for
that area and it just brings us back to
our temperature right now anyways
fooling around a little more with the
map you can just see it has the
surrounding areas and you can check out
the severe weather advisories which
there aren't any at this time also we
can tweet about our weather and see what
people have been tweeting about the
weather in the area a lot of these
tweets are going to come from news
stations and local radio stations I see
one right now that is so that's pretty
cool we can check out the videos as well
for weather around our area and weather
in general now these are going to be to
customized for your area unless you live
in a bigger city so I wouldn't bother
with these unless you kind of want to
know what's going on we have the
eyewitness weather and we also have
pollen alerts for those who have allergy
problems now under our settings we have
our header and background units of
measure severe weather alerts all that
stuff tips and tricks bug reports and
basically that is our Weather Channel
application
moving on we're going to check out the
flick goal application now this is
really fun as you can see I was playing
it earlier but I likes it to the main
menu and this is our main menu we've got
play flick kick options and the upgrade
options we got three modes of play
including practice precision and sudden
death mode I'll just do the practice
sports quotes now the object of the game
is to just put your finger under the
ball and flick it to try and make the
goal it's kind of like paper toss the
harder you push and the farther your
finger goes the harder and farther the
ball flies sometimes you have to account
for wind and then of course different
kicking angles so in this one we have
wind that's one mile an hour to the left
so I compensated for that and just
flicked it now we'll just go back to our
main menu and I'll try the precision
mode now now in the precision mode you
actually get your accuracy tallied so
that was a 50-percent shot this one we
ever wind 30 miles an hour to the right
that was a perfect shop and that one's
an also another perfect shot now when
you get perfect shots it raises your
accuracy and likewise for bad shots and
it just takes the average of all those
you know their sports quote and we'll go
to the sudden death match now the sudden
death it just gives you a score for all
the balls you have kicked and if you
make a perfect goal you can next your
life and it just gives you a score based
upon where the ball flies to the field
goal and there's another extra life so
that was basically our app there and we
can just exit the flick goal game all
right this next appt ESPN scorecenter is
for all the sports buffs out there now
first off we'll be greeted with a few
tab options here such as my teams just
gives us instructions for adding any
teams you want to follow to this tab
next we got the lead tab in an
advertisement and then NFL stats and
more from ESPN now I'll just go back to
the my teams tab and I'll just add a
random team for a football
and I'll just choose any one of these
because I don't really follow anyone
kadoka now we have saved that to our my
team's tab and news about them as well
as their scores will pop up in this tab
doesn't look like they have any current
news so let's go to the lead where you
can check out news some articles ESPN is
published scroll through these then
there's also video next tab is the
advertisement anyways we can check out
NFL news which has some of the same
articles check out the standings team
standings and then videos for teams this
is our menu but it just shows us the
same things there and we have
preferences as well then we can drag to
reorder three parallel lines three other
sports and favorite teams so since I
only have one here under the my teams
it's not really going to make a
difference but you can just order in you
can sort of a news aggregator style to
which teams you want to follow so that
was that app moving right along to the
Wikipedia app a lot of people have been
anticipating this for a while and it
just came out pretty recently so right
when you get to the Wikipedia web page
your agreed with today's featured
article but I'll just search for android
and we've got our Android here just
gives us the rundown on the Android
operating system in the history of it
basically any Wikipedia article switch
to the Galaxy Nexus the links are fast
you have your drop-down menus available
so you can check out the software like
that and you have a read in nearby share
save page I chose to save the page for
the Galaxy Nexus and you can go to the
settings here whether you want to in
english or your font size so that was
the wikipedia app next we've got our
home switcher application which is going
to help anyone out who's using more than
one home launcher as you can see here
I've got apex spb shell and TouchWiz so
I'll just load up my TouchWiz launcher
to show you how this works so you can
see we're running a different home
launcher right now I've got our
different transitions and are a
completely different user interface now
if I want to switch back I just go to
the applications and go to the Home
Manager once again
and now from home switcher we can choose
the apex launcher which i will set as
default and launch once again so it's
back to what i was using without any of
the settings or preferences changed so
next on the list we have the battery
indicator application and this is going
to be a cool status bar widget of sorts
that will tell you stats about your
battery now right here we have a task
killer warning saying not to kill it in
a task killer we can check out our
battery use which just brings us to the
battery use settings page and we have
our tools I want to convert it to
Fahrenheit because I don't want to read
it in Celsius it'll tell us the
temperature of our battery so anyways we
have this cool status bar on
notification now that tells us that
we're charging since the time that we
started alright our next appt is iris
now this is somewhat of a Serie clone
from the Apple iOS but it's really
functional and it's only in its alpha
version and I like the results that I've
gotten so we'll just test her out here
hello iris I haven't can you play the
song bleed Thank You iris actually no
I've gotta go see ya so that was the
iris application quite funny and pretty
cool alright our next appt is lookout
mobile security now this is a very good
free look out application has a security
backup and missing device support now
the security stop malware and spyware
just the basic rundown I'm not going to
enable it because I have one can backup
all your data and choose when to do it
I'm not going to enable it and then you
can have it support for a missing device
can locate it on a map and send a loud
siren to your vice even if the sound is
turned off now here is where we get
under our information and set up a
account with lookout mobile security but
I'm not going to do that I have a
different one this is a very good
alternative and is free so anyways we
can go down to the notification options
and about and it'll just tell you a
rundown of what you can do if you have
the paid version the premium there if
privacy advisor &amp;amp; Safe Browsing but I've
Matt this is very excellent it's a
really good application if you want some
free security for your Android device so
moving on we'll just check out the
beautiful widgets which is one of my
favorites i use it daily we have our
super clock settings weather widget
settings home settings our skin market
and then all of our skins know what this
is doing is you can actually choose the
skin you want to display your clock in
now these are all the different clock
options all the different skins that i
have downloaded
these are all the standard ones so uh it
also has featured skins so we'll just
let these standard ones load up we can
see if there's some popular ones here
there's some pool balls silver black HTC
themed ones and then all sorts of ones
and you can do the same thing for
whether skins now this is mine I have a
clear vanilla ice cream sandwich one
with some weather down there and in
order to add one you would just hold on
the screen if you're running apex
launcher or any other launcher and you
would choose beautiful widgets and I'm
going to choose the super clock for buy
one and this is what it'll look like now
what I can also do is resize this widget
and make it a little bigger it looks
pretty good I'll just remove that one
for now and show you another one here
and we have our beautiful weather for
buy one so these are our weather options
that we can just click save and apply
and there's our four by one weather
widget and we'll just remove that one
now another thing you can do is create
beautiful toggles and then just one by
one widgets but I'll pull up a toggle
here for Wi-Fi and there's our toggle
goes on and off and we can just remove
it from the screen whenever we want so
our next one is the spb shell 3d
launcher now this is a fifteen dollar
launcher so it's pretty pricey but if
you guys like the look of it i'd suggest
checking it out so as it's initializing
we'll just run down some of the features
it is not in true 3d as if it's going to
pop out of the screen but it has a 3d
user interface now these are the
transitions from the tiles has all sorts
of cool stuff like native Calendar apps
you've no taps and then a news
aggregator right here that you can
scroll up and down and you can also
choose your news so there's our imported
google calendar and has a nice user
interface as far as that here's our
weather application for the next four
days and we can choose where this is
where the fun begins here is our
carousel style a homescreen selector and
it's it that's the 3d feature here
we can just drag this all around and
it's a nice carousel style you can also
add panels so we would just grab one and
pull it up to wherever we want it and we
put that there we can grab our clock and
put that there and change the color as
well and choose which one to set is the
home screen so now going back we'll
check out the ones that we added
oops so here's our application drawer
and this has sort of a 3d styling as
well they come up from the bottom and
leave at the top and all the ones with
the little home means that they're on
your home screen and you would just add
a I con just by clicking and dragging it
nice crescent moon animation there and
it's just a really nice user interface
it's a bit steep in the pricing but I'm
pretty sure your friends will like it
you'll like it and it's a nice uh
launcher to have it's a lot better than
I say aww launcher or go launcher it's
not as customizable but it's pretty cool
and it's impressive so anyways guys that
was our 25 app roundup and if you liked
it check out more from android authority
