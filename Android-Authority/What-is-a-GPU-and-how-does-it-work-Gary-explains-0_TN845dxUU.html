or authority now one of the most
important components on a system on a
chip
besides the CPU is the GPU the graphics
processing unit now for some people the
GPU is shrouded in mystery how does it
work what does it do well let me explain
okay at the simplest lowest level a GPU
is a clever piece of hardware that's
very good at certain type of
mathematical operations in 3d graphics
everything is made up of triangles lots
and lots of small triangles that are
built together to make complicated
models now as you know a triangle has
three corners three points and each one
of those points is called a vertex and
it has a coordinate in the X and the y
and the Z dimension so one of the things
that happens in 3d graphics is those
vertexes need to be processed for
example they might need to be moved from
one place to another place that's called
a translation maybe it needs to be
scaled to be bigger or to be smaller and
of course it can be rotated now these
three basic operations are called a
transformation it turns out in 3d
graphics the best way to express this
XYZ coordinates is using a vector and if
you want to perform a transformation on
a vector you can multiply it by a
special matrix a special four by four
matrix now these matrices all have
different properties you can do scaling
and transfer translation and rotation
just using a particular predefined
matrix therefore a GPU needs to be
really good at matrix operations if it
needs to be good at vector operations
floating-point operations and matrix
multiplication now in the old days a GPU
had a fairly fixed pipeline a fairly
fixed process so you 3d graphics would
go in or your vertex is all your
triangles go at the beginning it would
go through certain processes and at the
other end you would get the display and
the how that pipeline worked you could
tweak some flags you could do certain
things but basically it was a fixed
pipeline and then what happened is that
you came up with the idea of creating a
programmable pipeline where the game
designer could actually write the code
food that handles the vertexes and
something that handles the pixels so
what came out of this was a the idea of
a programmable vertex shader and a
programmable fragment shader and we'll
talk about both of those now now a
vertex shader was programmable the game
designer could write some code that
would handle each of those vertex
operations now a vertex shader runs once
per vertex on a 3d model now after it's
been down the pipeline at some point
it's getting near to being pixels
getting near to being something that we
displayed on the screen
and therefore you have a thing with the
pixel shader or the fragment shader now
basically the fragment shader decides
the color the texture the lighting and
the shadows that are being thrown by the
different objects in the 3d world so at
one end you have the 3d models with the
vertex is the vertex shader let the
other end just before we're about to put
things onto the screen you have a
fragment shader which controls the color
of each individual pixel another
fragment shader runs once per pixel on
the screen now 3d pure is amongst you
will say yes Gary it's a bit more
complicated that and yes it is but I'm
just trying to give here a basic
overview of what's happening now where
CPUs and GPUs differ significantly is
that the vertex shaders are pretty
autonomous they can run on each vertex
independently and in fact it turns out
the fragment shaders are fairly
autonomous now of course there are some
interlinking between these things but
basically GPUs are very good at doing
things in parallel and therefore you
find that GPUs actually have multiple
execution engines in fact what they call
them is multiple shader calls a shader
that can run vertex work or fragment
work and if you look at an are Mali GPU
it's often the end of the name like the
are Mali t88 0 will have MP something in
mp4 and p12 and that number at the end
tells you how many shader calls it has
and the more shader cores it has the
more work you can do in parallel now
because GPUs can do things in a parallel
manner it actually opens them up to a
whole other area of technology called
GPU computing GPU computing is when you
have a task that needs to be
and highly in parallel using 12 shader
calls for example that actually turns
out that certain types of image
processing certain types of computer
vision and actually certain types of
machine learning work very well on GPUs
and so all modern GPUs both on the
desktop and on the mobile phone support
a kind of GPU computing renderscript
maybe or OpenCL which allows them to be
used for these kinds of tasks now
there's one other thing I want to
mention that is of course there is a
difference between 3d graphics on a
desktop and 3d graphics on a mobile
phone of course if you've seen a 3d
graphics card from Nvidia or from
ati/amd they are they are big they've
got big fans on them they've got huge
coolers on them they need their own
separate power supply sometimes they go
occupy two slots you can have two of
them in your car on your PC and so on
now of course a mobile phone can't do
that I mean the Stratis cars themselves
are bigger than most phones so of course
power efficiency is key when it comes to
mobile GPUs and that's why it's
interesting that companies like Qualcomm
and companies like arm have actually
seemed to be doing very well in the GPU
market but maybe Nvidia isn't doing so
well because it hasn't been able to
translate its desktop GPU technology
down into the mobile where as
specifically designed mobile GPUs from
say arm are doing a much better job now
of course the amazing thing is is that
we as consumers we expect to see the
greatest and best 3d graphics we can on
a mobile phone because we're used to
seeing things on a console or on a
desktop and the amazing thing is the GPU
designs are maging to bring high levels
of quality to a smartphone now of course
you've always sensed to yourself when
you've played a 3d game the back of the
phone does start to heat up a bit and
the reason for that is because of the
parallel nature of the GPU with a CPU
lit if you're doing something some of
the cause might shut down it might be
only running at a few megahertz now
while there are power saving things that
go on inside a GPU at that time when
you're actually rendering those 3d
frames it wants to get them out there as
fast it can so all the shaders are
working all of the stuff is going as
quickly
can so that it can produce those
graphics pinnacles is doing that 60
frames a second that means every 16
milliseconds is processing a whole frame
including the word from the CPU and the
GPU and it's amazing that we can still
actually get such great graphics from
such a tiny piece of silicon and from
such with such great battery life so
hats off to all mobile GPU designers
you've definitely got my respect now in
a minute I want to talk to you about the
unified shader model and about the
Vulcan API but before I do that please
just if you like this video do give it a
thumbs up also don't forget to subscribe
to Android authorities YouTube channel
now I said I'd mention the unified
shader model now previously the vertex
shader and the fragment shader were two
specific different types of shader if
you look at say the Mali 470 GPU you can
see it has a vertex shader and up to 4
fragment shaders what happened with
OpenGL ES 3.0 and the equivalent in the
DirectX world was that the shaders
became unified so any shade it could
become a vertex shader or a fragment
shader it could do both operations and
that's useful because if a shader was
sitting idle because had nothing to do
because there wasn't any more vertex
work to be done it was a waste but now
if it can be a universal if it gets
unified it you can do any type of
shading work then your shaders can be
employed to do all kinds of work and
nothing ever has to stay idle and of
course where it's not sitting idle that
means you get greater performance now
the latest thing that's happened in the
3d graphics world is the release of the
Vulcan API now basically the Vulkan API
comes after OpenGL it's this new level
with being supported by just about
everybody across the 3d graphics
industry and it's got two important
improvements over the previous api's the
first is that there's all the overheads
for checking for errors has been reduced
significantly because the idea is if
you're writing again need to find the
errors we're developing it they don't
need to be running while you're running
the program itself so they've been
reduce and that means that there's
actually greater performance because the
error checking has been reduced the
other thing is it plays very nicely with
multi-core C
P use which means that if two CPUs are
trying to do two things to the graphic
taper at the same time they can now do
it at the same time previously they'd
have to wait one for the other
now it's multi-core friendly so you'll
see that the Galaxy S seven for example
actually with the first mobile phone
Android mobile phone release that
supported the Vulcan API
okay to sum up 3d graphics are done
using triangles triangles have three
corners three vertexes and those three
vertexes need to be transformed in size
and in position into the 3d graphic
world and to do that you use vectors
floating point and 4x4 matrices and a
GPU is very good at doing those kinds of
operation and very fast now in modern
day GPUs you can program the vertex
shader that runs once per vertex every
point on those triangles and you can
program the fragment shader every pixel
that appears on the screen to set the
color and what happens is the programmer
writes the shaders he writes the code
that runs on the GPU to produce the
final image and as the 3d designers come
up with more and more interesting ways
of handling lights and shadows and
textures and all these amazing things
you get better and better graphics so
the next time you play a 3d game on your
mobile phone or even on your console or
on your desktop just give a thought to
the GPU and all that hard work is doing
just that you can enjoy your gaming
experience
