handy the Android authority app guy and
welcome back to the Android apps weekly
show this is episode number 141 and we
have a ton of Google i/o stuff to talk
about so let's get started it has been
officially announced that Android apps
are coming to Chromebooks this feature
will roll out sometime later this year
and it should include well over a
million apps and games it won't be
available for all Chromebooks as older
models will be getting the shaft but
this is a big deal for the OS as a whole
google also announced a low and duos a
couple of new messaging applications
meant to be used in tandem duos is a one
on one video chatting service while a
low is a text messaging service that
includes smart features from google
assistant ello will have encryption and
both applications seem to be packed full
of features we'll know more about them
when they get released later this year
but you can sign up for the
pre-registration now this will be
alongside hangouts which is reportedly
not going anywhere
Android wear 2.0 was announced at Google
i/o and you may be wondering why this is
being featured in an app news roundup
that's because the new operating system
will allow applications to be installed
and run natively on the watch without a
phone companion which will make watches
standalone devices instead of just
companion devices and that is very
exciting the Google Play app Awards were
conducted at Google i/o this week some
of the winners include clash Royale
taking the best game Pokemon shuffle
mobile taking the go global award and
the best application was house which is
an interior design application all of
the games were freemium which was kind
of disappointing considering how many
great paid games there are but the
applications were pretty decent if you
want to check those out Pokemon go is
now open for beta registration for
people in the United States signing up
for the beta has no assurance that
you'll actually get in but it is an
opportunity to try the application out
before everybody else the good news is
that even if you don't get selected for
the beta you can still get an email
notification when the game is widely
available if you want the link to that
we'll have it in the written companion
which is linked in the video description
below for even more Android apps and
games news check out this week's
newsletter which is linked in the video
description below
Google i/o was a huge event and there
are a ton of i/o and non
I owe announcements that we didn't have
time for that you should definitely
check out if you'd like you can sign up
for the newsletter using the form in the
written companion which is linked in the
video description below and we'll send
you that newsletter every Sunday or you
can download the Android authority app
and get the latest news as quickly as it
comes out okay folks we'll take a look
at the apps and games that made a big
splash this week as usual if you want to
check out any of these apps or games
we'll have those links for you in the
video description below
poncho is a cute little weather
application the application is designed
around its cartoon characters and
delivery system of the weather in a way
that is a little more colorful and fun
below the style it features twice daily
weather forecasts public transit alerts
hourly forecasts and alerts for things
like high pollen allergy and humidity
conditions it'll also give you tips for
the weather like whether or not you
should bring an umbrella it's free to
download but you'll have to sign up for
the beta first by clicking at the link
below
the playbook by Google Play is a
developer oriented application that
helps you learn the ins and outs of the
development atmosphere on Google Play it
has lists of things like best practices
tips on how to increase the quality and
usability of your app and tips on how to
publish and distribute your app please
note buggin the Android Authority app
guy on Google+ is not one of those
suggestions it's done up in beautiful
material design which is a nice plus
it's also in beta right now and you can
join the beta by clicking the link in
the video description below
Assassin's Creed identity is the long
awaited action RPG that was finally
released earlier this week for those who
don't know identity is a game that takes
place in the Assassin's Creed universe
but gives you the ability to create your
own characters and go on a variety of
adventures
it features open-world mechanics various
controller options and plenty of content
to enjoy there have been a few release
bugs and it seems like people aren't
overly happy with the third-party
controller supports but otherwise the
reviews have been generally positive
spaces is a new initiative from Google
that's kind of baked into Google+ the
idea is that you can set up a space for
a specific topic people then join and
then everyone can post about that topic
or just talk to other people who enjoy
that same topic think of it like
collections on Google+ except everyone
can contribute instead of just one
person curating everything it's a nifty
idea and it comes with its own
application so you don't have to go
through Google+ all the time
vector 2 was released earlier this week
for those who never played the first
vector
the game revolves around parkour themed
platform mechanics and you must escape
from the proverbial man in order to
remain free
it features minimal silhouetted graphics
simple controls and you can even do
stuff like stunts when you jump it's a
fun little time killer that adds some
depth and length from the previous title
and it ends up being a better overall
experience it has some early bugs but
nothing to get angry about and that
about does it for this video folks if
you want to watch more we have a ton of
Google i/o videos on the channel and
Christal's Android wear 2.0 video linked
up there on the screen and in the video
description below before you go don't
