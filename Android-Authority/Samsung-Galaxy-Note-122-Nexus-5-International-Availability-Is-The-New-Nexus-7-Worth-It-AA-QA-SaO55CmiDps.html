android authority Q&amp;amp;A for august
twenty-first 2013 hey everybody on Chris
look and it's good to be back thanks to
Josh for filling in now on to the
questions Johnny 77 says I'm considering
buying the new Nexus 7 but what are the
key differences between the two tablets
is it worth the upgrade or should I wait
one of the biggest differences is the
screen resolution the original Nexus 7
had 1280 x 800 resolution while the new
one has 1920 x 1200 resolution so
everything is going to look a lot
clearer and generally a lot better the
specs are also pretty much higher all
across the board with the exception of
storage which is the same as the
original Nexus 7 is it worth the upgrade
yes should you wait well I don't know
what you're waiting for if you're
waiting for the new Nexus 7 you're
probably in for a long wait so you might
want to snap this one up Akash asks well
the Nexus 5 be available internationally
when it launches we know so little about
the nexus 5 or nexus 4 version 2 right
now but it's impossible to say for sure
but since the original nexus 4 worked
internationally it's probably a safe bet
to say that the 5 or 4 version 2 will as
well how easy it'll be to buy
internationally though is a different
story you want to wait and see on that
one HR says hello Chris hello I've heard
rumors of a samsung note 12.2 device and
I'm quite interested in purchasing one
have you any idea of the release dates
and or whether these rumors are true or
just speculations thank you it
definitely looks like Samsung is
preparing a 12.2 inch tablet details are
pretty scarce but back in July evleaks
said that Samsung is preparing a 12.2
and a 10-inch tablet when it comes to
the release date some rumors are saying
October but we're not really sure yet
that's just a rumor stay tuned for more
information though mr Albizzi says i
currently own the LG optimus g pro and i
love it but with the recent announcement
of the LG
dg2 will LG update the optimus g pro
with some features from the g2 like
guest mode slide aside or text link as
far as I know there's currently no word
on bringing g2 features to the optimus g
pro as to whether or not that will
happen it's sort of tricky LG does stand
to bring some more customers to the g2
by keeping those features exclusive on
the other hand they'll definitely make
people happy if they bring some of those
new features to existing hardware we'll
just have to see what happens Giovanni
says ever since I moved my apps to my SD
card on my galaxy s4 the app logos have
been missing and they only come back
when I download an app from the Play
Store any help please first of all to
sly say that's pretty weird but what I
would try first is going into settings
and moving the apps back to the internal
storage if that fixes the problem try
moving the apps back to the SD card and
see if you have your problem again if
that doesn't help I'd say try rebooting
your phone I know it sounds simple but
that can fix a lot of problems christian
says i use the acer liquid e2 do you
know when Google will release the 4.3
update for the e2 first things first
that's not actually up to google it
would be up to either acer or your
carrier well unfortunately so far
there's been no word yet on 4.3 coming
to the e2 that doesn't mean that we
won't see it just that I wouldn't expect
to see it too soon and that wraps it up
for this week folks now remember this
show is powered by your questions so
keep them coming to ask ourself the link
down below in the description make sure
to stay tuned to android authority for
news reviews tips tricks giveaways QA
and more I'm Chris Wilk and thanks for
