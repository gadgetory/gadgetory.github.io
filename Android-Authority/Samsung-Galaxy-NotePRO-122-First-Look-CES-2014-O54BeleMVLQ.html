by Toyota if you need an even bigger
canvas for your S Pen work and play then
the newly announced pearl line has your
back age structure regard for Management
Authority what's going on everybody and
this is your first look at the Galaxy
Note pro 12.2 yes you heard it right
this is a 12 point 2 inch tablet that
not only blows away and pretty much all
the other devices when it comes to size
but also packs a lot of power underneath
Samsung has put their high 2560 by 1600
resolution into a screen now over 12
inches and is obviously one of the
biggest Android devices available now
the back of the device takes on the
textured plastic that is becoming
samsung's new material trope and there's
really no getting around the fact that
this is just one crazy big device to
behold powered by either the Snapdragon
800 or the akhtar the XE knows 5 octa an
updated version of TouchWiz brings a
better way of using all of the real
estate you gain in this larger screen
especially when considering multitasking
for which the note pro runs 3 gigabytes
of ram expandable storage is a trope for
Samsung devices and it does make a
return here as well and in order to make
this behemoth gopher enough time for
work and play a mass of ninety five
hundred million power battery is found
within the main additions to the note
pro involved the software for quite a
long time now we've been saying that
Samsung's TouchWiz UI has needed a
refresh and that is exactly what it got
here making the my magazine interface
the inspiration for much of the user
interface the pearl line of tablets
allows for pages of content that are
broken up into rigid tiles adding to an
organized clean but functional overall
look the s-pen obviously makes its
return with all of the enhancements that
were put into the note 3 M 10.1 like the
pen command menu and while multi-window
has always been a big samsung fan
favorite to the much bigger canvas of
the 12 point 2 inch screen now allows
users to create a space occupied by up
to four different windows running at
once it's clear that what the proline
Samsung is looking to really size itself
up quite literally while bringing some
very worthwhile enhancements underneath
the note pro to a point to will be made
available in the coming months and might
even come in bundles with software to
make productivity even easier for the
user once again thank you for watching
our coverage a stay tuned for more live
from the Samsung tech lounge here at CES
2014 and once again thank you to Toyota
