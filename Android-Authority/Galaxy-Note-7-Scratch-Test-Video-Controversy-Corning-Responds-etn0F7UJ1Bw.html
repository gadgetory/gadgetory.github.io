who just bought a beautiful new shiny
galaxy note 7 only to find out the hard
way that it's even easier to scratch
than its predecessor you may have seen
this video Zack from Jerry rig
everything performing his now familiar
durability test on the samsung galaxy
note 7 surprisingly though he appears to
leave visible scratches on the devices
Gorilla Glass 5 with a metal pick that
rates a three on the scale of hardness
quote only one step above plastic as
Zack notes in the video a new glass from
Corning that appears to scratch much
easier than its predecessor is
admittedly hot news but as often is the
case this scandal may have gotten blown
a little out of proportion now for those
of you who are new to this let's give
you just a little bit of context in
Zacks previous videos on devices
typically using Gorilla Glass 4 it
usually takes five or six hardness pics
before scratches occur but in the note 7
video non removable marks are visible on
the screen from a pic as lowest three
based on the video evidence some have
jumped to the conclusion that increasing
Gorilla Glass 5:00 shadow resistance has
come at the cost of weakening its
scratch resistance now this may or may
not be true but to be fair we had to
speak to Corning Corning is the
manufacturer that produces these
displays we spoke to their senior
spokesperson and they pointed out this
the test that was conducted in the video
is obviously not an industry test it
uses hardness picks but it's in an
uncontrolled manner we also don't know a
lot about the loads the person used
whether the loads are changing as he
goes through the testing now by load of
course he means the pressure with which
Zack pressed on the display with each
pick the human hand can't possibly be a
hundred percent certain that he's
pressing with the exact same pressure
each time it's a good point but we did
argue this we made the point that Zack
has performed this test over 30 times
and that even outside a laboratory
setting there must be at least some
degree of consistency in his approach
and execution but they pretty much shut
that point down with this point and I
quote the hardness pick that was used in
the video is a three that's
softer than the glass material itself
oftentimes when you have a softer
material and depending on what load
you've used you tend to see material
transfer on the test substrate material
transfer on the test substrate is not
necessarily a scratch but it can appear
as a scratch to the untrained eye
Corning went on to say and I quote we
have conducted control pick hardness
tests and have demonstrated that this
material transfer can sometimes occur it
is characteristic of the lower pick
hardness during the tests
so if Corning's theory is accurate
basically what we're seeing is the
rubbing off of the softer pick on the
harder display sounds like a reasonable
explanation but then we thought of this
the video seems to show progressively
worse scratches as the pick hardness
increases which would be logical if
indeed the pick is scratching the glass
so if what we're seeing is a soft
material being transferred onto the
glass shouldn't the effect become less
noticeable as the picks become harder
Corning responded and I quote it's a
function of the difference in the
hardness of materials but in particular
the load is very important so you could
have a lower hardness pick with a much
higher load and still achieve a
condition that would look like a
slightly higher hardness pick with a
lighter load it's a combination of
pressure and material hardness
differences that exist between the pick
and the material that's being contacted
so have any of you new galaxy note 7
owners suffered from increased scratches
on your device let me know in the
comments below I want to hear about it
well maybe you're now one of those
people who don't want to just watch
videos about technology but help
actually make new technology while our
beloved sponsor Full Sail University
offers degree programs to help you reach
those goals in their mobile development
undergraduate degree program you'll
learn how to create and distribute apps
and if you're ready to advance your
development skills check out the mobile
gaming graduate program if you're ready
to compete in this rapidly growing
industry visit Full Sail dot edu forward
slash authority to learn more about
these degree programs thanks for
watching Edward army Jase here and if
you want to get into this a lot deeper
