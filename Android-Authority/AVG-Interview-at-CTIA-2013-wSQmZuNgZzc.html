Authority what's going on everybody and
I'm here with Tony who is with avg and
they're going to show us not only a 2g
itself on Android but also to new
products that they've released very
recently did what they today or this
week oh this week yes okay well we're
here at ctia released avg cleaner and
avg image shrinker well why don't we go
through those two first let's talk about
the image shrinker well the image drink
is really really interesting you know
how how you collect all those
photographs on a mobile phone you know
and then you're going to post some of
them onto photo sharing site so i might
be able to a social networking site you
know what we allow you to do is shrink
the image down before you actually post
it so one it's you could delete the
original if you don't want the
high-quality image so we're saving you
space on the device the more importantly
we're actually saving in bandwidth on
your data plan yes you're actually being
allowed to monitor that slightly better
and when you shrink it we give you a
choice of the quality that you actually
want to shrink it to as we put the
choice back in your hands you'll see I'm
given a select size so i can now choose
what size I want to actually push to
push this down to now this is going to
make it easier for me to upload to a
photo sharing or a social networking
site I can yeah and it's going to it's
going to allow me to also save bandwidth
yeah on my data plan so i can actually
turn us out i'm only going to put this
on the web so i'm going to put this into
small mode yeah and i could delete the
original here as well if i want so if
it's if that's all I'm ever going to use
the picture for yeah that's a good
format to keep it in and it's safe
storage on the device and there we are
I've shrunk it down so you can see also
how much of it I shrunk down
and then you can see where i can
actually post it to so i could email it
or i could put it on any of the the
photo sharing sites that i've got here
as well wonderful so that would be the
image shrinker how about avg cleaner yvg
cleaner you know you're not take our car
to the garage every six months we get
our oil change to get that get that
rubbish out of the bottom of the engine
that avg cleaner is exactly that way
yeah your device accumulates cache files
temporary files and files from in the
past installations etc and things you've
deleted yeah what cleaner does is go
through those and remove them all for
you it's already calculated that on this
device yeah it can save 134 megabytes of
memory and we say so but just by
cleaning that off it will make the
device a little bit more efficient yes
it so i can i can actually click on one
click on here i can see what
applications are causing it and i can
clean all the caches yeah I don't I'd
rather not do that so so the next person
that comes along I can demonstrate it
with that in there as well and you can
schedule that to happen on a timely
basis so it automatically watch them out
of the device freeing up space and
making the device sir perform a bit
better Oh wonderful all right well
coming into avg for Android you guys
mentioned to me that avg is now the most
downloaded application for antivirus on
android and matt a question for you
again I think it'd be worth it to hear
from someone in the industry about is
Android well okay that's right this way
I guess a lot of people do want to have
that extra protection but what you say
Android is a vulnerable operating system
oh by nature is an open OS you're
susceptible to attack now if you look at
platforms as they grow what you'll see
is once a platform gets over a certain
market share it becomes interesting to
the bad guys what you got to remember as
five years ago or five or ten years ago
it was kind of about disruption so the
bad guys are writing the blue screen
viruses and malware yeah now they write
it to make money so they want to
covertly install something on your
device they want to steal your identity
or
take some money off you now are on a
mobile platform as that's there's an
easy monetization route because if i
write a piece of malware and i can send
a premium rate SMS yeah i can directly
monetize well that's actually much
simpler than writing it on a pc see it's
a more susceptible platform but because
it's open a bit because it's open we see
all those app developers out there
writing great apps as well so you know
it it just means consumers need to be
aware of the risk and instill some
security software let us take yeah let
us look after that piece one question
that it just came up into my mind just
now I understand that and row of course
Android is a platform that's available
across so many different devices and it
may be pretty easy to take care of you
know securing it but is there a
difference in securing a let's say a
stock Android experience as opposed to
say a samsung touchwiz or an HTC type of
user interface no I mean the skin that a
certain manufacturer puts on top of the
android OS doesn't really affect us
because we are we're working below that
level so for example if you're
downloading an app from an app store
we're actually checking the APK APK up
in the cloud yeah so before it hits the
device so we're kind of before that you
know or deeper down in the OS than that
and it's never posed a problem at all
not that i know of no i mean we might
have some user interface issues i've
never heard of any but who knows okay
i'm coming to you live from ctia 2013
this is pepco mobile focus and we're
going to go through with avg Tony just
before I sign off thank you very much
for your time thank you Joe all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
