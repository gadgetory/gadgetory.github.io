daydream Google home Google assistant or
Android instant apps Google i/o was a
tech geeks smorgasbord first let's start
off with Google daydream from the humble
beginnings of Google cardboard a couple
years ago Google has stepped up their
virtual reality game with the
announcement of Google daydream at this
year's conference daydream encompasses
everything Google has planned for
virtual reality including standardizing
requirements for smart phones and
headsets as well as baking in the new
virtual reality mode right into the
upcoming Android n the DIY nature of
cardboard is no longer a possibility
with daydream it just doesn't meet the
technical requirements but the good news
is that a lot of OEMs like HTC Samsung
LG and Huawei have already announced
their daydream VR plans
apart from third-party OEM Google will
also release a headset and controller
Google has also set the minimum
requirements for smartphones that lean
towards the high-end dubbed daydream
ready which will allow for the fast and
seamless experience that Google is
aiming for on the developer side of
things a VR mode will be baked into
Android N and is already available with
a third Developer Preview that currently
includes a VR optimized version of the
Google Play Store and YouTube all
hardware and software will officially be
released this fall likely alongside the
2016 Nexus smartphones now moving on to
Google assistant and for many Google now
or okay Google has been a key part of
their Android experience and Google
continues to make things even better
especially with their announcement of
Google Assistant the beefed up voice
assistant comes with a lot more
functionality than what you're currently
used to in Google now and interacting
with it is almost conversational in
nature if you haven't already don't
forget to check out the live demo of
Google assistant during the keynote to
see how simple and seamless the
experience is going to be Google
assistant will be available later this
year and will run across numerous
devices including smartphones tablets
and even your car now let's talk GU GLE
home Google home is the company's answer
to Amazon echo and is a compact wireless
Bluetooth speaker with a built-in mic
that you can interact with using a voice
assistant in this case it's Google
assistant it lets you enjoy
entertainment manage every
tasks and get answers from Google all
using conversational speech home also
acts like a chromecast and lets you play
audio wirelessly or connect to speakers
and enjoy content on your television you
will also be able to use home to control
automation systems like nest and finally
also take advantage of Google now and
Google search using the device all with
simple voice commands and conversations
without needing to reach for your phone
Google home will officially be available
by the end of this year now Android
instant apps as the name suggests is a
quick and simple way of accessing apps
without having to actually download it
this is ideal if you're looking to use
an app for a limited time or only during
specific occasions when a developer
updates their application to support
Android instant apps simply tapping on a
URL will give access to a full-fledged
Android app when the user clicks the URL
the Play Store will be able to search
for that application and download only
the code necessary to run the app you do
get the full functionality of the app so
for example if you're using a shopping
app you'll be able to use your
fingerprint sensor to authenticate
payment google says Android instant apps
will work on all devices running jelly
bean or later now let's talk a lo and
duo during the keynote Google announced
two new communication apps a low a
messenger gap and duo a one-to-one video
calling app a low will tap into your
contact list and the app will be linked
to your phone number also similar to
whatsapp palo features stickers and
emojis just like most of its competitors
but what makes a difference is a feature
called
whisper shout that lets you resize text
to better express your feelings instead
of resorting to something like all caps
Inc lets you draw images and Google
assistant is also built into the app now
duo is a simple one-to-one video app
that aims to make and video chatting
much easier no matter what platform
you're on or how fast your data
connection is like a low you'll be able
to use your phone number to sign up the
coolest feature of duo is called
knock-knock that shows a preview of what
to expect when you answer a call
basically if someone calls you on duo
you'll get to see them in front of your
front facing camera even before
answering it
allo and duo will be available soon and
you'll be able to pre-register for them
right now now most of you will be very
happy about the news regarding project
ara we finally have
some concrete information about this
device a working prototype of project
our smartphone was shown off during a
special session at Google i/o and there
was a lot that was revealed about the
device the phone will have six slots in
total and you'll have the option to add
any module to any slot and you'll be
able to swap between various components
without needing to shut down the phone
that's pretty cool
we don't have a lot of information yet
on what the various components of
modules will be but a developer version
will be available later this year with a
commercial launch expected in 2017
