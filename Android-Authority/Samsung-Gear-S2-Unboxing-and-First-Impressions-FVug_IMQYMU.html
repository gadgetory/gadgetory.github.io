coming into the end of the year but now
we have our hands on the brand new
Samsung iteration of their Tizen powered
SmartWatch hey it's Josh reguar from
Android authority what's going on
everybody and here is my unboxing and
first impressions on the Samsung gear s2
and so here we are finally with the
Samsung gear s2 we got a look at this at
Aoife and LAN did a great job of showing
just how unique this particular wearable
is especially when you compare it to the
Android wear iterations out there but
Samsung is powering this using Tizen
their OS that is exclusively currently
for wearable devices here we are with
the actual unboxing all right and there
it is I have of course the dark gray as
it is called version but you know just
pretty much as black and pretty much
grey all around really just dark colors
there is a white version that is also
available as well this is going to be a
little bit more of a sporty SmartWatch
as you can see already because of the
silicon band and unlike the s2 classic
you're not going to have the let's say
little rivets that are on the rotating
bezel right there so everything's going
to be look looking pretty smooth on here
so going to put that aside for now and
get underneath in order to look at what
we get with the box here is the charging
dock right here now we have Samsung on
the back right here
but the watch should be able to just
rest pretty easily like so and then the
documentation and of course the plug
adapter for the actual device and the
charging port itself and actually tucked
away into the side of the box finally is
a set of replacement straps they have
s-song up for small and the one that's
on the watch right now is considered
large so for those of you have smaller
wrists they do have a strap there for
you
removing the actual strap from the watch
is a little bit difficult at first until
you realize that you have to sort of
slide it out of the housing and then
after that you can just snap the other
one on now taking a look around the
device that we already have the nice
bezel right here which is going to prove
to be a dial inside of the operating
system here so it's one way of going
through all of the elements rather than
just having to swipe around the silicon
ban will give it a little bit more
resistance to splashes especially when
compared to any leather straps but
otherwise you have a stainless steel
body on here which keeps things very
nice so we're going to go ahead and get
the plastic off of this bad boy right
here now one of the best parts about
this watch is that it comes with an
AMOLED screen now that shouldn't come as
much of a surprise given that this is a
Samsung device but what that means is
that the display will only turn on the
pixels that it needs in order to display
what is displayed and that should help
with battery life which is something
that we always have a caveat with when
it comes to wearables so now with all of
that done we can finally dawn the actual
watch on the wrist and go through some
of the functions so here we are with the
Tizen OS I'm going to go ahead and just
go in and out of a couple of areas right
now my t-mobile bill is available
already so that is a notification so if
you go over to the left or if we wanted
to swipe over we could always do that as
well so swiping among all the different
areas we're going to have a lot of
options and applications so I'm going to
use the bezel right here because it
feels really nice and it's a new way of
input for smartwatches that we think is
the most exciting part of the gear s2
head over to the right we have a bunch
of apps you can have a quick dial
function right over here if we want to
pick which buddy we want to have and
there's a bunch of them that I can put
right here and then you can always add a
new widget here so here are a few of the
widgets that you would be able to add
you can add water and coffee consumption
an actual schedule widget and there
should be more inside of the gear
manager which we will use for our full
review and get a lot of new applications
on here aside from the ones that are
just already here and someone actually
is already asking me if I have tested
the s2 which of course today you are
seeing the unboxing and first
impressions of honestly the thing that
we liked the most about the gear s2 thus
far is this new version of input now we
already took a look inside of the gear
manager and there are quite a few
applications there already a few of them
we
actually use like Yelp and stuff like
that but we have yet to see if the
ecosystem is as mature as it needs to be
in order for Tizen to really stand up to
Android wear now it's important to note
that the gear s2 is compatible with a
lot of different Android devices you
don't need to have a Samsung device
anymore exclusively in order to use the
gear s2 however when you're going
through the setup in this case I'm using
my Moto X the brand new one you do have
to install a number of extra
applications in order to get it to work
now before we finish up I do want to put
out there real quick that I have a
number of reviews that are coming out
next week on smartwatches I have the
Moto 360 second gen and the Huawei watch
both of which will get the full review
treatment and you can see those here on
Android authority but with the gear s2
we're also going to go through a couple
of comparisons not only between the Moto
360 and the Huawei watch but between
Tizen on the gear s2 and Android we're
using those two as examples so you can
