might want to control an Android device
from your PC for instance maybe get a
text or what's up what's you're working
and you wanna be able to respond quickly
without having to get up from your
computer maybe just want to share your
mouse and keyboard or maybe you want to
transfer files between your devices in
this video we're gonna look at seven
different ways that you can control an
Android device from a PC but we're not
just going to be looking at screen
mirroring apps were also going to look
at some other slightly more interesting
options as well so I'm going to run
through seven different apps that allow
you to control your Android device on
your PC in different ways for nearly any
app like this you're going to need an
app on the phone and then you're going
to need a PC a piece of software on the
PC as well so they can sync together so
in most cases you just download the app
from the Play Store and you download the
software from the website install them
both and then join onto the same Wi-Fi
network or plug them in via USB and
you'll be good to go
unless I specify otherwise that's how
these will work and there's a more
detailed article to go with this video
I'll leave the link to that in the
description down below ok so the first
step we're going to be looking at is
something called join so join isn't a
screen mirroring app it's a chrome app
it runs inside your Chrome browser and
what this will allow you to do is to
send files to respond to SMS messages to
see notifications and perhaps more
interestingly to push your chrome tab to
another device so for instance if you're
reading something great on your desktop
computer and you're enjoying it you want
to go and get a bit more comfortable to
carry on reading it then you can
forwards that tab to your mobile device
and then enjoy it on the couch or let's
be honest the bog this is something I
actually do quite often it's fairly
convenient because you don't need to
have something running in your system
tray it's not resource-hungry
it just runs in the background in chrome
and then if you're enjoying an article
you want to transfer your clipboard also
then you can do so just by clicking that
icon and going to the relevant option on
the menu so this isn't a full Android
control solution but if you want that
specific functionality if you think it's
something that would be handy and you
don't want to always have your screen
being mirrored on the side of your
monitor then this is a great way to do
that
the next one I'm gonna be looking at is
something called pushbullet pushbullet
is an app that can run on multiple
devices and it aims to synchronize those
devices in various
waise again this isn't for completely
mirroring your android screen but what
it can do is once again share files send
messages between devices copy your
clipboard respond to SMS messages unlike
to join it can also view and respond to
whatsapp messages that you can't see
your whole history you just get the
message come up and then you have the
opportunity to respond quickly
pushbullet is free to use if you're
happy with just the most basic features
but that comes with a cap on how many
messages you can send of 100 per month
if you want unlimited messages you're
gonna have to pay a monthly recurring
fee which is always a bit irritating
whilst it's quite a popular option as
you're going to see there's more
powerful options on this list that are
completely free or don't cost any more
so I don't highly recommend push with it
actually but it's worth mentioning
because it's a popular one and it does
have some functionality won't get
anywhere else
such as the ability to communicate with
a big group and have lots of different
devices added you can even follow your
favorite creators and have that turn up
and a kind of feed so as useful it is
interesting but like I say for just
controlling your Android device it's not
the most powerful or interesting on this
list so if you're here hoping to
completely control your Android device
in order to run apps on your monitor etc
then you might have been left a little
bit cold by those last two options in
which case the first screen mirroring
app on this list should be more
interesting to you the only caveat to
that is that this is only gonna work for
Samsung aficionados so yes
you've guessed that this is side sync so
I'd sync is a screen mirroring app it
works both over USB or over Wi-Fi and
it's probably the best screen mirroring
app that I've experienced so it like I
say the only problem is that you need a
Samsung device in order to use it unless
you're going to do some hackery
so side sink has two modes you can
either just see your notifications and a
little window or you can mirror the
entire screen see your home screen
interact with it with the mouse and
keyboard and treat it as though there's
a window on your computer that is your
Android device and this works really
well you can even go full screen mode
and on a wired connection it's
incredibly fast almost fast enough to
play twitch games not quite but you can
certainly play things like candy crush
or Tenten
and even over wired connection this is
fine it's alright for media playback and
on the whole it's one of the most stable
and feature-rich options out there it
wasn't that stable when it first came
about that Samsung has been quietly
upgrading it on the down-low and it's
gotten better and better but if you're
not a Samsung user then there are other
options one of these is something called
a visor so visor is an app that once
again lets you move your screen it's a
chrome app so you'll need to install
Chrome you need to install the app
through the Chrome browser it also has a
desktop app so it gets a bit fiddly and
it's not the best to set up once it's up
and running you'll be able to control
your Android device just the same as
sizing and do whatever it is you want to
do via your PC you can use your mouse
and keyboard you can respond to whatsapp
messages but it's not as fast inside
sync and it's not free if you want all
of the features so the free version is
wired you have to pay if you want to go
wireless
and you can improve the speed and the
frame rate and use full screen mode in
the paid version as well even the free
version works fine you can choose
whether you'd rather have higher
resolution or higher frame rate I
recommend the latter like I said it's
not perfect and you definitely won't be
playing many games like this but if you
just want something to easily respond to
whatsapp messages then this is a good
bet it's also not the most user-friendly
it's not the most intuitive to set up
it's a bit fiddly I had problems with it
at first but like I say once it's up and
running it works well and if you just
want to be able to respond to messages
go for it there plenty more screen
mirroring apps out there by the way like
a power mirror it's just a matter of
finding which one works best for you
another option is to use something
called desk Talk another option is
something called desk dock which is
surprisingly difficult to say actually
so desk dock doesn't mirror your screen
but it shares your mouse and keyboard
and the idea behind this is that the
mouse can transition between your
monitor and the Android device which
presumably you'll have stood up next
your computer and some kind of phone
stand and that way you can quickly
respond to messages you can open apps to
check on things and there's even a
potential application here for
developers because it means that if
you're testing an app you can jump
between your code and the app and
test that everything work for that I'm
going to get up and input it all with
your stubby finger the free version only
allows you to share the mouse and you'll
need to pay for the pro version if you
also want to be a share your keyboard
but the good news is this is only a
one-off fee it's like five quid or
something
there's no recurring fee as with some of
these other options there's plenty of
other apps out there that'll let you
share your mouse and keyboard as well
one I believe is called share mouse and
keyboard original name there another
one's called synergy which I used to use
but apparently isn't doing so well
anymore but again have a look around
this is another option AirDroid is like
an amalgamation of a lot of these
different apps in terms of the sheer
number of feature so that brings to the
table so you can use it to respond to
SMS messages and to retrieve files and
things and to copy and paste but you can
also use it to mirror your screen the
screen mirroring isn't the best it's not
comparable with visor or side sync but
if you just need to use it for a
Productivity purpose in a pinch then
it's perfectly serviceable it can also
share the mouse and keyboard so it is
like an amalgamation of all these
different options it's free to use for
the majority of these features including
screen mirroring and sharing your mouse
and keyboard but you will have to pay to
remove ads and also if you want to
remove a couple of restrictions such as
file sizes but there's only one dollar
ninety-nine a month so you can see it's
considerably better value especially
considering the large number of features
as compared to something like pushbullet
so finally I just want to throw a
curveball out there you can also use
Tasker to control your Android device so
Tasker is an automation app lets you set
up triggers as events and then response
Ursula's triggers so for instance you
could have it so that when you get home
you turn on Wi-Fi so we can use this to
control our anger device because there's
lots of ways that we can communicate
with Tasker via PC for instance both
pushbullet
and join officially support to Tasker
and that means that we could make our
phone react in a myriad of different
ways when we send a specific text
message for instance maybe giving us its
location for example or making a noise
so we can find it or taking a photo
remotely once again like I say the only
limit is your imagination so there you
go that's seven different ways seven
different apps that you can use to
control your Android device and across
those seven hopefully you've seen
there's lots of different options and
lots of different applications which is
if for you is going to depend on your
workflow and how you like to use your
device but hope
really something there will be handy of
course if not then you can always just
use it as a kind of party trick to show
off to friends and say hey isn't this
cool my radar for what's cool by the way
is seriously out of whack so it fans
really useful interesting guys if you
did then please leave like please share
it around that helps us immensely
