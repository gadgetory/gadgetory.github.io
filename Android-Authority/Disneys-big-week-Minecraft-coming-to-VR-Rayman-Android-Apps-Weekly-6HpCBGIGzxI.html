weekly show is sponsored by stock market
sensei ladies and gentlemen I'm Joe Indy
the Android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 132 we got a lot to
talk about this week so let's get right
into it
Google is working on a new feature where
people can test out games without
actually downloading the game when you
search for games in Google search on
your Android device you'll get the
option to try the game right there in
the browser this is a nifty feature that
could save people a lot of downloading
it's rare to see Google turn its back on
a feature but starting with Chrome
version 49 the famed browser will no
longer merge recent apps with tabs by
default this was something that art a
great many people myself included and as
the first feature turned off by many
many people soon we won't have to turn
it off ever again
Disney has announced that a Mickey Mouse
themed version of the popular time
waster Crossy Road was going to be
coming to Android and iOS eventually
there will be over 100 unlockable Disney
characters each with their own
soundtracks which is actually kind of
cool
we don't know an exact release date just
yet t-mobile has finally gotten YouTube
under its binge on banner after lengthy
negotiations as part of the talks you
too will be doing its own video
optimization instead of t-mobile which
is definitely interesting because soon
every other fan Jon member will be able
to do the same thing score one for net
neutrality minecraft one of the world's
most popular games is coming to VR
namely the Samsung gear VR this could be
a lot of fun as the game would be
perfect as a VR title with its limitless
gameplay and exploration unlike most
games minecraft will be exactly the same
as it was before but you'll be able to
look around on all directions at once
word is that it will be out sometime
later this year
for even more Android apps and games
news updates and new releases don't

newsletter which is linked in the video
description below there you'll see all
of the news that we didn't have time for

forum which is in the written companion
which is also linked in the video
description below
and we'll send it to you every single
Sunday
okay folks let's take a look at the
absent games that made a big splash this
week as usual if you want to check any
of these apps or games out you can find
those links in the video description
below
spotlight music is a newer music
application that plugs into Spotify and
lets you listen to your collection on a
fully material design interface this is
a far cry from the dark simplified
interface of the actual Spotify app in
whichever one is better is best left up
to personal interpretations spotlight
music is a fun little application that
seems to work pretty well although there
are some bugs here and there it also
isn't nearly as feature filled as the
stock Spotify app but it is worth
keeping an eye on the Disney Magic
Kingdom's is a new game this week out of
Gameloft
and Disney this is yet another Disney
themed builder from Gameloft and in this
one the Magic Kingdom gets all messed up
and it's your job to rebuild it as you
see fit the game is rife with Disney
references along with characters and
scenes from various movies in terms of
mechanics it works like pretty much any
builder sim with some differences here
and there it's free with in-app
purchases and it's family-friendly the
last past authenticator is a new
application from you guessed it LastPass
that gives you two-factor authentication
for your LastPass account it will
generate a six digit code that you can
then approve of in the application
before LastPass lets anything go through
or you can set it up to scan QR codes
instead if you want it also works with
Google Authenticator along with any TOTP
based authentication it's free and
pretty much a must-have application for
anyone who uses LastPass back in its day
rayman was a fun platformer with a
pretty decent sized cult following now
you be soft has released the original
rayman for mobile so fans can relive the
old days once again the creators did
quite a bit to allow the game to have
its old-school charm so the graphics
didn't get a huge boost and most of the
controls and gameplay remained exactly
the same make no mistake this is the
game that came out in 1995 just adapted
for mobile it also has no in-app
purchases the PlayStation video is a new
video streaming platform from Sony this
application allows you to purchase or
rent TV shows or movies and then stream
them directly from the application it's
linked to your PlayStation Network
account so you can stream them on your
PlayStation as well the interface works
for the most part although there are
some optimizations that probably need to
be made because the app does
feel a little bit clunky otherwise this
is probably a must-have application for
PlayStation owners who intend on using
the service this week's episode of the
Android apps weekly show is sponsored by
stock market sensei this is a stock
market trading application that predicts
various stock market numbers such as
opening and closing prices along with
other stats it also comes with seven
days worth of predictions an intuition
game where you can see if your gut
instincts are correct and it's all
wrapped up in a simple easy interface
you can use the search bar to find
various companies along with predictions
for each one it also has a widget that
will show you the stock prices of the
company of your choice so far the
application has decent reviews and has
gained over 1,000 followers on stock
twits inside of two weeks it's a fun
little application and a handy addition
if you're an investor give it a shot and
show your support for the Android apps
