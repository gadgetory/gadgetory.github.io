brought to you by the LG g3 hey what is
going on guys lon here from Android
Authority and today we're gonna be
taking a look at some official
accessories to go along with your brand
new LG g3 when it comes to accessories
most people tend to think of cases but
since we already covered the quick
circle case for the g3 we're going to be
focusing on some other kinds of
accessories starting with the tone
infinim bluetooth headset the infinite
is the most premium headset in LG's tone
line of Bluetooth headsets and also
features sound by Harman Kardon to give
you a great listening experience it's a
very attractive looking headset with a
metallic silver finish and it's also
light weight which means you should be
able to wear it for long periods of time
without discomfort the headset features
your typical buttons like volume up and
down pause play and the ability to skip
between tracks you can also answer phone
calls to the tone infinim also has
retractable earbuds so you can extend
them out as far as you need to and it
keeps things nice and clean when you're
not using the headset with up to 14
hours of listening time and up to 17
hours of talktime that should be more
than enough to be able to use this
headset for work and play accessory
number two is the LG G watch this watch
probably needs no introduction because
many of you are probably already very
familiar with it but the G watch is one
of the first watches to run the Android
wear operating system and you can use it
to receive and respond to notifications
directly from your wrist it's got a
battery life that will last you all day
and what they very slim simple and clean
look this watch was designed to pretty
much fit anyone it's also extremely
lightweight making it very comfortable
to wear for long periods of time and the
strap is also interchangeable if you
want to add a little extra flair to your
G watch accessory number three is the
latest and most current version of the G
pad okay so a tablet isn't really an
accessory but the G pad does make a
great companion to the g3 and that is
because of LG's cue pair feature which
allows you to pair your phone directly
to your
tablet with LG's cute pair feature you
can receive phone calls social network
notifications and text messages directly
to your tablet and even respond to them
as well
queue memos saved on either device will
also sync to one another so you'll
always have them with you and if you
happen to lose your phone you can use
your tablet to make it ring and vice
versa and that is it those are the
official accessories for your LG g3
