authority and we're here Aoife 2016
taking a look at two new mid-range
smartphones from Huawei called the Nova
and the Nova plus the Nova is the
standard model and the Nova plus is the
bigger and slightly better SPECT version
but instead of being just a blown-up
version of the same phone
the Nova plus looks completely different
from the standard Nova they're both made
of metal which makes them both feel
really nice and solid in the hand but
the Nova looks like a miniature Nexus 6p
while the Nova plus looks more like a
typical mate device from Huawei
despite how much the Nova looks like a
smaller Nexus 6p it actually feels
pretty different in the hand not just
because of its more compact size but
also because the sides of the phone are
much more rounded to make it more
comfortable to hold they do share some
similar design elements like the 2.5 D
curved glass on the front the rounded
corners and sides the fingerprint sensor
on the back and the USB type-c port on
the bottom but aside from that you
wouldn't really be able to tell that
these phones had anything else in common
just by looking at the design the Nova
has a 5-inch display while the Nova plus
has a slightly larger 5.5 inch screen
but they both share the same resolution
at 1920 by 1080
they look decent but they're definitely
not anything that's going to blow your
socks off they're being powered by a
Snapdragon 625 3 gigabytes of RAM and 32
gigs of internal storage but there's no
micro SD card slot so the phone's
internal storage is all you're going to
get the Nova and Nova plus also have
identical software experiences with
Android 6.0 marshmallow and Huawei's
emotion UI 4.1 on top and if you've ever
used a huawei phone before you'll know
exactly what to expect it's a very iOS
like experience with no app drawer
transparency effects and colorful icons
and you get pretty much all the same
features they would expect from Huawei
including the knuckles Sense technology
that lets you perform a variety of
different actions just by using your
knuckles where these two phones really
differ is in the battery life Department
and the camera the Nova has a 30 20
milliamp hour battery and the Nova plus
has a 33 40 milli amp hour battery so on
paper at least you should get a little
bit of extra battery life on the Nova
plus the front cameras are the same at 8
megapixels but the Nova plus comes with
a higher resolution 16 megapixel rear
camera
with optical image stabilization while
the standard Nova has a 12 megapixel
sensor without optical image
stabilization onboard but they are both
capable of recording video in 4k and
support all of Huawei's makeup and
beauty modes the Nova and the Nova plus
will be available in three colors with
titanium gray prestige gold and
moonlight silver but Huawei hasn't given
us any exact information regarding
pricing and availability just yet but
we'll definitely keep you posted on that
over at Android or comm as soon as we
find out but what do you guys think

mid Rangers from Huawei
