Android authority and Lenovo is known
for making some products that can be
used in several different configurations
to fit your needs and today we're taking
a look at a tablet that does exactly
that this is the Lenovo yoga tablet 10
HD plus starting with the design of the
yoga tablet 10 HD plus for the most part
it pretty much looks like any other
10-inch tablet it's mostly made of
plastic has relatively large bezels but
it's thin and lightweight at the same
time it comes in a silver and gold
finish and the back has a texture to it
giving the tablet grip and making it
easy to keep clean as it doesn't really
attract fingerprints when holding the
tablet it does feel pretty solid with
the exception of the back which has a
very hollow feel to it at least on my
unit you'll also notice that the weight
distribution on this tablet is very
uneven but that's due to the metal
barrel that serves as a kickstand and
all the buttons and ports live on or
around the metal barrel the power button
and microUSB port is on the left the 3.5
mm headset jack and volume keys are on
the right and if you want to access your
microSD card it's hidden by a plastic
door that's hidden by the kickstand the
camera is also pretty awkwardly placed
sitting on the bottom right corner not
really sure why Lenovo felt the need to
put everything on the bottom end of the
tablet but that's what they did now even
though the kickstand makes this tablet
very unevenly weighted and not quite so
symmetrical it's what makes the yoga Tim
unique usually you have to buy a case if
you want to prop up your tablet but with
the yoga tins built-in kickstand you can
prop it up in a couple different angles
giving it a lot of utility especially
when consuming media it is a little bit
difficult to open up you sort of have to
roll it in order to get it to open but I
will admit I actually found the
kickstand to be really useful and I used
it a lot more than I expected as far as
the speakers go their dual front-facing
speakers so they already get points for
being on the front because after all
front-facing speakers just makes sense
especially on a tablet but besides being
on the front they actually sound quite
good as
taking a closer look at the display on
the yoga tablet 10 it's a 10.1 inch
display with a resolution of 1920 by
1200 so it's got a very respectable
resolution and it's packing quite a few
pixels so graphics and text do look very
sharp viewing angles are good and it
gets plenty bright where this display
falls short though is in the color
calibration the contrast ratio is way
off it's just a very warm and overly
pink looking display the colors look
very unnatural and it was especially
noticeable when looking at people or
anything with flesh-colored tones to it
it seems almost as if they completely
oversaturated the Reds while under
saturating the greens and the Blues the
internal specs are very mid-range so
it's not going to be a huge selling
point for this tablet it's being powered
by a Snapdragon 400 B Adreno 305 and 2
gigs of RAM these Snapdragon 400 has
proven to perform very admirably and
it's no exception on the yoga tablet 10
it's pretty smooth for the most part but
I do notice some frames consistently
getting dropped during some of the
animations and apps are sometimes slow
to load so it's not the fastest tablet
I've ever used but it's still more than
usable you can play games on it just
fine and some of the performance hiccups
might be due to lenovo software more
than the actual specs so it's probably
fixable but at the end of the day it
gets the job done without causing too
much trouble when it comes to cameras on
tablets most of them usually aren't very
good and the yoga tablet tin is no
exception
it sounds decent coming in at 8
megapixels and that's exactly what it is
just decent the camera UI is very simple
and straightforward there isn't too much
going on with it and you've got the
usual settings like white balance ISO
exposure and other common camera modes
like macro and panorama the picture
quality isn't going to blow you away and
you more than likely have a better
camera on your phone already but it's
still good enough for posting to social
networks given good enough lighting
conditions you can get some decent
photos but if you want to take some
photos and low-light this is not the
tablet you'll want to depend on but I
don't think many people are out there
buying tablets for their low-light
camera performance anyways
one of the better aspects of the yoga
tablet 10 and probably the most
impressive is its battery life inside
it's got a whopping nine thousand
milliamp hour battery so this should
last you a long time whether it's on
standby or being heavily used and with
my usage which consists of mostly
playing some games and watching YouTube
I was able to easily get over eight
hours of screen on time which to me is
pretty good for a tablet of this size
and I also noticed that this tablet
idles extremely well losing only between
one to two percent overnight so if
you're a much lighter user you don't
really use your tablet all that much you
should be able to get several days out
of it before having to recharge and
finally on to the software and the yoga
tablet in was originally running on
Android 4.3 jelly bean when I initially
received it but it has since been
updated to KitKat so it's great to see
lenovo keeping their products updated on
top of Android is Lenovo's custom skin
and it's not the heaviest skin out there
but it does have some quirks to it the
lenovo launcher doesn't include an app
drawer so you have to resort to folders
if you don't want your home screens to
get cluttered up and there's a few
pre-installed apps from lenovo like the
security app and the sound and visual
app that give you a persistent
notification making the notification
shade look very cluttered so it's a
little bit annoying the green and grey
color scheme with cartoony looking icons
isn't the prettiest thing either some of
the notable features include lenovo
smart bar that can be accessed by
swiping from the left or right edge of
the screen give you some recently open
applications and the ability to adjust
your sound and visual to displays
orientation on-the-fly
there's even a multi window feature that
lets you run up to four apps side by
side if you really want to get some work
done and it seems to work with a decent
selection of apps overall though the
skin feels clunky and seems to take more
away from the android experience than it
adds to it if you're looking to get one
for yourself it's available now for $350
directly from Lenovo it comes in two
colors gold and silver and if you're
inside the United States you're looking
at Wi-Fi only but there are some markets
that have a 3G model available to them
but there you have it for the Lenovo
yoga tablet 10 HD plus
the built-in kickstand is what makes
this tablet unique and gives it a little
bit more versatility over the
competition
but the subpar display the mid-range
specs and Lenovo's clunky software is
what really holds this tablet back
making it not as good as it should be
but that is it for this review hopefully
