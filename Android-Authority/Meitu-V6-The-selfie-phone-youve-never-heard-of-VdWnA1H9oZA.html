everybody and I'm here in Hong Kong I've
been travelling around China for a bit
and since I'm out in Asia it's kind of
an opportunity to take a look at phones
that we normally would not get in the
u.s. because there are a lot of them out
here in Asia especially in China which
is kind of a closed market plenty of
phones there don't make it to the west
and I actually have one in my hands
right now actually it's in a case and
that's one of the features let's say of
the phone that it comes with this
leather pouch and the phone itself is
made with a leather backing this is the
May to v6 I can already tell it has an
interesting design and let's go around
the phone a little bit and see what kind
of design elements it actually has now
clearly this is a phone that you're not
really too used to seeing in today's
flagship game not only does it have a
design that kind of makes us think of
the virtu phones but it takes a leather
backing and gives it four different
colors this one in particular may not be
our favorite one but there are a few
other ones that look great but on the
bottom are 18 karat gold rivets the grip
is really nice because of that leather
backing but also because the phone is a
little bit tall but that's not
necessarily because of an 18 by 9 screen
instead you have just more bezel up top
and on the bottom not only because of
the dual 12 and 5 megapixel cameras on
the front which are the same as the ones
on the back but also because of a haptic
feedback home button on the bottom
flanked by two capacitive keys for back
in recent apps this is also where the
fingerprint reader is but face unlock is
available as well so as exciting as the
outside is unfortunately the internals
are looking a harder to get excited over
it uses a mediatek processor but it does
have 6 gigabytes of RAM and 128
gigabytes of on-board storage now for
somebody that takes a ton of pictures
that's gonna be pretty nice and then
there is a button on the right side
that's a little bit too high up to be
considered immediately as a dedicated
shutter button but it is a convenience
key and we think that in China it is
used to invoke a voice assistant but
that bun is actually really useful
because for people that are trying to
take selfies you're just able to easily
hit that button or if you're gonna take
a picture of yourself
using the rear cameras then you can do
that both of the cameras are 12 and 5
megapixels so on the reader you get that
speck and on the front you also get that
speck so you're supposed to be getting
really high quality selfies but the
reason why the selfies are such a big
deal on this phone is because of the app
so before we get into the crazy stuff
we'll talk about the native camera app
it uses the 12 and 5 megapixel combos on
either the back or the front to provide
some pretty great looking photos the
idea here is that the photos from the
rear all are the same quality as the
photos you would get on the front
especially for selfies there are a
number of different modes here that you
would expect from pretty much any other
device but there's one that I wanted to
highlight here called the movie mode
essentially adding black bars to the top
and bottom of your landscape photo it
gives a much more cinematic effect you
could use this in pretty much any mode
including the video mode so you can get
kind of like anamorphic video footage
but overall it is good for just
providing a more cinematic selfie for
those who want to have a more dramatic
shot now selfies are pretty important
everywhere but here in Asia beauty modes
are really important people tend to want
to have softer skin take away some of
the blemishes in my case it would take
away the freckles on my face which is
kind of one of my defining features but
for other people they want to have a
bigger eyes and just to be able to put
makeup on that they won't already have
on in real life now here comes the big
one and we want to know what you think
about this in the comments down below
again this application is actually
available in the Play Store the may to
makeup plus now may to start it off
making apps like this and then it kind
of blossomed into becoming a phone
manufacturer with these crazy looking
and kind of high-end phones with this
capability built-in makeup plus allows
you to take a picture within the app or
import one that you've already taken it
will find the face in the photo and then
it will apply all of its changes to it
there are a ton of different filters and
a ton of different makeup effects in
here and the all stem from a number of
different categories if you want to sort
of hone down to what kind of look you
want now to a guy like myself it's
obvious that this kind of thing is kind
of fun maybe a little bit ridiculous and
the fact that the app is so effective in
adding these makeup effects is kind of
incredible and that's all on top of the
fact that you can make your eyes bigger
you can smooth your skin out which means
that in my case my freckles were taken
out of the photo and you can even make
your
slimmer now these all would make you
look incredibly different compared to
the original photo you can see the
difference a little bit later showing
you what could be is the point of a
beauty mode but at least for me this
phone makes me hate myself what's crazy
about these features is that you can
actually make a photo look somewhat
natura as if you were actually wearing
the makeup take away the fact that you
can slim your face or remove the
blemishes on your face or make your eyes
incredibly big but just take the color
and the makeup for what it is and you
realize that a lot of these effects seem
practical even though they're completely
digital one feature in particular is the
fact that you can change your hair color
and you can change it not only to
different hues but also have a split
tone there where you can have your color
go from one color to the other in a
smooth gradient if people didn't know
any different they might actually think
I got my hair colored recently so I just
wanted to take a short look at this
phone the may to be six and it's not one
that I'm able to actually use back in
the US because it's only available in
China and Taiwan also this is the Taiwan
version which is the reason why there is
a Google Play Store and Google Play
services installed on here of course in
China that won't be the case but it's
nice to take a look at a phone that
shows us what phone design and also what
phone philosophy could be like in
different cultures they might want
different things and in Asia a great
camera experience especially when it
comes to the front-facing camera for
selfies is paramount and that's exactly
what made to is created with this luxury
looking phone even if it comes in at
eight hundred US dollars equivalent all
right so that's you pretty much do it
for this look at the may to v6 this is a
phone that out here in China and in
Taiwan it has a big cult following its
spokesperson is a Chinese actress singer
and model a megastar endorses this phone
so a lot of people are clamoring for it
necessary zone I wanted to give you guys
a look at it I wouldn't be able to take
a look at this phone which it would
never make it to the US market unless I
was here in Asia that's exactly where I
am and props and shouts out to Lisa
Rodriguez of gadget
for letting me take a look at her device
and being able to look at the beautify
mode and all of the makeup modes in the
app that you can actually get in the
Play Store keep it tuned to Android
authority for even more about this phone
about every other phone about every
flagship that we've seen plenty of them
have been out of China over the last
number of weeks so sound off in the
comments sections and then head over to
