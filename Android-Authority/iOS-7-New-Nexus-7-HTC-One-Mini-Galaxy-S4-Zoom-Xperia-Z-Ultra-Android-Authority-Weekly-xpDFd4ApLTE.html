authority what's going on everybody and
it's time for another dose of the week's
top Android news it's android authority
weekly we begin first with news that has
nothing to do with android or does it
Apple had its worldwide developers
conference this past week and unveiled
iOS 7 now iOS 7 looks like Android that
whole joke has been pretty played out by
now so we're not going to get into that
but there are a few cool features with
the new operating system iOS 7 is a
rehashing of Apple's mobile system that
now has a flat look and translucent
effects you can now go back by swiping
from the left pretty much anywhere in
the operating system a new control
center has been created to give you
quick access to a lot of different
settings and iTunes radio has just also
been announced so those are just a few
of the features that come with or are in
iOS 7 if you want to see all of them
head over to the written article that
you can find at android authority com
there is also going to be a link in the
description below and now we move right
back into Android and a bunch of rumors
regarding the new updated Nexus 7 one of
the first things that we learned about
the new Nexus 7 is that it probably
won't be a part of the affordable price
range a report from Taiwan is telling us
that it should be priced between 199 and
249 a squarely middle price range then
it was reported that the nexus 7 will
probably come with a 1920 x 1200
resolution screen coming in at 323 ppi
specifications that would make a
mid-range price seem a lot more
attractive and finally the Nexus 7 was
spotted on a FCC document dubbed the
Asus k double 08 this particular device
was listed as having the newest version
of jelly bean 4.3 and the Snapdragon s4
pro now whether or not we've actually
positively identified the new Nexus 7 is
still up for debate but all of the
information on this particular document
does coincide with our previous coverage
I guess we're just going to have to keep
our fingers crossed for that mid to late
july release date boom son and blinkfeed
might be getting miniaturized later this
year as all information points to the
existence of an HTC one mini a couple of
nameless informants pass along
information to
that the device should be on sale by
August of this year we then saw a
picture supposedly of it right next to
its bigger sibling we have no word
officially from HTC just yet but the
device will likely have a less powerful
version of the Snapdragon 600 and a 4.3
inch screen coming in at 720p resolution
now with the success of the HTC One
perhaps a miniaturized version will give
HTC yet another big boost and now we're
going to get a little camera crazy with
a couple of big announcements by Samsung
last week we told you about the galaxy
s4 active for rugged lifestyles but now
there is the galaxy s4 zoom for shutter
bugs the result is an overall beefier
filled with a big ol growth on the back
and that would be the 16 megapixel
camera capable of a ten times optical
zoom with apertures ranging from 3.1 to
6.3 it will retain all of the general
functionality you would expect from a
smartphone only with a 4.3 inch screen
and lesser overall specifications than
the original galaxy s4 no launch details
have been given just yet regarding the
galaxy s4 zoom but we can expect all
that information to come out at the
media press event Samsung is holding in
London and the camera news just keeps on
coming instead of a phone with a camera
smashed into it you kind of get the
other way around with this supposedly
new galaxy camera the next generation of
this line of cameras by Samsung
supposedly has been adopted into their
NX line of popular mirrorless cameras no
longer a point and shoot it could have
an interchangeable lens system
compatible with the amex line and pack a
20 point three megapixel aps-c sensor
leaked press images show a camera body
much like a DSLR with a big old touch
screen on the back that houses the
Android experience Samsung has said that
they will soon unveil a new galaxy
camera and this could be it now I've
always said that I've wanted to see
something like this but now I'm not too
sure do Josh come on we got to take
pictures of the bride and groom man what
are you doing hey would you wait I'm
crushing candies okay let's talk about
Sony in a number of press event invites
sony has been teasing the announcement
of a new six and a half inch device that
has gone by a few names the Xperia Z
you the Xperia Z ultra and to Gauri and
what is probably the first actual image
of the device an invite to an event in
paris on july four shows an
exceptionally tall Xperia device it
looks a lot like the Xperia Z that we
already know and love just a lot taller
since then we've been seeing more and
more images supposedly leaked of the
device but we weren't sure if this was
really the real deal that is until a
Taiwanese website released exclusive
information regarding the Xperia Z you
yes it will be called the zu and it will
be a monster of a phone packing a 2.2
gigahertz Snapdragon 800 processor
expandable memory and of course that six
and a half inch screen at 1080p
resolution it will also have supposedly
the ability to register any pen pencil
or similarly shaped object as a stylist
the official announcement will be made
at sony's jun 25th mobile event and
finally google seems to have gotten a
little loony in a new experiment coming
out of the ex lab the google hopes to
bring internet access to remote parts of
the world using a mesh network of
balloons yeah you heard that right
balloons the project is called loon and
features solar-powered balloons that
cruise at an altitude of 20 kilometers
now it is just an experiment still being
tested in New Zealand but if it does
work we could soon be saying that we
have true worldwide internet and so
