show is brought to you by ES file
explorer pro the pillow vogan ladies and
gentlemen I'm Joe Hindy the android
authority app guy and welcome back to
android apps weekly this is episode
number 120 let's get started as you have
no doubt heard by now star wars the
force awakens has had fairly stellar
reviews so far and the fan hype has been
unbelievable to celebrate the google
play store is currently offering the
movie for pre-order on google play as
well as the soundtrack which you can get
right now sure it's kind of silly to
pre-order digital goods that never run
out of stock but hey it's there if you
want it this last week rumors began to
surface that Google Hangouts was going
to lose SMS integration this is of
course bad news for people that use both
fats and hangouts and it's been reported
that Google will begin promoting their
SMS application instead google voice
users will still be able to text though
and the application itself will gain
other new features in a bizarre ruling
court officials in Brazil levied a
48-hour ban on whatsapp when they
refused to hand over user information
for a criminal drug trafficking
investigation the band has since been
lifted because it was ruled
unconstitutional that millions of
Brazilians could cut off from their
messaging services over something like
that Facebook has announced that they're
shutting down their photo syncing
service on January 10 2016 from that
moment on users can download a zip file
containing all of their photos or they
can get the Facebook moments application
which will continue to the photo syncing
goodness I guess they want moments to be
a competitor to Google photos and we'll
see how that goes to celebrate the
holiday season there is currently a game
sale going on in the Google Play Store
there are more than 35 games on sale
including most Square Enix games prune a
couple of Lego games xcom enemy within
and plenty more check out the list and
grab up some awesome games on the cheap
for even more Android apps and games
news updates and releases don't forget
to check out this week's newsletter
which is linked in the video description
below we had a ton of stuff this week
that we didn't have time for here and we
encourage you to check it out if you
want you can go to the written companion
which is also in the video description
below and subscribe to the newsletter to
get it sent to your email address every
single week alright folks let's take a
look at the apps and games that made a
big splash this week as usual if you
want to check any of these apps or game
we'll have those links for you in the
video description below pic Pell is a
new application that is kind of like
snapchat you and your friends take
pictures of things and those pictures
are used to create collages that are
then posted this process can be repeated
whenever the mood strikes it's a fun
concept in the app uses material design
which looks good unfortunately the
application only allows facebook login
and it's a little rough around the edges
but it's definitely something to keep an
eye on this last week Google announced
over a dozen new designer watch faces
that aim to give Android wear users a
little more class to their smartwatches
some of the designers include Ted Baker
Vivienne Tam adidas and plenty of others
every watch face is entirely free and
they all have their own unique looks and
features that are definitely worth
checking out especially if you're
getting a bit bored with your watch face
scribblenauts remix is one of the most
popular paid games on Android in its
heyday and scribblenauts unlimited aims
to continue that proud tradition it uses
a lot of the same mechanics from the
prior games such as allowing users to
type words out and have those things
actually appear at its core it's a
creative puzzle gamer you must create
things to solve puzzles it's a lot of
fun and contains a ton of content
microsoft apps is an application by
microsoft that shows you other Microsoft
apps this may seem a bit silly given
that you can simply search for these
applications but not everyone is as tech
savvy as some of us which means there is
a legitimate use for an application like
this especially with Microsoft's
unusually large app collection it's
simple to use and adheres to most of the
material design standards it's also
totally free Zeptolab has released the
latest version of cut the rope just in
time for Christmas much like its
predecessors it's totally free with no
in-app purchases and again revolves
around helping these small adorable
little monster solve puzzles it borrows
a lot of its mechanics and premise from
prior titles in the series but it does
include new elements such as
transformations boss levels and over 100
levels thanks again for watching
everybody but let's get down to some
serious business this week's Android
apps weekly show is sponsored by ES File
Explorer pro this is one of androids
oldest and most stable file managing
applications and includes a ton of
features including pretty much any file
management feature that you could ask
for along with cloud storage management
app management remote file management
archive management and tons of other
types of management's it's all so
wrapped up in material
design recently the developers also
released ES File Explorer pro which is
exactly the same as ES file explorer in
every way except you'll have expanded
theming options no advertising and a
promise from the developers to keep
being awesome I bought this a day it
came out long before they ever became a
sponsored because I actually do like
this application that much give the pro
version to go for yourself and show your
support for the android apps weekly show
