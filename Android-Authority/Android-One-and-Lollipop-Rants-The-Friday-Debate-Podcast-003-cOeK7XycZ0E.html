Friday debate podcast episode number
three discussing topics and android
every single week i am of course your
host Joshua Vergara what's going on
everybody and I'm joined by our usual
panel we have andrew grush who is also
the architect of the friday debate every
single week on android authority calm we
also have writer Jonathan Feist here and
our appt guy on YouTube Joseph Hindi
how's it going everybody hello Internet
hello nice as always we get together
every single week and talk about a
particular topic one that we post on
android thorny com on which a lot of our
writers give their thoughts upon and we
made it into a podcast form so we hope
you guys have been enjoying the podcast
thus far we are now in our third episode
officially since we did a pilot over in
at CES but last week we weren't able to
record because while not the least
reasons where I was in China covering a
media tour with Huawei which turned out
to be a pretty good time and you can see
those videos obviously I did some very
nice vlog style video so you can kind of
see our experience rather than just so
you know watch some canned videos they
were they really did a great job just
sort of bringing us out and we got to
see their canvas so thanks to huawei out
there but also it was super bowl sunday
on sunday and even though we planned on
postponing it until then unfortunately
we all opted for the bad food and
watching the game i wanted to pop this
question out there did you guys his team
win i watch hockey okay so I mean did
anybody watch any of you and I watched I
was really rooting for the particular
team I just think it's fun to watch
Superboy ok so you guys didn't really
put down like any bets or anything like
I knew call that one right like 500
bucks in a pool or something it was
amazing no I here's the thing I just
moved to Portland Oregon and you know
Seattle is kind of our rival especially
when it comes to the college leagues and
NFL of course is a different story they
have the big league team in Seattle so
that the kind of my team and so yes my
team lost yeah
I feel the exact same way that we don't
have to get into it but I do have to
just sort of echo everyone else's
frustration over what that last play was
I was like oh my god that was the worst
call in history well not history but but
in any case I just wanted to do a little
bit of housekeeping and checking in with
everybody of course you can find our
podcast all over the web so if you are
on YouTube right now watching where we
put it up for you guys as courtesy for
your ears what you can also do is find
us on all the different podcast channels
you can find us on iTunes on stitcher
I'm very close to final not using the
Soundcloud channel but of course you can
use the podcast aggregation applications
if you want to do it that way which is
one of the best ways to listen to the
Friday debate podcast actually so why
don't we go ahead and just jump into
this week's topic we're talking about
Android one and if you don't know what
that is we'll go ahead and give you a
brief primer on it but here is our
long-form version of the Friday debate
topic that we put up on our site and
we're talking about right now part of
the alert of Android one was that it
would bring faster almost Nexus like
updates to lower end phones promising an
affordable offering that would still
provide a decent Android experience with
the slow update to lollipop though and
the fact that the sales numbers are
reportedly not all that high is Android
one delivering on that promise can
Android one be a success or with so many
other affordable devices is it a largely
unnecessary program so we're going to be
discussing Android one its implications
on the market because they're supposed
to be low end phones but the first thing
I wanted to pose to everybody is we're
all obviously familiar with Android one
what it was supposed to be able to do
but for just a brief primer about where
it was supposed to be going and the
reason why maybe us here in the West
like in the u.s. don't really know too
much about it how about brushy once you
give a sort of your brief overview of
Android one okay so Android one was
never really meant for the West markets
it was meant as a way to bring uh cheap
phones to the next you know a billion or
whatever is five billion whatever they
quote people and it was it wasn't so
much about cheap phones it was about
creating competitively priced devices
that had faster updates I mean you have
these low end phones in india china you
know throughout Asia basically
and Africa as well anyway they tend to
be stuck with the same version of
Android for their entire life cycle and
so the idea was to create something that
was maintained by Google Google will
provide the updates and it would create
basically we get phones that had that
Nexus like experience stock Android and
we wouldn't be stuck with these old
versions so it would provide the best
experience possible instead of people
getting you know something that
basically never changes yeah definitely
and the the whole idea that I mean
updates are always a hot button topic
for anybody that uses an Android device
and I think right bright before our
podcast we had a little bit of a
pre-show thing going on we were talking
about if all of our devices are on
lollipop at this point obviously we're
using anywhere between mid to high-end
phones but just putting this out there
like let's say feisty the devices that
you use um are you on lollipop on the
vast majority of them at least no not at
all majority are still jellybean 442 oh
wow jellybean okay well remember he uses
a lot of low-end devices huh hey
jellybean I'm sorry kid yeah okay that's
not a parrot ation here sorry yeah I was
about to say everyone raised her
eyebrows were like wait a minute you uh
you know Moto G though right so your
Moto G should be on lolly yes the Moto G
is up to date and of course that right
now is my daily driver but the remaining
I'm a remainder of the phones are
running older OS okay which arguably
isn't a bad thing considering all the
bugs for lollipop but that's a
conversation for another podcast yeah
yeah basically how about you Joe what
are you rocking and are they all on
lollipop um I have four devices
currently including my watch and yeah
all of my devices are running lollipop
but that's only because I mean you know
I have a nexus in LA and video shield
tablet which got official updates but my
note 3 is rooted so I got you know i'm
running a i think it's a note for port
right now hmm and it's it's actually
pretty terrible but it's functional so
i'm gonna keep it yeah see so that's the
whole idea behind making something that
an ecosystem i should say like android
one where you will be getting those
those updates people all around the
world supposedly will be able to get
there there
hands on the true Android experience no
matter what the price bracket might be
you but you know like where she said
we're not really looking at android one
as a real competitor to like the super
low-end devices that are super
affordable let's put it that way but you
know I look through some of the Android
one devices that are available in there
are quite a few of them Gruchy correct
me if I'm wrong but the actually one of
the main marketing points of Android one
was that its devices we're going to
provide features that actually a lot of
high-end phones don't have like dual sim
microSD card slot and you know various
uh oh like quad core processing even
though that's pretty much ubiquitous at
this point but I guess my question that
i'm going to ask is is android one a
program that is made to be successful or
is it really just google sort of trying
to extend the reach even farther um on
my end of things like I think it is I
think it's supposed to be that thing
where you know Google is extending their
reach the problem is that it I know that
it's not available in a lot of places
yet everywhere I keep reading you know
it's it's set to launch in these other
places sometime soon but really it's
like last time I checked it's only
available in a couple of countries like
India and I think there's one or two
more there's in India Bangladesh Nepal
Sri Lanka Indonesia and I think one of
the models launched or maybe two in the
UK are those like that's about it are
they actually available there because
are they set to launch their so well uh
Indonesia is still launching um but the
others i think all have it i believe i
don't quote me on that one hundred
percent but i believe i know that one of
the main markets that it was supposed to
come out and was like say India and yeah
an India does have I think they only
have like a couple though right exactly
and one of the reasons why we're talking
about is because a recent story came out
that Android one is supposed to come out
in Indonesia very soon and on top of all
of that you know the the other one the
rumored not rumored but like the the
small leak I should say is that these
devices are the first ones to get an
update to lollipop 25.1 which was why
Android one was also the rest back into
the into the limelight a little bit
because well everyone's kind of
following the lollipop train
right now okay but this is the thing
though the sales numbers haven't really
been all that great what is it I'm
questioning it's not necessarily a
question for the panel but I'm just sort
of questioning whether or not Google
knew what the strategy was supposed to
be for Android one and you know in sochi
in developing markets developing
countries where you should be able to
sort of get a really big foot in the
door with affordable phones if they're
not selling very well could that
possibly be because we have enough other
phones on the market that are affordable
anyway well you know these things take
time to you know to develop I mean I'm
sure that you know Android one was
something that was in development in
Google's you know brain machine or
whatever they're brainstorming it for a
couple of years and you know when you
look at 2013 you know there weren't a
lot of super cheap smartphones I think
like what the Moto X hadn't come out yet
you know the Moto G hadn't come out yet
there wasn't a whole lot going on in the
you know and the mid-range and low range
phones you know outside of having phones
that had super old operating systems
that never got updated so like hey let's
do this thing Android one and then by
the time they came out with it now we
have the moto x the 1+1 the Moto G you
know and all these other super
affordable phones essentially everybody
beat Google to the punch here and I
think that's I thought the whole reason
obviously but I think that's at least a
little bit part of it is it you know
they're already you know low-cost phones
that are getting updates pretty
frequently and you know so what's the
point of having Android one if these
other phones exist well i mean the the
question that comes to mind how low is
low enough then when it comes to the
price because we're talking about phones
like though you mentioned the 1+1 the
mode of wax even the Moto G let's put
the mono gene that makes which are still
let's say at best sub $200 phones if
price really does matter to people that
say in developing markets then oh yeah I
mean know what I mean like the crush you
go ahead well you know it's we have to
realize to us it's like we don't see a
lot like if we look at a foamer like oh
that's 150 that's 200 that's 250 to us
that's they're all pretty close to the
same price but you got to realize that
some of these countries are only making
like 80 or 90 bucks a month you know and
so when you're making that little bit of
money and obviously I might be wrong on
their number but I've heard that quota
before for certain parts of Asia um
anyway when you're making you know sub a
hundred dollars a month you bet your you
bet your you know but I did yeah i'm
trying not because uh $55 you know
there's phone to go as low as $55 $35
two hundred dollars doesn't seem like a
big deal to us but they are for them you
know that's a huge deal and i could
understand that if i was only you know
and so i think two people in the western
markets were like oh there's not a huge
difference between you know a phone
that's 180 iphone that's 200 but if you
were making a lot less i think that
twenty dollars would make a huge
difference to you you know yeah I do i
do agree with that and you know it's
this is this is a mark this is a
particular system that android that nat
that's re not android that google put
out android one that might might kind of
go over the heads of a lot of people in
the west which is kind of the reason why
i was excited to talk about it um feisty
do you like your thoughts on Android one
is there do you think that there's a
reason why Android one is not really
catching on is it really just a time
game or did end did Google get get
swooped on the whole idea of making
really affordable phones well exactly
what you say it is part of it no doubt
by all means there's other phones out
there other phone makers that are doing
the same kind of thing now I've never
had the chance to touch one of these
phones I wonder if in this case
inexpensive means cheap and certainly
that's a debate for any phone from any
maker but you know that's that's one of
my concerns where you know if they're
all so to speak cheap devices then maybe
that twenty dollars makes that huge
difference but what I really think it
comes down to is availability even here
in the Western market you know when the
Nexus line of devices started launching
you really couldn't you couldn't go into
the verizon the attn star and pick out a
Nexus device you had to know what you're
looking for go to the google play store
if android one was in every store at
every carrier
I think it might be uh you know a little
bit better off mmm and now that that
brings you to another idea I did think
about that that maybe the e-commerce
channel for Android one might be what
might be hindering it because now far be
it for me to say that I know how
carriers operate in places like
Indonesia or India but I would imagine
having been to you know that side of the
world at least that you know that the
smartphone has become rather ubiquitous
and there's so much choice in the market
now that it does come down to
availability I do agree with you on that
but if an Android one phone is supposed
to be let's say because I'm looking at
the website right now and I what one
comment I do want to make is that the
Android one website android com / 10 if
the program is supposed to be geared
towards developing countries the website
sure doesn't make it look like it's
supposed to be I don't know if you guys
have ever looked at the website but it's
it's incredibly colorful and they're all
these they're all these pictures on the
website that show people using these
particular phones and places where you
know you could probably afford something
more and I don't know just kind of irked
me a little bit but I will say this the
first time that the day that Android one
was announced obviously was at Google
i/o this past June I was super excited
for it I thought that it was a great way
of consolidating yeah I thought it was a
great way of consolidating what's
supposed to be a market that everyone in
the world it's almost like the internet
now you know the Internet is almost like
a right for people to have it's becoming
that ubiquitous and if smartphones are
going to be the main way that people use
it which it is in places in the east and
this is a great way to have an entry
point for it but it's a little
disheartening to hear that's not really
going in that route krushi when you when
it was a when it was announced what were
you looking forward to in terms of
Android one did you really think it was
going to live up to his promise I really
did and I felt that that the idea was
great um I still feel the idea is great
and I don't think it's dead i think
we're talking about like it's dead and i
don't think it is um the problem is that
there was big ambitions with the idea of
bringing it but
it hasn't lived up to it I think there's
a few reasons that like we haven't
touched on for one thing now I'm just
speaking from the few i've seen but
let's take for instance that in India
there's the carbon Sparkle five I think
it's called and the micromax canvas a
one and then there's a spice dream I
can't remember exactly what it is anyway
there's remember the spice 1 yeah yeah
there's there's three phones there that
i just mentioned they all have 4.5 inch
displays with 854 x 480 resolution they
all have the same exact one point three
gigahertz quad-core mediatek chip they
all have one gigabyte of RAM they all
have the same storage everything is the
exact same they're boring even the
aesthetics are pretty much right on with
one another and so hell if I have three
devices that look the same and then I
have something like a yaw me or I have a
you know even the micromax's that are
not from this line yeah i'm gonna go
with something else because he's a
boring you know its stock android and
i'm a stock android advocate but you
know there's nothing that defines these
phones is separate other than the brand
so if you're a fan of carbon or your fan
of micromax but that's about it you know
there's no difference and i think that's
part of the failing is that I don't
think the Android one phones we've seen
are worth getting excited about for
customers and then the fact that
lollipop took so long doesn't help
because that's supposed to be the big
draw is that hey these are similar price
to what you can get here but they also
have the newest version of Android well
no they don't because Andrew lollipops
now set from one sold and it's not here
you know and so I feel like I still
think that Android one it's a it's a
great concept I just feel like we had
Dave run into some hiccups but i do
believe google could still turn around
and i think Android one could still be a
big program do you might disagree with
you just a little bitch oh by all means
perfect up now the concept i like it but
I don't think it's dead on now my how I
remember the google i/o was basically
they were on stage they said we're going
to give the manufacturers a blueprint
for a device mm-hmm which is pretty much
why we have the exact same devices for
each one because they're just following
Google's
friend now that being said that that
says to me that Google's blueprint the
Google's overall overview of this
project is a little bit off and I like
it and I and I think it can go places
but right now I think it's a little bit
on and i don't know i don't disagree
with you actually i said that i think
there's potential and i still do but
yeah definitely now that said they gave
a blueprint but they gave specifics they
said hey you can use this you can use
that it's not like you have to use the
exact same chip they gave a range that
they wanted to get within a price range
but everyone just decided to do the same
cookie cutter approach and so that's not
totally google's fault but yeah i think
that the program was a little limited in
the way it was approached and I have a
theory I could be totally wrong but I
think that the fact that we're seeing
5.1 arrived on you know on Android one
speaks to the fact that even like advice
to know you mentioned you know elsewhere
when we've had conversations and stuff
anyway you've mentioned that you felt
that lollipops a little bit you know
sluggish let's put it that way um and I
think that that was part of the reason
is i think that in its current form with
its bugs and with everything that they
just felt it couldn't be on there and so
they needed to make some changes and I
think that's why we're seeing 5.1 launch
with Android one is that it's hopefully
address some of those issues like I said
that's just speculating but you know
adding to that speculation I wonder if
5.1 is sadly an offshoot of for king of
android or 5.2 and that stream will
continue on for you know the bigger the
flagship devices and the 5.1 will go to
the lower end well or slower lower you
know smaller hardware de but there's
already talk about testing of the 5.1
update on Nexus so I don't think that's
the case I don't think google would do
that anymore you know they did that
whack in the day with like honeycomb but
I think we're past that huh Nico hope so
has anyone used honeycomb that I it was
a it was interest I still have a
functioning logitech revue that runs
honeycomb
whoa logitech revue holy crap yeah well
I mean we mentioned honeycomb and you
know we can I know immediately what
comes to mind of the different devices
that used to rock that kind of stuff I
mean I'm on I'm on a android like 1.6
right now using the g one from my
flashback series I don't know I thought
that lollipop knowing that it's supposed
to be compatible with let's say lower
end devices both do supposed to maybe it
was a wishful thinking for me to think
that that I could easily put that on a
classic android phone no I i'm using a
phone right now that could be considered
what today's android one phones are and
it still has the android market like i
can I can't even use the freaking play
store to get the essential applications
that I need what if you know nostalgia
is is not a very big thing in the tech
world if you you know it's always about
the cutting edge it's not really about
nostalgia and going back to your roots
but you know those that that's that's
one of the caveats I have when it comes
to lollipop is that you know it probably
should have had it available for if
there are versions of it I would work on
any device pretty much then you know
maybe make that make that reach like
just so far that even classic phones
could be used so we're mentioning a lot
here that lollipop has some issues and
maybe that's something that we will
actually dive into in a little bit here
actually actually think I want to sort
of hash that out I want to hear so what
your guys thoughts are on that but I
thought came to mind could it be that
these companies are creating the cookie
cutter devices for Android one or even
the the really cheap ones that they're
making that are not part of Android one
could it be that they're making the
cookie cutter versions and just sort of
their sort of focusing on the bottom
line because there's probably not a huge
amount of profit to be had in a phone
that lets say is only about a hundred
dollars am I am I out of line by saying
that no I mean there they are in fact
businesses and do in fact care about the
bottom line so I mean you're probably
right on there at least to an extent but
I'm sure that there's probably something
that's been worked out between you know
these companies in Google or it's like
you guys build the hardware you know
we'll do the software and you know if
something goes wrong you know I
think that Google's like paying these
you know these companies for every phone
that they make but you know I'm sure
that there's something there to help I
encourage them to do to continue to do
stuff like this ya know I think the
biggest problem like feisty said earlier
was its distribution really I mean you
just you can't find these things
anywhere except for what on the internet
right like these aren't being sold in
stores and in carrier stores and stuff
like that yeah I don't believe I mean it
though but I don't know much about that
aspect to be honest well the thing is
I've spoken to a lot of uh of Indian
people who you know who use Android and
a lot of them don't have things like
credit cards and can't make purchases
online and uh because that they use that
and this is a whole different
conversation but I'm gonna bring up for
just a moment but that's that's the
reason that they give for pirating
applications like when the monument
valley numbers came out there like oh
yeah no we pirated the out of this
because we don't have credit cards to
pay for it you know week we're not
allowed to buy it so you know but we
still want to play anyway so you know a
part of me thinks like you know if the
main way of distribution is online and
you know a lot of people in that in
those countries don't have credit cards
don't have debit cards and you know
don't have the internet then how are
they supposed to order these damn things
yeah you know this is an incredible
point and I'd like I mentioned earlier a
lot of the people in let's say Eastern
developing countries their access to the
Internet is primarily through a
smartphone so if you already own a smart
exactly to get to the internet are you
gonna get in why would you get Android
one because you pretty much you got your
foot in the door and uh you know the
obviously there's going to be a huge
socio-economic discussion that could be
had when it comes to this which is which
is why I brought up the fact that the
Android one website looks like I mean
come on there's this there's this
picture of this asian dude walking
through what looks like a farmers market
you know he's dressed to the nines he
looks like a you know a well dressed
person and right next to it is a dude in
like what i can only say is like a ralph
lauren polo shirt I'm like what is going
on here like I think that one of the
failures of Android one is the fact that
it doesn't necessarily realize that
you can't really use money to market
something that's supposed to help people
who have no money and you know if this
is supposed to be some sort of a
grassroots not well maybe not grassroots
cuz we're talking about Google here but
if this is supposed to be something that
developing countries supposed to take
advantage of it doesn't really seem like
it from from the advertisements from the
marketing not not not in the slightest
you don't would be a really great idea
and I can't remember which we talked
about it on this podcast a couple of
weeks ago or a few weeks ago maybe but
um what was the only weeks we had a
Akobo but uh who was the company that
had the like the refrigerator trucks
full of technology and they're driving
around and selling it to people that saw
something that they're getting ready to
do with they haven't done it yet but
they're given to do that with um project
ara that's the kind of stuff they need
to be doing with Android one they need
to be you know putting an ice cream
truck full of Android one devices and
literally drive it up and down the
street and try to sell it to people like
ice cube videos like Josh said it's a
you know it's supposed to be a
grassroots movement and how you're going
to get to a grassroots movement if they
don't have the internet yet you know you
have to bring it to them yeah and in
order for them to buy it and you know I
mean the people that already have credit
cards and already have enough money to
buy a smartphone and have the internet I
mean those people are gonna go the extra
hundred bucks and get something a little
bit better than this I mean let's face
it that's what they're doing already
yeah exactly and you gotta go to the
people you know I have this image in my
head of Google's basically saying okay
we created this like you guys said
feisty and grouchy a blueprint for you
guys to create these phones go have at
it and then they wash their hands of the
whole thing um that's you know it's
almost it's almost upsetting me just a
little bit because i love the
democratization of information of the
internet and i love that you know at
Google i/o I was drinking the kool-aid I
thought oh man google is not the evil
company that sometimes we say they are
they really are trying to help people
and now exactly right they work
sometimes say I'm sorry i cracked me up
like I
to think that this was a focus this was
actually a pretty substantial part of
google i/o to think that this was a big
part of it and that it had a focus it
just kind of irks me a little bit that
first of all the way that they're
presenting it if this is going to be the
main way of finding it android com / 1
i'm not really convinced and even then
like we're saying the sales seem to be
and in the down portion right now and
that's just a little bit setting i guess
to me but I'm talking existential water
I'm not focused I've been eyes I've been
sitting here trying to do some google
searching it doesn't look like they have
done some relationships with the
carriers in India and stuff so there's a
little um it's primarily online when I
can see like Flipkart and you know
amazon and stuff but they do have some
carrier relationships so they've tried
to do it a little but you know it's a
lot it's a different landscape I don't
know I don't feel like Google's
necessarily let us let let down the
program I just feel it's been our off to
a rough start I'm not giving up on it
yet I think it still has a lot of
potential and Google's sometimes is that
way it takes him a little while to get
into the group with stuff you know so I
don't think it's necessarily down now by
any means yet yeah no I mean Google is
always about these long-form things you
guys remember uh you know google play
music you know started out it wasn't
really all that great you just upload
some songs and stream them and now you
can go online buy a bunch of songs and
have them not stream because it's
freakin broken still so you know but
they're still working on it and that's
the important thing yeah I suppose on
some level though it's just that that's
the way Google operates right we we have
we are all basically beta test say
you're partially in beta stage yeah yeah
how all the things are for better or
worse you know I know in some ways I
don't mind that but you know with a
program like this yeah i agree with you
it's a little a little upsetting to
think that it had the potential to be a
big deal but then again you're seeing
all these other companies that are still
producing good handsets so i think that
the goal is still being reached even if
android one's not the one doing it you
know yeah so good one I think is
responsible for making this a success is
this Google's Project do they own this
or is it up to the manufacturers or they
just have a guideline to follow I think
it's supposed to be pretty 5050 was the
idea but well we would you say
manufacturers in Google but we also have
carrier
is involved oh yeah and that always
makes things more complicated but yes
yeah retailers distribution I mean yeah
well I mean the air oh sorry good I said
there's a lot there yeah other logistics
there's so many channels to go through
you know and and I suppose you know
giving them the benefit of the doubt
giving a multi-billion dollar company
then the benefit of the doubt now they
can only mark it so much I mean below
those pick those ridiculous pictures I
was talking about earlier are you know
broken apart versions of an example of
an Android one phone that has all of
these features that supposedly are going
to be really great for people who can
afford it or the fact that it should be
affordable for a lot of people so
looking at some of these other devices
that are also affordable now obviously
we did mention already earlier that how
low is low enough obviously for us
something like that's two hundred
dollars or even the one plus one which
is three hundred forty nine dollars
constitutes affordable to us but if
Android one is having here front and
rear cameras quad-core processor micro
SD card all day battery well okay
everyone says that but uh huh LOL yeah
dual SIM cards well what would
constitute an affordable phone to you is
it let's look at this from another
perspective what if android one is a way
of telling people that you don't have to
compromise for the features that should
become standard for a phone feisty
you're using a moto g would you say the
Moto G is the bare minimum when it comes
to what could be an affordable phone
that has the features you want sort of
yes now I've got my gripes with this
phone and let's start off with the
processor I mean the Snapdragon 400 you
know I spent 200 to get this google play
edition version and it's getting a
Snapdragon 400 device right now can be
done for thirty dollars out there so i
don't know i'm not sure where the
processor market is at right now there's
no to me there's no solid successor
there's the Snapdragon 410 but you know
we're not really seeing it out there
yeah I did so I'm not sure I think it
really comes down to that we're anything
below a snapdragon for
under you know the Snapdragon 200
devices and what not tell you i just i
don't think they have enough juice even
now this moto g it's recently updated to
5.0 point2 and i notice it the slow down
i am now feeling that the 400 is not
strong enough snapdragon 400 we've seen
in a few devices i'm looking i'm doing
my own little research on the side just
just a sort of bolster this it looks to
me here that Android one phones from the
various partnerships that they have
primarily use MediaTek processor yeah
there's that there's been talks about
using a like there's partnerships with
qualcomm it just hasn't happened yet
yeah i think we're gonna see the second
generation android one phones are gonna
be a lot different to the first gen i
think getting it out there they started
with pretty base phones and I'm hoping
that the second gym will really see what
the program's made of wood they call
that Android too I think it'll still be
Android one but it's google they're
gonna call it android 1.1 yeah coming
soon now i have done i do have to say
like you on we're on cheating we're
mentioning a bare minimum and specs and
the snapdragon 400 on KitKat does great
lollipops supposed to be even better for
that for lower end and so I really do
sincerely think bugs are in the way and
I think that 5.1 and later updates will
fix that but anyway talking about
Snapdragon 400 um now face says you know
almost two hundred dollars but is that
the bare minimum for a Snapdragon 400
device absolutely not um for instance
Yami's up what how do they pronounce it
as a red me or redeem shred me is that
the line it usually it's me if his mi
yes all right redmond the redmi 1s for
exit for example is the equivalent of a
hundred dollars in india and it has a
snapdragon 400 in it it has one gigabyte
of ram has an eight gig it has an
8-megapixel camera you know it has I
believe it has 80 device the storage let
me see um I'm gonna look it up uh yeah
eight gigabytes of storage you know and
so it's a hundred bucks and so there's
companies that can do it that can
produce a high-end device I think this
probably speaks to why Android one isn't
doing well as they're selling me
tech device when yeah me and stuff is
able to produce the vice with the
Snapdragon 400 for the same price I mean
kind of a no-brainer I'm gonna go with
the yummy yeah and speaking from
experience mediatek processors are
they're not they're not terrible by any
means but they just don't kind of hold a
candle to snap dragons and even I am
we're talking yeah if we're talking
about entry level media tech phones lot
of processors i should say oh my
goodness I who's to know exactly what
kind of experience you're gonna get on
that wow I mean would with the sorry not
to cut in but with like that no no no I
do want to say with red me like the
redmi 1s you are getting jelly bean and
that was supposed to be the point of
Android one is you're getting the newest
version whereas with that well obviously
it's running that me you I or whatever
they call it but it's based on jelly
bean and so you're not getting the
newest version of Android and that was
the point of Android one but to me if I
was if I was low on money and I was in
one of these countries and you gave me
two phones that were one hundred dollars
one had a crappy not to be mean but a
crappy MediaTek processor but it had
KitKat and it was about rating upgrade a
lollipop and the other has jelly bean
but it is running as faster processor
it's more optimized as a better camera
you know what I'm not I'm not gonna be
petty about the android version i'm
gonna go with the device that gives me
more power for the money you know well i
love that you said that because I I
expected our conversation to move into
you know the the scales you know which
one are you going to pick if you had an
Android one phone or something else that
had a little bit more to offer feisty
what would that be for you they are you
a software monger in the sense that you
really want the latest one or will the
actual specs let's say really sway you
in the other direction not to say that I
don't want the latest OS but i
definitely look at the hardware before
the software and a software again plays
a part and it always should but I mean
hardware theoretically can be upgraded
with new software and these devices it's
not like an old pc where you can rip it
out put in new round now you get what
you pay for and that's it there's no
upgrading these phones so hardware is
always what I look at enter
well yes that too our podcast will
always go full service how about you Joe
um am goodness gracious this is such a
complicated answer because you know we
were talking about the minimum specs a
minute ago and you know everyone's like
oh yeah you know I can deal with you
know one gigabyte of RAM and Snapdragon
400 I'm looking at my current apps usage
and I just flashed this from today right
so i just reinstalled everything and all
that's totally clean install and i'm
using 715 megabytes of ram just for apps
that's not including my system with
including the system it's 1.2 gigabytes
so a 1 gigabyte phone with the apps that
i run is like impossible for me i would
never be able to use it because
everything would be slowing down because
of lack of ram so like you know for me
personally like my minimum is 2
gigabytes and you know if i'm looking at
something that's you know lots and lots
of updates or you know hardware i'm
going hardware because hardware can
always you know like feisty said you can
always upgrade hardware with better
software eventually as long as you buy
it from a company that doesn't suck HTC
i'm just kidding just kidding i love it
i'm buying an HTC One m9 I'm allowed to
say mean things right now but uh well
you know the uh it's a it's a
complicated subject I don't really have
my thoughts totally in line yet for this
and so I'm gonna shut up now well I mean
that's yes the thing this is the reason
why at least maybe brushy and I were
hoping that Android one would be able to
consolidate these issues and it doesn't
seem like that it would it so far has
been able to who knows what would happen
two years down the road if all of these
companies who are always looking for the
bottom line will actually allow
themselves to go below that line and say
okay let's make a phone that is not only
got the bare minimums and we mean bare
minimums like two gigabytes of RAM like
Joe was saying but we're also going to
make it affordable it seemed up until
Android one happened and maybe even
until now if we're talking about Android
one not necessary succeeding it was sort
of a pipe dream and for people in
developing countries I mean I'm Filipino
and there are i have so many family
members and people that i know in the
teams who are stuck with particular
types of phones and you know even my
father who goes back to the Philippines
every now and then he brings back phones
he pretty much brings back my hand me
downs to give to people in the
Philippines so they can have a more
upgraded experience because otherwise
they wouldn't have anything the the
Philippines are still called the texting
capital the world because that's what
everyone can do not everyone has a
smartphone not everyone can get on
whatsapp or whatever the hot messaging
app is nowadays but you know that's
that's why this this topic sort of hits
home for me is because I want to see the
democratization and the overall
availability of a program like this
because I I know firsthand you know from
from personal experience what it can be
like for people who have that trouble to
get a phone like this so only owing it
to maybe a little bit agreed from some
companies or maybe Google's reaches not
as far as we thought you know the
Android one program is something that we
have to still wait and see where it's
going to go I wanted to actually brushy
I wanted to can I put you on the spot
right now a little bit I guess with the
other growth we I think mostly from you
during our conversation now we've heard
quite a few a little bit of shade
against lollipop like Kim can we get a
small crush he ran on like what's wrong
with lollipop because oh um well grab a
seat kids I don't want to be I'm sorry
probably honestly I would say I really
honestly thought you're about to do it
oh hell no to go I'm just trying to kind
of gather my thoughts here I mean I have
lollipop um on my Nexus 5 uh and on my
Nexus 7 and on my Nexus 4 and on my
Nexus 10 I have a lot of Nexus anyway I
have it um and I'm considering going
back to KitKat whoa um I think lollipop
has a lot of potential people are
probably getting ready to bring out the
pitchforks right now they're gonna be
listening to this um I'm a Google fan I
think lollipop has a lot of potential I
just think it's very but it's very buggy
whether or not that's justified since
it's such a big
is probably another conversation uh but
ultimately it's just that I kind of feel
like with the fact that we this time
around had a testing phase where we were
able to try out the phone and report our
bugs you know I I downloaded it right
away on my Nexus 5 you know what back
before it was what it was just you know
android l I felt like we were gonna get
in a version of Android that was pretty
stable from the get-go and it hasn't
been um the battery life promises on my
device saliste hasn't been what it's
supposed to be uh I run into a lot of
random glitches and shutdowns and I'm
not going to say that I represent
everyone and you might have the lollipop
advice right now and be like I've had no
problems at all and that's fine just my
own personal experience I just feel like
there was a lot of bugs there's been
battery bugs that are draining bugs
there's when Wi-Fi bugs there's been all
sorts of and it just feels like we
should have had this figured out before
now um eventually when it gets all
solved in Android point five point
whatever 5.1 whatever is there I'll
probably be very happy valley pop I like
material design um it's a big change
it's bright it's colorful I'm cool with
it uh uh you know and there's a lot of
good changes with lollipop but at the
same time if you are still on KitKat
don't necessarily be in a rush to get
all the pop eventually it's gonna be
awesome but don't be like I wish you had
lollipop because you may not necessarily
be thrilled what you get I mean there's
still a lot that's not there I think
lolipop it's a lot of potential but it's
not polished to where I want it to be um
and the analyst people are probably mad
at me now for saying it but um
personally I just feel like lollipop has
a lot of potential but it hasn't all
Richard and what do you guys think I
mean do you feel like a lollipop is
everything it's cracked up to be right
now I I I have full confidence before I
hand it over I have full confidence
Google will get it there I I absolutely
have confidence that Google will get it
there I don't think a lollipop will be a
disaster it's not gonna be the windows 8
of of the FAA windows I like it actually
I like it was rarely stay but everyone
hates a grenade I mean I windows 8 and
Roy a dragon age Oh
now no I everyone hates Windows 8 um
except for a small subsection of people
yeah I had no problem with it either
jail but I don't like a lollipop will be
remembered as a bad version it's what
I'm saying but right now it's not quite
there in my opinion what do you guys
think is all about what you think it
should be right now um I think the low
end up first of all you're absolutely
right lollipop it is buggy is all hell
like I have three devices of lollipop
and the one that's rooted the one with
the broken warranty running a rum from a
phone that was released a year later is
the most stable device in my in my
possession right now like you know my
Nvidia shield tablet is a great device
but it has audio bugs that keep you know
like you'll be listening something
you'll be like oh hello the ER on and
then keep going uh my Nexus 5 sometimes
connects to my Wi-Fi and sometimes it
doesn't it's really up to it sometimes I
sweet talking a little bit like aw come
on baby please just for a little bit i
really need to download this app to test
it i'll buy you some flowers and stuff
I'd never buy it flowers which is
probably why it's mad but um all my
listeners have a very colorful idea of
what Joe does it this way yeah you don't
want to know it gets crazy I I wish I
would them I woo them to try to get them
to work and they don't work sometimes
it's you know it like brushy I've
considered going back to KitKat on a
number of occasions but given the nature
of my work I pretty much got to stay
with the with the latest because that's
what people want to see but no um it it
speaks to it thanks a lot crush yeah
thanks for that that chat there totally
derailed me garlic bread and phones my
two favorite things anyways um if we
were talking about it earlier the always
in beta thing that pretty much everybody
who's a Google fan goes through you know
everything is always in beta all the
time you know and we see that effect on
more than just Android you know you have
a Chrome browser that eats up a bunch of
ram you know you have google play music
which doesn't stream sometimes and now
it's getting to the point where they're
so rapid fire with these releases every
single year with android that
I think it's just starting to catch up
to him a little bit you know there it's
getting harder and harder for them to
rebase and redo all of this stuff and
come out with an operating system that
has no bugs cuz you look at Windows 10
when it windows 8 come out like 23 years
ago something like that yeah yeah and
Windows 10 is even come out tonight
that's for years for years that Windows
has to work out the bugs and get these
and get this stuff in order before it
gets released and you know Google is due
out for another version of Android and
freaking nine months like are you
kidding me like it's it's starting to
get to a point where I think you know
Google and people in general just need
to calm the hell down a little bit and
she's like you know the way I look at
software's you know does it work great
it's doing what it's supposed to do why
are you in a rush to change that and it
is just it feels like you know it's
getting to a point where I don't even
want to update any more I feel like I'm
being forced to update because otherwise
I'm gonna get left in the dust and
that's that's my little micro rants on a
on Android and just upgrading to quickly
I think that's the real problem is just
they had 365 days to do it and they
needed more time okay um the reason why
I love that you guys were going at
length about this because I'm gonna
bring it around in a second but I want
to hear from feisty thoughts on lollipop
and do you have any problems with it the
way that it seems joe and grocery have
you know it's just some coffee not
caveats but some reservations about it I
hate it I'm sorry hey no no no the pups
awesome eventually yeah lollipop but I
have found a few minor things but you
know in the UI in the front end I would
specifically call out this priority mode
on the audio settings it's an awesome
option but why is it the default it
should be a back-end thing that you can
enable and then just allow allow us to
hit the power or the volume rocker and
turn the phone down and off but anyways
that's being fixed in 5.1 by the way
just just throwing it out there x2
little too late you can always wait for
thursday my android customization series
and if i cover these things and how to
get by it no
honestly though the biggest thing for me
i think is art the Android runtime the
thing that has been bothering me with
the the phone specifically the Moto G I
got a nexus 9 here it's been great the
Moto G I'm finding that it's ram
utilization is a blessing and a curse
all at the same time yes it's loading
apps faster however I'm glad you guys
brought up windows it's doing the old
microsoft thing where it's just slowly
bleeding and sucking up more and more
ram once every week and a half or so i
have to restart the device I hate having
to restart my device Oh boohoo that few
seconds just ends your world see it goes
beyond that I am a huge helium backup
user or carbon whatever you want if you
remember from the old days yeah come on
so when you hook this guy up to your PC
you get everything all set up you can
run your backups and restores I don't
like to have to hook it up all the time
again that 30 seconds right but every
time I restart the device i have to
reconfigure these things and redo all
this stuff and I don't like didn't have
to before is my point I did not have to
on KitKat feist have to now up for some
clarification do you mean like reboot
the device or do you mean like total
like wipe the device re yeah factory
just reboot power toggle okay which
again it's a minor thing but and that is
my largest complaint with with lollipop
so I guess in the long run we're doing
pretty good it's okay if that's the
complaint okay well personally speaking
I should give my answer on this actually
two is uh I really enjoy lollipop I
think the the aesthetic upgrade was
something that was very truly needed as
much as I love hollow material design is
farm beyond a better way of presenting
Android absolutely uh and I'm also one
of those people I've said this a couple
times before and I haven't gotten much
reaction to it yet but I'm also one of
those people who had the best way for me
to describe it is I'm a very tolerant
technology user if there are some minor
issues i'll say minor because it's my
scope if there's some issues with the
way that i'm using my
android I will find a way around it and
and use up that like two hours to figure
out you know is there a way for me to
optimize a bed roars or something I can
do to alleviate it blah blah blah so
really when I run into any like little
things I call Joe a what did I call you
that other time I stutter not see i
think is why I was um that I thought the
cut that kind stuff doesn't really
bother me where if I see a little bit of
a hiccup here and there the only real
problem that I've had on my Moto X at
least what the what lollipop does that
count the calendar app which I don't use
keeps force closing on me and YouTube
even when Moses on me all the time by
the way that's probably while you're
using it yes oh wow uh-huh a Google+ uh
reboots my phone for me yeah that
happened to me tues that happened to me
too I'm lollipop see I by far do not get
these types of problems on the phones
that I use and that the worst thing
that's happened to me on lollipop is
that the calendar just every now and
then no matter what I'm doing because I
almost never touch the calendar app
it'll just pop up a little window that
says sorry calendar has stopped or
whatever it says on there that's really
all I get um and I can't really begin to
even tell you why that is the case with
me but I actually have had a very great
time well with lollipop that's kind of
why I mentioned that I'm not
representing everyone because there's a
lot of people who probably have to know
of these none of these issues that Joe
and myself have ran into and that's
great and honestly if I reloaded
lollipop who knows maybe I would maybe
we better next time around you know
sometimes sometimes just stuff happens
while you're installing and just you
know that has happened to me before
where I've reloaded and it's been just
fine I've thought about doing that to
see you know and so you know I know with
windows and whatnot in any operating
system sometimes just stuff goes wrong
and sometimes just you know starting it
all over again is enough you know
reloading everything from scratch is
enough and you know maybe I should
consider that before I get too angry but
like I've had a a volume issue where now
my nexus 5 isn't as high and who knows
maybe my speaker is going out but it
happened it coincided with the update 25
point 0 point too so I'm guessing it's a
software issue and I just haven't got
around to reloading to see and so that
was probably the main reason why I'm oh
no wait about lollipop is that I
actually still use the phone unlike most
people to call people
um like my mom make my mom and people
like that you know family members and so
yes I call my mom she lives three hours
away I have to call everyone so I'll see
how she's doing um anyway and so when
I'm making a call I can barely hear so I
have to use a bluetooth you know
bluetooth headset look like a dbag all
the time running around with the
Bluetooth and so which I hate Bluetooth
and so I guess that's the reason why I'm
annoyed by it it's just little stuff
like that and like I said I I have
nothing against lollipops design I have
nothing against all the new api's I
think lollipop is the biggest change the
android seen since ice cream sandwich
absolutely but you know then again when
I ice cream sandwich showed up there's a
lot of issues to wasn't there you know
so maybe that's just growing pain yeah
probably growing pains why not I I agree
with you though grocery if I had that
problem where I had to use a bluetooth
headset all the time which I actually do
use I don't use like the one year piece
one so I use like full on headphones and
I have a microphone on them if I had to
use that just to talk to somebody I'd
probably be pissed off too so I don't
blame you at all yeah and like I said
maybe my phone but I guess that would be
a whole nother issue if my nexus 5 which
is only it's not even I didn't get it
right when it came out so it's only
about a year old and so maybe my Nexus 5
you know speakers going out but if
that's the issue that I'm even more
annoyed yeah perhaps oh ok well here's
where I wanted to bring it full circle
been there are problems with lollipop
and not the least of which is the fact
that it's not necessarily available for
even lower end phones right now if we're
talking about Android one but bringing
it back to the whole Android one thing
if these are problems we're having with
lollipop on higher end phones is it
justified for Android want to use it as
a main marketing strategy not really
yeah that's a really good question um I
don't know if it's not as if it's not a
sustainable or even stable that's a
stable operating system and and it's
supposed to be their platform to create
a democratization of smartphones is that
really something they should be doing if
these are the problems were having in
the high-end market yeah um well like
bro she said you know lollipop
has a lot of potential in there they are
gonna fix all of these stupid little
problems eventually I got a feeling that
it's gonna be like jelly bean where it's
gonna be you know they're already 5.1 is
already lolly there up so we're probably
have a 5.2 lollipop but diluted I drop
out there for a sec no no I thought I
heard a noise over from grouchy also but
it's okay oh yeah but uh yeah no that's
right glad but I said I'm sorry maybe I
dropped out install was that anyone
quiet no no no we're fine guys but yeah
go for it technical difficulties oh I
totally lost my train of thought guys
I'm sorry a potential or potential with
Android one and potential with a
lollipop that is oh yeah I don't got
good google is gonna fix these problems
and when they do fix these problems it's
gonna be fine you know it'll work better
I actually noticed I have a nexus 7 2012
right did I actually gave it to my
roommates girlfriends kid because I yeah
that's right that that that's the new
demographic for tablets that barely were
kids oh man that sounded bad I'm sorry
anyways um but i had android 5.0 point 0
on it and it was garbage like the nexus
7 2012 was totally unusable a period
like I couldn't even open and read a
comic book likes flipping the pages took
2 seconds and it was just like I wanted
to destroy the thing and then I put 5.0
point2 on there and a lot of those
problems were alleviated not all of them
but enough of them to where I felt
comfortable giving the tablet to a kid
and I know that the kid would probably
still be able to enjoy it even if I
couldn't um it's just you know like
where she said it's gonna be one of
those things where it's gonna take some
time and they got to get all this fixed
I just kind of wish you know like just
one year I'd like for Google to go you
know what guys we're not doing an
Android released this year we're gonna
do something really big next year we
want to work on it make sure it's
perfect no we need to change is now Joe
quiet I know neither changes now hashtag
Nexus Warriors google google can't
necessarily be hideo kojima so i want
this i don't know i want six point oh
where is it it's getting to a point
where you hear these things over and
over again and it's just like it maybe
it's just time to stop with the with the
Nexus
dile yearly updates thing like I just
don't think it's working anymore no
you're bad I I I do think I'm honestly
those these are going to be my favorite
moments on the podcast is why uh you
know one of the golden rules of
podcasting user should never be any dead
air but I actually would actually love
it I would love it every time I bring up
a question and you guys like all I got
think about that for a second because I
think that's those are the questions
that we we hope to be able to to to to
answer you know that we get answers to
because that's the whole premise behind
Android one is the fact that you'll get
the latest the latest operating system
um but we've heard from three people
here or actually to Brushy and Joe that
you're thinking of going back to kick
head although he is no I'm sticking out
all day I just I've had those moments
I'm gonna probably reload lollipop on my
Nexus 5 to see how it goes and if it's
still ok but I think we'll get there I
think 5.1 will be a solution hopefully
but that brings me you know you're
talking about you know Android one and
whether or not uh lollipop should be on
there I think that's why it's not um you
know I have to give Google credit there
I think that they realized that it was
going to be a subpar experience out of
the box and so they waited and I think
that's why it's launching in Indonesia
with 5.1 and that's why Android one is
going to be the first to see 5.1 is
because I think that's they address the
issues and I think that Android one will
hopefully start becoming a bigger deal
after this I think that you know and so
I I have faith in Google I do I mean we
probably sounds like the most anti
google android podcast ever but no I
have absolute faith that Google get it
right and i think that they had the
hindsight to realize you know if we
throw a lollipop on here and it's just
been it's laggy and buggy on a low-end
phone people are gonna hate Android one
so we're better off to take a little
flack for waiting you know that's so
funny if it works on our our crappiest
phones that has got to work on that on
the better phone yeah well that's what
I'm thinking is that they if they
optimized it for Android one if they if
android 5.1 is is optimized for Android
one then theoretically it should work
fine for everything else because it's if
it can work well
on low end it should work well on
everything else with a little bit of
work unless it has a Tegra 3 in it
because then it won't work at all trust
me boo how about you feisty do you think
that you know going to all the things we
said about lollipop is it is is it
justified that Android one is using s
one of its main marketing strategies
before I answer that I have to thank Joe
for bringing up the nexus 7 i'm sticking
with mine man i'm going to try and get
this to work now i will say that the
lollipop update on this old 2012 nexus 7
yes changing apps is a terrible
experience but once I'm inside a nap
especially a heavier game the it is
running much better so your was it your
roommates sister girlfriends nice now I
hate the time they are something yeah so
go into the question sorry um there is
always that expectation when you upgrade
an OS that it's going to be an
improvement to the system to your device
so certainly waiting and holding off for
this you know proper 5.1 I say proper
we'll see what happens was a great move
that's absolutely what they needed to do
so Android one I'm with the other guys
absolutely I have high hopes for the
program I think it has a future assuming
they can looping back to the beginning
get their marketing and distribution
figured out okay yeah I I have hopes for
it I am kind of on the fence after
having been one of those people that was
like oh my god my relatives and the
Philippines are gonna benefit from this
so much and then you know we get this
kind of news from it that's why I guess
that's why I was a little bit
impassioned during our discussions
because you know I really want to see
stuff like this succeed I want to see I
want to see developing countries develop
you know and you know if Google was
going to be at the forefront of
providing smartphones to the masses who
otherwise born to be able to afford the
experiences that we are blessed to have
here in the West then I you know I'm all
for it so I have high hopes as well but
I wanted to explore all the issues as
why and if lollipop was one of them we
were going to put it to task and I'm
glad that we were able to do that so
with that I think that we've thoroughly
been able to go through this particular
