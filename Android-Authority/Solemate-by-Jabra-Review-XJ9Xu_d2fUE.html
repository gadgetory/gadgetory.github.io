Youngberg with Android Authority comm
today we're gonna be reviewing the
soulmate manufactured by Jabra this is a
Bluetooth speaker system that has a lot
of other connectivity options and you're
gonna find yourself really pleased if
you decide to buy it so let's go ahead
and check it out this is the front
facing grille of the Jabra soulmate here
we've got two tweeters as you can see
through the grille and then right here
we've got a subwoofer it almost looks
like it could be a one inch subwoofer so
it has some good bass and it's really
weighted the bass is very heavy and you
can feel it in your hands when the
device plays and the highs and mids are
great too because of the tweeters
anyways on the side here we'll go ahead
and check it out we do have our power
options and stuff got our on/off switch
with our bluetooth pairing mode as well
we've got two notification lights
including Bluetooth and battery
notification you get a 3.5 inch
headphone in and then we have a micro
USB in let's go ahead and pop it on we
do the audio confirmation when the
device turns on as well as a nice
confirmation that the Bluetooth is
seeking and we also have our battery
notification as you can see it turned
green and it'll turn red if the
battery's low whatnot any waste a pair
of Bluetooth we go ahead and slide this
up until we get the audio confirmation
which is pretty cool yet it could be a
little overpowering for some with the
guys voice and all then anyways on top
we have our phone controls this accesses
our speakerphone functionality as well
as can answer a call or end one and then
we have our volume up and volume down of
course now the jabber also has this nice
little lanyard built in with these
rivets into the side and it also comes
with a nice waterproof bag because this
is marketed for a lot of the outdoorsy
types this also has a lithium ion
battery and it only weighs 610 grams
which is nice and heavy for a Bluetooth
speaker system it makes it so it's not
going to vibrate around when it's on the
table and you're not gonna actually have
the bass move this unit undesirably so
anyways let's go ahead and test out a
song we have our 3.5 millimeter
headphone
cable artillery cable actually in the
bottom of the unit stored away in this
cool little design like that we simply
just pull it out and that's what I'm
going to use I'm not going to use the
Bluetooth just for the ease of access
and sound quality too so go ahead and
plug that in we've got our galaxy s3
here
it sounds really nice turn it up
so it does sound great we've got a nice
heavy bass coming out of there
the bass is really really heavy you can
feel it in your hands and you know you
can feel it in the table but this isn't
going to vibrate on the table because of
a nice grip on bottom great style
dynamics gets really loud too this can
get up to 120 decibels which is pretty
impressive that's very very loud of
course all of this is dust resistant
it's water resistant as well it's a nice
rubber on there so you're going to be
able to enjoy your music if you are in a
tight situation out in the forest or
something if you're camping whatnot and
stuff like that the voice guidance for
all of the features like we had the
confirmation for the bluetooth pairing
voice is going to tell you step by step
all the stuff you need to do let's say
if we wanted to battery full get a
status on our battery retails for about
$200 you can find it at Best Buy jabber
comm amazon.com two speakers one
subwoofer a nice little plethora of
controls here but not too overloaded and
it's easy to use guys so if you guys
want a great sound quality speaker check
out the soul mate from Jabra thank you
