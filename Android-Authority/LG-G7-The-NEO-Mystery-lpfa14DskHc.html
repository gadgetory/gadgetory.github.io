much that LG said that they were gonna
do away with the name LG G 7 altogether
and call it the LG G spot but then they
thought I M not gonna feel right
honestly that's at least partly true but
first I want to talk about a giveaway
something I want to give to you used to
do giveaways all the time but I want to
give more away than just a t-shirt I
want to give away at Google home Mini
all you have to do is answer a simple
question who loses their phone in
today's show the name of one individual
all you have to do is watch carefully
for the whole show and find out who
loses their phone at the end I'll tell
you how you can answer the question ok
so back to LG news coz LG buddy you're
confusing me you see earlier this year
the CEO of LG mobile claimed that they
were gonna do away with their current
flagship plans to create something to
better distinguish themselves from their
competitors they don't want to make a
phone that just looked like everyone
else's then the usually reliable Evan
blast
added to that story by saying that LG
would release another flagship phone in
June of 2018 codenamed Judi with me so
far
good cuz now it gets a little bit funky
I say funky because look what showed up
this past week at their Mobile World
Congress an lg device called the LG G 7
neo under the hood the g7 neo features
the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor up
to six gigabytes of RAM up to 128
gigabytes of storage and a 3000 milliamp
hour battery we presume the phone runs
Android Oreo out of the box but no
official word yet there's also no
official word on the g7 neo itself the
phone seemingly came out of nowhere and
is pretty much an enigma to all of us so
what's really going on here is this just
a backdoor way in to promote their
actual flagship phone the LG G seven neo
or is that just a prototype that are
never actually gonna sell and the real
phone is coming in June we don't know
it's clear as mud what do you think
alright so have you figured it out who
lost their phone if you have the answer
