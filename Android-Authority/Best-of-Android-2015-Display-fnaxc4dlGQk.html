Authority and a question a lot a lot of
people always ask is what is the best
Android smartphone to buy so welcome to
best of Android 2015 where we dive deep
and get extremely technical and in this
particular video we're gonna be focusing
on a main component of a smart phone
that makes a smart phone great and that
is the display so which smartphone out
there has the best display well that's
what we're about to find out explain
before we get started the devices that
we use to test this worthy blackberry
Prive the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 the
Motorola Droid turbo 2 the Nexus 6p the
LG v10
and the Sony Xperia z5 premium so you
have a combination of AMOLED panels and
LCD panels in this particular test the
equipment that we use to quantify our
data and measure the screens overall
brightness and color accuracy where the
x-rite display Pro spectrophotometer the
spectra Kyle color checker and the
mobile forge mobile app if you want to
know more about the equipment and
software used to measure these displays
make sure to check out the link down
below to the written companion piece or
the card up here where we can get a lot
more in depth and we can in this
particular video so the testing for this
was divided into three parts each
smartphone was configured to the same
settings to standardize testing so
brightness was set to 10% 50% and then a
hundred percent of the full color gamut
to measure the average display error so
basically the way that it works is the
mobileforge application would output
colors on the smartphone display and the
i1 display pro spectrophotometer would
read those colors outputted by the
smartphone screen color checker that
uses that data captured by the Iowan
display Pro and compares it to the color
output from the software to measure the
average display error they lowered the
display error the more accurate the
colors outputted by the smartphone are
so what we found in part 1 of this test
is that 100% brightness the Xperia z5
premium is the brightest display of all
at 620 nets with the BlackBerry Prive
and second and the note 5 and third the
Moto X force is the most accurate with
the least Maxon delta error and least
average Delta error and the Xperia z5
premium is the worst at this test at
full brightness at 50% brightness the z5
premium is signa
the only darker at a hundred nine
minutes 620 nits at full brightness
which is a very drastic drop while the
motox force is again the most color
accurate the LCD devices are
considerably darker at 10% than the
AMOLED based devices and at 10%
brightness the BlackBerry Prive is also
the most accurate overall with the
lowest average Delta error in the second
part of this test we ran a calibrated
test so we calibrated each display to
250 minutes and we then rent another
test with the same exact setup as before
with the only exception of the colors
were white and the main six srgb colors
like red blue green yellow
etc and in the case of LCD devices black
was also thrown into the mix calibrating
the display provided for some very
interesting results as the difference in
brightness at various levels is
basically nullified by calibrating a
brightness level across every individual
smartphone the Moto X force has the
lowest average and Max Delta errors for
a hundred cent of the colors including
white the LGB 10 is the most accurate
for calibrated colors but is let down by
the white performance which is
indicative of LCD technology itself and
not necessarily the phone and despite
being perceived as a disadvantage thanks
to this LCD display the LGB 10 has the
second lowest average Delta error and
the other LCD device the Xperia z5
premium has a much higher average Delta
error the note 5 over saturates on the
greens and blues which sort of makes
sense because TouchWiz is predominantly
based on greens and blues the note 5s
display also looks the most pleasing to
the eye as most Samsung devices do but
has the highest average display color
error and finally in our last test we
wanted to see how bright each smartphone
gets at different brightness levels to
test this we ran a white only test again
using the same exact setup as before
with auto brightness disabled the Xperia
z5 premium definitely has the brightest
display which you can see from this
graph but it also has the sharpest jump
in brightness from 75 percent at 296
nits to a hundred percent at 629 nits
it's also the darkest at 0% and the z5
premium handles brightness in a very
strange way where you need to set the
display brightness between 75% and 8
hundred percent to get a usable
brightness other devices like the
BlackBerry Prayer
the Nexus 6p and the droid turbo - all
have a very uniform increase in
brightness
whereas LCD devices like the v10 have a
very non-uniform increase in brightness
which you can see from the curve in
their graphs whereas the AMOLED displays
have a much more linear and direct
increase in brightness so the overall
analysis is that LCD based devices are
consistently accurate with the high
present colors but are let down by the
white error which is more indicative of
the LCD display itself and not so much
these smartphones that are utilizing
them the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 is not
technically the most accurate display
but appears to be the most pleasing to
the eye and the BlackBerry Prive out
performance a galaxy note 5 across all
these tests despite using a Samsung
AMOLED panel the Motorola Droid turbo 2
is the most color accurate display but
it's not very bright which doesn't show
off the true color potential of the
display devices such as the LGB 10 and
Xperia z5 premium would be exceptional
with an AMOLED panel especially if these
OEMs can buck the AMOLED trend of over
saturating on a hundred cent colors but
that's pretty much gonna do it for this
video guys so hopefully you enjoyed it
and found it helpful and if you want to
find out more about this particular
display test make sure to check out the
written component which will be linked
either down below or up here in a card
where we can cover a whole lot more than
we can in this video but if you enjoyed
