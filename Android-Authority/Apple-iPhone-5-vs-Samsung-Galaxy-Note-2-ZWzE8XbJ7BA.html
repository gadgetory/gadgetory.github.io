today we're going to be taking a closer
look at the brand new iPhone 5 versus
the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 both are fresh
on the market and features the latest
generation of Android 4.1 jelly bean and
we have iOS 6 here on the left
obviously Android devices have become
extremely popular due to their
customisable nature and this device is
no exception
whereas with an Apple iOS device we are
somewhat limited to basically what is
nothing more than a simple app drawer
similar notifications can be found on
both devices
but basically what really makes them
different is that we're looking at a
4-inch screen here with an 11 36 by 640
resolution versus a 5.5 inch 1280 by 720
panel so 4 inches versus 5.5 obviously
the iPhone affords the user
significantly better one-handed
operation one-handed typing and things
of that nature making it a very
pocketable and portable device it is
extremely fluid iOS is a really polished
operating system hundreds of thousands
of apps it was the leader initially but
many people consider Android to be a
more advanced and more customizable
operating system though for people that
prefer simplicity and some better
software integration iOS and iTunes does
afford the user a more simplistic and
controlled or walled garden type
approach while whereas with Android if
we wanted to customize certain different
things like the sizing of apps or
widgets move them around we are capable
of doing that
additional differences aside from size
include the fact that the Galaxy Note
obviously has the S Pen which enables
the user to create notes and to do
doodling to capture screenshots and to
do other things of a more creative
nature otherwise on the rear both
feature 8 megapixel cameras capable of
1080p video capture 30 frames a second
or extremely high quality stills
particularly in bright light we really
have to hand it through Apple the the
new image sensor that they've
incorporated is substantially better at
low-light situations than the iPhone 4s
and this essentially contains the
similar same camera that was in the
samsung galaxy
three and a slightly improved version
over what was in galaxy s2 otherwise the
display technology on both differs we
have an IPS LCD here on the iPhone it is
really really good at accurate color
reproduction but the AMOLED display on
the galaxy note 2 is also extremely good
as we can see here just bringing up
videos we have really really rich vivid
color spectrum but for some it might be
a little too saturated obviously in
terms of one-handed portability you
really do need to incorporate the usage
of two hands when it comes to typing or
just overall usage of the device itself
but we can see that both are extremely
polished and fluid obviously web
browsing here is finally on par with
what we would i OS and apple device
owners have had for quite some time this
is the latest version of Android Android
4.1 the only other device on the market
to currently have that is obviously the
Galaxy Nexus which is a Nexus device
that gets updates directly from google
otherwise we have a beautiful sort of
exhort on the edge titanium gray the
devices construction is primarily
plastic with a little bit of metal
hidden underneath the exterior housing
otherwise we have a two point excuse me
a 1.9 megapixel camera on the front here
for the Galaxy Note and with the Apple
iPhone we have a 1.3 both are capable of
HD or 720p video capture for Skype or
FaceTime of the equivalent obviously in
Apple iOS but yeah the iOS operating
system obviously is very basic so for
those looking for something a little
more simple something more portable and
potentially more durable due to as high
quality construction maybe this is the
device to get you can't help me now so
this is just a closer look at the Galaxy
Note 2 versus the iPhone 5 both are
obviously completely different products
different operating systems from
different manufacturers but we thought
you guys would be curious to know just
in terms of their size will let you
judge for yourself but obviously they
are substantially different this one
being from a phablet category a category
pioneered by Samsung with the original
Galaxy Note and this is obviously the
most convenient size being at four
inches you still have access to the
whole screen from one hand so here we
are taking a closer look at the
benchmarks of the Apple iPhone 5
the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 both are
extremely powerful containing the latest
generation processing technologies they
do contain reference designs from armed
Apple actually licensed it and created
their own a6 processor it is clocked at
1.3 gigahertz whereas the Galaxy Note 2
is clocked at 1.6 gigahertz so let's run
the benchmarks this is both Geekbench 2
and let's see how they do this is the
dual-core versus a quad-core this is the
2 gigabytes of RAM for the Galaxy Note 2
and we have one gigabyte around for the
iPhone android do 2 is highly
customizable nature does run higher in
terms of RAM consumption pretty much for
all high-end devices now if 2 gigabytes
is going to be the standard all right so
the iPhone finish first so we have 1624
for the iPhone versus 1962 for the
Galaxy Note 2 so for running one
benchmark is synthetic benchmark mind
you the Galaxy Note 2 does have more
processing power in terms of the raw
numbers where does it really punch well
the memory is more efficient on the
iPhone which makes sense because they
prioritize the GUI so that it runs
absolutely fluid at all times so it
likely contains faster memory for the
galaxy note though the floating-point in
terms of how quickly can process
calculations on the fly is going to be
at 31 1 6 vs 2 1 1 4 for the iPhone so
the Galaxy Note 2 wins there and also
yeah either way both are extremely fluid
fast devices just roping up a web
browser here for example we can see
obviously iPhone runs extremely fluid
and the Galaxy Note 2 is no slouch Eldar
I would say that they are almost
completely identical actually obviously
some minor GUI differences in terms of
being able to pinch out a little bit so
that's the benchmark I would say that
they're on par in terms of running
something let's say like a camera for
example let's just bring it up really
quickly okay it's really hard to do this
together we just have the s-pen from the
galaxy note here so let's try and focus
and see which one can capture quicker
okay so it looks like the Galaxy Note 2
is actually faster capturing in terms of
the clarity let's just see
no this one okay so it looks like the
iPhone actually it was capable of
capturing although it was slower the
iPhone was capable of capturing more
accurate higher resolution pictures even
though it was slower we'll run a couple
more tests on the camera in the next one
just to see how it does but basically
both are extremely powerful Samsung
Galaxy Note 2 has a little high
resolution at 1280 by 720 versus 11:36
by 640 so it does have to calculate a
bit more on the fly but and also we have
widgets and stuff and a whole bunch more
going on so yeah that's the benchmarks
of the Galaxy Note 2 versus Apple iPhone
5 so my name is Ursula cuvee we're here
with Android authority we're taking a
closer look at the Galaxy Note 2 versus
the Apple iPhone 5 let us know what you
think of the devices below and don't
