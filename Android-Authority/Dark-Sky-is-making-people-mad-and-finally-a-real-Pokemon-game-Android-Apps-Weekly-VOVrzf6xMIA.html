Hindy the android authority app guy and
this is the 140th episode of the android
apps weekly show let's get started the
ES file explorer released perhaps its
most horrible update ever that claims to
charge your device twenty percent faster
instead it hijacks your lockscreen puts
advertising on it and because it's
hogwash it doesn't actually charge a
device any faster if you use ES file
explorer you may want to start thinking
about finding alternatives because the
app is more bloat than function at this
point microsoft announced this week that
the Sun will soon be setting for sunrise
calendar according to an official posted
developers are busy working on outlook
and they don't have time to update the
app anymore so they're shutting it down
which kind of sucks for anyone
interested this probably isn't going to
happen to swiftkey at least not for a
long time this war of mine was our pick
for the best android game released in
2015 and now it's going to be a board
game the idea was put on Kickstarter
this week and has already racked up more
than three times its goal and it's hit
all of its stretch goals too it looks
quite complex and it should mirror the
experience of the game rather well you
can find it on Kickstarter right now the
creators of siri have been working on
another AI assistant and this one is
called viv in its short demonstration at
TechCrunch Disrupt it had a very
impressive showing allowing the
presenter to do things like send money
buy flowers and order an uber driver in
under two minutes it's very impressive
and it should be platform agnostic which
means it'll come to Android eventually a
developer over on reddit created a way
to play old school Virtual Boy games
using your Android device a popular
emulator called retroarch and Google
cardboard it's a little complicated to
get it all to work but it does actually
work pretty well and includes some extra
features like changing the color from
red to grayscale along with others for
even more Android apps and games news
releases and updates check out this
week's newsletter which is linked in the
video description below there we have a
bunch of stuff that we didn't have the
spaceport here if you'd like you can
sign up for the newsletter using the
forming the written companion which is
also linked in the video description
below and we'll send it to you every
Sunday or you can pick up the android
authority app for even faster apps news
ok folks is take a look at the absent
game
it made a big splash this week as usual
if you want to check out any of these
apps or games for yourself we'll have
those links for you in the video
description below beam came out last
week to generally favorable reviews but
I didn't cover it because I wanted to
see what it was like first perhaps the
best way to describe beam as if you took
the act of creating reaction videos on
YouTube and created a social network out
of its that social network would be
called beam otherwise it's not too much
different from other multimedia sharing
sites like Instagram or vine except you
can't edit anything before you share it
it just kind of happens and it's
definitely interesting bejeweled stars
is the latest match 3 game in the
popular bejeweled series this one has
the same basic mechanics as prior
incarnations except for this time pieces
of the board move around which
periodically changes which shapes are
where this adds a little extra challenge
and can occasionally even save you if
you're stuck it also comes with
leaderboards power-ups mini missions and
more to keep things interesting it is a
freemium game through and through but
it's not all that bad dark sky is the
latest hit weather application to hit
the google play store although we're not
sure how long it's going to be a hit the
application had great success on iOS and
it works pretty well on Android however
a lot of people are upset that the
application is a subscription service on
Android while it's a pay wants
application on iOS the developers claim
that the yearly subscription results in
a lower upfront cost but I think they're
missing the point on why everyone is mad
anyway it's free to download and it is
actually pretty cool if you want to try
it out for yourself after what seems
like forever there is an actual for real
pokemon game available on android it's a
trading card game where you collect
pokemon cards build decks and dual
people from all over the world it
follows the same basic premise as most
other monster or card collecting
freemium games except instead of
collecting monsters that kind of look
like pokemon you're actually collecting
pokemon it's suffering from some release
date bugs but those will be cleared up
over time it's free to download right
now fallout 4 live wallpaper is you
guessed it a live wallpaper themed like
fallout 4 it was released by Nvidia but
it should work on most devices and it
features a scene with a bunch of bulk
boy bobbleheads that will not move and
wiggle based on how you move your device
or swipe your home screen it's nothing
overly ridiculous but it's a nice touch
for fans of the series it's entirely
free with no in-app
if you want to try it out and you'll get
additional features if you happen to be
rocking a Tegra k1 tablets and that
about does it for this video folks if
you want to keep watching we'll have
chases latest video linked up there on
the screen and in the video description
below don't forget to sign up for that
newsletter so you can keep up with the
latest app news and remember to keep it
