Android authority you're watching our
video review of the Mizzou Pro 6 plus if
you recall last year's Pro 6 this phone
should look pretty similar since it's
pretty much just a larger version of
that it's an all metal unibody as you
can see it's both beautiful and
ergonomic it's also made of softer metal
than most other metal phones so it has a
very nice feel in the hand that also
means that it's quite slippery though so
you may want to consider a case
regardless the craftsmanship here is
impressive musa states that the body
assembly process alone takes 30 steps
and 150 hours to complete and that
amount of effort definitely pays off
it's the keen attention to detail that
really counts and makes this a high-end
design at a mid-range price we also
really enjoy mazes em touch navigation
system instead of the three key layout
that many of us are used to the process
plus has a single tactile key that you
tap to go back and press to go home and
you just swipe up from other side to
access the redesigned slimy six
multitasking menu this redesigned binew
replaces the horizontal cards view with
a vertical screens view which makes it
easier to close that once you no longer
have to change swiping direction the
front key also serves as a fast and
accurate fingerprint reader it's not as
fast as some other phones like the 1
plus 3t but it's still pretty fast
thanks to fly musics you can also use
the fingerprint reader for a password
vault to lock apps and access privacy or
guest modes being able to access each
mode with different fingerprints is cool
and we like the idea of having a second
space the pro 6 plus redeemed its name
with a 5.7 inch quad HD Super AMOLED
display it's a considerable improvement
from the pro 6 and it's one of the best
displays that you can find at this price
colors are punchy not too oversaturated
the contrast is excellent and sunlight
readability is decent the display makes
everything from reading articles to
watching television shows an absolute
pleasure the slightly larger size also
helps everything feel more immersive
meizu has implemented 3d press
technology with the pro 6 plus which
works very much like Apple's 3d touch
it only works with select meizu apps
though so it's not terribly useful
day-to-day under the hood we have a
Samsung Exynos 88-90 octa-core processor
which has been used in devices like the
Galaxy s7 the base metal of the pro 6
plus is under clocked at 2.0 gigahertz
however so if you want performance more
similar to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 1
you'll need to pay a bit more for the
higher-end model which is clocked at 2.3
gigahertz Mesa sent us a base model
which didn't do too well in benchmarks
but performed absolutely fine in
everyday use we're sure that the 4
gigabytes of lpddr4 ram new FS 2.0
storage also helped with that too
importantly mesa makes up for where the
base model lacks and hardware capability
with special software optimization with
slime e6 mezzo is introducing one mind
AI which learns user habits to better
manage memory and decrease predicted app
load time as expected the pro 6 plus is
an unlocked
dual tomorrow unfortunately though it
won't work with 4G LTE in the United
States
well not intended for the US market this
is something to keep in mind if you live
in or travel to the US as being limited
to 3G is a pretty big drawback another
drawback for global users is that
although the hardware does include
support for NFC and a heartrate monitor
both of these features were disabled by
the global software at the time of
producing this review these should be
switched on soon with a software update
though the internal speaker on the side
of the pro fix+ is pretty good it's loud
enough for general use but if it
distorted at higher volumes what's more
significant is the hi-fi audio setup
there's a 32-bit DAC and amp and yes the
pro 6 plus still includes a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack amazing pro 6
plus is powered by a 3400 milliamp hour
battery we noticed a significant
improvement in standby usage after
upgrading to a beta version of fly me 6
we were only averaging around 3 and a
half hours of screen on time with fly me
5 but after upgrading to fly me 6 beta
we were getting around 6 hours of screen
on time a bit of a disclaimer though
these tests were conducted over 80s
HSPA+ network instead of a proper LTE
network so the numbers are presumably a
bit inflated when you need to charge
the pro six plus you can do so with the
M charge 60-watt fast charging when
using the stock charger we were able to
go from zero to 50 percent in 30 minutes
and to 100% in one hour that's pretty
fast but the proprietary technology
means that charger selection is limited
the cameras on the meizu pro 6 + 2 look
promising on paper there's a sony IMX
386 12 megapixel f 2.0 rear camera with
laser autofocus for access oh is in a
dual tone LED flash in practice the rear
camera performs quite well - general
color reproduction is excellent not too
oversaturated but still pretty punchy we
did notice some processing issues with
bright reds but that's not unusual at
this price if you take a closer look
images are sharp and detailed displays a
lower megapixel count dynamic range is
great - the camera balances the
highlights and shadows and most shots
very well allowing for more realistic
photos as expected it's all short and
low-light situations
images our software colors become muted
and digital noise is noticeable you do
have to keep in mind the price though
you can't really get much better than
this unless you want to consider
something more expensive like the Google
pixel XL the front facing five megapixel
F 2.0 camera performs about as well as
expected and we like how beauty mode
doesn't overdo it with a skin softening
you can record 4k video at 30fps
with the meizu pro 6 plus but actual
video quality is only about average
Michigan Rose gave the phones Oh is
quite the test as you can see you can
quickly access the camera by double
pressing the home button even when the
phone is locked maybe even refine the
built-in camera app for climene 6 and it
now offers an even better shooting
experience the key selling point of the
pro 6 plus is the soft worker sure it
ships with android 6.0.1 marshmallow but
it's mazes slimy skin that really makes
the experience unique put simply Nathan
slimy 6 may just be the best Android
skin available to date I personally even
preferred over stock Android which may
sound surprising but hear me out the
clean design performance enhancing AI
innovative features and overall polish
just make this phone software a pleasure
to use Mesa has redesigned fly musics to
be more colorful and
folder you can see this everywhere you
look from the various screens of the
security app to the fun animations
implemented throughout the system
there's also a bunch of little features
that Mesa has developed for fly me six
which I've never seen before let alone
in stock Android take the customizable
important not important notification
split for example you still get
important notifications as you usually
would but not important notifications
get sent to a separate shade to be
dismissed after 24 hours when I first
launched PayPal I was also surprised to
find a built-in secure payment mode
which does a variety of things to make
sure you that you aren't fished or
otherwise attacked by rogue apps or
websites the most glaring drawback apply
me is mazes lack of an official
relationship with Google because of this
maze you can't install Google apps on
their smartphones like other
manufacturers can so they rely on
unauthorized methods instead these
methods are effective but some apps like
Android pay don't work you might also
take issue with the update strategy
instead of updating two new versions of
Android meizu updates their fly me skin
with new features before or shortly
after to stock Android this means that
it's highly unlikely that this phone
will ever see Android 7.0 nougat you can
purchase the amazing pro 6 plus in China
now and either gold silver or black the
base model is 3000 UN whereas the
higher-end model is 3300 um like many
competing options the meizu pro 6 plus
offers great hardware it's in the
software however where the pro fix plus
inches ahead of its competitors with the
pro 6 plus you're getting a great camera
wonderful display excellent performance
and of course fresh and innovative
software well there are certainly some
claws the NFC and heartrate monitor are
disabled in the global software google
apps support is unofficial and the phone
lacks support for us 4G LTE the mais new
pro 6 slots offers an exceptional
experience for its target audience if
you're a hardcore meizu fan or are just
looking to try something different the
pro 6 plus is a great option and that
will be all for this video be sure to
give it a thumbs up if you liked it and
