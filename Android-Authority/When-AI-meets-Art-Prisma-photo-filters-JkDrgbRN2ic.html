Authority here to take a look at the
only filter app that you are ever going
to need it's called Prisma and as you
may have heard it launched on iOS a
little over a month ago it's coming out
on Android in a few weeks but we've got
a sneak preview for you here to take a
look at what makes Christmas so special
the short answer artificial intelligence
let's take a look Chris mom works pretty
much like any other filter app simply
take or choose an existing photo and
start applying one of the three dozen
filters when it's done you can share
director Facebook or Instagram or other
social networks through the Android
share picker
well that might sound like nothing too
exciting just wait till you see what
prisoners filters are actually capable
of these are no run-of-the-mill tweaks
to color balance contrast and saturation
that's because prisoner doesn't just
apply a filter over the top of the photo
like Instagram it actually recreates the
image from scratch in a certain style
using artificial intelligence and neural
networks
unfortunately that tends to make the
filtering process take a little longer
than I'd probably like it to but there's
a lot of data crunching going on in the
5 seconds or so you have to wait and the
results are absolutely worth it now it
launched those three dozen filters with
more coming in the next few weeks some
stylistic like watercolor effects coffee
comic book or impressionist while others
are based on famous paintings like Hakka
sighs great wave if that moves the
stream or works by Pierre Mondrian or
Roy Lichtenstein but there's also a
great mix of other crazy stuff like
Tokyo Electric and Heisenberg the
intensity slider lets you determine the
strength of the filter once you've
applied it although in my experience
anything less than 100% is a little bit
boring now a video is coming to prison
soon along with support for 360 degree
images which have already been previewed
on Facebook and in fact the prisoner CEO
was recently at Facebook demoing
the filters on facebook live streaming
video booth or ever Prisma ends up it is
truly the most impressive filtering out
that we've ever seen and it is
definitely worth checking out if you
want to add some creative spark to your
photos till next time guys hit that like
