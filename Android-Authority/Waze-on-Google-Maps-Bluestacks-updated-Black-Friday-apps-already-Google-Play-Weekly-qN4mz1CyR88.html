Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly as it
has been the last couple of weeks google
has been dominating the headlines there
is a new Magic the Gathering style card
game coming out of blizzard and the
latest nova launcher is now in beta so
you can give it a shot we have that and
a lot more so let's get started and our
first bit of news this week BlueStacks
has been updated to ice cream sandwich I
know I know it's not the most current
android OS but considering the platform
was running on gingerbread before it's
still a pretty dramatic improvement in
terms of sheer usability the service
remains pretty much as it was you can
still use it to download and use android
applications on your computer about the
only difference you'll notice our apps
that you couldn't use in Gingerbread
like blackberry messenger can now be
used earlier this week at blizzcon it
was confirmed that harston heroes of
warcraft would be coming to android and
iOS Blizzard chief creative officer Bob
Pardo made the announcement that it
would be a free-to-play card game and
that would arrive sometime in quarter
two of 2014 it is a card game much like
magic the gathering and Pokemon so if
you've played those this shouldn't be
too hard to pick up and play it'll be a
while before it hits Android but it does
hit iPad next month and if you're lucky
you can get in on the closed beta for pc
and mac last week we talked about the
announcement of a nova launcher update
that's going to bring a whole lot of
android kitkat goodness to nova launcher
it's not ready for primetime yet but
there is a beta that you can try out
right now among other things the beta
features a lot of KitKat like features
such as folders the KitKat font the app
drawer transparent system in nav bars
where supported and others if you want
to give the new Nova a try you can
download it at nova launcher calm slash
beta as many of you may know google
bought out ways over the summer to the
tune of 1 billion dollars and has been
working ever since to bring ways into
google maps this week Google Maps has
been updated to include ways data in 46
countries to get it you just have to
wait this requires no app updates or
anything special it'll just start
working when the rollout of the feature
reaches you a couple of countries that
are included are Canada and Italy among
many others the best news is maps will
now start giving you directions based on
this new traffic info so if there is an
accident on your route it'll redirect
you to a different route automatically
in our last bit of news this week Google
search has been updated to 3.1 point 8
this is a very interesting update
because it not only helps fix bugs and
supported devices but also
supported devices that may be running
the Google Experience launcher included
in the update our new google now cards
and updated you I new animations and
numerous fixes this means that the
screwy tablet layout has finally been
fixed along with the random keyboard
popup issue that tablets have been
seeing and the voice search force closes
that everybody's been seeing it didn't
fix everything but it fixed the worst
problems so if you've been holding off
on trying this out you're all good to go
now so who wants to see some trending
applications as usual if you want to
give any of these a shot you can find
the download links in the written
companion in the video description first
up is Dave frame this awesome and free
app takes the idea of a photo frame and
adds pretty much every feature you'll
ever need in a photo frame app it's from
the same people who brought us HD
widgets which i use religiously on all
my devices if you want to see more we
did a video review and it's on our
YouTube channel the camera awesome is a
reportedly popular iOS camera app that's
been ported to android so far reception
has been both positive and negative
people seem to enjoy how the app works
when it actually works but hate to the
interface is modeled after iOS 7 also
it's not compatible with a whole lot of
Android devices it is good when it works
so if you don't mind wagering the three
dollars on whether or not it'll actually
work for you it's worth a try even
though we're coming up on Thanksgiving
everyone is talking about Christmas for
some reason but with Thanksgiving comes
Black Friday and some apps are cashing
in early this includes a new app by
slickdeals called the Black Friday app
that surprise surprise delivers ads
deals and coupons for the upcoming black
friday if you plan on participating it's
worth checking this app out the long
awaited discount google wallet I mean
Isis mobile wallet has finally been
released to the masses for about ninety
percent of people it's going to be
garbage and it only worsens the longing
for Google Wallet 2 point 0 to come out
but for those privileged few that can
use it without any problems it's a
reasonable substitute until then it's
free so there's no harm in at least
trying it out last up this week is my
personal favorite podcast app called
pocket casts it was recently updated to
its own version 4.4 which it's dubbing
kentucky fried chicken with the update
comes a couple of KitKat only features
and a few more changes and updates that
are for everyone if you need a new
podcast app this is the one we recommend
once again I'm Joe Hindy the android
authority app guy and this has been
Google Play weekly feel free to
subscribe to our YouTube channel and
don't forget to tune in next week for
our next episode the written companion
and the social media links are in the
no description thank you for watching
