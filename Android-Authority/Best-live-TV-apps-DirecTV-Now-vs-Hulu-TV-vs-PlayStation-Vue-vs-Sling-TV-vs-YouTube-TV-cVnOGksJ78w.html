hindi the android authority app guy
internet TV is hitting the market in a
big way especially this year and we
wanted to see which ones were worth
checking out it's gonna be a long one
folks
so let's get right into it okay let's
start out with channel selection and
prices now I could drone on and on
listing off the same old stuff over and
over again forever but I'll spare you
the pain the written version of this has
all of this information along with links
to the various services for more
information thus instead of boring the
hell out of you with long list of stuff
that really don't translate well over
video let's go over some of the
highlights instead for starters all 5 TV
services offer local channels in every
package that should cover most local
sports news and the weather whether or
not the channel is available on a
particular service depends mostly on
your location we couldn't test all of
the 43,000 zip codes in the United
States so you might have to dig a little
deeper to see what local channels are
available in your area additionally all
5 services offer a decent selection of
on-demand content or stuff that you can
just stream even if it's not live this
usually includes movies and TV shows
that have aired recently and in many
cases it's the entire currently airing
season of a TV show
most services don't offer local live TV
in every area but those local channels
usually have on-demand content 24 hours
after airing for instance the Superbowl
was available on NBC on all of these
services 24 hours after the event in
areas that didn't have live local NBC
coverage of the 5 sling TV has the
cheapest starting package at $20 per
month for about 30 channels the most
expensive individual package is
PlayStation views top tier which is 70
$4.99 for just over 70 channels
including HBO and Showtime the rest of
the services and packages fall somewhere
in between those two of these sling TV
also has the fewest channels in its most
basic package with just over 30 while
DirecTV now has the most channels in a
package at just over 120 the rest of the
packages fall somewhere in between those
finally all five services also have
add-ons along with the base packages
these mostly comprised of premium
channels like Showtime HBO Starz sports
channels and other such channels they
range from $5 per month to $15 per month
or even more in some case
slang TV has over 30 add-ons that
include multilingual channels and a
bunch of other stuff each of the
services supports a different set of
platforms however most of them do
support the big players like Apple TV
chromecast Amazon fire and Roku with
sporadic support for Android TV consoles
and other Fringe devices again we
encourage you to check out the written
version for the full rundown of
everything these services mostly focus
on delivering live TV content however
all of them do offer some additional
features to entice us the consumers
there really isn't anything dramatic but
some of these perks are quite nice we'll
also mention how many concurrent streams
each service allows and for
clarification concurrent streams is
simply how many devices can stream these
services at the same time let's start
with Direct TV now it's the only service
that doesn't offer cloud DVR although
that service is coming within the next
couple of months so by mid 2018 it won't
be an issue anymore
some of the other features DirecTV
offers includes a 72-hour rewind feature
as well as a restart feature to watch
stuff that you may have recently missed
additionally Amazon fire and Apple TV
devices get support for Dolby Digital
5.1 and that's neat we guess finally the
service offers up to two simultaneous
streams per accounts Hulu does have
cloud DVR service with up to 50 hours of
recording time the service also offers
two continuous streams per account
perhaps its best feature is a baked in
subscription to the normal Hulu service
that gives it live TV as well as a
healthy batch of binge friendly content
that no other service can match for
additional fees you can upgrade the DVR
to 200 hours and upgrade the number of
concurrent streams to unlimited over
your home network or three outside of
your home network however those are
fairly expensive and we honestly don't
recommend them PlayStation View also has
a cloud DVR but they aren't very
transparent on how much of it you get
they say you get hundreds of hours but
there is no specified maximum
additionally PlayStation 4 owners get a
unique multi stream view mode while
PlayStation Plus members get discounts
on premium channels and channel bundles
PlayStation views most unique feature is
the ability to use your credentials to
login to TV apps like Fox Sports go
discovery go watch ESPN and similar apps
like a real cable provider
lastly the service allows for up to five
concurrent streams but each device has
to be registered under the main
account holder sling TV is one of these
simplest services available it does
offer 50 hours of cloud DVR but it does
cost an additional five dollars per
month
it also has integration with air TV a
digital TV antenna box that grants
unlimited access to local TV channels as
long as you're in range of the broadcast
towers thus it always ensures that you
have those channels
even if sling TV itself does not sling
TVs biggest feature is its ala carte
style with over 30 add-on packages to
add whatever kind of TV that you want
beware though because these packages
ramped up the monthly cost rather
quickly and also sling TV allows for up
to two concurrent streams YouTube TV
proudly flaunts an unlimited cloud DVR
service that we really appreciate
additionally it allows for up to six
accounts per membership with each
account having their own cloud DVR
favorites recommendations etc it does
only allow three concurrent streams
though so all six accounts cannot be
active at once you also get access to
YouTube red originals which is okay we
guess but it's got nothing on Hulu's
additional content offerings otherwise
YouTube red is actually a fairly simple
service overall PlayStation View has the
most robust set of features with the
fewest compromises but as we saw earlier
it's also the most expensive service and
now we all know why YouTube TV banks
heavily on its cloud DVR service and its
sixth account membership but it doesn't
really have any other unique features
DirecTV now lags behind with no cloud
DVR but that's a very temporary problem
and they have other features to mitigate
that problem so we didn't really judge
it too harshly
Slean TV is probably the least
interesting service when it comes to
extra features and we're not happy that
cloud DVR costs extra when it comes in
the base price of the other services
Hulu including its regular service in
the base price really gives a ton of
extra stuff to watch and makes it a
better value but it's expensive add-ons
kind of negate that bonus those with
bigger households should probably stick
with YouTube TV or Playstation view
streaming quality is a bit of a hairy
subject because there are so many
variables that control it your internet
speeds consistency and quality will all
affect the streaming quality of live TV
additionally those with 4k TVs with
subpar upscaling may see additional
softness even if the stream is razor
sharp and of course if the services
themselves are having issues that will
affect streaming quality as well to make
matters even more complicated different
broadcast
or extreme at different qualities all
five services can do basic HD at 720p at
30 frames per second per channel some
channels offer 60 frames per second
1080p and up to 1080p at 60 frames per
second however this is largely out of
the hands of these streaming services
and more on the broadcast networks
providing the stream thus you can't
complain to YouTube or Hulu or DirecTV
because they don't have a specific
channel in 1080p it's usually not their
call and there's usually nothing that
they can do about it obviously 1080p at
60 frames per second is the sweet spot
but in our experience 720p at 30 frames
per second is passable in most cases
each service streams in a slightly
different bit rate and that is
controllable in the settings menu and a
few of them including sling TV none of
these companies publish their bit rates
and stream quality varies for all sorts
of reasons thus an academic view of
their streaming quality is outside of my
abilities to provide and for that I am
sorry
the best I can do is the old I test and
I looked around at what other people
said based on that research most seem to
agree that YouTube TV and PlayStation
View have the best streaming quality
while sling TV is often described as the
worst with Hulu and DirecTV now slotting
somewhere in the middle however during
my eye test on a note 8 and an LGB 7
oled TV I found the differences to be
fairly marginal at best all of the
services had the occasional hiccup or
skip or long load time but I experienced
no serious problems while streaming with
any of them my recommendation is that
you don't turn down the right service
for you because it isn't the sharpest
according to most people the differences
aren't night and day and all 5 services
have the same ceiling when it comes to
video quality channel selection of price
extra features and value will ultimately
matter more at least for right now
design and UI is another difficult
subject to approach mostly because what
constitutes as good is highly
preferential none of these services do
design poorly however all five of them
have some minor elements that are
undesirable for instance sling TVs
mobile app looks rather antiquated
PlayStation views TV Guide is a little
difficult to use on mobile and YouTube
TV's mobile app has some inconsistent
layout features none of these things are
overly bad but rather nitpicks
additionally most of these services are
available on a minimum of half a dozen
platforms and each platform has a
slightly different UI to take into
account things like control mechanic
design standards and other stuff quite
frankly an in-depth view of the UI isn't
necessary on TV facing devices like
Android TV Roku Apple TV etc because
they all do a good enough job with very
little issues in reality the mobile and
tablet apps differ far more than their
set-top box counterparts plus it would
take like 40 minutes to talk all of that
out and neither of us want that there
are a few observations worth making for
starters all five services look and act
nicer on set-top box devices and Smart
TVs than they do on mobile devices all
five mobile apps do have chromecast
support and they also allow for cross
device syncing between devices for
things like DVR favorites and other
stuff so that's good news as far as we
could tell
none of the services offer an
alphabetical TV Guide view although most
do offer alphabetical lists of available
channels somewhere within the app
perhaps the most interesting point of
note is how much like TV these apps try
to feel when they really don't need to
the little quirks like TV guides and
channel flipping or quaint
however in 2018 we would have liked a
more efficient system still none of
these services are difficult to use nor
are they hard on the eyes ultimately the
one that you like will be a matter of
opinion more than anything because all
five services have apps on supported
platforms that hold to basically the
same thing now we could go and rank all
of these as best to worst however we
felt that it would be more appropriate
to outline what each of these does well
calling one of them the worst and the
other the best could easily get taken
out of context and it's not necessarily
accurate in reality all of these
services are good in their own way and
it all really depends on what you're
looking for so here's what each one of
these does well and what they do poorly
we'll be honest with you we went into
this project thinking that Direct TV now
was going to be an easy scapegoat and we
were wrong the service excels at
providing a very PlayStation view like
experience for even less money it
features tons of channels for decent
prices and several packages to choose
from additionally it's HBO stars and
Cinemax add-ons are cheaper than any of
the other services 60 channels and HBO
for $40 per month is a surprisingly
excellent value especially when compared
to Hulu and YouTube TV it does lack DVR
but it does have a 72-hour rewind
feature that acts similarly Plus DVR is
coming before too long anyway so it's
really not that big of a deal
we would recommend this service to
people who like a ton of tea
and also on HBO additionally AT&amp;amp;T
customers get some extra perks so we
would definitely recommend that AT&amp;amp;T
customers look at this one first
Hulu TV honestly doesn't excel at much
they get outperformed in channel
selection DVR price concurrent streams
and even streaming quality by at least
one other competitor however Hulu does
have its benefits a subscription to the
service also gets you a subscription to
the regular Hulu and that makes Hulu the
only service with a one-two punch of
live TV and also binge friendly
streaming selections it's also available
on more platforms than many competitors
although live TV support still hasn't
rolled out to all of the platforms that
Hulu usually supports it does have cloud
DVR included in the base subscription
which is nice we recommend this one to
existing Hulu customers who may want to
add a bit of live TV to their experience
and don't necessarily need a lot of
channels or a lot of customization we
would also recommend this to people who
enjoy binge watching old TV but also
want a little bit of live TV as well
PlayStation View slots into a weird spot
in this space it runs a little more
expensive than DirecTV now for less
channels however it has more concurrent
streams excellent DVR and it also has
above-average streaming quality that
makes it a decent choice if you don't
mind paying a premium for fewer channels
but for better features additionally
PlayStation Plus members get additional
discounts and deals and it also comes
with multi-screen support for
PlayStation 4 that makes it a good first
choice for PlayStation 3 or 4 owners and
it's five concurrent streams also makes
it great for busy households however
under most circumstances DirecTV now
does what PlayStation View does but
cheaper slim TV is the cheapest solution
for those who want the most basic TV
access its ala carte approaches
refreshingly different and it's 30 Plus
add-on packages really let you customize
your TV subscription it's a level of
customization that no competitor even
comes close to matching those add-ons do
add up quickly though resulting in
higher prices than some competitors in
some cases sling TV also has the unique
ability to integrate digital TV antennas
into its service via air TV although
that device does cost you a hundred
bucks that guarantees local stations
support for those who live close enough
to a city the biggest con to sling TV is
the cost as you add more and more
channel add-ons there comes a point
where it may be more economical to just
do one of the big packages from a
competitor to save yourself a few bucks
otherwise there really is
much wrong with Celine TV the services
selection of international TV content
also makes it great for non-english
speakers as well YouTube TV is actually
one of the weaker options overall right
now
it's unlimited cloud DVR service is
unrivaled in the industry but it is
somewhat mitigated by strong offerings
and on-demand content from all of its
competitors plus its channel add-ons are
on the expensive side and YouTube TV
offers no customization in terms of
pricing finally YouTube's bread is one
of the weaker perks compared to
something like Hulu's extensive
on-demand library of binge worthy
contents still there are some benefits
to YouTube TV it caters well to large
households with its six accounts per
membership offer even if only three
concurrent streams are allowed at once
plus it offers some of the best
streaming quality and app design among
all five services and it's relatively
simple to understand if that's what you
want then YouTube TV may be for you
however it has a long way to go before
it starts outright beating competitors
in this space here's the thing folks the
Internet TV market is rather young the
oldest of these services is a mere three
years old to date and we expect to see
massive improvements changes and other
new features rolling out over the coming
months and years right now is an
excellent time to take advantage of
these services however don't expect all
of this stuff to be the same in the
future in fact most of these services
should see major updates within the next
six months if we miss something that you
think is important about these services
make sure to tell us about them in the
comments and that about does it for this
