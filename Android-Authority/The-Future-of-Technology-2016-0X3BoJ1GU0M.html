topic and that's the best tech that's
just around the corner the Internet of
Things is a buzzword that's been growing
in popularity for a good reason just
about every tech company out there
whether you're talking about smartphone
OEMs or accessory makers have launched
at least one connected product over the
past two years according to Gartner
there will be upwards of 6.4 billion
connected things to use worldwide in
2016 up 30% from 2015 the research
company also says that the number of IOT
devices will reach twenty point eight
billion by 2020 but that's not
necessarily a good thing for every good
product that's a wearable or so-called
Internet of Things device there's at
least five more that are utterly
pointless such as from the green IQ
smart garden hub that takes the hassle
out of watering plants or the hundred
dollar vessel smart cup that monitors
how much water you drink for real every
time the Internet of Things revolution
looks like it's about to get off the
ground it just stays the same and that
probably won't change in 2016 it might
in 2017 or 2018 but not this year now
let's talk virtual reality or as my wife
says the age in which geeks do not leave
their goddamn bedroom 2016 is going to
be an iconic year for virtual reality
this is the year that oculus will
finally come to market with their rift
headset which will ship out to early
adopters in March for $5.99 u.s. which
surprisingly isn't as much as many folks
were expecting for the first generation
headset to cost years ago the rift was
considered to be the quintessential
virtual reality experience but it's been
a long time coming and other VR
platforms have already surpassed the
rift and making their way to consumers
we expect that 2016 will also be the
year where wearables are no longer a
niche market in 2016 the third wave of
wear devices will arrive there will be
more options and less sacrifice which
means more consumers will get on board
with the wearable trend as far as
specifics are concerned we can likely
expect new wearables from LG
and Motorola and possibly even Huawei
and HTC now my personal prediction for a
breakthrough wearable product would be
an earpiece or two earpieces in stereo
that are very comfortable discreet and
can be worn in such a way that you
actually forget that they're there allow
you to here's phone calls music podcasts
audiobooks and all that kind of stuff
and still hear the outside world that
would be fantastic
who's gonna do it and we also expect
that 2016 will be an even bigger year
for mobile payments we expect a slower
adoption rate for mobile payments among
the older generation but according to
Brian Yeager an analyst at emarketer
younger consumers generally have fewer
apprehensions when it comes to
experimenting with new technologies
ultimately mobile wallets will need to
have a strong track record of security
to attract more users across all
demographics long-term all right now
it's your turn let me know in the
comments below what you think will be
right around the corner in 2016 or
beyond and back it up with some sort of
evidence give us an intelligent argument
and don't forget about my brothers and
sister and Android who are working super
hard to be your source for all things
