to you by HipChat now ever since
smartwatches first came out I've always
wanted to do one thing you know what it
is a man a DS boy kit come get me get a
line alright so the industry had high
hopes for these smartwatches they were
expected to explode and go mainstream
quite quickly but they haven't quite got
there at all and today we're going to
talk about why and to start off well
they're not a standalone product unlike
Dick Tracy's telephone esque timepiece
the majority of smartwatches are not
capable of placing voice calls on their
own in fact most of them need to be
tethered to an Internet connected
smartphone in order to operate at full
capacity this may not be a complete deal
breaker for everyone however some people
aren't too keen on this setup add in the
fact that most smart watches are
currently priced from two to three
hundred dollars and this watered-down
extension of a smartphone experience
really starts to become a tough sell now
let's talk about what they do do well
they give you easy notifications without
having to take the phone out of your
pocket for text time temperature all
that kind of thing and it does give you
the added fitness tracking which is
fantastic but is that a compelling
enough reason for most people especially
because they're not the best fashion
accessory if you're looking for an
attractive intelligent smart watch your
choices are somewhat limited most of
these devices are pretty masculine in
appearance and if you are a woman
seeking something softer things get even
worse if you ever seen a woman wear a
SmartWatch my wife just says men in your
toys in their present form smartwatches
are still unpolished unproven and
ultimately unnecessary toss in the fact
that most devices are poorly marketed
and it becomes pretty clear why they're
not flying off the shelves until
Hardware SmartWatch producers can come
up with a clear-cut reason why these
devices are actually needed 1 million
units sold every two years might be a
slow death Neil ringing loud and clear
that was some bloody good writing and
that's mark Hearn at android authority
calm you want to check out his article
link below I base today show on that but
now i'm going to riff on smartwatches
here we go my friends it comes down to
Wi-Fi easily accessible Wi-Fi how many
of us out there would pay for LTE
carrier charges on both our phone tablet
and wearable devices like a SmartWatch
not many it gets super expensive and
there isn't a compelling enough reason
to do so yet but if Wi-Fi is everywhere
I mean it's grown so much right it's now
in our community center library school
cafe and McDonald's all that kind of
stuff but when it doubles in capacity
when it doubles in accessibility and
it's just everywhere standalone wearable
devices are able to really pull their
weight and now a really compelling
reason because they can access the
internet and get all the data that we
want without having to be dependent on
our smartphone or tablet that is going
to change the game what do you guys
think now I saw that some of you in the
comments we're talking about domain calm
and possibly getting Android dot army
and I thought that'd be kind of cute if
you guys don't get it I will cuz domain
now comes fantastic it's not just about
domain com net org anymore you now have
the opportunity to name your site and
build your brand in ways that's never
possible choose from the growing list of
200 plus domain name extensions like
ninja NYC that expert and duck club all
available now at domain.com and the guys
at domain.com on a hook our viewers up
with a great offer say fifteen percent
on domain names and web hosting when you
use our coupon code Android at
domain.com check out don't forget
fifteen percent off when you use our
coupon code Android when you think
domain names think domain.com alright so
this is the LG G watch it was a
thoughtful gift from android authority
dnd the the Android God's they got this
for my birthday and it was fantastic
here's what I like I like easy
notifications time text temperature
weather all that kind of stuff and it
vibrates it's much more discreet for a
text I can you know if it's neat if I
need to tax them out to dinner
like that and I'll pull up my phone I
can just look at my watch and it's much
more polite that's kind of cool but of
course is we talked about it's not stand
alone so there's limited things it can
do I really do like the fitness tracking
combined with the watch and text and all
that stuff so it's okay would I have
paid 180 bucks to buy this myself no so
my wife's right it is kind of a toy
thanks for watching you know what I say
the same thing all the time you know
what I'm looking for here here here and
down there so I'm just going to go up by
saying kitten no ugly at least I have an
