by Toyota the Sony Xperia z1 was a
further perfection of the great
smartphones that they have come out with
in the past year we were big fans with
experience see and that when the c1 came
out it was definitely closer to what we
knew Sony there too but now they've
taken the great package of the c1 and
brought it down to size and then package
that is not only accessible but is
incredibly powerful and should be one of
our favorites like this show hey it's
josh mccown from Andhra authority what's
going on everybody and this is the sony
xperia z1 compact
and here it is the Sony Xperia z1
compact this is definitely the z1 just
shrunken down to size I am holding the
pink one right here the hot pink one
rather that does it's not necessary my
first choice but there are so many
different colors of the z1 compact that
you will be able to personalize your
experience by choosing the one that's
right for you now what is great about
this phone is that it is the z1 brought
down to size and made more accessible
for the general user nearly everybody
out there will be able to take this
phone and have a very good time with it
surely because it is very very easy to
grip in one hand and have as a very very
pocketable device compared to many of
the 5-inch and even larger phones that
we have out in the market today this is
a 4.3 inch screen 720p resolution with
the triluminos display and also the X
reality engine backing it up underneath
the surface no this is one of the great
great specifications come in because all
of the specifications of this Xperia z1
come in this little body we have the
Snapdragon 800 clocked in at 2.2
gigahertz 2 gigabytes of RAM we also
have expandable storage due to the
microSD card slot right here on the side
and of course all of this goodness is
protected by an IP certification that
allows it to be water-resistant and
dustproof so you'll be able to take this
out and pretty much do whatever you need
with the phone and it will come right
back and survive the elements no matter
what you're doing and then one of the
better parts of this is this tiny phone
comes with D 20.7 megapixel G lens like
was introduced in the z1 the great
performing camera that will allow you to
get a lot of great shots in an easy way
especially considering how small this
phone is it's almost like the size of a
compact camera so sony has really come
out the gate with a great offering not
only are they bringing the z1s the
American version of this new one to the
States but now we also have the z1
compact here and it's just a wonderful
wonderful version of the phone that
allows everybody to have a great time no
matter
they are so keep it tuned here we are at
the sony booth here at CES 2014 the show
has gotten started so we are in the
thick of it and stay tuned to android
thority for all of the best coverage
from the Consumer Electronics Show of
2014 and once again thank you to Toyota
for sponsoring our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
