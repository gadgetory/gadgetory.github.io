big flagship for the second half of 2016
and it's the successor to last year's
v10 but it's been completely redesigned
with a new look that's a lot more
similar to the g5 than it is the v10
instead of those stainless steel rails
and dura skin material the V 20 swaps
all that out for a mostly metal design
with polycarbonate on the top and bottom
chin it doesn't look quite as unique as
they'd be tended and I've actually had a
few people confuse it for an HTC phone
but it is a pretty good-looking phone
regardless and feels really good in the
hand despite the change in design and
materials the v20 still carries a
military 810g rating that makes it
extremely durable against shocks and
drops and it's nice that LG was able to
keep this feature on the v 20 without
making it look so obvious now if you
didn't know any better you'd think that
the V 20 is a completely unibody metal
smartphone but it's not there's actually
a button on the lower right side that
releases the catch mechanism for the
metal backplate giving access to the
removable battery your sim and the micro
SD card slot when the backplate is on
its it's completely flush and doesn't
slide or move around and it feels just
like any other smartphone out there
that's made of metal the build quality
is absolutely top-notch and you really
have to commend LG because no matter how
much their design changes or what
materials they use they always figure
out a way to keep that removable battery
they've realized that there's still a
lot of people out there that still want
a removable battery and out of all the
major ball players like Samsung HTC or
Motorola LG is the only company that has
held on to this feature and it kind of
makes LG smartphones a little bit more
unique and there's almost no excuse
anymore to having a metal smartphone
without a removable battery and I would
really like to see this happen in a lot
of other smartphones another feature
that the V Tony has that a lot of OEM
seem to have done away with for whatever
reason is an IR blaster so if you like
controlling your TV and other
peripherals with your smartphone you
certainly can do that with the V 20
on the back of the phone you have LG
signature rear-facing power button but
just like the g5 the volume keys are no
longer on the back instead you'll find
them sitting in a more traditional spot
on the left side which I personally
prefer and there's no real issues with
the power and volume buttons at all
they're both very clicky tactile and
easy to press the power button of course
also doubles as a fingerprint sensor and
it works extremely well it's fast
accurate takes very little time to set
up and unlike some other phones that use
a physical button for a fingerprint
sensor you don't have to press the V
Tony's power button down in order for it
to read your fingerprint which makes it
feel that much faster along the bottom
is the headphone jack USB type-c port
and the single firing speaker which
isn't going to compare to phones with
dual speakers or front-facing speakers
but for a single firing speaker it's one
of the better ones that I've heard in a
long while
the real audio experience with the V 20
is on the inside it's got a quad DAC
built-in and without getting into any
specifics this basically means that
you're going to get much higher quality
audio with less distortion and noise and
much better dynamic range as long as you
have a decent pair of headphones you're
going to hear a huge difference in how
your audio sounds and because of the
built-in quad DAC it's able to power
much higher impedance headphones even
with streaming audio it makes a pretty
significant impact but you also have
support for lossless audio files like
flak and you have a 75 stage volume
control along with left and right
balance controls to really fine-tune the
audio to your ears something to be aware
of it's at the V 20 in Asian markets
will have audio tuning done by Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen whereas the V 20 here in the
States
will have audio tuning done by LG as to
what the differences are or if there are
any differences at all we don't really
know as I haven't heard the Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen version but what I can say
though is that I've had zero complaints
with the audio tuning done by LG not
only is the V 20 able to playback much
higher quality audio it's also capable
of recording higher quality audio the
built-in HD audio recorder lets you
record audio and 24-bit FLAC files and
it can handle really high inputs which
means you can record really loud and
noisy environments like sporting events
or concerts without the audio clipping
or sounding distorted these auto
recording tape of the
these also extend over to video but
we'll talk more about that when we get
into the camera just like the v10 last
year the LGB 20 comes with two displays
the main display is a 5.7 inch IPS LCD
with quad HD resolution and it's bright
enough that it's visible outdoors has
good viewing angles and with such a high
pixel density is super sharp and easy to
read my only complaint would be that the
colors aren't quite as vibrant as I
would like but otherwise it's a pretty
good looking screen just as you would
expect from a high-end flagship the
secondary display is still at the top
and LG's made a few improvements to it
on the V 20 it's slightly larger and
brighter making it a little bit easier
to see outdoors but functionally it does
all the same things as it did last year
and can show a variety of different
things like app shortcuts recently open
apps media controls upcoming calendar
events your favorite contacts and quick
toggles two basic settings like Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth and when the main display
is turned off it'll show you basic
information like the time date and
battery life you can also set a custom
signature but because the screen is
wider now you can set signatures that
are much longer with more characters and
if you want to take it a step further
you can even set a custom signature
wallpaper to match the second screen
isn't entirely necessary and it's one of
those features that you may not use all
the time but it's nice to know that it's
there in the off chance that you do want
to use it and if you give it a
legitimate chance you might find it to
be really useful I actually like it a
lot for the features that it provides
especially the app shortcuts you can
customize it with up to five of your
favorite or most commonly used apps and
the app shortcuts will all show you
notification badges any time you receive
a new notification which I thought was a
really nice touch I do however wish that
the screen was
AMOLED instead of LCD because it's
really easy to no slight bleed coming
from the second screen when the main
display is turned off it's not a huge
deal but it is something you will see
when you're using the phone in the dark
the rest of the specs are pretty typical
of what you would find on a 2016
flagship there's a Snapdragon 820 chip
inside with the adrenal 530 and 4
gigabytes of RAM and in with LG somewhat
heavy skin performance on the v 20 has
been very buttery smooth it does all the
day-to-day things with very little
issues it opens apps quickly touch
responsiveness is great and
to tasking back and forth between
applications has been a very fluid
experience the V Tony also handles
gaming like a champ and because it's
running Android nougat you're getting
much better graphics and gaming
performance with Vulcan supported games
speaking of Android nougat the LGB 20 is
the very first phone to ship with
Android 7.0 out of the box which was
surprisingly unexpected considering this
historically has always been a Nexus
phone but I guess Google chose to switch
things up quite a bit this year it's a
selling point for this phone right now
since there aren't that many phones
running newgate at the moment but that's
obviously going to be very short-lived
since it's running nougat you're getting
all the features that we've seen from
this update like built-in multi window
support the revamped notifications
direct reply customizable quick toggles
and doze on-the-go just to name a few
the only feature that I noticed I was
missing is the system UI tuner I'm not
entirely sure why LG chose to leave that
out but it would have been nice to have
considering how useful it is on other
devices currently running nougat like
the Nexus 6p and Google's brand new
pixel phones on top of Android 7.0 is
LG's custom skin and it looks and feels
a lot like what we saw on the g5 it's
still really bright colorful and
somewhat cartoonish and by default there
isn't an app drawer but this isn't that
big of a deal anymore since you can
easily revert back to an app drawer in
the settings there's also built in
themes made specifically for the b20
which is great if you don't like the
default color scheme unfortunately
there's only a few to pick from right
now but hopefully we'll see more options
pop up in the next couple of months it
is cleaner than previous versions of LG
skin and a lot less intrusive but it
would have been nice if LG did a lot
more with it to make it flow better with
Android nougat because outside of the
fact that it's running new get the
overall experience still feels the same
as what we saw on the g5 for a phone
that has two screens a quad DAC and is
capable of doing so many things with
photos and video you would think that
would have a much larger battery and
while 3200 milliamp hours isn't
necessarily small for a phone that is
significantly bigger than the s7 edge
it's a little surprising it didn't have
a bigger battery like I mentioned
earlier the upside here of course is
that you can swap batteries in and out
as you see fit and despite the battery
not being as big as you would expect it
is enough to last me a full
all day with my usage of texting email
social media streaming music and a few
hours of gaming and youtube per day but
I typically never had a whole lot of
battery life left over I would say that
the battery life will be good enough for
most people but don't expect this phone
to last all day if you plan on using its
video and audio capabilities extremely
heavily of course with this being the
v20 the camera experience on this phone
is a pretty big deal it's got two
cameras on the back just like the LG g5
with a 16 megapixel main sensor at F 1.8
and optical image stabilization and an 8
megapixel wide angle sensor at F 2.4
just like the wide angle lens that was
on the g5 I absolutely love the wide
angle lens on the V 20 even though the
quality is not as good as the main
sensor the wide angle lens is just a ton
of fun to use and works perfectly for a
variety of different situations like
group photos and landscapes it makes a
huge difference over the standard angle
of the main sensor and not only can you
fit more into the frame but the wide
angle effect just makes your shots look
that much more dynamic LG's camera app
is very feature-rich especially when it
comes to manual controls for photos and
video and it's pretty incredible how
much they've been able to pack into this
camera you can control everything from
white balance ISO exposure shutter speed
and focus just like you would on a real
camera one of the most useful changes to
LG's camera is that it now has built-in
focus peaking which makes it a lot
easier to tell if your subject is in
focus and if you're a content creator
you'll know exactly how useful focus
peaking can be on the video side of
things there's a plethora of settings
that you can change you can pick from a
wide variety of video recording
resolutions including 4k adjust the
frame rate and bitrate add film great
effects and record hi-fi audio during
your videos for improved sound quality
not only do you have a lot of controls
for video but you also have a lot of
controls for audio all of what you can
adjust as you're recording video
these include built-in controls for gain
a low-cut filter a limiter a wind noise
filter the ability to change the
direction of the microphone sensitivity
and you can even monitor the audio
levels directly through the viewfinder
while the camera does have optical image
stabilization it doesn't do a whole lot
for video
even just casually walking will cause a
lot of jerkiness if you want smoother
looking footage you can turn on LG's
steady record software stabilization and
it does make a significant difference
but you'll notice some slight warping or
jello effect especially in the corners
and it's even more noticeable on the
wide-angle lens so it works but it's far
from perfect having all of LG's manual
controls at your fingertips is really
awesome but if you're purely shooting an
auto picture quality is good but it
isn't great
there's plenty of color saturation and
sharpness and most of the time you'll
probably be pretty satisfied with the
shots that you take but it doesn't have
the greatest dynamic range it always has
the tendency to overexpose and blow out
highlights and it doesn't handle bright
colors like reds oranges and yellows all
that well low-light shots will show some
noise which is just to be expected but
the camera isn't over aggressive with
noise reduction which helps preserve
some sharpness and detail but the
cameras white balance is very heavily
influenced from surrounding light
sources especially on the wide-angle
lens
though either turn out way too cold or
way too warm and just like in most shots
it doesn't do well with properly
exposing highlights it's pretty obvious
the cameras real strength lies in its
manual controls and just like any camera
whether it be a smartphone or a DSLR
you'll always get a much better shot if
you're willing to take the time and dial
in these settings yourself now the
front-facing camera is still a 5
megapixel sensor just like it was on
last year's v10 but instead of two front
facing cameras you only have one this
time you still have the option to pick
between a standard angle and a wide
angle but because it's only working off
of one sensor it's actually cropping the
image so what you're looking at right
now is the wide angle and this is what
it looks like with the standard angle
and as you can see the quality
deteriorates quite a bit because again
it's cropping the image so for best
results I would recommend sticking with
the wide angle and you can always choose
to crop it after the fact if you want
although the b20 may share some
similarities with the g5 it's a complete
180 from the g5 and is exactly the
smartphone LG needed to turn 2016 into a
success what makes the V Tony so great
is that it isn't trying to do anything
different or crazy and instead just
focuses on being
a good smartphone it's got a new and
improved metal design a big beautiful
display a very feature-rich camera and
an awesome audio experience with its
built-in quad DAC the best part is LG
managed to pack in all this while still
keeping features that matter the most
like the removable battery and
expandable storage and that's something
you can always count on an LG phone to
have with the note 7 out of the picture
the V 20 can have the entire spotlight
to itself as that big screen
productivity powerhouse and if that's
what you're looking for the LG b 20 is
the perfect smartphone to fill that void
