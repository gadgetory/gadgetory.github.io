iPhone 10's max are two of the biggest
and most expensive mainstream
smartphones on the market the galaxy
note 9 starts at eight thousand bucks
and goes all the way up to one thousand
two hundred and fifty dollars for the
512 gigabyte model the iPhone 10's Mac
starts at $1100 and goes all the way up
to a pretty staggering fourteen hundred
and fifty dollars for the same amount of
storage as the fully maxed out note 9
these phones aren't cheap by any stretch
of the imagination but you do get a lot
for your money the galaxy note 9 and
10's max both offer fantastic build
quality with metal and glass designs but
I have to admit I like the rounded
design of the iPhone better it's more
comfortable and easier to manage than
these sharp boxy feel of the note 9
you're also getting top-of-the-line
specs with a snapdragon 845 and 6 to 8
gigabytes of RAM on the note 9 and
Apple's a12 Bionic chip on the 10s Macs
in day-to-day use the note 9 and 10 s
Macs are very fast when it comes to
launching apps multitasking or playing
games and they both feel very fluid but
apples touch response is still second to
none the note 9 performs great but the
touch response on the iPhone 10s max
just makes everything feel so much more
instantaneous which says a lot about the
advantages they have when it comes to
vertical integration between their
hardware and software in terms of
overall hardware they're actually kind
of similar they both have dual speakers
ip68 water resistance and wireless
charging they also both have big bright
in beautiful AMOLED displays that go
nearly edge to edge but Samsung manages
to do it without a notch the Note nines
display is 6.4 inches with a resolution
of 29 60 by 1440 and the 10's Max's
screen is slightly larger at 6.5 inches
but it doesn't pack quite as much
resolution in everyday use though I
couldn't really spot a difference in
sharpness
there are some major differences between
these two phones and depending on how
much you care about them it could matter
a lot or not matter that much at all the
note 9 comes with expandable storage
fingerprint sensor and a headphone jack
none of which are available on the
iPhone instead of a fingerprint sensor
Apple's pretty much gone all in with
face ID and I like face ID it's very
fast and reliable and works in most
situations but in situations where it
doesn't work I kind of wish there was a
fingerprint sensor because entering in
your passcode is kind of annoying the
biggest and most major difference is of
course the s-pen this has been the
signature feature of the note line ever
since the original Galaxy Note but it's
never been a reason as to why I've ever
used a Galaxy Note as a daily driver
I've personally never found it to be all
that useful but you can use it for
productivity purposes and this year
samsung added Bluetooth functionality so
you can kind of work as a magic wand of
sorts for pausing and playing music or
remotely taking a photo with the camera
on paper the cameras on the Galaxy Note
9 and 10's Mac seem pretty similar they
both have dual 12 megapixel cameras with
a secondary telephoto zoom lens and
optical image stabilization on both
lenses the note 9 does have that
mechanical aperture though for letting
in more light and creating a shallower
depth of field while the aperture on
both lenses of the iPhone are fixed they
also are both capable of taking portrait
mode photos and now the iPhone lets you
adjust the blur after the fact which has
been available on Samsung phones since
the note 8 the note 9 and 10 s max do a
pretty excellent job with separating the
subject from the background but when
taking portrait mode photos of people
the note 9 tends to over soften the
details in people's faces and skin tones
are much more washed out when compared
to the iPhone the note 9 and 10 s max
handled themselves very well in pretty
much every lighting situation but the 10
s max has much better dynamic range
giving you a lot more detail in the
shadows and highlights this can probably
be attributed to Apple's new smart HDR
feature which stacks a bunch of photos
together for better exposure and detail
the note 9 also tends to skew towards a
warm look which doesn't look quite as
attractive as the iPhones more neutral
color tones the software experiences on
these two phones are obviously not going
to be the same the note 9 is running
Android 8.1 Oreo with Samsung's custom
skin and the iPhone 10's max is running
the latest iOS 12 Samsung software has
gotten much
over the past couple of years that I
don't mind using it exactly the way it
is out of the box and there are some
advantages to using it like having
Samsung pay but there are some bad sides
as well like the duplicate apps and
Bixby
if you've used an iPhone before iOS 12
is going to feel very familiar
aesthetically it pretty much looks the
same as the last few versions of iOS but
this year's update was focused on better
performance and refining the OS iOS 12
is quicker at launching apps quicker to
open the camera and the keyboard pops up
slightly faster notifications are now
bundled together by apps so it doesn't
feel so cluttered and iOS 12 finally
shows screen time numbers and breaks it
down on a per app basis so you can see
how much time you're spending within
each app we've seen these features on
Android already but it's still nice to
have them on iOS if I had to pick which
one I like better I'd have to go with
the 10s max which might surprise a lot
of you guys but here's why I personally
don't use the s-pen all that much so
it's not a huge selling point for me
with the Galaxy Note and having used so
many Android phones without a headphone
jack this year it doesn't really bother
me all that much that iPhone doesn't
have one I also prefer the image quality
from the iPhone don't get me wrong the
note 9 takes amazing photos but the
iPhone just manages to take ones that
look even better so that pretty much
concludes this comparison between the
galaxy note 9 and iPhone 10s max let me
know which one you would choose down in
