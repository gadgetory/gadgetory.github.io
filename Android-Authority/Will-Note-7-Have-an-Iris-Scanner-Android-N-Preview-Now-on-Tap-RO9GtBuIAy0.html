7 actually does have an iris scanner
will that be more secure than a
fingerprint sensor and if so how the
news that the note 7 will have an iris
scanner comes via The Korea Times which
also claims that the camera manufacturer
called patron will be charged with the
task of supplying this component now
this new should not come as a big
surprise given that Samsung has already
announced the galaxy tab iris a
two-hundred-dollar tablet that is
designed for Indian govern officials
that also has a so-called iris scanner
in recent weeks renderings of a supposed
galaxy note 7 have appeared which
include two front facing cameras thus
ramping up the rumors about this iris
scanner now why would an iris scanner be
better than fingerprint sensors well the
Korean Times pointed out that quote
compared to fingerprint scanning
technology which works by recognizing 40
traits on a fingerprint the iris scanner
recognizes 266 traits on an iris meaning
the latter offers greater accuracy and
security unquote well if you've been
wondering about what the end could be an
Android n we have some clues back in May
google announced that it would be doing
something a little different with the
naming process for the next version of
android instead of thinking of the name
internally this time around the company
is letting users vote on their favorite
sweet treats that start with the letter
n while Google still hasn't decided on
an official name at least not publicly
android vp hiroshi lock heimer is trying
his best to keep the hype train rolling
on twitter lock heimer has tweeted out a
series of not-so-subtle images that all
feature the name Nutella in some way the
first as you can see here is a photo of
a menu that features a dish called
Nutella pizza and the next screenshot
from a Chrome OS device running a number
of different Android applications check
out the google search window in the back
now before you get all too excited about
android nutella you should know that
google has not been above trolling us in
the past and sending us on red herring
suggesting that marshmallow was really
milkshake so remember this could be a
ploy now let's
actually talk about Android and itself
in an announcement post Google notes
that all the new API is introduced an
Android n are now final which means
developers can start compiling their
apps to test against the official
Android and API developers can also
publish updates to the google play store
if you are a developer and you want to
make sure that your updated application
runs well on Android n you want to look
into using google play's beta testing
feature so what's new in the fourth
Android end developer preview it looks
like this google is working hard to make
sure that android runs faster in this
case in two specific ways one when you
are trying to load different languages
in the past google would load all
languages at once but if you don't need
all those languages that's kind of
wasted time and resources so now android
allows you to load just one or two
languages the selected languages that
you actually care about and secondly
android is trying to be more efficient
when it comes to beacons so when you are
shopping at a mall or in different
stores soon you'll start to get beacons
or signals from the shop about possible
coupons or sales or something like that
and android is now limiting these
clients are these api's from sending at
least five notifications every 30
seconds so you can't be bombarded with a
bunch of beacons there by draining your
battery unnecessarily move it on the
news about now on tap which is available
without Google now access now on tap is
a more recent service launched by the
search giant and allows you to get more
information about what's on your screen
instead of having to go and search for
it elsewhere the idea is to make the
internet more personal and easier to
work with for example imagine if you
were having a chat with a friend via SMS
and they invite you to meet them at the
movies now on tap will use this
information to offer a calendar entry to
go to the cinema with that person it
will also show you information about the
movie including reviews YouTube clips
and other information that's relevant to
that discussion you see until recently
you needed to have the full google now
system activated including the cards to
use now on tap the two systems were
interlinked if you disabled the show
cards option in the settings of google
now then it would disable now on tap
however Google is updated the app
separated the need for users to have
google now card switched on the new
switch allows just now on tap to be
enabled of course if you want the full
experience of Google now you really
should enable both Google now and now on
tap you guys remember from like 15 years
ago when people were making money hand
over fist in the.com bubble remember we
didn't call it a dotnet bubble or
dot-org bubble we didn't call them dot
biz billionaires we called them calm
billionaires because that's the power of
a dot-com now why is that because no
domain name extension tells your story
with the same degree of trust as a calm
or dotnet domain name dot com and.net
domain name extensions inject
credibility in to your online presence
say fifteen percent on domain names and
web hosting when you use our coupon code
android at domain.com check out when you
think domain names think domain.com
thanks for your patience this week guys
