handy the Android authority app guy
Netflix has just been released to
countries all over the world and we're
going to take a look at how you can save
yourself some data using opera max for
those who may not know Opera Max is an
application that tries to save you data
it does this by running your web traffic
through opera servers where it is
compressed and then sent to your device
you keep doing whatever it is you want
to do when opera max helps you consume
less data while doing it it should be
noted that opera max works for both
Wi-Fi and mobile data connections
although in this video we only used
Wi-Fi on top of that you can actually
turn applications on or off within the
service so maybe you want Google Chrome
to use regular data and only want the
savings on Netflix that is definitely
possible it's very simple to use you
just open up the application it turn it
on tinker with the settings until
they're where you want them to be and
then go about your merry way with
Netflix releasing all over the world
there will be a lot of people coming
into contact with the service and its
immense data requirements for the first
time using it on your mobile can consume
a lot of data very quickly and a lot of
people around the world have only
limited amounts of data to use each
month that sucks because Netflix has so
much awesome stuff and you can pour a
lot of your data into it very quickly ok
so initially I was going to VPN into
various countries and then test opera
max however I had forgotten that opera
max is a VPN service itself and Android
can really only handle one VPN service
at a time instead I decided to enable
opera max and just start watching some
stuff on Netflix my theory is that since
it's all going through the same opera
servers that the data savings should be
approximately the same everywhere no
matter where you use it I watched a
little red versus blue
Jessica Jones and some orange is the new
black altogether I watched about 30
minutes of video they all took a moment
to load but once they got started the
performance was smooth and the quality
of the video seemed to be pretty good I
didn't get any stuttering or buffering
and the experience was very pleasant
once the test was over I went back to
opera max to observe how much data the
service had saved me according to opera
max I would have used about a hundred
megabytes of total data and opera max
managed to condense that into a scant 46
megabytes
with a savings of about fifty four
megabytes or about 54% this is actually
very impressive and honestly was more
than I was expecting given that the
application claims that they can save up
to 45 percent of data using the Netflix
app if you decide to try this out for
yourself you should expect your numbers
to be a little bit different than mine
but it should still fall between that
40% and 60% savings range if you want to
try opera max for yourself you can find
it in the google play store and we have
a link in the video description below
for quick access as you just saw you can
save quite a bit of data this way on
Netflix as well as other applications
and it really does help extend your data
limits and that about does it for this
video folks don't forget to subscribe to
our YouTube channel if you haven't done
so already and don't forget to check out
the awesome videos we have linked up
right there on the screen if you want to
learn more about opera max we did a
review of the service back when it first
launched and we'll have that linked up
in the video description below as always
thanks for watching everybody and have a
wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
