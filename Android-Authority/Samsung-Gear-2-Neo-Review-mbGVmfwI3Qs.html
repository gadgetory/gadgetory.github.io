Android authority and we've taken a look
at the Samsung gear 2 now it's time to
take a look at its sibling which is
practically the same thing but there are
some notable differences this is the
Samsung gear 2 neo so here it is the
Samsung gear 2 neo and right off the bat
when looking at the gear 2 neo the first
difference that you're going to notice
is the build material unlike the gear 2
which has a metal face the entire front
of the neo is constructed of plastic
including the home button and there's
definitely some pros and cons to it the
biggest Pro being the weight the actual
dimensions of the watch itself is
slightly larger than the gear 2 but it's
a little lighter coming in at 55 grams
making it very comfortable to wear maybe
even a little bit more comfortable than
the gear 2 it still feels very solid
despite the plastic so the only real con
I guess you could say to the Neos
plastic construction is it doesn't look
quite as classy or premium but I guess
that's why Samsung gave us two versions
the other big difference that you're
going to notice is up top and that is
the omission of the camera which to me
is more of a good thing than it is bad I
don't know I guess I'm not sold on
cameras on watches just yet but you do
still get an IR blaster for controlling
your TV which is nice and other than
that the rest of the hardware is pretty
much the same as the gear 2 you still
get the same 1.6 3 inch display that's
very bright vivid and easy to see
outdoors the metal clasp with textured
bands that are replaceable and the heart
rate monitor just like the galaxy s5 and
also like the galaxy s5 the gear 2 neo
is ip67 certified meaning it is dust
proof and water resistant for 1 meter up
to 30 minutes the internal specs are no
different with a 1 gigahertz dual-core
processor 512 megabytes of RAM and 4
gigs of internal storage so you can
expect identical performance here it's
still just as quick and responsive and
I've yet to run into any performance
issues or lag also the same is the 300
milliamp hour battery running the show
and I got pretty awesome battery life
with the gear 2 which was a
about three days and the gear 2 neo is
no exception so battery life is still
very solid here but just keep in mind
that you might get more or less
depending on your usage on the software
side of things the gear 2 neo is running
Samsung Tizen platform and you'll find
very little differences here outside of
not having a camera app but that's to be
expected with no physical camera for
better or worse you still have Samsung's
s voice and their slew of fitness apps
that they've been pushing for quite some
time now
like the pedometer for tracking how many
steps you take and an exercise app for
gauging your running walking cycling and
hiking I do like some of Samsung's
included apps though like find my device
which lets you use your watch to find
your phone and vice-versa through
Samsung's gear manager app considering
they're both still connected to one
another and the MIDI controller which
lets you control your music from your
phone directly from your watch and I
can't vouch for other third-party music
players but it does work with Google
Play Music which to me is a huge plus
the gear 2 neo is available now for $200
which is $100 cheaper than the gear 2
and that might be all it takes to
influence your buying decision keep in
mind though that just like the rest of
Samsung's wearables the gear 2 neo is
compatible with only Samsung devices but
it does offer a lot of extra
functionality that most current
smartwatches do not and an arguably
nicer looking display so there you have
it for the Samsung gear 2 neo if you
loved everything about the gear 2 but
you didn't care about the camera and
wanted a more lightweight watch then the
gear 2 neo is the one for you but that's
pretty much it hopefully you guys
