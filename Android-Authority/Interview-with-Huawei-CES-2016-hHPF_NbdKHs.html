reporting live from CES 2016 has been a
long day
police did a little bit blown out and
I'm here was a
affected colleague of mine mr. bill
Plummer who's VP of strategic external
affairs for Huawei thank you very good
time today sir for meeting with me thank
you yeah so let's talk about 2015 for
huawei not a bad year not a bad year now
we've not we've not yet reported
officially our revenues but we're
talking about sixty billion which is a
slight jump from last year's 46 billion
if you look at just the consumer segment
of the the 60 billion we hit in terms of
consumer revenues last year about 20
billion dollars which is a 70% increase
over the previous year which is really
really remarkable a hundred and eight
million smartphone shipped last year
which is a 44 percent increase over the
previous year so yeah it was a nice year
that's a good year as I'm including
honor or is that just falling good honor
that doesn't clear in terms of the
competitive landscape in terms of you
know what consumers perceive various
brands to be in the space
who would you say are your closest
competitors in 2015 well I mean
depending on the market obviously as a
March and through the year we were the
number one smartphone vendor in China
generally speaking in Europe were number
three Latin America we shipped 12
million of that devices last year also
roughly number three so it seemed a
Samsung Apple Huawei and and you know
the rest cascade down from there
I see yeah definitely well looking in
2016 now you guys do penetrated into the
US market with the launch today on or 5x
it's gonna be the song Amazon right now
for pre-order price of 199 what other
kind of devices do you think are gonna
come to the u.s. in the future well we
the obviously we brought the Nexus the
device this year which is done really
rather well I mean it's sold out in the
first month yeah Google store just sold
out
it's an incredible device yeah it is I
have a few here young yeah not getting
them out just just at the moment I'm
sure you have one I do and the market
well with the PA light and again this is
all through you know big-box retail and
and each channel you will see more on ER
devices coming here you will see a
broader range of Huawei branded devices
coming here and it's sort of a
complementary approach just as the
approach to the US market is similarly
complementary in terms of from a channel
perspective the US market is different
it you know the the carrier channel is
far more pronounced here than anywhere
else yeah and so we're taking a
complementary approach working with the
carriers to fill their portfolios but
then also addressing the consumer
segments that are gonna buy unlock
anyway mm-hmm and and that's where some
of the Huawei device isn't all of the
honor devices are targeted so talk about
the Nexus 6p I mean that was a
breakthrough for volley in a lot of
people's eyes how was it architected
happen how is it achieved and can you
talk about any potential for future
collaboration with Google well I mean it
when you're when you're involved with
Google on a nexus project you're you
know it is a special project in your
organization and so you know one way of
course the consumer business continue to
move along while this project moved
along so it's very collaborative
and in terms of the the inter inter
interaction between Huawei and Google it
is not an initiative of either company
it is truly a joint initiative I think
we enjoyed the experience I believe that
Google enjoyed the experience and I
think that both sides would look forward
to enjoying the experience again
absolutely well consumers absolutely
loved the device and it got our Editors
Choice Award and it was second place in
our best of Android but it was the
reader's choice it was what the readers
wanted to win and anyway it's just a
fantastic device so we really have to
congratulate you for that
well I'm carrying one now and I'm also
carrying them eight eight now and I may
have a p8 on me now so I'm having three
phones which is probably too many I love
it
I look though I'm torn between the Nexus
and the mate 8 yeah and I think that the
winner in the maintains just it's
exquisite especially the device it
really is you know maybe for my personal
preference it's too large but I thought
we talked about this a year or two ago
where dude I've got this phablet phobia
I know you did there's a media pad x2
that we are talking about I mean it's
big but it's beautiful it is gorgeous so
what kind of challenges this Huawei face
in 2016 well I think is I mean
industry-wide we're
we're moving towards you wander around
here at this show and and everyone's
talking about wearables or other
connected devices or connected solutions
or what-have-you and and that's great
and this is the you know the so called
interweb of stuff or I hate IOT as a
phrase I do too
but it is what it is so we'll call it
iOS or iw OS in a web of stuff and you
can replace the stuff with an S word of
your choice but that's all exciting and
that's all very sexy but how is all that
going to work yes so from a consumer
perspective Huawei obviously is we're in
the wearables business we're doing
terribly well in the modules business
working with particularly the German
automobile manufacturers taking an
approach there where I said look we
don't we don't know the vehicular
environment you guys figure out the user
interface we make radios we make damn
good radio yeah you do
and so you know so that's a that's a big
business for us as well and then
populating a range of devices that gives
you know a variety of consumer segments
we're not a one-trick pony like some
know some comfortable sent our
competitors yes but then there is that
infrastructure business and all which is
massive yeah yeah and all the magic of
wearables and all the magic of the
interweb of stuff is only gonna work if
you got the network's to support it you
need that infrastructure and and you
know if imagine you know 2g your imagine
3G as a little stream through the forest
and 4G is the river fed by the stream
well 5 G's gonna have to be the ocean
ocean has to be yep you're right because
otherwise we've already said 100 billion
connections plus by 2025 yep at 10 Giga
second bare minimum and with sub
microsecond latency because some of
those connections might be telemedicine
related yeah exactly kind of a not a
good thing you need it and in a smart
car environment the same thing building
out those networks is going to be
critically important and we are already
600 million dollars invested in R&amp;amp;D for
5g network technology there won't be
deployed
half a decade hmm setting a building and
understanding this year as we continue
to build our consumer brand but help the
industry also understand we need to work
together getting to 100 billion
connections is gonna be a collaborative
effort doesn't seem like the industry is
prepared to be honest
particularly markets like the US where
it seems to be quite a bit slower in
terms of adopting the latest generation
technology it'll be I think that when
the u.s. actually in in terms of LTE you
know the Lua US was definitely behind
than 3G the u.s. actually led to some
extent 4G deployment largely because
they were so far behind in 3G yeah and
also because the Europeans bankrupted
themselves in buying spectrum for 3G
it's an Achon also a leader in LTE or 4G
deployment it's it's between now and
five years from now the things that we
will be doing that the devices and the
solutions that will be connected and and
the the graduation you and I will carry
a smartphone five ten years from now at
some point along the way it's going to
go away
it's there's going to be a wearable here
or a wearable in your clothes or some
solution that's in your smart car your
smart home and so that evolution is one
we all need to be preparing for is it
will be profound and something that
Huawei as you know as the world leader
in infrastructure and as a top-three
soon well as aspiring to be top two in
terms of devices solution we think it's
important to be driving this
conversation and looking forward and
it's a responsibility as an innovative
leader to be a part of the conversation
and you know that does bring you know a
very logical next question which is you
know Holly was demonized you know
unfairly or fairly depending on your
perspective my perspectives clear yeah
so you're right there but I mean the
United States clearly has you know some
kind of disdain for of always technology
but yet hallway still produces as you
say the world's leading you know five
view solutions that are coming down the
pipe and you guys are selling buildings
at all its equipment to carries around
the world annually yeah so is that going
to inhibit or hurt United States
technological progress if they're
unwilling to play ball so to speak that
was then this is now yeah you know there
was you know Huawei was a victim of some
unfortunate collateral damage in the
us-china geopolitical relationship a few
years ago yes and since then as a result
of a number of certain revelations like
prism it is driven a better
understanding including with
policymakers of the nature of this
industry I mean come on whether you're a
Huawei or a Cisco or an Eric Simon's and
and those concerns by the way didn't
apply to consumer they only apply to
network yeah you know we're all global
companies we're all interdependent we're
all intertwined we're all relying on
common supply chains and I think the
understanding that exists today
including among political minded is much
more mature than it was then and in
knowing that look to the extent that
there are vulnerabilities very Universal
and so let's find you know reasonable
rational and commercially logical ways
to address them and particularly with
with you know the need to extend
broadband today and prepare for for
whatever tomorrow's broadband is ensure
competition in the marketplace and with
you know Nokia and Alcatel coming
together it'd be imperative is even
stronger for American carriers for
instance to make it clear they when they
get ready for 5g they want they want a
competitive space they need us they do
they need to pit the competitors against
one another to drive down the cost you
know I'll take your network widget and
your network what's it and since they're
interoperable built to the same standard
I'm gonna put those together so you guys
got to bid yourselves yeah and compete
on quality compete on price compete on
technology and compete on security
assurance
that's where we'll be that's extremely
well said thank you that's exactly what
I have right here because I'm extremely
erudite man
so winners losers 2016 any any
predictions looking at her crystal ball
do you think things are gonna be more
the same our heads gonna roll you know
keep gonna make a comeback
oh we were talking about the election
well no oh yeah okay who's gonna win oh
god I can't two careers ago I was a
diplomat as a diplomat I was not allowed
to actually have a or at least not
publicly have any political affiliation
her preferences and and I've done a good
job of since then not telegraphing any
preferences this is one of the weirdest
yes campaigns I've ever seen
I'm I'm firmly hoping that America
remains a marginally rational country in
the future doesn't seem like it will
though no I think we will I don't just
need to get this out of our system yeah
we're working through that yes we are
and that's kind of like Southern Oregon
is no longer part of the United States
apparently I didn't know that well we'll
fix that okay I don't work itself out
oh it's not a real country either fairly
okay but in the industry I think it's
gonna be I mean it the evolution of
smartphones is going to continue to to
to be fast-paced I mean the the cadence
of that industry right now and wearables
is so much faster than the most
energetic sectors I don't see that
changing there are no you know huge big
infrastructure deals going on really
anywhere everyone is you know building
out 4G and and and you know getting the
you know where their capacity issues you
have microsomes and pico cells or
coverage issues or or even as always
doing here in the US and you know some
of the rural areas and Eastern
Washington Eastern Oregon we even
deployed gigabit city solutions for
places where the major carriers just
simply weren't there yeah I've heard
that um so those you know it's I think
it'll be more of the same this year
kind of like the evolution of this show
year to here it's only the first day and
I've been around
um I'm waiting still there's always at
some point there's always an aha I got
your oh wow I haven't haven't seen it
yet I don't know I haven't seen you
there and it's my fifth time doing it
but I know there would be something
significant
well once we're off camera I'm going to
tell you about something I heard about
no not going to say it on camera we'll
have to stay tuned for that
yes mr. Plummer a real pleasure and
honor thank you guys starts to the
cuvette from CES 2016 reporting signing
