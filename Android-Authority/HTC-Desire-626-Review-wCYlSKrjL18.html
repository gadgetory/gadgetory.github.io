desire lineup boasts both a bold design
and an affordable price tag but is HTC's
attempt enough to compete with the likes
of Motorola and Asus this is Bailey
Stein with Android authority and this is
my full review of the HTC Desire 6 to 6
the desire 6 to 6 is design is very
similar to that of last year's Desire
eye with a few tweaks go on is the
larger 13 megapixel front facing camera
and with it goes the camera shutter
button there's also an absence of a dual
LED flash presumably to cut down on
costs while the design could be
considered recycled there was never
really anything wrong with held the
desire I looked or felt in the hand and
that remains the case with the 6 to 6
with 6 different color options each
featuring complementary accents there's
a good chance that you'll find one that
suits your taste regardless of the color
option however the desire 6 to 6 is
certain to feel nice in the hand
although the phone is made of entirely
plastic it still feels fairly solid it's
also relatively thin and light at 8.1
millimeters and 139 grams while you
can't access the 2000 milliamp hour
battery you can access both a single SIM
slot and a micro SD card slot by opening
the flap on the left side of the device
HTC says that you can expand the storage
by up to 200 gigabytes if the eight
gigabytes of internal storage isn't
enough the power and volume buttons are
positioned on the right side of the
device and both are disappointingly
mushy there's little tactile feedback
and while HTC may not have the best
record for tactile feeling buttons it's
a shame that they didn't take this
opportunity to improve on this from the
desire eye on the front you'll find a
single front facing speaker on the
bottom below HTC's branding as well as a
2 megapixel front facing camera on the
top to the left of the earpiece the five
inches 720p display on the desire 6 to 6
looks all right with good viewing angles
it's a bit on the warmer side but not by
much there does seem to be some
weirdness going on with sharpening where
texts and app icons look a bit off to my
surprise there's no sending option to
turn this off and it's unclear why this
is like this
powered by the quad-core
2:10 clocked at one point one gigahertz
the desire 626 is a tad on the slower
side well I never had the phone freeze I
did notice some leg in certain areas as
well as frequent stuttering during
animations it's definitely still usable
and the one-and-a-half gigabyte of RAM
is nice to see and serve the one
gigabyte and provides a better
multitasking experience with the adrenal
304 the desire 626 is able to play most
casual games but higher-end games seem
to struggle a bit in addition to slow
load times I also noticed frequent frame
drops in asphalt 8 on high-end
occasional frame drops ball on medium
the HTC Desire 6 to 6 is equipped with
802 11 and Wi-Fi GPS and GLONASS and
Bluetooth 4.1 although the Wi-Fi signal
is limited to 2.4 gigahertz I found the
speeds and signal to be about on par
with other devices since the desire 6 to
6 will be sold by US carriers you can be
sure that each variant will fully
support 4G LTE on it's respectable
network while there is a single front
facing speaker on the bottom of the
desire 6 to 6
there's sadly no boom sound the speaker
itself is a bit distorted and could be
louder but it's still much better than
virtually all rear facing speakers the
2000 milliamp hour 9 user replaceable
battery provides disappointing battery
life and will make it through a full day
of use for many people during my battery
life test I took the phone off the
charger at 9:30 a.m. and was able to get
it to last until about 9:30 p.m. with
just over two hours of screen on time
oddly enough HTC Sense UI hides screen
on time values so that number was
provided by GCM battery monitor what's
more unfortunate than the battery
capacity is the fact that you can't swap
it out even if needed thankfully there
is a power saver mode as well as an
extreme power saver mode if you need to
get the phone to lash just a little bit
longer the eight megapixel rear camera
is slightly better than average for this
price point and it does perform quite
well in properly lit conditions it does
struggle when processing bright colors
however but otherwise offers respectable
image quality
HTC's camera app
offers a bunch of different shooting
modes settings to change maximum ISO
exposure value and white balance you can
even save your settings as a shooting
mode for later access which is a very
handy feature running android 5.1
lollipop with HTC Sense 7 out of the box
the desire 66 provides a very good
software experience since it is an HTC
device you'll be getting HTC blinkfeed
launcher powerful multi-tasking menu
customizable quick toggles and general
interface tweaks HTC skin may be a
departure from stock Android but unlike
a few other Android skins it still
offers a very nice user interface with a
clear focus on design my only complaint
about the software is the amount of blow
wear that comes pre-installed out of the
box well it will depend on your carrier
my 18 T review unit included nearly a
dozen AT&amp;amp;T apps just general crap
digital life while tangent gains keeper
key VPN look out uber yellow pages and a
whole collection of redundant HTC apps
are also present
there's even three separate apps for
reading email pre-installed which may
confuse some users luckily you can
uninstall most of the bloatware but it's
still very annoying unlike on the HTC
one devices there's sadly no double tap
to wake or other gestures available on
the 6 to 6
I also have doubts that this device will
be updated to Android marshmallow as HTC
has refused to update similar devices
like the Desire 610 in the past if you
do end up purchasing this phone don't
expect to receive any operating system
updates the HTC Desire 626 will be
available for purchase on several US
carriers soon but you do need to be
aware that the model that we're
referring to in this review is actually
a refined edition of the six to six
proper released back in March sometimes
referred to as the 6 to 6s but still
branded as the 6 to 6 it's a bit
confusing but you can easily tell the
difference between the two by looking at
the specifications if you're on a tee
you'll be able to acquire the HTC Desire
6 to 6 for $1 with a two-year contract
or for about $185 on AT&amp;amp;T next spread
out across 28 months although the HTC
Desire 6 to 6 offers a very nice
design and build quality a good camera
and an excellent software experience its
flaws are significant the display does
seem to have some sharpening issues the
performance is relatively poor and the
battery won't last many users through a
full day of use while the desired 6 to 6
may have been a good choice at this
price a year ago the market today is
much more competitive with competing
options like the $200 Asus zenfone 2 and
$180 moto G third generation even if you
are a diehard HTC fan you'd be much
better off by picking up a used one m8
for about $200 thank you for watching
