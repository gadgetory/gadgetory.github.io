the more premium pricing segment of the
smartphone market that leaves some room
for other companies to step up into the
budget-friendly flagship space and asus
looks like they're up for the challenge
this is their latest flagship the
zenfone 6 and for starters it's going to
cost $4.99 in the US which is kind of
insane for everything that you're
getting you're still getting the latest
snapdragon 855 processor and the $500
base model will snag you 6 gigabytes of
RAM and 64 gigs of storage there's a
couple of other configurations with 8
gigs of ram and more storage but at the
time of this video as Zeus has it
confirmed the pricing on those models
just yet but you can probably assume
it'll be at least 50 to $100 more one of
the most unique aspects of the zenfone 6
is the fact that it doesn't have a
front-facing camera and that's because
it actually uses the rear cameras for
everything the rear cameras can flip out
and face towards you via a motorized
mechanism this is kind of similar to the
galaxy a8 II that we saw from Samsung
fairly recently but instead of rising
and then flipping this just flips
straight out and I gotta admit it's
pretty freakin cool the biggest benefit
to this is you're getting the same
quality across the board whether you're
taking a picture of a landscape or an
ordinary selfie a soos didn't skimp on
the camera sensors either the main
sensor is the 48 megapixel Sony IMX
which is one of the best camera sensors
on the market right now that a lot of
phones are starting to use and it's
paired with a 13 megapixel ultra
wide-angle sensor the wide angle lens is
going to afford you a lot of flexibility
like being able to take a group selfie
without having to stretch your arms out
or use a selfie stick god forbid and
it'll also be really great for vlogging
purposes you can flip the cameras out
just by tapping the camera rotation
button in the camera app which probably
seems pretty obvious but one really cool
thing that a soos lets you do is if you
tap and hold on the camera rotation
button you can drag up or down to angle
the cameras however you want I'm not
entirely sure what the practical
benefits of
are in real-world use but it's still
pretty cool that a soos lets you do it
having this flip out mechanism also
changes the way that you would take a
panorama normally you would have to turn
the camera yourself
but these zenfone 6 will automatically
rotate the camera for you and this means
you can even capture yourself in the
panorama or take a vertical panorama if
you really wanted to also if you happen
to drop these infamous it's a
gravitational sensor inside that will
cause the cameras to automatically close
up to prevent the mechanism from getting
damaged the flip out mechanism does end
up making these n phone six a little bit
thicker than some other flagships but as
soos makes really good use of that extra
space by packing a massive 5,000
milliamp hour battery inside which
hopefully will translate into really
good battery life since the zenfone 6
doesn't have a front-facing camera and
the fingerprint sensor is on the back
this allows the entire front of the
phone to have an uninterrupted display
with thin vessels without resorting to a
notch or hole punch it is an IPS display
and not AMOLED but to my eyes that looks
pretty good so far and it's all
protected in Gorilla Glass 6 now
something that a soos has improved
drastically on the zenfone 6 from
previous cell phones is the software
they've pretty much done away with the
Zen UI which always felt really clunky
and bloaty and have gone with a more
stock like Android experience they're
pretty much taking the oneplus approach
here where the software looks and feels
like stock but it still has extra
features baked in but those features are
implemented much more seamlessly there's
still some Zen UI stuff that remains
intact like these Zen motion gestures
but for the sake of simplicity there now
just called gestures it will be running
Android Pi at launch but as news has
gone ahead and included a dark mode so
you don't have to wait for Android cue
the zenfone 6 is slated to receive an
update to Android Q and will also be
supported by the Android Q beta program
if you want to try it out a little early
so since this phone costs five hundred
dollars you're probably thinking there's
some sort of a catch and there is it
doesn't have an IP rating or wireless
charging even
it's got a glass back but if you want
those things you're going to have to
look at bones that cost several hundred
dollars more the zenfone 6 does however
have a headphone jack and it also has an
extra hardware key called the smart key
it defaults to Google assistant but you
can remap it to a handful of other
functions like the flashlight or camera
anyways that's pretty much gonna do it
for this hands-on of the zenfone 6 do
you think this phone is a good value for
500 dollars let us know down in the
comments below thanks for watching and
I'll talk to you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
