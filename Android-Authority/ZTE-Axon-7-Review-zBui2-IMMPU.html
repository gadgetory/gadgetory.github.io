with Android authority and here it is
the ZTE axon 7 it's a $400 unlocked dual
sim smartphone that works on all major
carriers in the US
but should you buy it let's find out in
our video review of the ZTE axon 7 the X
on sevens design is largely a refinement
of what we saw last year with the first
axon this time around zg has used an
aluminum unibody
free of any edges or plastic caps it's a
more traditional take yes there are many
things to love about this design the
build quality for one is excellent and
the curved shape is both elegant and
ergonomic I really like the recessed
fingerprint reader on the back too isn't
made actually finding the reader much
easier the reader is both fast and
accurate and easily beat cell phones
like the Nexus 6p the camera hump is
well there but it's not terrible it's
not enough to make the phone wobble on a
table anyway unless using excessive
force ZTE tells us that this phone was
designed with the help of design works
which is actually a us-based BMW Group
subsidiary I can definitely see this in
the axon 7s design even without the
small designed in the USA take on the
back serving as a reminder so for the
navigation keys ZTE actually ended up
going with 3 non-illuminated
indeterminate capacitive keys for the US
release although it's at first difficult
to determine which key does why I found
the ability to change the layout in the
settings to be invaluable personally I
don't really care that the keys are not
illuminated but I feel that they could
be spaced out a little more one other
thing this phone is really slippery
and the curved side edges certainly
don't help it can be challenging to grip
at times and reaching for the
notification panel makes me especially
nervous overall though a big thumbs up
for the accent sevens design moving on
to the display we're looking at a 5.5
inch quad HD
AMOLED panel so yeah it looks great on
paper and it's even better in person
with excellent sharpness punchy and
saturated colors deep blacks and decent
sunlight readability there's not much
more we could ask for from a smartphone
display and it's kind of crazy that ZTE
was able to include this given the axon
sevens price
there's also Gorilla Glass 4 for scratch
resistance and I really like how the
display curves down to meet with the
Schappert aluminum oh and it's being
powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820
which has been used in every major
flagship this year it should come as no
surprise that day today performance is
buttery smooth I didn't notice any leg
with the axon 7 and the 4 gigabytes of
RAM was enough to handle heavy
multitasking if you're a gamer you'll
find that the Adreno 530 is more than
enough for pretty much every Android
game out there what sets the axon 7
apart from other Chinese smartphones is
its compatibility with every major u.s.
4G LTE network and since it's unlocked
and dual SIM you can use two individual
lines with this single phone I was very
happy to learn that ZTE decided to not
only double the phone storage from last
year to 64 gigabytes but also to include
a microSD card expansion slot up to 256
gigabytes that's a feature that we all
love to see even if it means having to
give up one of the SIM card slots the
axon 7 includes dual independent - audio
chips for both listening and recording
and yeah it admittedly can sound a bit
gimmicky but the accent sevens audio
output is excellent especially when
streaming at higher bit rates even with
an $8 pair of earbuds I found the sound
to be louder and fuller than many other
smartphones as far as recording is
concerned
well this voiceover was recorded
entirely with the axon 7 and the rode
smartlav microphone for conferences and
other less formal recordings ZT states
that the dual noise cancelling
microphones are able to clearly capture
voices up to 8 meters away that's great
and all but the true highlight is the
exon 7
dual front-facing stereo speakers with
Dolby Atmos surround sound technology to
put it frankly the listening experience
is extraordinary sound is impressively
clear loud and full I also didn't notice
much Distortion
even at full volume these speakers make
watching movies listening to music or
playing games much more immersive and
give the HTC's boomsound a run for its
money thankfully ZTE went with a
reversible USB type-c port and also
implemented quick charge 3.0 which lets
you charge the phone from 0 to 50 in
just 30 minutes
unlike some manufacturers ZTE included a
quick charge 3.0 charger in the box - so
you won't be needing to go out and buy
one yourself actual battery life holds
up quite well - and I'd say that it's on
par with the galaxy s7 maybe even just a
bit better I was at first worried that
the 3,250 milliamp hour battery wouldn't
be enough considering the axon sevens
hardware but I was consistently able to
achieve upwards of 5 hours of screen on
time with a full day of heavy use with
moderate use that amount could be
stretched to 6 hours one of the most
important aspects of the modern
smartphone is of course how well the
camera performs the X on sevens camera
looks pretty killer based on the specs -
it's 20 megapixels with an F 1.8
aperture and optical image stabilization
and in good lighting most images come
out sharp with good contrast and
accurate color reproduction with that
said the camera app didn't always nail
exposure and there can be a lack of
vividness in certain shots but overall
I'd say that the camera does very well
in good lighting for video it does 4k at
30fps and even supports the newer h-back
codec there's also an 8 megapixel
front-facing camera which can also
record video at up to 1080p at 30fps
although the camera specs may make the
exon 7 seem like a low-light champ
low-light images came out soft with
muted colors I did notice an excessive
amount of noise reduction taking place
in
most of the images so it's possible that
low-light could be improved with some
image processing software improvements
but for now low light performance with
the axon 7 feels much like a compromise
I did enjoy using the camera app however
the automatic mode automatically turns
things like HDR and night mode on well
the manual mode is also very powerful
the additional filters and modes like
panorama and time-lapse are also
appreciated I think that ZTE s idea of
using the fingerprint reader as a
shutter button is ingenious and the
capture and cheese commands work
surprisingly well in regards to software
the exon 7 is running ZTE s me favored
UI 4.0 / Android 6.0 point 1 marshmallow
but actually out of the box a stock
Android theme is selected by default
with the stock theme UI changes are
expected ly minimal there are no major
changes here and the minor changes ZTE
has made feel justified for the most
part for example there's a clear all
button in the multitasking view
something which a lot of people have
been asking for a while now there are a
lot of functional changes - one of those
is the dynamic wallpaper feature which
can change the lock screen each time you
unlock the axon 7 there's also some
gestures like double tap to wake and
Shake twice for flash lighting when we
spoke with ZTE they seemed very focused
on delivering a superior user experience
so for example when you hold the accent
7 up to your ear it asks who do you want
to call 6 1 1 as much as I think ZTE has
done an excellent job on the software I
feel that some areas could use some
additional polish there's a lot of
little things that are simply annoying
like the fact that you have to tap the
notification Bell every time you want to
see notifications on the lock screen
overall though the software is pretty
good and it's easily ZTE the best
attempt yet you can purchase the exon 7
in either ion gold or quartz gray for
$400 from various retailers there are
some special goodies included in the box
including some earbuds a SIM door eject
tool attachable - a keychain micro USB
to USB type
the adapter as well as a clear silicon
case but that's only the beginning as
the exon 7 includes axon Passport 2.0 a
two-year premium warranty it's a pretty
compelling offer especially once you
consider how inexpensive the accent 7
already is it's evident that ZTE has
scored a massive amount of time and
effort in order to make the axon 7 the
home run that it is although the exon
sevens camera may not be the best the
phone otherwise feels largely
uncompromised and that's why I'm making
the accent 7 my daily driver and I think
you should too
