Austin Texas to talk to the team behind
the Legends series of Android mmo's
organ you take a look at what goes into
making these games and where the company
goes from here arcane legends arcane
legends is the fourth in the Legend
series of games we started years ago
with game called Pocket legends and
Pocket Legends did extremely well for
spacetime Studios we followed up with a
couple of other legends titles refining
the kind of gameplay the sort of
experience that you could have various
features in the game and wound up in a
position for arcane legends where we
could take the best of everything an
extremely fast extremely responsive
action-oriented combat system really
deep skill trees and an addition of
companions and we have pets now in the
game that make it an incredible and
different experience in arcane legends
is our best-in-class mobile MMO it's
extremely easy to get into extremely fun
to play but has an enormous depth the
sort of depth that you would expect from
the kinds of games that we make long
cycle lots of quests lots of things for
you to do player 2 player adventures
both cooperatively and against your
buddies you know arcane legends really
is so far our finest date our finest
multiplayer game my finest MMO and by
far one of the best mobile games
I think anybody's going to play it's a
really rich title
how long did it take you or the people
that you work with it's waste time to
decide on arcane legends as the fourth
installment for their any other ideas
being floated around and it you honed in
on archaeology as the chief visionary
officer for space-time it's my
responsibility to bring products to the
fore and in the case of something like
arcane legends it felt like a really
natural progression for the team I work
at a couple of different levels I have
partners that founded space-time and
together and we work through some of the
more difficult creative issues but I
have an incredible team of game
designers Eli holding the design
director Nicholas Johansen for instance
they'e the head of content and game
systems and these guys really understand
these kinds of products and had an idea
that we would make the ultimate mobile
MMO and that we would take the best part
of our combat of the most explosive and
interesting aspects of being these
characters and then the richness of the
quest and content everything else that
we've done over three previous mobile
hem memos and essentially moosh it all
together into something extremely badass
there were a number of different
products that we thought about along the
way and they're all within our
wheelhouse the team is extremely good at
multiplayer real-time and so there are
all kinds of products that really
exploited that in our history involves
things like spaceships four or five
people driving a spaceship spaceship to
ground combat and that kind of thing so
a lot of that came up and we love racing
we love vehicles it's pretty much any
time we also love more patient and
strategic games too and in the process
before we decided that we were committed
to arcane legends we did think of a
bunch of different other properties but
realistically when we compared those and
how successful how fun that would be to
making
really what would be the very best
legends kind of game it just arcane
legends just stood out over everything
else the most fun easily the most
accessible game for us but also we knew
we would make it extremely extremely fun
dark legends came out how long did it or
how long did it take for y'all to decide
that you were ready for a fourth
installment and see along with that how
long did it take from deciding on the
concept to but actually appearing we
moved pretty quickly around here at
space-time so the decision to move
forward with arcane legends really took
about six weeks maybe a month or so so
in the process of creating an MMO game
in the way that we do it we get towards
the end of our development and the game
is playable and the game is fun maybe
has some issues and we're working out
those issues it's very different phase
months prior to this like for dark
legends which launched early this year
we're working very hard just to make
sure all the content was in all various
game system with all the items and all
that kind of stuff but that really
starts to tail down quickly prior to the
release of the game and we're just doing
bug fixes and we're just we're just
refining the product so it's in that
period that all the creatives within the
business here start to say well I'd love
to do a game like this or why don't we
do racing why don't we go into space and
you know how about monsters and all that
kind of stuff starts to happen and while
that's happening we're finalizing dark
legends we're getting ready for it to
release on all the various platforms and
so we have a few good ideas then and
then probably right after dark legends
made its debut we started seriously
looking at the fourth legends title and
looking at what decisions we made around
dark legends that that we liked and what
we didn't there are things about dark
legends in particular that we
we've really adored the combat we wanted
to do something in a multiplayer context
that nobody really done before we wanted
to do action-oriented charging skills no
auto-locking target no Wight damage loop
we wanted it to feel really visceral and
from dark legends we succeeded with that
we wanted to see that in a magical and
evil context where I could be different
player classes that you understand but
then now doing stuff that's just really
different when I'm charging up in order
to get various combos from my player
skills and my weapons and you know that
just that just felt like an awesome
opportunity for us there with arcane
legends but from that point
Chika's puts us in the very early part
of this year it took us between I would
say about five maybe six months to move
from the idea we're gonna do it to all
right it's done we've got a lot of stuff
in the game it looks a certain way we've
got items dropping so on and so forth
and yeah that was a significant amount
of work but you know the team team knows
what they're doing the team knows how to
make these kinds of products extremely
well so making the basics and the
general population the basic AI basic
weapons all of that moves very fast from
us it was about the distinctive
qualities the pet system and how the
companions grow with you how the skills
and the skill trees work all of the
stuff that was a huge improvement on the
existing legend stuffs that really took
the time but a few months worth of
development and we had a functional very
fun MMO and we just needed to start
adding those features that were gonna
make arcane legends distinctly arcane
legends when I look at pocket which was
the first installment religion series
setting wise do you think that there are
some similarities and how are they
similar how are they different
and what did the designers do to make
our King legends distinctly different
and fresh well we have a style as a
studio and that's something that I'm
very proud of when we do medieval
fantasy we have sort of a
a snarky kind of funny look at what
medieval fantasy is all about and when
we decided to make pocket legends in
Pocket Legends is very much what now in
the first few days pocket legends was a
lot like arcane legends is today it's a
lot more serious humans in a world of
evil you know humans and the power of
goodness in life all kind of stuff but
it was pretty pretty quickly in the
process we decided that we're gonna go
with animals and this sort of its own
story with pocket legends and that world
though that world is still a medieval
fantasy world that's more of a storybook
more of a fractured fairy tales and less
of a serious and dark fantasy and that's
that's something that's just as a studio
we do so when we decided we were going
to go back to medieval fantasy for our
fourth a legends title we knew we needed
to do some stuff to freshen head up and
so we took a little bit more of a
serious approach not to the to the tone
but to the way we told the story in
Pocket legends the story is told in a
pretty haphazard way where it's just the
quest dialogue and a handful of
cinematics for arcane legends we wanted
to treat the story with a lot of respect
because we worked very hard in order to
create characters that you could
understand with motivations that make
sense and so we invested really heavily
in a cinematic system in conversations
in ambient barks and the way in which
the world reacts to the players progress
to the world and we feel like that's
that's um that's a major change of just
how the technology and how the design
team has decided to how to change the
way that the world works but watching
what we wanted to do what you wanted to
bring the focus back to you know
believable story
motivations and having evil characters
who have their root have dysfunctions
that you can understand and that as a
hero your opportunities to win the day
are pretty clear and that's the way the
story begins some of the key differences
between arcane legends and pocket
legends it just deals with the depth of
the story and the kinds of characters
that are involved trying to move the
world forward one of the things that we
from the very GetGo of our Payne legends
though is to make the pet companions
critical to the story we have this
vision where the world in arcane legends
is seething with this arcane magic and
that magic is available to the player
but its availability has a lot to do
with the companions in fact the destiny
of this entire world is tied up with
these pets the kid cat and the dog and
the bird and all that they actually have
an epic destiny that you're a part of
and we're not revealing anything about
where that goes but that's really the
critical distinction three classes in
arcane legends in the warrior the road
and the sorcerer what do they bring to
the table
and how did y'all decide that these were
the best food in classes technically
from our perspective it's a a classic
trilogy so those the the Trinity with
the classic Trinity of those three
classes makes it fun for us to create
content where you know there's monsters
that are going to eat a lot of health
points so it's important today it's
gonna be monsters that are going to have
a lot of defense ability that are going
to need to be locked down then you need
to crowd control that you're going to
need to put certain VPS moves on in
order to defeat them that's all really
fun and keeping it to those three you
know making a cord out of the tanking
the DPS and support feels like we can
make a bunch of different kinds of
content that make the player groups
really entertained entertain those
groups of three and four entertained as
one or two as well and you know that's
really where all that comes from I know
you briefly touched on this earlier in
terms of like extra character classes or
the destiny of these pets in our
colleges but can you can you hint at any
other features that you've got planned
in arcane legends even if they're just
like you know Santa Christmas gay we're
working on there are holiday content
right now we've got a couple of ideas
and I don't know where the team is with
that but I think there are a couple of
different things that we really enjoy
like for instance in in dark legends
there's a ghost that pops out sometimes
when you're destroying stuff we've got
one idea where there's this sort of evil
elf that shows up when you swing stuff
and maybe he's got some things for you I
don't know but it's gonna be fun and
that's that's the main thing is that the
team is is having a blast coming up with
ideas and ultimately the ideas that's
gonna make it are the ones that we know
are going to be really fun for the
people playing it with arcane legends we
now see four games in the Legend series
pocket star dark and arcane how long
before we see the fifth installment in
the legend series
have internal discussions already
started and space time see themselves
moving potentially in another direction
finding another mind sure like another
genre you know whether we want to go
back to harbor where with one experience
you know something modern or science
fiction you know those things are on the
table but there's not a lot of urgency
surrounding them and I think it has to
do with the fact that we're in love with
our King right now and unlike the
previous game both star and dark were
immediately looking at next titles this
one I want to hang out with quite a
while I'd like to see where the next
campaign goes really want to pay off
some of the stories stuff that we've
built into it and really try to try to
make it an epic upon epic experience any
last words before we wrap up oh well
thank you very much for coming I
appreciate you spending the time to talk
it's always great to talk about space
time I'm really proud that I work here
and that's my partners and I've we've
gone through a lot and the team that has
been here that has put out so much
effort and he's given us so much of
their time and their talent it's
humbling I mean working in independent
games from coming from a corporate game
reality every day is a it's a reason to
be thankful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
