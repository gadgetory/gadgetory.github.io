sometimes you need to share to another
person whatever is displayed on your
screen for such occasions what you need
is a screen shot do you want to learn
how to take screenshots and your Android
in this video I'll teach you how a
screen shot is a snapshot of your phone
or tablet screen
some people make screenshots to share to
friends or colleagues while others use
screenshots to take note of something
important other devices screens whatever
your purpose for taking screen snaps
they're easy to make on Android however
the procedure for taking screenshots may
vary according to the Vice software
version or even ROM there are many ways
to capture screenshots on Android but
generally it involves pressing button
combinations on your device the most
widely used combo is the volume down and
power button combo this is the button
combo used on most Sony LG and Google
Nexus devices ass Wallace from Samsung
devices the home and power button combo
is also used as in the case of some HTC
devices and some recent Samsung devices
there are also other alternate methods
that don't need button combinations
device manufacturers often add custom
ways to grab screen ease the Samsung S
Pen for instance can be used to grab
screen ease I'll tell you more about
such alternate methods as we go along
on most Samsung phones including the
Galaxy s2 and galaxy s3 you can capture
a screenshot by holding down the home
button and power button at the same time
until the screen flashes and you hear
the camera shutter sound the home and
power combo also works for the Galaxy
Note and galaxy note 2 for certain
Samsung devices without a physical home
button such as the Galaxy Note 10.1 at
the Galaxy camera the volume down in
power button combo usually works certain
recently released high-end Samsung
phones support hand motions by enabling
the palm swipe to capture option you can
take screenshots just by swiping your
palm over the screen like this the
Galaxy Note Galaxy Note 2 and galaxy s3
for example have this feature
even Samson's magical s-pen for the
Galaxy Note series can be used as a
magic wand to catch some screen EES just
hold down the pen button and touch the
screen until the screen flashes this
works even on the Galaxy Note 10.1
speaking of Galaxy Note 10.1 this tablet
has its own virtual screen shot button
of course the volume down and power key
combo works too but those keys can be
tiresome to reach on a tablet this huge
especially if you take a lot of
screenings this quick launch button here
can be set to capture screenshots just
tap it to grab a snapshot for HTC
devices such as the One X Desire X and
desire you the button combo to use is
still home plus power but with a slight
difference from the usual instead of
holding down both buttons simultaneously
you hold down the power button first
then quickly tap the capacitive home
button there screenshot captured what
about on Sony Xperia phones for these
the button combo to use as power and
volume down let me demonstrate it using
the Xperia T hold down the two buttons
at the same time and they're screening
captured this key combo works for the
other experience too such as the Xperia
TX Xperia v and Xperia J there's an
alternate method to through the power
menu although this method doesn't seem
to be present in all experience hold
down the power button until the power
dialog appears then tap on take
screenshot to capture the screen
underneath the dialog on most LG phones
such as the Optimus Gene just long press
the volume down and power buttons
together to take a screenshot another
interesting way to grab a screen
snapshot is by using the quick memo
applet you can launch it from the
notification shade like this or you can
press the volume up and volume down keys
together to save the screenshot just tap
the Save button at the corner or you can
write or draw annotations on the screen
first before you save it last but not
least the Nexus devices whether on the
Galaxy Nexus Nexus 4 Nexus 7 or Nexus 10
the method for grabbing screenshots is
uniform press the volume down and power
buttons at the same time and
the screen flashes and the screenshot
thumbnail flashes on the screen now you
know how to grab screenshots of your
Android devices screen you can share
your screenshots to your colleagues you
can even edit them after all they are
just plain images I hope you find this
