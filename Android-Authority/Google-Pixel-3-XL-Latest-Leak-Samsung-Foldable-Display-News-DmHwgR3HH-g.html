want to see the Google pixel 3xl and we
got you covered but what I want to talk
about is what no one else is talking
about the fact that the prototype was
found in a lift a lift it's mentioned in
the title in the Android headlines
source article also at Android authority
many other sites are copying that and
mentioning lift in the title in the
article several times why is it
mentioned why is it so important that it
was picked up in a lift a company that
is partly owned by alphabet aka
Google is that not suspiciously good
accidental marketing I think so you
might be thinking JC yeah but Google
owns part of uber also true but uber
doesn't need the same marketing lift
that's right as first reported by
Android police a lyft driver noticed a
phone in the backseat of his car after
dropping off several passengers and
believed that it was a pixel to excel
but after spotting the notch display and
the Google logo he realized that he had
found someone's pre-production pixel 3xl
yeah as you can see from the images here
there isn't anything new about the
handset that we haven't known from
previous leaks and rumors the device
itself appears to have been kept in a
case to help disguise its identity
clearly that didn't work out as planned
now shortly after taking the photos the
lyft driver contacted the device owner
and returned the device to him if that's
the story you want to believe but what
if you're like me and you like the
regular sized pixel what we got you
covered there too what we have here are
brand-new images of what looks to be the
Google pixel 3 complete with screenshots
of specs now be forewarned these pics
were found on reddit not for a vetted
publication and as such they could be
forgeries however the images look to
line up pretty well with what we already
know about the pixel 3 now next up is
some fascinating news regarding Samsung
and they're super smart strategy when it
comes to foldable displays you see we
know that Samsung is planning to release
a foldable smartphone sometime in 2019
known for now as the Samsung Galaxy X
the fold of device has been a hot news
topic for over a year now but a new
report from the Korean site ET news via
Sam mobile says that Samsung is already
planning on selling its foldable display
technology to competitors like Oppo and
Xiaomi now guys this is some super Jedi
marketing moves and let me tell you most
of you already know because I've talked
about it at nauseam that if you want to
make some serious chatter you want to be
first in your category right you want to
be McDonald's of fast food you want to
be kleenex of tissues you want to be
Apple of smartphones you want to be the
first in your category you dominate not
by little but by a lot so the question
remains why would Samsung willingly give
up that first marketing position and
sell this foldable technology to Xiaomi
and Oppo isn't that kind of silly no
because in this case in samsung's
position it's potentially brilliant
here's what they can do they can sell
aspects of their foldable technology to
Xiaomi and Oppo to create this new
marketing niche of foldable technology
foldable displays right grow it learn
from it create demand and then when the
time is right at the right moment they
release their own version of foldable
displays and they've of course held back
features that you can only get with a
Samsung foldable display they
immediately become the dominant player
in that market after they've created the
the fertility created the demand in that
market it's probably that's why Samsung
is Samsung let me know what you think in
