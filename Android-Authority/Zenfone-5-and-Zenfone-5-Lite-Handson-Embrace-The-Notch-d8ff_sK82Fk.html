Andrew Authority and I'm here at MWC
2018 takes a look at a couple new phones
that were announced here by a soos this
is the zenfone 5 and zenfone 5 light but
before we get to the light model let's
just start with the regular zenfone 5 so
I know what you're thinking this looks
like an iPhone 10 and you wouldn't be
wrong because it totally does it has a
notch at the top just like the iPhone 10
the cameras on the back are in vertical
orientation and shape just like the
iPhone 10 and the phone even feels like
an iPhone 10 with the same metal and
glass design now to a Seuss's credit it
isn't a 100% blatant ripoff of the
iPhone 10 because it does have a
headphone jack and there's a dedicated
fingerprint sensor on the back the notch
at the top of the display is a little
smaller than the iPhone because it's not
really housing anything other than the
usual sensors and earpiece and a
front-facing camera you won't find any
fancy face ID technology but they did
add face unlock as an alternative method
for unlocking your phone otherwise it's
more of an aesthetic decision than
anything else and as far as I could tell
apps don't actually wrap around or go
underneath the notch and instead the
notification bar just color matches
itself just sort of make it appear like
it does despite the iPhone 10
resemblances I still came away kind of
impressed it felt really nice and
comfortable to hold and the screen is
pretty large at 6.2 inches with an
aspect ratio of 19 by 9 and a 90% screen
to body ratio the panel itself is IPS
but the colors and contrast were
surprisingly good it's not going to be
quite as sharp as other panels on the
market with a screen resolution of 1080p
but it still looked perfectly fine to my
eyes a soos made a pretty big deal about
the AI on this phone and I say AI with
air quotes because there's technically
no real AI or machine learning involved
a soos calls the display in AI display
because it can stay on when you're
looking at it and turn off when you're
not and the color temperature of the
screen will also automatically adjust
based on the lighting conditions to make
it easier to read if any of it sounds
familiar it's because we've seen other
factures do this already another feature
that ESU's calls AI is the scene
detection in the camera it can detect up
to 16 different scenes and subjects to
give you the best possible photo it does
seem to work pretty well with detecting
the subject but again this feature isn't
exactly new these are just a couple of
examples of what a soos calls AI but
there were plenty of other features such
as how you can boost the phone's
performance for a faster and smoother
experience or the way the phone can
intelligently charge your phone based
off your charging habits in terms of
specs see zenfone 5 has a snap during
636 inside and comes with either 4 or 6
gigabytes of RAM depending on the
storage there's also a pretty large 3300
milliamp hour battery which would
hopefully be enough to get you through
the day the zenfone 5 will ship with
Android Oreo and Zen UI 5.0 which is
still a very heavy skin but as sue said
this is the cleanest version of their UI
yet it has significantly less bloatware
and they've gotten rid of all their
first party apps that duplicated what
Google was already doing a Seuss's other
smartphone the zenfone 5 Lite will offer
a pretty similar experience with
identical software and a metal and glass
design but there are some notable
differences it doesn't have thin bezels
like the zenfone 5 and it comes with
dual cameras on both the front and rear
there's a 20 megapixel shooter on the
front that's paired with an 8 megapixel
wide-angle lens and the rear is a 16
megapixel camera that's paired with the
same eight megapixel wide-angle sensor
no word on pricing and availability just
yet but a sous says they will be priced
very competitively for more on zenfone 5
and zenfone 5 Lite make sure to head on
over to Android thorny calm and keep it
tuned here for the rest of our MWC 2018
