Android authority and we're here at the
Samsung Galaxy s4 launch event in New
York City at Radio City Music Hall now
we've been comparing a bunch of phone
seeing how they hold up to the s4 and
now we've moved on to the htc droid DNA
now both are 5-inch 1080p phones both
have the same pixel density of 441 PPI
but as Samsung likes to tout the display
in the s4 is Super AMOLED while as the
display in the Droid DNA is an LCD now
looking at hardware specs we've actually
gone ahead and ran some benchmarks here
we did this earlier to take a look at
how the specs held up now as you can see
the s4 has some truly impressive
benchmark numbers in antutu benchmark
25900 compared to the Droid DNA's 20500
94 this is the handsome part to the much
more powerful processor in the s4 we're
not sure if this is the processor that
the device is going to ship with but
what is in this very phone right here is
a 1.9 gigahertz Qualcomm processor it's
unconfirmed what build this is but we do
know that it's armed v7 architecture
while it's in the Droid DNA we have a
1.6 gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 pro
looking at the rest of the hardware
specs we have 2 gigs of ram both devices
16 to 64 gigs of internal storage in the
Samsung and only 16 in the
HTC Droid DNA moving on to the cameras
the Samsung Galaxy s4 has a 13 megapixel
camera in the rear and a 2 megapixel
camera up front while the Droid DNA only
has a 8 megapixel camera in the rear and
2 up front looking at Android versions
the HTC Droid DNA only runs 4.1.1 jelly
bean
while the Samsung runs the newest
version Android 4.2.2
now while the batteries not been as bad
as some people think it was never one of
the selling points of the Droid DNA at
only 2020 milliamp hours the samsung
galaxy s4 on the other hand has quite a
bit of a heftier battery at 2600
milliamp hours now well both phones as
you can see are similar in size the s4
is significantly lighter than the HTC
Droid DNA weighing in at just 130 grams
now one thing that may be a killer for
people talking about the limited storage
in the Droid DNA is that it has no
microSD slot which means you can't
expand the memory and you can't replace
the battery which can be problematic
both of those are not a problem in the
Samsung Galaxy s4 it can accept microSD
cards up to 64 gigs and it has a
replaceable battery alright this is
Chris work from Android authority we've
still got more phones to bring you so
stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
