Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to another episode of
Google Play weekly we have a lot of
awesome news this week but first of all
happy birthday to the Google Play Store
which will be turning to soon we're
going to talk a little bit about that
some booyah news and the latest Humble
Bundle along with a lot more stuff so
let's get this show on the road square
enix announced this last week if they're
working on a new RPG called rise of mana
that will not cost an arm and a leg at
least not at first as you can see from
the video the game actually looks really
good compared to the remakes of final
fantasy and chrono trigger that Square
Enix has done so far in so far as we can
tell it looks like it'll play more like
an action RPG like Legend of Zelda
rather than the typical JRPG style that
we're used to seeing out of Square Enix
they are aren't a lot of details yet so
we can't give you an exact release date
we do know they'll be releasing the
soundtrack on April 23rd in preparation
of a summer launch for the game itself
in terms of pricing Square Enix states
that it'll be a quote paper action RPG
unquote so it won't cost anything to
download but if you look up the
dictionary definition of all of those
words it doesn't sound all that
promising well reserve our final
judgment for when the game gets released
XBMC has released a beta of their new
version called Gotham which reportedly
significantly improves video playback on
Android now as you can expect it being
in beta means that there are likely a
bunch of bugs and crashes so you really
shouldn't actually try this out until
something more stable gets released that
said the bill does offer a lot of
improvements which is great because the
app has always bran a little sluggish on
Android some of the improvements include
some minor polish around the UI in
places like menu animations and
on-screen controls more consistent and
improved video playback in both standard
definition and high definition formats
and significantly improved battery
consumption for those who may be
interested the new release will also
support Raspberry Pi the only downside
is that there is no evidence of
chromecast support yet regular viewers
of the Google Play weekly show know just
how much i love a good humble bundle and
this latest one is one of the better
ones I've seen in a long time if you're
not familiar with humble bundles there
are two ways to buy it you can give
under the average donation price and get
a few games or you can give over the
average donation price and get all of
the game
if you give under the average you'll get
catan vector riptide gp2 which is a
favorite here at Android Authority and
zombie gunship this is a very strong
list of games and we've covered most of
them before if you're feeling generous
and go above the donation price which is
about three dot sixty-six cents at the
time of this video you'll get the
premium version of bad land along with
breach and clear so for about four bucks
you can pick up a half a dozen great
Android game titles to give you an idea
of how good of a deal this is catan on
its own is worth four dollars and
Riptide gp2 on its own costs three
dollars plus the money goes to charity
and who doesn't like that the google
play store turned to this last week and
to celebrate its second birthday its
tossing a great big sail to celebrate
its second birthday the google play
store is tossing a sale of various items
throughout the store where you live
tends to change what you can get on sale
so if you live in australia you'll have
a slightly different set of things on
sale than people in the united states
and other places it is worth noting that
there aren't any actual free premium
apps available what you'll find is
discounted media like books music and
movies while apps are generally either
getting discounts on the price of the
application or discounts on the price of
in-app purchases some of the more fun
things up for sale or black sabbath's
paranoid album the in-app purchases of
fifa 14 star trek into darkness the
hobbit and unexpected journey the
amazing spider-man bad grandpa and some
dr. Seuss titles the OEM was a pretty
big deal when it first started on
Kickstarter and it has since fallen into
obscurity with a new initiative called
o'yea everywhere that may change the
concept of oh yeah everywhere is very
simple it's the oogah gaming platform
available you guessed it everywhere
according to reports the standout of
engadget leah is looking to make their
platform available on other set-top
boxes and smart TVs which would greatly
improve the experience of those set-top
boxes and smart TVs unfortunately we
don't have a lot of information other
than that there is no release date right
now and it's been confirmed that oh yeah
is still going forward with their yearly
hardware refresh as scheduled so really
we're just playing the waiting game at
this point although I'm sure we'll hear
more about this the closer it comes to
release who wants to see some trending
applications as usual if you want to
check any of these applications out you
can find the links in the written
companion which is in the video
description first up in our trending
apps this week is the one loosen icon
pack this is a brand new icon pack out
of the
popular icon theme ur the one dynasty
it's a neon themed icon set with over
450 icons available it also comes with
two wallpapers and support for pretty
much every launcher that can support
custom icons we decided to put this up
this week in celebration because the a
v8 launcher now supports custom icon
packs and we thought hey what a better
way to celebrate than to get an awesome
new icon pack like this one all cast
seemingly makes our show every other
weekend that's because every couple of
weeks couche does something to it that's
worth talking about in an update that
hit this last week the app has fixed or
improved many features like transcoding
on certain devices general performance
improvements and the ability to change
the streaming bitrate to help stop laggy
playback and now includes muzie support
a new user interface and a new icon in
short it's a pretty darn big update this
may be a bit pre-emptive because the
next Shazam update hasn't rolled out
quite yet but we have it on good
authority that some big changes are
coming to Shazam so the app is worth
keeping an eye on according to the
reports and teasers the upcoming update
will feature a brand new user experience
which will undoubtedly include a new
user interface new features and some
more new stuff millions of people have
tried it and the google play store
rating is really good so it's definitely
worth checking out kemco games is
probably the most known name in the
mobile RPG space aside from Square Enix
and they have just released a brand new
game called rusted EEMA 'the in this
JRPG you play as a young man who rides
golems during the course of the game you
hunt down bounties while you try to
figure out what destroyed your homeland
and why it's seven dollars and
ninety-nine cents usually but for a
limited time it's 399 so if this looks
interesting get on it quick while you
can still get it on sale blast up this
week is a goofy little puzzle game
called another case salt in this game
you play as a customizable detective who
solves crimes the premises you're in a
world where candy is illegal or you can
also think of it as a world where
king.com gets to make the rules and you
must hunt down criminals who are
stealing candy and doing other nefarious
things it's free to play it's goofy and
fun and it doesn't take itself too
seriously it's definitely a game worth
checking out once again I'm Joe Hindy
