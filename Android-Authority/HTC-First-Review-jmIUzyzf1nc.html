ships running Facebook home is the long
rumored Facebook bone worth your time
and money find out in our review hey
everybody I'm Chris book when it comes
to Facebook home we've heard a lot of
bad things and we've heard a lot of well
okay it's actually mostly been bad
things but we'll get to that in a bit
let's kick off the review of the HTC
first by taking a look at the specs the
HTC firms packs in a Qualcomm Snapdragon
chipset with a dual-core 1.4 gigahertz
Krait processor and Adreno 305 GPU for
memory we're looking at one gig of ram
and 16 gigs of internal storage but no
microSD slot the 4.3 inch display is
720p HD we have the pixel density of
around 342 pixels per inch the primary
rear facing camera is 5 megapixels with
1080p video capture and the front facing
camera is 1.6 megapixels providing the
power is a 2000 milliamp hour battery
HTC is known for build quality and while
this isn't as solid as the flagship HTC
One it doesn't feel cheaply built either
the back and sides have a grippy feel
making you less likely to drop this in
the middle of a call the HTC first comes
in a variety of colors from red like our
review unit to white black or blue it
fits well in the hand and the relatively
small size of the device makes
one-handed operation a breeze compared
to a lot of other phones in the same
class buttons feel sturdy almost to the
point of viewing overly stiff unlike a
lot of other mid-range Android phones
the display is not a weak aspect of the
HTC first the small 4.3 inch screen size
in 1280 by 720 resolution leave us with
a pretty sharp pixel density of around
340 pixels per inch so visuals are much
clearer than other similarly SPECT
phones colors are vivid without the over
saturation that is clearly apparent info
from some other manufacturers black
levels are good with the display having
very nice contrast to test the
performance we ran our usual suite of
tests starting with antutu benchmark a
total of 10 benchmarks taken at
different times left us with an average
score of just over 11,500 almost exactly
about what we expected from this
Hardware next up was Epic Citadel in
high quality mode the average frame rate
was 54 point 4 frames per second while
high performance mode produced 50 5.1
frames per second not too bad for 720p
resolution in real world use the phone
never felt slow but obviously didn't
feel as blazing fast as a high-end phone
would apps launched quickly and
scrolling was smooth
subway surfers ran smoothly though it
isn't a very demanding game the software
is where the HTC first takes a nosedive
it runs Android 4.1.2 jelly bean but
while it isn't skinned it does run
Facebook home now it would be easy to
call facebook home a love it or hate it
piece of software but looking at the
Google Play Store it doesn't seem like
that many people love it at all for the
purposes of this review though that
isn't exactly the problem the issue is
consistency now while you may not be a
fan of TouchWiz or HTC Sense at least
they provide a unified experience with
Facebook home it's always apparent that
you're running an app on top of stock
jellybeans but here's the thing that may
actually be a plus see you can simply
turn off Facebook home and suddenly
you'll find yourself greeted with a
phone that is running stock Android no
it's not a nexus and you probably won't
see frequent updates but it is a
surprising bonus in good lighting the
five megapixel rear facing camera takes
photos that are above average for a
phone in this class
in low light however images aren't
nearly as good you can use the LED flash
but this isn't going to lead to the
nicest photos the front-facing camera
has the same issue but with fewer pixels
the 1080p video capture is unremarkable
while it will capture whatever you
pointed at the videos tend to be on the
shaky side and low light performance is
just as poor as it is for still images
having said that for a mid-range phone
it's still not that bad the two thousand
milliamp hour battery isn't the biggest
we've seen but is definitely more than
adequate for most tasks well I did
notice that heavy testing and benchmark
seemed to drain it fairly quickly in
general use it held up pretty well
HTC claims 14 hours of talktime and if
you take that to mean 14 hours of
moderate day-to-day use it definitely
meets or even surpasses that time
unfortunately the battery isn't
removable so if you're looking to carry
a spare or pick up an extended battery
you're out of luck do you like Facebook
no well then the HTC first definitely
isn't for you the hardware isn't bad but
the general mess on the software side
makes it hard to recommend sure you can
run stock jellybean pretty easily but
who knows how often it's going to be
updated that said if you use Facebook
more than anything else this phone might
be worth picking up want to know more we
