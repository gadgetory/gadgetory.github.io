ships running facebook home is the
long-rumored facebook phone worth your
time and money find out in our review
hey everybody I'm Chris blue when it
comes to facebook home we've heard a lot
of bad things and we've heard a lot of
well okay it's actually mostly been bad
things but we'll get to that in a bit
let's kick off the review of the HTC
first by taking a look at the specs the
HTC firms packs in a qualcomm snapdragon
chipset with a dual-core 1.4 gigahertz
Krait processor and Adreno 305 GPU for
memory we're looking at one gig of ram
and 16 gigs of internal storage but no
microSD slot the 4.3 inch display is
720p HD we have the pixel density of
around 342 pixels per inch the primary
rear facing camera is 5 megapixels with
1080p video capture and the front facing
camera is 1.6 megapixels providing the
power is a 2,000 milliamp hour battery
HTC is known for build quality and while
this isn't as solid as the flagship HTC
One it doesn't feel cheaply built either
the back and sides have a grippy feel
making you less likely to drop this in
the middle of a call the HTC first comes
in a variety of colors from red like our
review unit to white black or blue it
fits well in the hand and the relatively
small size of the device makes
one-handed operation a breeze compared
to a lot of other phones in the same
class buttons feel sturdy almost to the
point of viewing / least if unlike a lot
of other mid-range android phones the
display is not a weak aspect of the HTC
first the small 4.3 inch screen size in
1280 x 720 resolution leave us with a
pretty sharp pixel density of around 340
pixels per inch so visuals are much
clearer than other similarly spect fonts
colors are vivid without the
oversaturation that is clearly apparent
in phones from some other manufacturers
black levels are good with the display
having very nice contrast to test the
performance we ran our usual suite of
tests starting with antutu benchmark a
total of ten benchmarks taken at
different times left us with an average
score of just over 11,500 almost exactly
about what we expected from this
Hardware next up was epic citadel in
high quality mode the average frame rate
was 54.4 frames per second while high
performance mode produced 55.1 frames
per second not too bad for 720p
resolution in real-world use the phone
never felt slow but obviously didn't
feel as blazing fast as a high-end phone
would apps launched quickly and
scrolling with smooth subway surfers ran
smoothly though it isn't a very
demanding
the software is where the HTC first
takes a nosedive it runs Android 4.1
point2 jellybean but while it isn't
skinned it does run facebook home now it
would be easy to call facebook home a
love it or hate it piece of software but
looking at the google play store it
doesn't seem like that many people love
it at all for the purposes of this
review though that isn't exactly the
problem the issue is consistency now
while you may not be a fan of TouchWiz
or HTC Sense at least they provide a
unified experience with facebook home
it's always apparent that you're running
an app on top of stock jelly bean but
here's the thing that may actually be a
plus C you can simply turn off facebook
home and suddenly you'll find yourself
greeted with a phone that is running
stock android no it's not a nexus and
you probably won't see frequent updates
but it is a surprising bonus in good
lighting the 5 megapixel rear-facing
camera takes photos that are above
average for a phone in this class in low
light however images aren't nearly as
good you can use the LED flash but this
isn't going to lead to the nicest photos
the front-facing camera has the same
issue but with fewer pixels the 1080p
video capture is unremarkable well it
will capture whatever you pointed at the
videos tend to be on the shaky side and
low light performance is just as poor as
it is for still images having said that
for a mid-range phone it's still not
that bad the 2,000 milliamp hour battery
isn't the biggest we've seen but is
definitely more than adequate for most
tasks well I did notice that heavy
testing and benchmark seemed to drain it
fairly quickly in general use it held up
pretty well HTC claims 14 hours of talk
time and if you take that to mean 14
hours of moderate day-to-day use it
definitely meets or even surpasses that
time
unfortunately the battery isn't
removable so if you're looking to carry
a spare or pick up an extended battery
you're out of luck do you like Facebook
no well then the HTC first definitely
isn't for you the hardware isn't bad but
the general mess on the software side
makes it hard to recommend sure you can
run stock jellybean pretty easily but
who knows how often it's going to be
updated that said if you use Facebook
more than anything else this phone might
be worth picking up want to know more we
