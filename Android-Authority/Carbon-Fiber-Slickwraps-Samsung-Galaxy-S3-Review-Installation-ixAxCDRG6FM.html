Clayton Youngberg coming at you from
your number one source for all things
Android Android Authority calm today
we've got a few slick wraps to put on
our galaxy s3 these are from slick wraps
calm these are full body protection for
your Samsung Galaxy s3 we've got our
sides our front and our back and this is
a new carbon fiber variant of these
slick wraps so we're gonna go ahead and
open them up install them and then
review how they look and feel on the
galaxy s3 as well as maybe do some
protection demos so anyways let's just
open this up and push all the contents
out we'll start by installing the back
of the slick wrap as you can see it
looks really nice the carbon fiber
already feels strong so we'll just flip
our samsung galaxy s3 on its back we're
gonna use a microfiber cleaning cloth
just to remove some of the oil and
residue from back there make sure that
the slick wrap has a nice fit on the
galaxy s3 without any obstruction I'm
going to remove the slick wrap and I'll
move my galaxy s3 out of the way
and then I'm gonna put the slick wrap
halfway down on the wax paper here it
doesn't have to be straight or anything
and then I'm gonna use that to align the
slick wrap right around the camera and
the LED and the speaker now you don't
have to get it perfect the very first
time looks pretty close and then we
simply just push it and we mold it to
our device just like that
a little heat can be used to fix the
corners anyways I'll just remove the wax
paper we can simply bring our slick wrap
down to the rest of the body there so
I'm gonna go ahead and install the front
and sides and that's exact same process
so we'll just pick the video up after I
get that on and talk about the feel of
the slicker right guys you can see here
we have our slip wraps fully installed
on our Samsung Galaxy s3 front back now
I'm not an expert installer but it was
still extremely easy for me to get it
fairly right I did get some air bubbles
here but the air bubbles tend to work
themselves out now despite me being a
less than gifted skin installer I still
managed to get a really good fit on the
slick wraps on my galaxy s3 as you can
see here my home button is pretty good I
have to work it out I'm just gonna be
pushing this up a little more to let
that fit but everything looks nice we
have our capacitive soft keys here cut
out our home buttons easy to access all
of our sensors and our front-facing
camera as well as our speaker atop then
we have our cutout for our power button
over here as the installation sets a
little more we can get these spaces more
or less evened out but anyways you can
check out here on the back looks really
nice our carbon fiber is just really
really sexy on the samsung galaxy s3
it's really protective to just hear the
actual carbon fiber and it's kind of
tough to actually put a scratch in this
and get our good Nick in there but it
takes a little bit and then it's sort of
self-healing just like that anyways it
feels really nice too it's not obtrusive
it's not obstructing any of the buttons
then it looks awesome in the light as
well when I screens all lit up on the
Samsung Galaxy s3 we just have a really
nice finish just like that really
accessible everything looks awesome
great protection this is really scratch
resistant and kind of just go at it and
nothing really happens and it provides a
nice little border between the screen
and the body you can still fit a screen
protector on there if you'd like because
the cutout is only the front of the face
and not necessarily anything over the
actual screen just the bezel so anyways
guys check out the slick wraps for the
samsung galaxy s3 you can go to slick
raps calm and get them and stay tuned
with Android Authority calm you guys cuz
we got plenty of more reviews where this
came from</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
