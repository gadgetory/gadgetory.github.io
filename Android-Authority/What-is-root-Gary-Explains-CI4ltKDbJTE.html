you
you
hello my name is Gary sim from Android
Authority now maybe you've heard the
term root or rooting your phone or maybe
an app that needs root access and you're
not quite sure what it means well let me
explain
now all operating systems have the idea
of system privileges as a set of
privileges that allow certain users or
processes to perform tasks that are
reserved for system administrators you
don't want normal users doing certain
things they are reserved for those who
have the authority to do those things
now on some operating systems this
system set of system privileges are fine
grained there are many many levels but
on linux and most unix type operating
systems it's very black and white you
are either a normal user or you are a
super user who can do just about
anything now traditionally the account
for a super user on linux and unix-like
operating systems is root and that's
where we get the term from root is
basically a super user the system
administrator who can perform any task
and the thing about root is that once
you have access to the root account you
can do just about anything you like on
the system you can change the system
files you can change the system
configuration and you can read all the
data that belongs to other users on the
system so if I'm on a multi-user Linux
system and I have my email account and I
have my personal data root can access
all of those whereas normally I couldn't
access what's going on in the account
next to mine or another account on the
system whereas root can see and read
everything
as it was once said with great power
comes with great responsibility
so of course you don't want to give root
access to just about everybody and
therefore on a Linux system there are a
couple of mechanisms that exist to limit
who has access to the root account and
they are called su which tends will
substitute user or su do now su or
substitute user basically allows a
process or a user to change their user
ID to that of root and when they do that
they gain the privileges of that root
account now su do is very similar what
that does is it allows you to execute
one command with a substitute root user
so in other words it's kind of do as
root or root do but they call it s you
do for substitute user do connected with
that original su command now depending
on which Linux system you are using and
depending on how that is configured
there are different ways of the
authentication occurs to make sure that
only those allow to do those commands
get the right to do them so for example
on a system that uses just su you need
to know the root password to get into
the root account on other Linux systems
that use more the su do command then
maybe you need to be an authorized su
doer and maybe you need to know a pass
or add not necessarily the root password
but probably your account password and
those two systems mean that only those
who have the privilege can execute
super user commands okay that's the
world of Linux and let's move quickly
into the world of Android now Android is
built on a Linux kernel and therefore
the ideas of root and of super users and
normal users exists on Android as much
as it does on any other Linux system now
as you can imagine Google do not ship
Android with root by default there is no
root access for any apps because the
moment an app has root access it can
change the system configuration it can
change the system files and it can read
all the data that's associated with any
app installed on the system but if you
want to actually modify any system filed
or read the data
or other apps then you need to have root
axis now this can be a very good thing
for example there is a very popular app
and the Play Store called titanium
backup root and there is a program that
allows you to backup all of your apps
onto an external SD card now you can
only do that because it requires root
access and once it has roots access
super user access it's allowed to read
all the data on all the files associated
with any app on the system including
system apps if it didn't have root
access it would not be able to do that
so there is a positive side to having
root access on your phone however
there's also a negative side I could
write a free game I could put it up on a
play store somewhere and on a non rooted
system this game could just act quite
normally
but when it detects that root is
available I could maybe bring up a
message saying please get me root access
because I need to improve the
performance of the game and it will
happen if you grant me root access or
please grab me root access I can upload
the school or download an update or just
basically a lie that convinces the user
to give that app root access and once it
has root access then everything on your
phone is available to that app or your
PayPal account your banking information
your email addresses your email
passwords your or anything else that
you've got on that phone is available on
my little game could then start sending
that information up to a server which I
could then collect in and use for
whatever purposes I want to so the fact
that you have opened the door to
allowing root access on the phone means
that you've left a chink in the armor
for people who want to write malware to
get access to your data
you
so of course there is an argument is
route a good thing or a bad thing those
that like at like Titanium Backup
root they say root is essential yo those
that are more security conscious who
realize that opening the door to root
access can open the door to security
breaches say root is not a good idea I
wonder where you are in that debate now
before we go on any further I want to
tell you a little bit in a moment about
how you get root on your phone but
before we go any further I want to
mention that if you want to connect to
me and talk to me about any of the
subjects that I covers in my videos then
there is a link here that you can use to
go to the annual authority forums and I
check that daily and I'll connect with
anybody there that asks me a question
about the videos that I've been doing so
now let's move on how do you get root on
your phone well basically there are
three different ways your phone doesn't
come with root occasionally there might
be a phone that comes out of China that
has root access built into it but by
default the vast majority of phones do
not come with root X and how do you get
it well one way is you can just unlock
the bootloader
and installed the superuser su binaries
that need to be installed on your phone
and that's quite easy another
possibility is to install a version of
Android that has root built into it for
example Saanich and mod has root built
into it already so if you can find a
version of that for your phone you can
follow the instructions on their website
and you can install Android on there
with root pre-baked into it or the third
possibility is you need to exploit a
vulnerability in Android that gives
access to root temporarily so that then
the various binaries can be copied on to
your phone so just let me tell you about
that third one for a second basically
every program in the world has bugs in
it even the programs that say that they
write for NASA that sends spaceships up
they all have bugs in them there's
nothing we can do about that we haven't
found a way of fixing that yet as
mankind so all programs have bugs
including Android coding windows
including Linux including iOS
everything's got bugs in it now
sometimes those by
can be serious and allow people to get
into the system through a way that they
shouldn't be allowed to get in now
that's called a vulnerability now when a
vulnerability allows for a program to
get root access when it shouldn't have
okay then people can use that to gain
elevated privileges now what happens is
once a vulnerability is a theory look we
found this bug in this program and as a
thing called an exploit which when
someone actually takes that theory and
turns it into real code that can
actually use that vulnerability and many
many root systems actually what they do
is they take a bug in the Linux kernel
or in the Android system and they find a
way to get elevated privileges through a
way they weren't meant to through a bug
somewhere and then they write an exploit
now normally of course when Google finds
out about these exploits make Google
find out or Samsung finds out about them
they patch them up in fact it's
interesting because in the current news
at the moment the FBI trying to get
access to an iPhone and I read this
morning that they've already gained
access using a third party who showed
them a way to get in there and Apple's
response was please tell us what is that
vulnerability because they want to fix
it so it doesn't appear in future
iPhones and this is a ongoing battle
those who follow security issues this
literally is happening every day with
all the operating systems across the
world so one way to get root is to
exploit a vulnerability of course the
question is do you really want to run
software intentionally on your phone
written by somebody who's going to
intentionally break your system so they
can get elevated privileges now they say
they're doing it so they can install
root for you but are they or are they
doing something else that's a matter of
trust and to trust somebody you've never
met who lives halfway across the world
that could be quite difficult where
certainly is for me
so there you have it my quick overview
of what route is on Lin UPS what route
means to Android and how you get root on
your Android phone well my name is Gary
sim from Andrew authority and I hope you
enjoyed this video if you did please do
give it a thumbs up as I mentioned
earlier there is a place over on the
forums you can use this link here to
connect to me over on the forums I'll
read that at least once a day if you've
got anything you want to ask about the
videos that I do please come over and
have a chat with me there also don't
forget to subscribe to Android
authorities YouTube channel you can also
follow me on Twitter and on other social
media accounts also there are they eat
the comments here below both on the
annual thority website and on YouTube
where you can tell me your experiences
with root what you think about root
which side of the fence do you stay on
the root non-root argument and finally
please do stay tuned to Android
Authority calm because we are your
