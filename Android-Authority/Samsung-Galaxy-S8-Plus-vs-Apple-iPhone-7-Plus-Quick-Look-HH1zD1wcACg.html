really have anything over the holiday
seasons compete against the Apple iPhone
7 plus instead they were dealing with
one wicked migraine of a problem with
the Samsung Galaxy Note seven now that's
all in the past they're looking ahead to
the future with its upcoming phablet of
a phone in the samsung galaxy s 8 plus
right away the most notable difference
between the two is in-house Samsung is
able to cram in a whole lot of screen to
the body of the s8 plus comparing it to
the iPhone 7 plus it's pretty incredible
Samson was able to maximize the real
estate on its phone because the two
appeared to be similar in size but yet
the SI plus features a significantly
larger 6.2 inch display easily dwarfing
the 5.5 venture in the iPhone 7 plus and
speaking of their displays their
again a draw with the s8 plus because of
its staggering resolution of 29 60 by
1440 pixels with so many pixels crammed
together it makes it sharper looking in
more detail than 1080p resolution used
by the iPhone 7 plus aesthetically
there's no denying the premium feel with
two phones that's a plus much like its
predecessor has a shiny affection for
glass which strimmers nicely when light
bounces off its surfaces but that glass
still feels a bit more fragile in
contrast the metal body of the iPhone 7
plus gives it a more substantial feel in
the hand honestly they'll come down to
personal preference but at least the two
offer degree of water resistance placing
the two on top of one another we can
make out how the s8 plus features a
slimmer chassis so we're not straining
to hold it in our hand
however the iPhone 7 plus is a little
shorter than the s8 plus regardless
though it's still impressive house the
s8 plus is able to achieve nearly the
same profile dimensions as its rival
while yet carrying along a larger screen
it's been a short time checking out the
two phones in action so we still have a
lot to go before we get a good feel for
the two of them the iPhone 7 plus proved
to be a champ when it comes to snapping
photos thanks to its a dual camera
configuration but don't count out the s8
plus just yet known because the s8 line
has been
pretty reliable with its performance in
this area well the one area where we
feel the si+ eclipses the iPhone 7 plus
is in its brand-new desktop environment
courtesy of Samsung decks now this
essentially allows you to dock the s8
plus and experience the desktop
environment where everything is powered
by the phone itself it's not a new
concept mobile as Windows 10 is its own
version but this still something that
the s8 plus has an edge over its
competitor beyond that will save our
reservations between the two phones
until we get a better feel for the s8
plus so far however it's no doubt going
to be a force to be reckoned with so
there you go guys that's a quick first
look between these two handsets if you
guys want learn more about it you could
