the original redmi note fast-forward to
today and the market has changed
dramatically with much more competition
in the sub $200 price category so does
the just released second iteration redmi
note 2 live up to the high standards set
by its predecessor this is bailey stein
with android authority and this is my
for review of the xiaomi redmi note 2
the redmi note 2 takes the size of the
original redmi note but applies many of
the design elements found on the me 4i
it might even be fair to call the redmi
note 2 a blown-up version of me 4i as
the two are strikingly similar in both
how they look and how they feel in the
hand but make no mistake there are many
differences between the two devices
while the redmi note 2 does retain the
same matte soft touch plastic rear it
ditches the unibody aspect and offers
access to the battery microsd card slot
and dual micro SIM slots
something that has been standard on all
redmi devices other key differences
include a once again Center justified
camera red capacitive keys and the
subtle move of regulatory information
from the back cover to beneath the
battery oh and there's also an IR
blaster something that was absent on
both the me 4i as well as the original
redmi note in terms of size the redmi
note 2 is lighter thinner and even a bit
smaller than its predecessor while the
power and volume buttons are both more
responsive than they are on the redmi
note they do feel a tad mushy compared
to the me four-eyes buttons the red
capacitive keys recent apps home and
back are each illuminated in addition to
that there's also a notification LED to
the left of the five megapixel
front-facing camera as you may have
guessed the redmi note 2 keeps the same
5.5 inch screen size as the original
redmi note but what changes is the
resolution from 720p to 1080p that's a
pretty substantial upgrade and while the
display does look pretty sharp with
excellent viewing angles the contrast
and vividness aren't quite up to par
with the me 4i nor similarly priced
devices like the meizu m2 note that's
not to say that it's a bad display by
any means it's actually quite good but
it's just not the best out there perhaps
the most significant upgrade from the
original redmi note is in performance
this time xiaomi has included an
octa-core MediaTek Helio x10 collected
either 2 gigahertz in the base model or
2.2 gigahertz in the prime model a quick
end to to test on our base model reveals
high marks and processor related
categories the same areas where the
original redmi note fell behind dinner
day performance was also very good and
this is actually the first redmi device
that I've used that runs me UI without
lag Xiaomi claims that their upcoming
new UI 7 update will improve UI
performance by up to 30%
well there is 2 gigabytes of RAM do keep
in mind that meal is a fairly memory
hungry skin so you'll only be left with
about one gigabyte on boot gaming
performance on the redmi note 2 was
about average for the price with the
power vrg 6200 i did notice some lag and
games like asphalt 8 even on medium
settings which is a tad disappointing i
also noticed that the phone tended to
heat up while playing games but the heat
never made the phone uncomfortable to
hold the redmi note 2 includes support
for 802 11 AC Wi-Fi GPS and Bluetooth
4.0
although the phone does include support
for dual SIM 4G LTE
carrier support is completely dependent
upon the variant I was able to receive
HSPA+ over 18 TSU s network with a
Chinese model but be sure to check the
phone's frequency list before making me
purchase the IR blaster on the top right
of the device functions just as expected
although the stock knee remote app
doesn't seem to support Vizio TVs
luckily you can download a third-party
app to gain support for many more
manufacturers overall it's a really nice
addition especially considering the
phone's price the speaker on the back of
the redmi note 2 sounds very good with
adequate volume for most environments I
would say that it's slightly less
distorted than they already good me for
AI speaker with the only drawback being
that its rear facing but for less than
$200 it's one of the best speakers that
you'll find
unfortunately battery life on the road
Mino - was not as good as I'd expected
in my testing with Wi-Fi on for about
70% of the day and screen brightness set
to auto the phone was never able to
exceed 4 hours of screen on time I
started each day at 6:30 a.m. and was
able to get an average of about three
and a half hours when using the phone
for 12 hours or less however when I tone
down my usage so that I could use the
phone for about 15 hours I was only able
to get about 2 hours and 15 minutes of
screen on time compared to the meizu m2
note which achieved 4 hours and 15
minutes of screen on time with 14 hours
of usage redmi note 2 does seem to be
lacking in longevity there does appear
to be some significant battery drain
during phone idle I'm speculating that
this combined with the high usage by the
display is what's killing the 3060
milliamp hour user replaceable battery
it's still too early to tell whether
this issue affects the Chinese model
exclusively but I'm hoping that Xiao Mei
can resolve these battery issues before
releasing the global variant the xiaomi
redmi note 2 includes a 13 megapixel
samsung camera with phase detection
autofocus and while the autofocus is
very fast actual performance is just
about average with a noticeable lack of
detail and sharpness the camera is still
a step up from the original redmi note
but it's really nothing too impressive
Shami standard camera app offers quick
and easy controls as well as many
different camera modes there's also a
manual mode for adjusting white balance
and ISO but I never felt the need to use
it the redmi note 2 is shipping with me
y6 over Android 5.0 point 2 lollipop
with the promise of a me UI 7 update
very soon me why has a lot of positives
but here's just a quick list of things
that I really like about the experience
you can reorganize the quick toggles
adjust the brightness with auto
brightness on and even customize what
shows up in the status bar there's also
options to change the display color
temperature or contrast a very powerful
built-in theme store chummy's me sound
enhancer for headphones which even lets
you assign headphone buttons and options
to change capacitive key functions
Shaunie's backup app lets you backup
apps with app data as well as launcher
layouts settings and accounts
automatically without root and if you're
feeling adventurous you can flash a
slightly less stable developer on to get
weekly updates to me why perhaps the
best aspect of new UI is Shani's
attention to detail throughout the
animations are fluid and the system apps
I'll follow a beautiful design language
of course Mui also has its drawbacks you
can't dismiss notifications from the
lock screen nor access an app other than
the camera the launcher doesn't include
an app drawer and memory management is
still relatively poor the biggest
drawback right now however is that you
can't download a global Rum with Google
Play services I'm confident that we'll
see a release alongside the global phone
release but for now you're stuck with a
Chinese ROM if you pick up the Chinese
variant there's a lot of Chinese
bloatware and a noticeable absence of
Google Play services
unfortunately Xiaomi also removed the
easy to use Google installer app from
their App Store making it significantly
more difficult to install google apps
the only current workaround is to flash
a custom recovery and then flash a G eps
package which works but isn't an ideal
solution for obvious reasons the good
news is that it's only a matter of
time before Xiaomi releases a global ROM
for Chinese variant owners to flash it's
also important to note that if you
purchase the device officially instead
of importing it you won't have to worry
about this as your device will include
Google Play services out of the box you
can purchase an FD DLT equipped xiaomi
redmi note 2 in China for 900 run menB
for the base model or 1,000 renminbi for
the prime model or $140 and $156
respectively a global edition of this
phone will be launching in various
international markets very soon which
will include Google Play services and
cost less than having to import a
Chinese variant you can also purchase
this phone in either white black yellow
blue or pink
the base model will include 16 gigabytes
of internal storage while the prime
model will include 32 gigabytes you can
expand the storage however with a micro
SD card up to 32 gigabytes the xiaomi
redmi note 2 is an excellent phone for
the price with a very nice design a
powerful processing package in a great
software experience unfortunately it's
disappointing battery life average
camera performance and lack of US
availability may be enough to turn
potential buyers towards other options
if you can live with those flaws and
want the very best performance and a
great software experience from a Chinese
OEM then the redmi note 2 is likely the
best option for you however if you'd
rather have a nicer display and better
battery life and are willing to
sacrifice on performance and speaker
quality the meizu m2 note is definitely
an option worth checking out thank you
