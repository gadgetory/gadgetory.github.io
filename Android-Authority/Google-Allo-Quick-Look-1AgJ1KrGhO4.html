handy the Android authority app guy and
folks we've been waiting a long time for
this one so what is Google allo exactly
it's a messaging platform similar to
whatsapp or iMessage that allows you to
send messages to people the application
uses your phone number as a screen name
and you can actually text people over
SMS although the application doesn't
register itself as a texting app so you
won't be getting rid of your default
anytime soon when you first open the
application you'll be greeted with a
clean white screen that will list your
chats if you have any Google assistant
is there from the moment you first open
the app but you can delete that
conversation and ignore it if you really
want to although we can't imagine why
you would you can open the menu from the
left side which shows you a fairly basic
set of controls including your blocked
contacts settings and profile
information in the settings you'll have
your typical stuff like setting
ringtones and you can unregister your
phone number if you don't want to use
the service anymore let's get into what
a lo can do to start with the messaging
platform is deceptively simple you can
engage with any person you have a phone
number for although they won't see any
special features unless they're also
using the app they won't see your actual
phone number if they're not using a lo
but we'll talk about that more here in a
minute if everyone in the chat is using
ello you'll have a variety of fun and
clever little things that you can do you
can paint Google assistant in any chat
and ask for whatever you want but we'll
talk more about the kinds of things that
Google assistant can do here later on
top of that you'll be able to do these
standard stuff like snap a photo to send
share images share your location and
there are a collection of stickers that
you can send you can also manage your
sticker sets download more or delete the
ones that you have right through the app
if you send images you can use the ink
feature to doodle on them to make them a
little more fun there are also some
goofy little features that aren't really
useful but they're fun for instance when
you send a message you can press and
drag the send button to make the speech
bubbles bigger or smaller this is to
simulate things like shouting or
whispering and adds a bit of a twist to
normal conversation you can also start
group chats by inviting a bunch of
people to chat with you it's nothing
special and acts just like a normal allo
chat except there are more than two
people in it
the last big feature is incognito mode
this is an encrypted messaging feature
that allows you to chat with people in
complete privacy
and here Google data collection is
turned off and you can't even ping
Google assistant you can set messages to
expire after a set time finally you can
click the recipients image in the top
right corner to mute the chat to clear
the history and view additional chat
details overall it's a very simple
application that doesn't take long to
learn this entire app revolves around
Google assistant for those who don't
know Google assistant is Google's new
virtual assistant that's kind of like
Google now but in a text about format
you'll ask it questions and talk to it
and it will answer questions and talk
back at this time you can paint Google
assistant in any non incognito chat that
you have going to utilizes features you
can also have a chat with just Google
assistant and it can do a range of
things you can ask it for the weather
and it'll deliver the weather you can
ask it for the latest NHL news and it'll
deliver the latest NHL news it doesn't
work with every single request but it
does work enough of the time to make it
a lot of fun to use and a little bit
impressive it can do a lot of ultimately
useless stuff like tell jokes or play
games but it can also do stuff like find
airplane flights set timers find
restaurants nearby check your calendar
and all sorts of other stuff you can
check it out for yourself by opening a
chat with Google assistant and simply
asking it what it can do on top of that
you can configure the bot to know more
about you by having it ask you questions
my Google assistant knows that my
favorite color is green and that my
favorite food is tacos it's a small
thing but it's kind of nifty and it'll
come up every now and again if you
answer enough questions perhaps my
favorite feature of Google assistant is
the subscriptions feature if you ask it
for the weather it'll tell you the
weather you can then ask it to send you
that information every single day at a
certain time thus I have my Google
assistant send me the weather forecast
every morning at 10 a.m. and the latest
NHO headlines every evening at 7 p.m.
you can also manage subscriptions simply
by asking the total list of things that
Google assistant is capable of doing as
far too long to list here but you can
ask at any time you want to and it will
always answer it's surprisingly fun to
use and easily the best chat bot that I
personally have ever seen not everything
in aloe is sunshine and rainbows and
there are some curious emissions that
don't make much sense even for an
application that's brand new
for instance the application isn't
overly customizable you can connect to
your Google account but you won't be
able to get ahold of anybody unless you
have their phone number there is also no
theming and no dark mode when you
combine that with the simplistic look
and feel of the application it's
actually just a little bit boring and
the bright white just kills your battery
if you have an AMOLED screen and use the
app frequently despite its ability to
field and answer text messages you
actually cannot use it as a stock
texting app this is because a low
doesn't actually use your phone number
when texting non allo recipients people
getting messages from Allah will get a
random five digit number that doesn't
belong to you and we really don't
understand why this isn't a thing that's
allowed there is something to be said
about how Google is going to skim every
single message you send here that isn't
in incognito mode the privacy crowd is
really bothered by it although your
personal feelings may be different it's
not ideal but it is required for Google
assistant to work properly
lastly the superfluous nature of the
application itself can't be seen as a
negative thing hangouts works perfectly
fine and we honestly can't see people
leaving whatsapp Facebook Messenger or
other popular messaging apps for
something like a low if you're not into
Google assistant this app really doesn't
offer you anything
overall ello is a very fun idea but it
does feel like just an idea as opposed
to a completed and polished product
messages send wicked fast and Google
assistant is so much fun to use ello
could easily be an iMessage replacement
with stronger as semester ports and a
little bit of tweaking the good news is
that the application is simple and
virtually anybody can pick it up and use
it the bad news is that it may be too
simple in places where it could have
used a little bit more when it's going
to end up being like and how successful
it is really is up for grabs right now
but it'll be a whole lot of fun to see
how it turns out and that about does it
for this one folks if you want to keep
watching we have our latest Android apps
