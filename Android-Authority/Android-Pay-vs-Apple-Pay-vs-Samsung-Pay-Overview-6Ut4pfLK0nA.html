no longer need to carry cash or cards to
buy something at a store this because
we're seeing an increase with mobile
payments effectively smartphones are
redefining how we pay for things hey
guys John valasco here with the android
authority and i'm here to talk about the
different mobile payment solutions out
there
so that's Android pay Apple pay and
Samsung pay
at the moment there are three notable
mobile payment systems dominating scene
you could argue which of the three has
the largest adoption rate but it's clear
that mobile payments are the future over
on the Android side two options are
available Android pay and Samsung pay
and on the other we have Apple pay so
let's start off with Google's mobile
payment option that's Android pay the
premise is simple and it's similar as
well with the other solutions you
download the app if it isn't
pre-installed already then you use the
camera to capture the information off
your credit card and that's ready to be
used at payment terminals that have NFC
displace the device near the terminal
and that's it you'll get a notification
about the transaction afterwards for
your own record now the great thing
about it is that it has the largest
support of devices pretty much anything
running Android 4.4 KitKat with NFC the
downside though is that it has the few
supported banks so you might not find
yours just like Android pay Apple pay
leverages the NFC contact method to
exchange information with POS systems
you use the iOS Wallet app to initially
capture your cards information once it's
stored on the iPhone all you need to do
is place it in your terminal from there
the transaction is authenticated by
using the touch ID sensor on the phone
it's available to the latest iOS devices
with integrated touch ID so that pales
in comparison to Android pace listing of
supported devices at the same time
though Apple deserves credit because
Apple pay has far more banking partners
under its belt and oh yeah
it's available in more countries than
Android or Samsung pay speaking of
Samsung pay it works on NFC terminals as
well it's one advantage is that it
alternatively offers magnetic secure
transmission MST for short essentially a
magnetic coil embedded inside the galaxy
device generates a dynamic magnetic
field and that magnetic field
effectively allows it to work with
traditional card terminals well has an
extensive list of supported banks and
retailers you can't be used for
purchases and apps on top of that the
supported devices are limited to recent
Galaxy smartphones still I can't stress
enough about its
team method which makes it more likely
to work in places we go every day even
though we're seeing this increase in
adoption the biggest question we have to
ask ourselves is whether they can be our
sole source for payments and that's the
thing they can Samsung and Apple pay are
no doubt leading away at this moment but
they still don't have the same success
rate we get from a traditional cards for
example restaurants and gas stations in
particular seem to be places where
mobile payments don't have any presence
in terminals that require you to insert
your card like an ATM don't work with
mobile payments at all sum it up Apple
pay has the largest banking partners in
the u.s. about 1200 versus 133 with
Samsung pay and 41 with Android pay
Apple pay also has broader availability
six countries to be exact
whereas Android pays only available in
the US while Samsung pay is established
in the u.s. in South Korea right now
Apple and Android pay can be used in
apps for payments but Samsung pay has
the largest collection of retail
partners and with MST it definitely will
work at more payment terminals there's a
lot of work needed in this space but you
could certainly expect broader adoption
as these services continue to expand the
question is which one are you going to
choose so if you learn more about any of
the services I talked about in this
