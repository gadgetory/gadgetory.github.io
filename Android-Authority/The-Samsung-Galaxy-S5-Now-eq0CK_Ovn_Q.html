Samsung Galaxy S line with a lot of what
we expected a plastic body with a lot of
the specifications that plenty of users
Pine over and also quite frankly we also
got quite a bit that we didn't expect
the phone was polarizing at best to a
lot of its users and at its announcement
it pretty much split the fan base given
a lot of its design cues and some of the
choices they made underneath the surface
but that was then and this is the
Samsung Galaxy s5 now let's take a look
back at the unpacked event at MWC last
year while there was a lot of excitement
around the new Samsung Galaxy S device
much of what was new about the device
definitely surprised the journalistic
masses not necessarily because the new
features and design cues made much sense
but because it felt like the
long-standing company seemed to be
losing its touch a little bit what
perplexed a number of people was what
came after that you had more features
that many weren't sure made sense a new
divot for example appeared underneath
the camera optics housing a heart rate
monitor Samsung's push into the tech
health segment was going to be more or
less powered by this and other versions
of it found on their wearable devices
which were also announced at that
unpacked event and then of course the
inclusion of an ISO cell technology in
the camera hoped to bring some new buzz
to what was already a pretty good
picture taking experienced in recent
Samsung devices oh and the phones back
it looked like a band-aid so yeah there
was that so what did we get once the
phone finally hit the market well we got
a brand new Samsung Galaxy device but it
did seem to lose some of the footing
that it gained in the s3 and then in the
misguided but still expected step
forward in the s4 there is a law of
diminishing returns with everything and
for once it felt like Samsung was
finally feeling it after all what
exactly do we see at first glance with
the s5 we see somewhat awkward lines on
the frame that while helping somewhat
with handling didn't seem to lend the
phone and easy sense of symmetry the
typical Samsung button layout was not
going anywhere but the Menu button was
finally replaced by a recent apps button
a move that fell in line with the
evolution of Android itself and the most
scrutinized choice of them all the
backing glossy plastic was the bane of
many users when it came to the
oxi lion and many including myself we're
expecting the full leather backing of
the Galaxy Note 3 to make a reappearance
in its smaller brethren but instead we
got a dimpled backing that many equated
to a band-aid look and feel the cover
itself was still quite flimsy but at
least it helped protect the tried and
true editions of replaceable battery and
expandable storage and finally the cover
on the bottom of the device was annoying
but it was one aspect of a larger
picture water and dust resistance yes
despite its looks the Galaxy s5 was a
pretty rugged device and users could use
it with a little bit better peace of
mind underneath the surface the Galaxy
s5 was still one of the fastest phones
available but it was bogged down by yet
another iteration of TouchWiz that tried
too hard to be everything to everyone
bringing back all the s4 features meant
that dozens of the phone's capabilities
were doomed to uselessness and very few
of the additions that came with it would
buck this trend the download booster was
probably the only feature I personally
loved using but it was on my t-mobile
unlimited data plan though and then
after that that was about it
and though you would be hard-pressed to
find anyone that could actually quantify
the improvements of ISO cell Samsung was
still able to bring one of the best
Android picture-taking experiences and
today I know users who have benefited
from having the s5 in their pockets in
very key moments but with the number of
missteps that were taken in the galaxy
s5 all signs pointed to this still being
one of the best selling devices of the
year but one thing that was becoming
increasingly clear was that Samsung's
momentum was shifting down a little bit
if you look at the devices used by
plenty of tech journalists the s5 is
actually a little bit scarce but look
around you in the real world and it gets
quite a bit more common given what
Samsung is able to do with the
essentials and then maybe some extras in
their flagship devices it should come as
no surprise that contract toting
customers still view new Galaxy phones
as the logical next step but with a
phone that still comes at a premium
price the changing landscape toward
powerful but still affordable devices is
definitely something to keep our eyes on
why pay so much for a Samsung phone
whose many features might never be used
when you get the essentials in a fast
reliable and most of all cheaper package
elsewhere not to mention a package that
looks and feels better to the masses
which is something that many agree was
not the case with the s5
and then one stripped of all of its
extra features in bloatware the s5 was
then met by more affordable offerings
like the 1+1 the Nexus line and then the
device that made a pretty significant
dent in the Galaxy share in the last
year the Moto X in all honesty the
Samsung Galaxy s5 was not really used by
me as much compared to the other
flagships that came after it most
notably the Galaxy Note 4 which reminded
me a lot of what I wish I saw in the s5
see the thing with the note 4 is that
it's design language is a little bit
more directed and as I said in my review
a little bit more executive which seems
to fit in line with my style a little
bit better and even with all of the
features including the s-pen that the
note 4 had that the s5 also had it still
was a great experience that came in a
premium and great looking package that
justified its higher price point so what
became clear to us when this came out
and also the Galaxy alpha phones after
it was that Samsung was slowly in a
direction of changing its philosophies
especially in design and it made us
excited to see what was going to come
next and then the Samsung Galaxy s6
actually appeared while you will have to
wait a little bit longer for our verdict
on the newest Samsung device we end by
looking at the galaxy s5 as perhaps a
turning point in the company's history
one that made clear that a company can
definitely get a little bit too big for
its own good
and in order to remain relevant
sometimes you have to dial back the very
things that first brought it to
Providence revisiting the galaxy s5 if
anything made it clear that we're
looking forward to a new change as
Samsung finally makes for the future but
until we finally get our hands on the
Samsung Galaxy s6 which is hopefully
soon and I give you my full review it's
worth looking at the samsung galaxy s5
and seeing where Samsung has come and
where they just might go in the very
near future as always thank you guys
very much for watching and I hope you
enjoyed looking at this retrospective on
the Samsung Galaxy s5 revisiting it and
seeing how it fares right now makes it
kind of clear to me that I was right not
to really recommend this phone to
everybody especially in this day and age
because there are so many other phones
out there that provide just as
compelling packages probably for even
less money but even then the next
Samsung Galaxy S device looks to be a
doozy and we can't wait to get that
reviewed which should be happening
pretty soon but when the less keep it
tuned here and remember to keep it tuned
to Android authority for all of the best
cover
including my future review of the
Samsung Galaxy s6 including comparisons
among it ends its other rivals in the
space until then drop us some likes on
