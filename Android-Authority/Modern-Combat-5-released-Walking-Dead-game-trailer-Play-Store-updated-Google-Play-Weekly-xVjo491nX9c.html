handy the Android authority app guy and
happy Friday everybody we have some big
app releases this week along with some
big updates so let's dive right in our
first bit of news this week the Google
Play Store has gotten a really big
update in this update the Google Play
Store UI has been overhauled in
accordance to the new material design
standard application images and video
takes center stage now change logs are
only available to those who have the
application installed and the overall
experience has been described as
personal by our very own Edgar servantes
it's rolling out right now so if you
don't have it yet just be patient
because it's coming soon last year there
was some news floating around that
bluestacks was coming out with a gaming
console called game pop now thanks to
Samsung that is still a thing that is
happening it was announced this week
that Samsung has dumped thirteen million
dollars into funding for the unique a
little gaming console game pop was kind
of a big deal last year until the specs
got revealed which really kind of killed
its momentum it'll be interesting to see
what BlueStacks does with the additional
funding for their gaming system
especially since they have a couple of
new partners that they haven't announced
yet unfortunately there's been no word
yet on whether or not Amazon Instant
Video is coming to Android but Amazon
Prime music has just added a whole bunch
of new music that's right friends Amazon
Prime is adding hundreds of thousands of
new songs from a variety of artists
including Miles Davis Elvis Linkin Park
Skrillex Panic at the Disco and many
others it doesn't do much to bridge the
gap between their lineup and the lineups
of other services like iTunes and Google
Play but if you're an Amazon Prime
subscriber your music selection just got
infinitely better the Google Play Store
has started at summer sale and there are
some pretty good applications that are
up for grabs the sale includes price
breaks on premium games premium
applications and even a few applications
that are tossing sales on there an app
purchases some of the big names include
Final Fantasy three and four dead space
weather pro HD beautiful widgets Pro
Temple Run oz and many more there's no
word on how long this sale will go and
if you want to see the complete list
we'll have it linked up in the written
companion which is in the video
description below last and certainly not
least this week there is a new trailer
out for the upcoming
he's dead game the trailer shows the
graphics in the upcoming title but not
really anything else the creators have
been quoted as saying that their
approach will be survival strategy so
that's obviously what kind of game it's
going to be it'll tie into the other
games and the TV show so fans of those
will definitely want to get their hands
on this when it comes out where it is
that it'll be out sometime early on in
2015 so wants to see some trending
applications as usual if you want to
check any of these applications out you
can find the links in the written
companion which is in the video
description below first up this week is
bamboo paper this application by Wacom
is a doodle notetaking application that
has a crisp clean layout and some funk
tools for doodling and note-taking that
focus on precision some people have been
disappointed with it but overall the
vibe is that the app isn't all that bad
and if you're looking for a simpler note
taking or doodling application this
could be the way to go swipe is the
first official game designed
specifically for Android wear it's a fun
little time waster where you must swipe
around your watch face to match blocks
match blocks then disappear and you get
points added to your score it features
online multiplayer and has a phone
version as well it's a dollar 69 in the
Google Play Store right now Firefox
browser got a huge update this last week
included are a few UI tweaks the removal
of caps infrastructure web VTT
implementation css3 implementation and a
whole lot more this should result in a
cleaner better experience with less
incompatibilities than before if you're
getting tired of your old browser why
not try Firefox Skype version 5.0 for
Android came out this last week included
or the boilerplate fixes and
improvements blitz guy can now manage
your contact list and your contacts will
start showing up in your Skype contacts
automatically for many this may not be a
big deal but if Skype starts being more
like Google Hangouts as an all-in-one
chat solution then things could get
really interesting because you can
already make phone calls in Skype last
and certainly not least this week is the
release of modern combat 5 the game cost
$6.99 in the Google Play Store and has
no in-app purchases the graphics are
phenomenal and the game comes with
online multiplayer more campaign and
more action than the original monarch
combat will remains on a lot of lists
for the best first-person shooter and we
don't expect anything less out of modern
combat 5 if you want to see more stay
tuned because our review will be out
soon
