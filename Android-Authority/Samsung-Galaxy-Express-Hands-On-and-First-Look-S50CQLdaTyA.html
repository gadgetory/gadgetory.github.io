Authority what's going on everyone and
we're looking at essentially what is the
last phone in the galaxy line that we
see here at the booth at least at mwc in
Barcelona Spain what we're looking at
here is essentially kind of a clone of
the galaxy s2 to essentially but with
galaxy s3 design so as you can see just
like the galaxy young the galaxy grand
the galaxy fame this is very much a
phone that takes a lot from the galaxy
s3 in terms of its design see the silver
lining over on the sides over here all
around the UI TouchWiz as we all know
and love button underneath you know so
the design the design choices are
largely the same however this is a
little bit smaller than the galaxy s3
coming in at a 4.5 inch display wvga it
is a super amoled screen though so you
got you have some pretty nice display
capabilities here and it does look quite
it does look pretty sharp so the display
does do its job and does it quite a good
job of it 4.1 jellybean is the software
that you get here so it's nice to get a
newer version of Android on here however
it is like we said kind of like the
galaxy s2 because it has a 1.2 gig
Rhodes dual-core processor underneath
with one gigabyte of RAM so that all
being said there is a 2,000 milliamp
milliamp hour battery inside so you are
going to get quite a bit of power from
this phone it should be able to last for
quite a while and it should because if
it needs that battery since this is the
LTE variants of all of the different
galaxy phones that are available at the
finally on the back there there was a 5
megapixel camera so this is just a quick
look the smaller size by jose point 2
inches really does make a bit of a
difference though in the hand is really
easy to grip and even though this has
samsung's pretty much trademark
plasticky design it doesn't really feel
like it's going to slip out on my hand
because i can get a very good grip on it
and still have a good time using it so
there is still a market out there for
these more mid-range phones people who
just want their phones to work they
don't necessarily need all the crazy
aspects and this is one of them so this
is the samsung galaxy Express we're
coming to you live from the final day of
the Mobile World Congress here in
barcelona spain one last time it's josh
ravu gaara and we will see you a little
bit later so remember to subscribe to
