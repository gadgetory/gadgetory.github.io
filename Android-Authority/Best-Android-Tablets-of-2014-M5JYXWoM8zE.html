brought to you by Harry's so you want to
buy an Android tablet well whether that
tablet's for work and productivity or
for gaming or just for watching goofy
Android authority hosts grandma you're
like talking to a brick wall we my
friend have got you covered so we're not
just gonna share with you what we think
are the best Android tablets but the
best use case for you now right at the
top of the list we got to talk about the
Samsung Galaxy Tab s 8.4 most of us use
tablets for watching movies reading and
playing games so what makes sense to go
for the very best display that you can
get and it's hard to find anything
better than the Galaxy Tab s 8.4 the Tab
s 8.4 is one of the few tablets with an
AMOLED screen and a super crisp quad HD
at that with an excellent 359 PPI being
AMOLED the screen will show deep blacks
and vivid colors perfect for games and
movies now the portable Tab s 8.4
combines the portability of smaller
devices with the screen real estate
afforded to larger tablets plus they
point for ensure is fast and
feature-rich
making it good for just about any task
now in my mind this is really the best
all-around tablet for those who want a
smaller form factor and whether it's
gaming or media consumption or work you
really want to look at this one now next
up is for all you gamers who will love
the Nvidia shield tablet Nvidia is known
for video cards not Android tablets but
this shield tablet is definitely worth
your attention especially if you're into
gaming that's because the shield tablet
is powered by a mighty Tegra k1
processor and comes with Nvidia's Tegra
zone portal that gives you access to
dozens of Tegra optimised
Android games the rest of the specs are
nothing to sneeze at and build quality
and design are top-notch the shield's
stereo front-facing speakers are great
for gaming video and music and the
stylus that comes in the box will amp up
your productivity on the downside
however this device is a bit heavy and
the battery life tends towards the lower
of the spectrum now thus far the people
I know that have used this tablet have
really enjoyed it but they all really
have gaming as the priority now next up
is my personal favorite the Samsung
Galaxy Tab s 10.5 like the Tab s 8.4 the
Tab s 10.5 gives you a beautiful high
resolution AMOLED display that is ideal
for consuming media everything is in a
bigger package however so if a large
screen is your priority the Galaxy Tab s
10.5 is the ideal choice for you from
our list of best Android tablets despite
its generous dimensions however the Tab
s 10.5 is easy to handle weighing in a
little over a pound the Tab s 10.5 comes
with almost everything you may want in a
tablet and samsung's touchwiz delivers
tons of features on the software side
though you may end up ignoring some of
them and while the Tab s 10.5 is all
plastic it still feels like a premium
device all right so this is the option
for people who want to begin to bridge
the gap between mobile and their laptop
or desktop so for example I go to
several meetings a week and I sit around
a boardroom where there's a number of
different laptops everyone's got it out
and it clutters up the space and we
really don't need the heft and weight of
a laptop what we need is to be able to
do some light typing user agenda or
calendar take notes etc and the tablet
is perfect for that and foreign lighter
than a laptop that is the best use case
scenario for this tablet now next up is
this sexy and sleek option that is the
Sony Xperia z3 tablet compact this
tablet is as sleek as Android tablets
get this 8 inch device impresses through
its lightness and very slim profile at
six point four millimeters this is the
thinnest tablet you can get currently
but the z3 tablet compact has more than
just good looks on the inside the fast
Snapdragon 801 processor and three
gigabytes of RAM ensure that you will be
flying through the screens of Sony's
minimalist user interface the LCD screen
is not quad HD but Sony's unique display
technology ensures that you get vivid
colors that are similar to what you'd
get on an AMOLED screen another unique
attribute of the Xperia z3 tablet
compact is that it is water-resistant so
not only is the
tablet very well powered and compact it
is the sexiest sleekest of all the
options so for those of you who are
fashion conscious this may be the choice
for you now I enjoy shopping about as
much as I enjoy explaining Skype to my
grandmother I did it before by accident
yeah so that's why I love harrys.com
because they deliver my razors which I
have to buy every month anyway right to
my door saves me from buying them at the
drugstore and they're better quality
anyway
two things I love about Harry's
especially one the shaving cream smells
great and actually minimizes the razor
burn gentlemen you know what I'm talking
about
we don't love the burn the second thing
is that razor has elegant heft to it it
feels like something my grandfather
would have used go to harrys.com now
when Harry's will give all viewers of
the show five dollars off the winter
Winston set with the code Android
holiday that's right as a special
limited time offer for the holiday
Harry's is gifting all new and existing
Harry's customers five dollars off the
winter Winston set that's harrys.com and
enter the coupon code Android holiday
next up is the much-anticipated Nexus 9
the brand new Nexus 9 from Google and
HTC is an Android fanboys dream it runs
the purest most recent version of
Android lollipop 5.0 and will stay
current for at least two years now the
Nexus 9 is as impressive on the hardware
side you get a 64-bit Tegra processor a
beautiful 1536 x 2048 pixel screen
stereo front speakers disguised under
the protective glass and a very big
battery however like all Nexus devices
there's no microSD card slot the device
features a utilitarian yet elegant
design with an aluminum frame that gives
it the rigidity without adding much heft
alright the Nexus 9 is on this list
because well it's a nexus and it's a
well powered one at that so it deserves
to be on the list but there's two things
that I have to rag on and I don't know
why Google did this one the battery is
known to overheat a little bit the tech
ninja talked about that in his own
review and the second thing is that
something that no one seems to be
talking about and that it's that it
maxes
out at 32 gigabytes come on it's the end
of 2014
32 gigabytes should be a minimum if
you're not going to give us expandable
storage Google at least give us a 64-bit
option this is a primarily a media
consumption device we need a lot of
media space alright so last up let's
talk about the best bang for your buck
option and it has still got to be BAM oh
you guessed it the Nexus 7 2013 edition
yes it is a little bit long in the tooth
for those of you who want cutting-edge
technology but you gotta remember it
still has a higher pixel density than
some of the tablets we talked about
earlier and though it does have those
thick bezels it is still a gorgeous
screen that gets regular updates from
Google you gotta check it out look out
for that full review right there thanks
for watching Edward army my name is Jace
I love to connect with you right here on
Google+ or Twitter you don't have forget
about my brothers and Android over here
Jost Joe and the tech ninja Kevin lawn

hard to deliver the best Android content
