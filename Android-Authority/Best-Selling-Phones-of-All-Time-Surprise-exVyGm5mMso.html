of all time it is not what you think
because it turns out that most people
don't want to spend $1000 on their phone
so come with me back in time and start
off by talking about the 10th best
selling phone of all time I remember
this phone it was the sexy phone I'm
talking about the Motorola RAZR v3 with
more than a hundred and thirty million
units sold the razor v3 was an icon of
its time the devices gorgeous design
stood out from the crowd and made it one
of the most successful phones ever not
only is it the tenth most sold phone of
all time it's also the highest selling
flip phone ever the razor of III can't
compare with today's handsets of course
but it was the best back in the day now
if you're over 30 you've probably used
or owned the ninth phone on our list the
nokia 2600 in 2004 the nokia 2600 didn't
offer much at least by today's standards
it was a simple device with the sturdy
body and Nokia devices were known for
and a small 1.5 inch display
it didn't feature a camera Bluetooth
connectivity or any other fancy features
but it did have a great battery life and
an affordable price tag that made it as
popular as anything in its time and in
the same vein let's talk about number 8
which was the Samsung II 1100 with over
a hundred and fifty million units sold
like the Nokia 2600 the Samsung 1100 had
a sturdy body and offered great battery
life 13 days of standby it debuted in
2009 and became a success due to its
affordable price and worldwide
availability the device featured a 1.5 2
inch display 1 megabytes of internal
storage that is not a typo and a
built-in flashlight for finding stuff in
the dark and yeah you're gonna start to
see a trend here with number 7 on our
list the Nokia 5230 the Nokia 5230 was
an entry-level smartphone with a 3.2
inch touchscreen this Symbian operating
system 3G connectivity it also had a GPS
chip a 2 megapixel camera and 128
megabytes of RAM the device couldn't
connect to a Wi-Fi network but that
didn't seem to bother anybody in 2009
and number six on our list is again
Nokia with the Nokia 6600 with more than
a hundred and fifty million units sold
the Nokia 6600 was a high-end model when
it came out in 2003 offering a 2.1 inch
display a basic camera and an 850
milliamp hour battery it was quite
expensive retailing for around 695
dollars u.s. pricey indeed and for all
you battery hogs out there let's talk
about number 5 on our list
the Nokia 1200 the biggest feature of
the Nokia 1200 was indeed its battery
life seven hours of talktime and 390
hours of standby time it also had a
flashlight that you could turn on by
long-pressing the scroll up key other
than that the phone wasn't really all
that exciting it was just well built and
well priced that plus the fact that you
could get it just about anywhere the
Nokia 1200 is one of the most popular
phones in the world with over a hundred
and fifty million units sold also let's
go even farther back and talk about a
phone that's even older than many of you
I'm talking about the Nokia 3210 it was
launched in 1999 when phones were used
for making phone calls maybe sending
texts the hence that became a massive
success due to his robust body many
color options and attractive look for
its time the best feature was the snake
game which kept people glued to their
screens for hours on end
now with number three on our list we
moved to the more modern era and talk
about the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus
now these phones were released in 2014
and they are therefore the newest phones
on this top-selling list of all time and
although they don't compare to today's
flagships in terms of specs they blow
all the other phones out of the water on
this list when it comes to feature sets
now one of the reasons they sold so much
is because it was a big change for Apple
right that's when the iPhone 5 was a
4-inch screen and then they jumped to
two options a 4.7 and a 5.5 inch screen
huge big feature change for Apple and
that really spurred the 220 million
units sold that's a lot now you're
probably guessing the trend on our list
but number 2 is probably a phone that
many of you owned I'm talking about the
Nokia 1110 with over 200
50 million units sold this compact phone
offered only the basics it didn't have a
camera a color display or a fancy design
like the Nokia and 70 and many other
devices also released in 2005 still it
outsold just about everyone mainly due
to its global availability and
affordable price and for the number one
selling phone of all time let's talk
about the Nokia 1100 with over 250
million units sold this is the best
selling phone of all time and it's a
basic phone that debuted in 2003 it had
a simple curvy design that appealed to
many small monochrome display a
flashlight on top it stuck to the same
formula that made all the Nokia feature
phones popular offering a solid build
quality an attractive design and an
affordable price tag
Nokia's vast distribution network also
brought the device to loads of markets
across the globe which played a big part
in its success and it is an interesting
thing to see the shift that's happened
over the past 15 years or so right
I mean smartphones were really feature
phones that were made cheap and
accessible to everywhere around the
world and now our most popular famous
phones are really expensive 800 to 1200
dollars per phone feature-rich
smartphones but are really for the
exclusive you know top to 3% of the
world who have the income to drop $1,000
on a phone right so that's why we kind
of have a two-tiered system
the iPhone and premium Samsung users
pretty much and then everybody else the
market has really shifted my question to
you is how is the market going to shift
in the next 15 years cuz it is gonna
shift let me know in the comments below
