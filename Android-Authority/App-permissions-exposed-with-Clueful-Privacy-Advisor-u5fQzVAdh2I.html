Hindy the android authority app guy and
in this video we're going to review
bitdefender's clue full application
which lets you take a closer look at
your app permissions so here's what this
app does every app you download has a
set of permissions permissions are
essentially parts of your phone that can
be accessed like your contacts SMS
internet and more can be accessed by
apps so that they can function properly
this app shows you what every other app
on your phone uses in terms of
permissions and that's the full purpose
of this app your apps are divided up
based on how much of your privacy each
app violates and you can go through and
see which ones are the worst it gives
you options to share apps that are
particularly bad to warn your friends or
you can install them on the spot it's
quick it's easy and it works considering
how simple this app is you can do a
whole bunch with it you can uninstall
high-risk apps if clue 'full can find
any of them you can learn what each app
on your device is actually doing with
your device for instance you can see all
the ridiculous things that facebook
wants to do you'd be surprised what your
apps are asking for from there you can
decide whether or not to remove them so
here are the good things the app is very
very easy to use you open it and start
browsing your app permissions categories
of risk and individual explanations of
what each permission does makes learning
permissions easy for those who are not
so tech-savvy it's free and we love free
on installing apps that are too risky as
easy as tapping a button and here is the
bad there are no advanced user options
we would have liked to have at least
seen an option for root users to disable
individual permissions in order to make
applications safe without uninstalling
them everyone who owns an Android phone
should know what permissions are how
they work and what apps use what
permissions this app does an amazing job
of breaking down app permissions and
explaining them to people who might not
otherwise stumble upon the information
on their own while we wish there were
more advanced features like permission
disabling for root users the app is
otherwise a great pick up and is highly
recommended once again I'm Joe Hindy the
