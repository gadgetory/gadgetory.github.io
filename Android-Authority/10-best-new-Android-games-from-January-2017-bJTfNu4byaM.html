I'm Joe handy the Android authority app
guidance about that time of month to
round up the best new android games if
you want to check out any of these games
for yourself you can find those links in
the video description below five nights
at Freddy's sister location is the
latest game and one of the most popular
horror franchises in gaming you'll find
yourself in a familiar position as a
security guard who must keep watch over
some possessed animatronics without
getting yourself killed there are also
some new mechanics laid over the top to
give you an additional challenge along
with the five nights of standing guard
there is also a minigame multiple
endings and a custom night it's $2.99
with no in-app purchases geometry -
world is a simple little platformer game
you'll play as a little square and your
goal will be to jump around avoid
obstacles and make it to the end it also
has a pretty decent soundtrack some fun
mechanics and a practice mode if you
need help you can also play
user-generated levels play daily quests
and a whole lot more this is also one of
the few decent games that is also free
to download with no in-app purchases
grumpy cats worst game ever is a clear
attempt to cash in on an internet meme
thankfully the game is actually pretty
fun it features a variety of minigames
that you can play to pass the time
there's a fishing game a board shopping
game a whack-a-mole game and several
others it also has some delightful
chiptune music along with leaderboards
Deportes it's nothing deeper huge but
it's a good way to kill some time the
little fox is an infinite runner what
did you make premise the developers
boasted it's the first infinite runner
to use a hexagonal playing field that
means you'll have more than just a
couple of directions that you can go it
features simple controls colorful
graphics and an adorable little fox as a
main character it runs pretty well and
it's fun to play however some have
complained about the advertising and
there are a few bugs here in there
Capcom released the first six Megaman
games on Android these are the ports of
there originals and they are the
original games just with touchscreen
controls laid over top all six games
cost the same and none of them have in
app purchases unfortunately all six
games do have some framerate issues that
Capcom claims to be looking into
assuming these get fixed they are all
excellent platformers for mobile if not
then it was wrong to put these games on
this list and I sincerely apologize
bookoo jeera is a platformer where you
play as a whale
apparently aliens have invaded earth and
human technology can't stop them thus
your job is to smash buildings as a
giant whale for some reason weird logic
aside the game is actually pretty fun it
features colorful graphics easy controls
a couple of different play modes and a
lot more
it's a freemium game but it's also one
of the lesser aggressive titles that
we've seen it's good for killing some
time roller coaster tycoon classic is a
port of the classic PC game of the same
name your goal will be to jump into a
scenario and building themed parts that
meets the expectations this version
comes with clothes rollercoaster tycoon
and rollercoaster tycoon 2 you can buy
additional DLC through in-app purchases
it features pretty much everything that
the original games did except for this
one is played with touch controls it was
a classic then and it'll be a classic on
Android soon enough
star wars force arena is a card
collecting game featuring everyone's
favorite galaxies from Far Far Away in
this title you'll be tasked with
collecting up to 80 characters which can
then be used to do combat it features a
premium style combat system support for
co-op play through guilds and a play
system that rewards players for putting
apropos characters together
it's a freemium game through and through
but that can be fun for some people at
least for a little while
The Walking Dead Season 3 is the latest
chapter in a long line of successful
titles from telltale games like its
predecessors you'll be playing through a
selection of The Walking Dead comic book
the graphics animations and voice acting
are all on par with the prior titles
however gameplay seems to be a little
buggy right now and we're sure the
telltale games will fix this eventually
for those who are still interested the
game is $4.99 for the first season and
then you can buy additional seasons as
in-app purchases war friends is a fun
little social shooter you'll play as
some ridiculously cartoonish characters
along with friends and against enemies
it features a 1v1 PvP mode as well as a
standard PvP mode with other players you
can also invite friends to play through
the campaign mode and online co-op mode
it's a whole bunch of fun but the only
bad news is that the in-app purchases
can wreck an otherwise engaging online
PvP experience otherwise it's not half
bad and that about does it for this one
folks if you want to keep watching we
have the latest Android absolutely show
linked up there on the screen and in the
