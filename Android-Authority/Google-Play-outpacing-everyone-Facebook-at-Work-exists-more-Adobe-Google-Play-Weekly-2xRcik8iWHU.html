Hindy the android authority app guy and
this is google play weekly the samsung
has announced that open mobile ACL will
be available on tees and bones starting
from day one what this means is that
android apps will be available to be run
on teasin this is a big deal because
teasin is brand new and has like no apps
at all open mobile ACL will be made
available on the t's an app store on day
one so people can actually have
applications to use there are 1000
supported apps right now which isn't
that much but it's better than what was
available before some new stats have
shown that the Google Play Store grew
faster than any other app store in 2014
the stat measured the total number of
applications and the total number of
developers compared to previous years
Google Play grew to 1.4 3 million
applications by the end of last year
while iOS is sitting pretty at 1.2
1,000,000 of course amazon was also
measured and they've got about 300
thousand applications overall according
to the numbers all three app stores
actually did grow in 2014 but Google
Play outpaced all of them earlier this
week google released google classroom to
the google play store and the apple app
store it's important because this is
essentially the portal to the google
apps for education platform and it was
previously only available on the web
some notable features include the
ability to snap a photo of something and
upload it to google classroom and the
ability to share things from other
applications straight to google
classroom it's basic but it can be a
powerful tool for educators Google Play
Maps is going to be updated very soon
and you will finally be able to share
directions this seems like something
basic that should have always been there
but surprise it totally wasn't now when
you look up directions you can tap the
three menu and share those directions to
others which is a great feature if
you're meeting someone somewhere or
carpooling somewhere additionally you
can now permanently dismiss those
obnoxious location settings warnings it
will be rolling out sometime in the near
future in our last bit of news this week
facebook at work is a thing that now
exists okay so this is actually a
totally separate social network from the
regular Facebook and it aims to bring
that facebook simplicity to businesses
so they can communicate better and
easier it'll compete with existing
networks such as slack and Yammer along
with others it's only available for the
web and iTunes right now which totally
sucks but an Android application is
coming
Ashley will reserve judgment on how good
or bad it is until we actually try it
out it's supposed to see some trending
applications as usual if you want to
check any of these applications out you
can find the links in the video
description below Google Translate got a
huge update this last week included is a
new word lens feature that lets you
point your camera at something and have
it translated for you in real time the
other big feature is instant voice
translation where much like Word Lens
translations happen on the fly and in
real time if you need translation Google
Translate proves again that it is the
king on Android AC display is a popular
lock screen replacement application that
was recently updated to version 3.0 the
new update brings support for lollipop a
new material design inspired interface
and a host of bug fixes and performance
improvements it's one of the better apps
that emulates the Moto active display
with the notifications and the clean
look it's free to download if you're
interested Google now launcher was
updated this last week the update
includes some material design elements
to those running Android 4.1 through 4.4
and that includes some animations some
button changes and other minor aesthetic
changes it's not a huge update but those
who want a more lollipop style
experience that don't already run
lollipop should definitely appreciate it
and it's rolling out right now Falcon
pro 3 was released this last week it
improves on prior iterations of the
application by including boatloads of
material design improved performance
easier navigation and a whole lot more
it is a brand new release and that means
there are some bugs so if you try it out
do keep that in mind if you don't want
buggy software give the developer a
couple of weeks to fix up the problems
and give it a try then adobe released
adobe lightroom mobile for android and
pretty much any name-brand released from
adobe is good news it has a pretty
decent set of features including desktop
syncing and considering it's an early
release it works fairly well the bad
news is that you'll need a creative
cloud account once the trial expires and
that sucks for those who bought the
software and don't use Creative Cloud if
