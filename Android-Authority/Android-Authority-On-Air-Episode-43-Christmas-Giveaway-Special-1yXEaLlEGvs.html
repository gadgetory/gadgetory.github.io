original android hangout show on google+
I'm Derek Ross hey I'm Scott Anderson
we're joined with Johnathan Franklin and
Dan Charlton for a very special
Christmas edition of android authority
on air we'll be giving away 5 google
play gift cards worth ten dollars each
which will have details for later in the
show they're going to do with ten
dollars i do with ten dollars on google
play or just ten dollars in general on
the postal on the place where i was
gonna say well if it was just ten bucks
i go by two beers but uh um alright so
so ten dollars in the Play Store you
know I'm trying to think of us an app i
want to buy right now i can't think of
an app that i want to buy but there's
definitely some music I'd want to buy or
a movie definitely I yeah I would use to
buy us some content I wouldn't use it to
buy a game or a nap at this time I'd
like to check out that new reader app oh
yeah okay well we'll talk about that new
reader app maybe a little bit later on
the show cool cool all right let's talk
about some Android ecosystem news here
and then we'll get into some apps and
devices as well as some carrier news and
routing and ramen as usual and we'll
we'll wrap up as we always do with some
patent whores Apple got smacked in the
face this week and it just makes me
smile all right so uh so let's start out
our christmas edition show here with
some ecosystem news like I said so
Google Play is going through upcoming
2013 deals or end of the year deals or
into the world deals depending if you're
thinking that's gonna happen tomorrow
either way there's there's a yearly wrap
up / new year beginning deals going on
right now so at least until the first of
the year there'll be every day there's a
new new way for you to take advantage of
google play there if that's a free app
or if that's a an indie lap such as an
app you use the free app to look for
hotel and they gave you a $35 you know
credit towards that so there's
everywhere everything changes every day
there's a new app or a new giveaway new
deal every day so that's great that
Google's doing that they did something
like this last year and I think we're
all hoping for a ten-cent app days well
that was that was nice yes I love more
of those I bought tons of apps I know
you know it for ted says monsters by
mall he's good it adds up there you end
up spending a few bucks it's good it's
good like ten dollars over the whole
course yeah so uh musicmatch is now
available in the US and this was rolled
out recently in the UK and and what
musicmatch is it allows you to do the
same thing you always did is upload your
existing content to Google Play you're
allowed to upload 20,000 songs they
already have in your existing class free
but net yet for free as Scott said but
now it happens faster so does it really
actually upload faster no not really oh
it was actually upload yeah exactly well
it only uploads I guess if your song
isn't found on the Play Store yes which
yeah the library is still growing so
there have to be some songs that you
know doesn't match what happened that I
know is not on the Play Store yeah so
I'm sure all of us have some songs that
aren't on the Play Store so songs that
you do have that are on the Play Store
they are automatically added to your
cloud storage on on Google Play so the
new matching feature scans through your
song that says hey this song already
exists you know so it's going through
Scott's yannis albums it sees it seems
that Jonnie is all available in the Play
Store I'm assuming it isn't a place
towards this bad joke and it uh anything
and it says L Scott you're yawning is
already available for you to start
listening to and you can start listening
to it automatically and then you can
stream it back to listen at 320 kilobits
per second now here's my question so
let's say upload a song that's 128
kilobits per second and let's say it
gets matched to Google Play content okay
and Google Play content is 320 kilobits
do I then get the opportunity to
download 320 so basically
upgrading the bit rate on the songs that
i have i believe so because the the
content is is said it just really just
matches the song it doesn't generate
repair on your bit so let's say let's
say you ripped and ripped music yourself
or you got it from another provider from
the bowels of the internet however you
got it let's say you know you have some
skips and pops in your song for whatever
the reason you're not going to have
those anymore because your song really
isn't upload it's just now available to
be streamed so that that's nice if you
don't have a greatest you know quality
music collection and you know a year and
what has been like a year and a half
since the music first came out and was
it made 2011 something like that I
remember it took me like two days to
upload 10,000 songs you know I it took
forever so so okay I'm not a big deal
then since then I've been slowly adding
music to that but you don't have to
spend days doing anymore it's just maybe
only an hour half hour a few minutes
depending on how much music you have
that isn't available so that's nice with
regards to the 320 kill but nick says on
Google+ that you can only stream at 320
you can't download it 320 I'm not sure
he said you only stream yeah so I mean I
just covered it as well as keying what
um like what is the download rate at
that is that whatever your original one
was what if you don't actually have the
original file on your hard drive how do
they know or what if you uploaded them
you know of a very most mp3's nowadays
or vbr variable bit rate so what type of
feeling mean like that's actually a very
good question ah I haven't redownload
any of my music I've never had a need to
personally I didn't have my originals I
mean I know very little of my music was
probably at 320 kilobits but I mean I
don't have the to compare you know what
I recently formatted in put linux men on
my system I don't have my 10,000
originals either I don't need them that
you know what the Nick I'm gonna I'm
gonna check i'm curious i'm gonna
download an mp3 or two after the show or
try right now either you might give my
band was for the show dan
the right thing to do would be to allow
them to download an inequality because I
mean technically anybody that would be
uploading or anybody they would have mp3
files on the computer to begin with
probably ripped them at some point from
a CD which the city is higher quality
than 320 or 128 or anything so it's why
you do flat right well I mean no God
Google servers you know that they have
that it would go crazy if it was flag oh
yeah it's something for us to look into
a little bit more obviously we'd we
don't know everything about it that's a
good question so so let's uh let's talk
about some Android malware fud dan you
have some information on that force
barely there's a mud slinging going on
earlier yeah yeah so there were these
big estimates that if androids gonna get
18 million devices affected with malware
in 2013 and this is just so much malware
yeah that's really only about 1% of the
devices Android device is expected to be
on the market just remember there's 500
million half a billion we're a half a
billion right now and they're expected
to sell a billion in 2013 so this that's
a that's not a big deal I mean it sounds
like a lot when you look at actually how
many users or how many phones tablets
actually exist it's nothing and when you
compare that to Mel hair in Windows for
example that's nothing I my works me as
basically if your OS X word that they
found if you just compare that to the
percentage of Apple machines at Apple's
headquarters that were infected you're
looking at more problems in apples
ecosystem than on Android yeah and yet
everybody keeps complaining about
Android has the security problem just be
a smart consumer in you will be safe
yeah the only place with no tomes is in
places where you're buying it off a
black market so don't use a black market
another thing is the ones that are
really leading this research our
antivirus and anti-malware companies
they're trying to sell you something yes
the ones that are primarily pushing
and claiming the majority of the
exploits or potential exploits and
security flaws are the ones that are
trying to sell you software so you have
to take that into account too because
trend micro has been a really big one
it's and the antivirus companies are
really dying out yeah monetarily so
we're starting to realize that it's not
about having hantavirus stuff bogging
down my system all the time it's about
me not clicking on stupid links all
right so let's talk about some app
updates here Scott you are a resident
app update guru you want to hit on some
of these for us I love the app updates
you know when I wake up in the morning
and I don't see that there's an app that
needs to be updated starting off on the
wrong foot starting on the wrong foot
all right so we had a google+ app update
allows the communities feature it's in
right now my personal opinion is it's an
overused feature that just kind of is
there in my stream it's going to get
better moods which are little like blobs
that have emotions I guess that's the
best way to describe it I don't know
really what they're called but uh they
you can post them to whatever mood
you're having I think it's a pointless
feature um and hopefully they replaced
the moods with something and moods when
you post them their gifts and you can
see them moving in your stream on mobile
tablet or on your phone and with that
could have been used elsewhere yeah um
but you know yeah you gotta show how
you're feeling I guess turning this into
you know that F word um and then
basically there's a bottom bar it's
black and colorful um personally I think
it's ugly and it gets in the way when
you're trying to scroll down swiping up
and yeah I don't think it it gets in the
way I actually like it down there versus
being up top because whenever i am
swiping down you you don't really swipe
up that often you're scrolling down your
stream you're eating so I like it being
down there I don't like the colors I
mean I know their Google color to just
be it feels out a place with the rest of
the app wait you you swipe up no no no
no no no you swiped from the bottom to
the top to see the older pulse what as
I'm scrolling down swiping down whatever
as I'm looking at older posts it
disappears as soon as i go to swipe up
it it appears yeah but let's say you
look at a post and it appears yeah and
you try to swipe down again and then it
gets in the way i think i would agree
with that yeah i don't know why it's
there at all i don't know why it's not
unlike the hidden side menu yeah i don't
i don't hate it I like it I like it
being the where it is versus where it
was at the top I didn't like it's easier
to just tap it with your thumb now you
need to make a post I do agree it is
easier to tap with her thumb anybody not
like like Scott said that I don't like
the colors only well they're pushing for
hollow you know kind of monic tones
colors really against it for how the
guidelines you not I mean it's they
won't they want the action or atoms to
be relatively subtle like Dorian Gray
mono you know flat gradients not a lot
of you know iOS looking kind of things
then you put these applications out here
is ugly yeah it is fugly yeah yeah so
one thing though that is nice about the
app is moods right i mean that's the
best feature that was at it like
you know it's neat but I'll give it that
I'm not a fan of my spacing Google+ is
it cool that you can add a mood yeah am
I ever gonna do it no and I really hope
that if I have you on my stream you
don't show me your moods all the time in
see anybody moving yet I did it to this
video i have not mooted and i will never
mood same people mood but i have mooted
myself i saw a couple people do just to
see what looks like any know and that's
okay but something that'll see it all
the time man i blocked them immediately
it's not i I'm not mean I'm in the
Christmas spirit I will not block you if
you give me a mood unless you mood all
the things than I'm like you guys
haven't noticed our attire is green and
red um because of this holiday that's
coming up I don't know festivus I think
they go fast yeah festivus uh well and
what we're going to do we're going to
talk about the pole and we're talking
about our grievances and the show won't
end until one of us gets wrestled to the
ground and then we're going to talk
about our moods together in a circle a
circle all right so uh so yeah so moods
yeah let's move on talk about some more
apps here hi so the Amazon mobile
shopping app got updated basically gets
7 inch tablet support which is nice it's
moving in the right direction nexus 7
definitely looks nice um got some bug
fixes able to see wish list so things
related to your wish list kind of cool I
go if you want to use a your nexus 7 to
buy a Google+ Santa gift for the G+
Secret Santa you can do that since you
can view wishlist I do like that so
let's talk about Isis mobile wallet and
Google Wallet uh if you remember about
honestly two weeks ago I could be wrong
on the time frame recently verizon
released a statement saying that the
reason the google wallet is not
supported is because google
wallet uses the secure element on the
phone and that is proprietary hardware
and it is not part of the OS it's not
part of their radio communications and
therefore verizon thinks it's bad and
has no access to it and will not use it
however screenshots of Isis being
installed have been making their rounds
this week and whenever you install Isis
the mobile wallet from verizon uh
basically the exact same thing AT&amp;amp;T and
t-mobile it says hey look whenever you
install this app this app has to have
access to NFC and the secure element hmm
so their argument last week of the week
before that said Google Wallet couldn't
be used because it uses secure element
was complete and utter crap no
it was it was more crap so so
Dan what do you what do you think of it
I mean I know you know a verizon
customer but but but you're you're
usually creatures Verizon t-mobile just
risin though it's erica me mobile too
yeah and they're the three of them
together making themselves a lot of
legal problems because right off the bat
the three of them together are colluding
to block a competitor know what they're
doing is they're buying time for
themselves to release an okay app and
get it on all their phones and then
eventually they'll let Google do their
thing yeah that's the effect of all the
action what's going to happen the
practical impact of what they're doing
I'm talking about like the legal
ramifications these three companies are
illegally colluding I'm talking the
exact same way that Apple and the book
publishers were illegally colluding this
is against the law for the three of them
together to be doing this and then for
them to block it for such superficial
reasons and then turn around and do the
exact same things they're gonna start
running into huge antitrust problems all
three of them together and they're so
big that they can do it no because
Google is big enough that they can raise
the stick especially while the FTC is
grilling them
and pour it for two years they've been
under investigation and they will have
no problem turning around and saying I'm
sorry you just came off this
investigation and pretty much let us
walk away with a self and post slap on
the wrist and this is what you're
letting our competitors do really yeah
it will be able to well for verizon and
AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile so what these prints
has not been particularly favorable
towards do you know our stance on on
Google Wallet Isis debacle secure
element gate let's call it that secure
element gate so what let us know in the
comments if you're watching or later
when you're listening but what do you
think of this you know is is this you
know it's verizon's it's a tease it's
t-mobile's phones they can do whatever
the heck they want with them or is this
pretty much the exact opposite of what
Android is meant is you know an open
operating system if this was you know I
could see this being okay if this was an
iPhone because it's closed but entrance
you're more or less open so I don't
agree with it so let me know if you
think that we're nuts or if you if you
hate this as well so what's why you're
yelling about this I think we have
another another honorable mention for an
app update we uh we love it when apps
get holo holo we love it when they get
updated to the new you know android 4.0
or 4.1 higher design which is uh you
know hollow getting rid of oh yeah we
don't need to get into hall you know
what hollow apps are so ESPN decided to
hollow all the things on their
scorecenter app so that's cool alright
so let's get into a Google Play gift
card giveaway here so here at Android
authority we are going to give away five
google play gift cards this evening
during the show each gift card is worth
ten dollars and you will be given a code
and you can then use this code to buy

winner and to help help you guys out to
to make it easier so we can give you
something so find the original post and
start watching here so um whenever we
ask the questions you're going to then
comment the first person to comment with

contact you after the show most likely
tomorrow since that it is late and
evening and tomorrow I will contact you
and give you your code and then you open
up the google play app where it says
redeem or you can actually even do it on
the website too I'm you can redeem a
code you put your code in you get your
10 bucks you buy whatever you want ok so
now giving you guys a few seconds here
enough rambling on here the first
question for ten dollars of google play
credit is named the month date and year
that google acquired android for example
july first 1773 which obviously that
that's that's pretty accurate yeah so so
said yeah month date and n year what
month date and year did Google acquire
Android and our and our yeah yeah young
remain ounce yeah you don't have to give
us the hour cuz I don't know I don't
know if I'm sure only a few people
actually know that all right so uh what
while we're waiting for an answer let's
talk about another google app update
Scott which one we are talking about Oh
Loretta redbox instant redbox instant um
all that I have another one to talk
about that I got a little beef on being
a winner already i'm gonna interrupt you
Scott cuz I'm a jerk I see Steve Foster
i think is the the the winner you go
first winner august seventeenth 2005 it
look let's verify that on outside the
comment tracker here that's it yeah all
right okay John let's keep 2005 somebody
could not follow all right so Steve
Foster ah i will contact you and get you
your code tomorrow I set up a show to do
tonight and all the prep and everything
I will definitely contact you uh I will
contact you on google + 0 + mention you
and give you your code ok all right
let's move on and talk about redbox
instant and then stay tuned uh we're
gonna give away uh for more in a little
bit I'm excited very good Merry
Christmas steve-o you get that free
money solid explore just got out of beta
I thought that he likes alex Florida I
really do oh yeah yeah that's all sir
than I said okay so uh redbox instant
it's a service from verizon and redbox
it's basically a competitor with Netflix
eight dollars a month from minute
streaming and for physical one night
rentals it's an invite-only beta right
now and it is available for installation
on the
play store and to any rooted verizon
users you are destroying the network but
streaming movies is not yeah so what's
great is verizon axes unlimited data
because that's bad and then they come
out with a new day too hungry service
mmm seriously theorists go to the top um
been with consumer in the United States
of any service so yeah yeah yeah yeah
the real problem is gonna come when they
start not charging you for data over
their service that's true and only like
only data from Netflix or YouTube goes
to your cap but if anything from redbox
is totally free because you pay for
verizon yeah they could do it one of two
ways they could do it okay this service
this unlimited streaming service for our
content is going to be free to you no
monthly fee but free but you will pay
for data that you go over or they could
do it and they could say hey this
monthly fee is cool but we're not going
to charge you for data using this app so
I mean they could do it a couple
different ways right now they're else
you know what maybe it'll be something
like if you agree to have with verizon
logo watermark and all your videos in
love if oh come on verizon those good
thing they just gave me LT in my house i
love rice and they do great work nobody
cares all right so hurry up let's move
on you know even wanna give what give me
more Christmas presents here alright so
let's talk about device is up so the
Nexus 7 I want to say one thing hold on
google maps for iOS was downloaded 10
million times in 48 hours does that
surprise anybody know people don't want
to die in the outback of Australia and
they say good things I said iOS 6
adoption jumped up like twenty nine
percent yeah that one boy rival map
service comes out boom people install I
left six I saw actual statistics
comparing
Bing and Google and Apple maps and it's
shocking how bad apple is just shocking
in the US it's not as bad apple will get
you the right place about 71 percent of
the time compared to 88 from google or
86 and then in the UK it's 88 for google
and like 50-something for apple even in
the u.s. when you factor in the margin
of error means you're three times more
likely to get a bad like a dress from
Apple maps then from google maps three
times more likely it's terrible and the
u.s. is where they're the best the rest
of the world they're even worse all
right so uh let's talk about nexus 7
here so I was saying the nexus 7 got
some interesting news this week um
earlier in the week we saw a official
nexus 7 doc get unboxed in Japan and a
few days later today the official doc
went on sale at B&amp;amp;H for 40 bucks is it
showing up on google play no is there
any word from google about this no but
it is the official nexus 7 doc and you
can buy buy it in now and it looks like
shipping availability begins December
30th so I don't know anything else
besides that ah oh it it charges has USB
port and audio an audio jack now
standard no there's no speakers you know
it you know it it's just it's just a doc
you place it in in the landscape noises
their talons right well one would think
it uses the pogo pins because it has a
it has a USB port in the back for
charging so I would assume that it uses
PO gopher for charging you to set it
down in and charges but you know we
don't really know since it's still very
new I'm not a family I don't need one
for it all right so we had some had some
interesting rumors about the HTC m7 as a
successor to uh to the One X to the 1 X
Danny won't talk a little bit about that
yeah
so it's supposed to be another 4.7 inch
device just like the One X also with an
LCD to display except this time it's
going to be at 1080 instead of 720 so
it's even more pixel dense than the
droid DNA which was already like 414 so
this is in like the 450s probably range
so very pixel density it's also rumored
to have a 1.7 gigahertz Qualcomm
quad-core Snapdragon s4 processor and a
13-megapixel rear-facing camera together
with a 2-megapixel front-facing plus
their image sense chip so it should be a
very good camera so i got if the rumors
are true this is going to a very very
good ties that's a kind of you know i
think big screen sizes too small now
talking about pogo pin charging we saw a
little bit Nexus 10 rumors leaked this
week nexus 10 pogo pin charger is
basically just a little clamp that just
clamps on the bottom knob if the image
is correct if the image is real the leak
said it was going to cost roughly 20
bucks and be available online stores you
know for like twenty bucks like on
Amazon we don't really know anything
else it's a leak it's a photo online and
it seems to be legit I don't really see
the point of it um I but hey it's a
different way no has to use the
properties because those things have
been pretty much useless to this point
and say you know yeah it's on it's a
nexus accessory so we don't know
anything about it you know until boom it
just shows up somewhere magically um
moving on us sell your owners rejoice if
you have a galaxy s2 from Samsung you
are now giving ice cream sandwich on
your device that is a jelly bean said
the ice cream sandwich ice cream
sandwich came out 14 months ago and you
are now getting android 4.0 point form
congratulations you're still behind you
know i'm i try to be sorry not to be
sarcastic about that because an update
is an update it's a great update you
know you're getting some nice features
uh but yeah it's really far behind that
me an update an update and that's good
you're on four-point-oh italina at least
but project butter is really the thing
that people need if all basic phones got
project butter and be awesome would be
sweet you know their UI experience would
be increased a lot he was from
gingerbread ICS it's a lot to as does
his shrimp you still got that you know
lag and Brenda ICS from a like technical
standpoint is a far more difficult
hurdle than I see us to jelly mhm egl
drivers already good so uh let's talk
about another phone that's getting
android 4.0 that is needed for eons I
hope we move so the HTC Thunderbolt
verizon's first 4g phone supposed to be
getting android 4.1 HTC said this on
twitter so soon in soon plus android
updates plus verizon plus HTC equals who
knows they saw it in Tommy so
Thunderbolt owners your phone at this
point is gonna be ready for an upgrade
very soon but you're gonna have an
update coming out even though your new
42 is already coming up in like months
from now if you were perfect get that
phone I i really wonder why they would
push an update to a phone that is
probably lost and you know had a steady
declining of users that actually on the
phone why why waste your time yeah
people to still have it not one that
still hasn't he's livid and maybe it is
rising just doing it to say hey we do
support legacy devices probably restore
the wreckage eric i don't panic hurdle
for that for months well you know what
what what uh never mind we're not gonna
give we're not could talk about that so
you've got a kernel for that phone from
thunderbolt fries yes yeah well you know
what Dan that actually brings us into

he has no clue where talk fascinators
memes that leads to baby needs to start
baking Carl's together and calling it
that I think it's like it sounds legit
yeah alright so so let's uh let's move
on to some more are more two more device
news now almost done we'll talk about
something else I so if you like Google
TV
or you know you're on the fence about
should I get one should I not get one we
have two things with the vice news today
one the Hisense pulse became available
for ordering today the Hisense pulse is
a $99 google TV set-top box um similar
to the vizio actually looks almost
exactly like the vizio the you know it
but it's made by different manufacturer
but but it is but it's a little bit
different the the remote control has a
microphone in it the co-star does not so
it is google TV version 3 ready I'm just
nice and if you're not aware for in
version 3 of google TV it allows you to
do voice search so you'll pick up your
mic and say you know uh Batman Begins
and you'll find a it'll find that for
you so um the remote has that feature
and I said the co-star does not and
another big differentiating feature is
the Hisense pulse has the IR blaster
built into the actual set-top box most
Google TV devices have that but the
could the co-star it said the device
that it looks similar cost similar to
does not the costars IR blasters are in
the remote it's what exactly does that
mean for a lot of people won't mean
anything won't be a big deal but for a
lot of people it will be IR blasters
allow you to control other devices so
you can control your TV your you know
your DVR your cable box whatever and
Turner dropped out do you have any idea
like how good the Hisense is in
comparison to say the physio or the I'm
not that familiar with that new device
but I know that the update for the video
was awesome it's definitely a lot faster
than what it was before uh Derek you
agree with the vizio update yeah yeah
the vizio update is I definitely noticed
faster menu performance stability I
never really had a crash or anything
like that our apps crash but except for
plex plex
crashes all the time I uh one bad
experience that with a visit visio it
got in a continuous loop of me trying to
reboot it and this app just kept dying
interesting well the it's faster now I
can definitely tell the menus are faster
the UM the overlay it's itself is faster
you
our blasters as you guys finish that up
at all or no no all right so real quick
the IR blaster so if you have them in
your remote now that works great so you
can control all of your devices as long
as you know your remote is pointing out
all your devices why would you know if
you're pointing it at the TV all your
devices are going to be out there and we
got to control them where this comes
into a big deal is if you're using an
app to control your TV so if you're
using like the Google Play I'm sorry the
google TV app or you're using may be
able remote or something like that and
you're trying to control your TV your
remote has to be pointed at your TV
anyway so you have to have an out on the
coffee table and then you have to go
into the settings on the co-star and say
do not put my remote to sleep basically
when it's not in use so it's always
running always using battery so there
are workarounds in it you can get it to
work on the coast are but most Google TV
devices have the blaster the you know
communication device to your other
devices built into the actual set-top
box you don't have to do that um big
deal for some people not a big deal for
others anyways 99 bucks you can go ahead
so you can go and purchase that today um
you know how I I snagged one I'm gonna
have to google TV boxes in a pulse in a
costar saw I'll give my thoughts here in
two days when i get 10 which one you
think is better well which one do i
think is better now when you get the oh
yeah yeah i'll definitely taught me
depending on the overlays Chris if you
know the stock versus overlay you know
their implementation of it yeah I'll
I'll definitely talk about it and give
my recommendation definitely also uh
yeah let's uh let's let's move on to
some OEM news uh Dan I've been yakking
for a while you want to take it over
sure uh so apparently HTC in their
continuing financial woes is canceling a
bunch of devices we already heard
they're canceling of Windows Phone
device most because of Microsoft's low
standards um but now currently they're
canceling several Android devices and
trying to kind of refocus we heard kind
of the same thing
from them last year and it didn't really
pan out they ended up releasing a whole
slew devices again this year so
hopefully they can get it together a
little bit more and keep the you know
the m7 is sort of the One flagship
everywhere and then you know push out
one or two other models beyond that and
really get it together they want to
really really put the focus into making
blockbuster devices which for them their
biggest problem is advertising so that's
that's good because it means that you
know your few things to advertise for
and then in other news Samsung Exynos
processor specifically the Exynos for
apparently has a security flaw in it
that basically you can exploit the
security flaw to gain access to the
devices ram and then from there you can
do continuing late more malicious things
and basically take over the device so
definitely a definitely a flaw
definitely bad definitely a simple fix
in terms of coding essentially just a
particular permission is not set
appropriately in a particular place so I
have to do is change that and then it's
fine the problem is obviously getting
updates out to the public is slow and so
now that there is very public
information about this definitely if you
have devices with the nexus 4 and that
would be in the US the Galaxy Note 2
internationally the galaxy s3 and I
think some versions of the galaxy has to
have a dual core Exynos foreign so both
the quad-core exynos floor and the dual
core X notes for are affected by the
issue so if you have one of those and
you're rooted you can very easily find a
kernel developer that is going to
incorporate the patch and get yourself
you know an updated patch otherwise it's
probably going to be a while for samsung
twirl it out to you internationally
that's a little bit easier so
fortunately most of the affected people
are international in the u.s. Galaxy
Note 2 owners should be watching out for
for problems with that and then in more
processor news Tegra 4 rumors of leaves
so in videos next generation processor
is rumored to be a quad-core cortex a15
processor so twice what the the samsung
exynos 5 is together with a single core
a5 cortex a5 processor she's the same
four plus one set up that they've been
using and then their GPU which is based
off their new desktop GPU line I think
it's called the Trinity GPU but for the
their arm chip it's going to have 72
cores so what that says for actual real
were real world performance remains to
be seen but it's definitely going to put
a damper on Apple trying to brag about a
quad-core GPU now um then aou is a
display manufacturing they're going to
start shipping AMOLED screens the first
company other than Samsung to ship these
types of displays and HTC quickly bought
them all so definitely look for probably
too low to mid-range HTC's using AMOLED
screens in the not-too-distant future in
a little bit more news Imagination
Technologies who makes a lot of GPUs
they make the power VR series that the
iphone and a lot of other high-end
devices use are trying to buy miss who
make processors for about a hundred
million dollars and so that it looks
like they are trying to move into the
full-on system-on-a-chip marketplace
through mips intrusion that's
interesting yeah and android runs on
myths already and there are a lot of
popular very low-end Chinese and Indian
tablets using mips processors they are
very popular for mixes of devices here
in the US these are reduced this drunken
set architecture that doesn't cost as
much to license so minutes ya know it's
it's definitely a promising architecture
it's usually used for a lot more sort of
intermediary processing tasks the sort
of behind the scenes things that people
don't think about actually having a
processor type applications so i don't
know how it will go
definitely didn't have options there
though they got bare chested in tow I
listen let's move on here talk about
routing and wrong in for a little bit
and then after this segment will give
away our third google play ten dollar
gift card here in a few minutes so on
the root and rom in front CM continues
to CM 10.1 all the things right now they
have a decent list of devices that are
getting nightly builds one of the nicer
features that is available right now
Lisa that I think is the quick settings
quick tiles update or enhancement I
guess I'm really not the enhancement
that CM added so right now and Android
4.2 quick tiles are pretty much just
shortcuts I honestly don't see a whole
lot of a need for them besides seeing
the current state of some of your you
know some of those things you know if
they're connected or whatnot they're
just shortcuts it's very cool i love
them but they take the exact same amount
of clicks or taps to still disable or
enable Wi-Fi you still have to flick
down you saw off to hit the Wi-Fi
shortcut then you actually have to hit
the button to turn it off it it so it's
a shortcut the same amount taps so it
very cool but CM improved upon it so now
the tiles are actual toggles and then
they're completely customizable to you
there's a list of maybe ten fifteen
different toggles you can choose from
and then you can rearrange them in the
order you want it it's very nice I like
it um i wish i was able to do that on my
DNA that's another story so let's get
into what is available right now on CM
10.1 with nightly builds remember
nightly builds are you know kind of like
bleeding edge roms you know there might
be a few things uh not working or might
be buggy whatnot but yeah you know flash
of your own risk anyway so all variants
of the galaxy nexus have CM 10.1 as well
as the nexus 10 the next is for the
seven the next 7 3 3g also the trap next
in the name and not followed by one it's
got it yeah yeah pretty much else no the
nexus s does not have it poor us or the
fort nexus s 4g so anyways a the
transformer pad as well as a transformer
pad infinity or the transformer infinity
have CM 10.1 and then a whole mess of
Samsung devices as always so we have a
samsung galaxy tab 2 7 point 0 the tab
to 10.1 the verizon 10.1 10.1 Wi-Fi uh
and then a few models of the original
samsung galaxy s a few variants few
models of the s2 and then a few models
and variance of the s3 so there's a lot
of Samsung devices you know that got
added the past week and I'm sure as time
goes on more and more get added more
more get more stable yada yada yada and
as always the rule of thumb with the
signage my team is no no ETA so you know
it's coming when it comes whenever your
developer your maintainer you know does
his thing so let's talk about a new
touch recovery that made its way to the
world this past week most of us probably
use twerp or which is team win open
recovery project and then there's clock
pot the original popular guy from couche
so what the what he does use right now
what do you what do you a fan of dan
what's your what's your recovery of
choice i used for but then again i know
most of the developers that were gone so
yeah you got a you guys support your
buddies right you somewhat so John what
do you like you a clockwork guy or a
tornado normal come on twerk come out
here a mano are a guy huh amon-ra
remember that oh yeah well from its are
haha i was i was said are a god I'm on
Raw oh okay well that makes sense now
yes before we lose sense okay very i'm
an idiot from time to time so sorry John
what did you say you grow you remember
that used to be for EXT recovery to
remember yeah I would say much out of it
lately but yo yeah I've been on a I've
been on tour and I don't have a huge
recovery preference or you don't
necessarily need touch or anything but
it's it's fast it's efficient and it
works nice so I haven't had any reason
to change it I uh I liked work how about
you Scott I talked to it's simple and
means yeah I like I like touching on
others clockworkmod touch but clock or
touches Bugsy though but but the touch
it's it's the touch it was added to a
scroll in her face you know what I mean
it yeah not the exact same thing just
blown up four fingers yeah yeah I really
like TWRP I'm a fan and it's in it's you
know it's completely open with with goo
manager it allows you to do a lot of the
things it you know you don't have to
have a certain application bought and
installed to be able to use to access
the API is it it's not like it I said
then again you know a lot of people like
clockworkmod because it supports you
know an insane amount of devices to us
oh that's quite a few like want my old
HTC she's my wife's old HTC incredible
sitting right here it has it has a
clockwork model on you know hmm there's
at work for it there is whatever better
up they've met why should be a public
one I might have a test build of it
still have your private build only the
old day might still have a non-public
tour build up incredible one all right
so uh anyways the reason we're talking
about recoveries is as a new kid on the
block all cannibal open touch recovery
um it has the standard things you can't
expect in the touch recovery you know
there's theme support touchscreen
support obviously it says touch in the
name has button so you can do back in
advance backups user-defined backup
locations like I said standard recovery
features that we've all come to know and
love over time it only supports a few
devices right now because it's new the
developers plan to support additional
devices in the future right now it's
just on the nexus 7 the nexus s 4g the
dink the HTC droid incredible we were
just talking about it's on the epic
touch 4g the kindle fire
the optimus s V &amp;amp; M so um I'm sure maybe
they've had another device or two since
uh since I actually looked into it but
yeah so what right out of your devices
supported and let us know you know what
you think it's definitely an impressive
list and there's a lot that are sort of
easy pickings from there that got
incredible getting the evo and the nexus
one and the desire is minimal work all
right so uh we talked about Google
Wallet earlier let's talk about root and
rom and so if you're a if you're rooted
user and you have a galaxy s3 getting
google wallet to work was kind of a pain
you had to do a whole bunch of build up
prop at its and I'm constantly changing
Google wall to work and it was kind of
paying the but it was hard not really it
was just a paint you know who wants to
go in and edit your your build up prof
unless you're on an it dot T looking for
you know speed to enhancements right and
say hey it's something you're always
going to do so whether there's an app
which honestly it could be removed from
the Play Store already i assume it'll
get removed eventually that's just my
guess like I could be wrong other
anyways there's an app that's on the
play store that does all that for you
don't have to manually go in and edit
your build.prop to get you know doesn't
yeah to get Walt to work to fake it into
working it just uh it does it all for
you now so it makes it easier for you um
if it gets room from the Play Store you
can still snag it from XDA what's that
what's that I assume its root only yeah
yeah could you have two errors I doubt
that'll get pulled from the Play Store I
wasn't doing anything illegal all it's
doing is changing a setting and it dad
it you know it downloads and installs a
wallet for you I mean I guess for a long
time there is a google wild installed on
them either yeah so let's get into what
I voting a nap they can't possibly fault
that all right almost see let's let's
give away another Christmas present our
third google play gift card this card is
gonna be nine dollars and ninety-nine
cents no mom it'll be ten dollars but it
is actually about my friend
Anderson who has been with me for almost
a year talking about android on hangouts
as you realize in another couple weeks
this is episode 40 39 weeks nine and
nine weeks and they had two months we
will be at of a year of doing this
that's crazy to think about right now
alright so in the year that I've known
Scott he fought tooth and nail about not
wanting to root he didn't want to damage
his phone you know what damage is tablet
yeah he he was under the impression that
he could damage it yay yeah you could if
you really try really hard um and
eventually the darkside got to him and
he decided to become a fan of routing
and roaming so in the comments on the
android authority post on Google+ of you
just joining in us now I want you to
tell me the very first phone that Scott
Anderson rooted and what is my rom of
choice for that phone you don't it's not
a part of it that that's a bonus point
and the only thing you get is
gratification that Scott Anderson is
your peer oh yeah the main question is
what phone did Scott root first and for
bonus points what what Romney running
now or what rom did you run first
whatever what rom did I run first and
stick with ya gotta know you stuck with
it I thought you were sticking with the
thing that Adam and I'll give away her I
can talk about my salute soon we have a
winner already a winner yet the way many
Scott Anderson fans oh I think we have a
winner John says I I previously had an
incredible oh well he didn't have an
incredible you had a home with my
previous phone you're the droid x but
but and he currently has the galaxy
nexus so i'm guessing we gotta give it
to John uh wait a second there's some
any further up
who said what he rooted first Ross tuner
Turner excuse me okay the comment
tracker just refreshed for me John
posted before you ask the question oh
I'm sorry yeah I was ignoring John's
post as the yeah were you asked the
question oh and then that's what he
actually posted again his actual real
answer ok John you done screwed yourself
yeah yeah just okay so who won Ross
Turner right Ross oh great I don't see
how Ross Turner one I don't see Russ
turn almost yes and John says so too
okay alright so let's turn off your
watch scott why I see you and that's all
it matters so Ross wants to go to Turner
I will get a hold of you as the others
and then bagley got it right Galaxy
Nexus aokp with a question mark but you
know take that question off ? off and
you'll be right what's a interesting
enough is you he must stalk you well
enough to know that you did have a okay
p there you go Scott I'm just kidding
I'm just kidding been um kid all right
so uh congratulations again Ross I like
your first name my last name glad you
want I merry christmas and i will get a
hold of you later with you coud I mean
where we got I can't blame after all
good I need to hurry up well we're
really dragging the show out tonight
right so uh we got two more to give away
let's just burn through some carrier
stuff for public wireless ah they're
awesome because they're doing things
that other carriers aren't they know
that data and phone calls you know are
two completely different animals and
they're tying it all together with Wi-Fi
calling or date data calling and saying
that we're going to give unlimited
calling unlimited the data for very very
cheap prices and do things completely
different than other carriers and
they're also not okay with rooting your
phone they announced this week that we
saying that they've seen a flurry
question the comments now that the
service is live and they want to give
some answers in a bit of context the
burning question these days is whether
to root your phone and are they okay
with rooting your phone and they said no
when you agree to the Terms of Service
when you join republic Wireless and if
you follow the Terms of Service their
Terms of Service says that they can
terminate your service at any time for
any reason so if you root your phone and
they find out about it I somehow uh they
can terminate your service they can that
doesn't mean that they will yeah i mean
verizon isn't okay with routing and
that's why everything comes down to the
spa yeah but just be aware that they can
but that doesn't mean that they will so
just know they could yeah but but it was
I mean it was interesting to see here
you're just come out and say that though
you know a lot of you know no carriers
really say don't read your phone yes
they do well yeah that's it spread
t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T say the same thing you
read your phone we don't support it
don't support us warm rubble is
completely different than we could
terminate your service yet they can
still terminate your service mmm-hmm
how's it going I like it well either way
we don't work well some of us don't walk
into the place expecting to get
technical support on your rooted phone
we're probably okay and that's pretty
much that that's pretty much the case
anywhere you don't you don't work in
your Galaxy s3 running cyanogenmod
you're probably my racing okay for some
reason like you drop's data yelling no I
never Google won't work on my galaxy s3
what are you doing you know um so uh so
we have republic Wireless so what do you
think of well you know their take on on
calling you know they're doing something
completely different what do you think
about them Dan Scott john looked into
what yeah i mean i like they're trying
different things and
I'd like that about carriers I lie so
he's an old son you know don't a
pitchfork come yet just because they
said no to rooting you know I mean they
have some good stuff yeah I like that
yeah I just don't think it's
particularly well implemented or it
won't be well I'm implemented until you
networks for bigger better stronger
faster no their problem is that they're
building this particular the problem is
they're building this on the back of
sprint's network and on when I say that
I'm not actually saying anything bad
about sprint's network cdna does not
handoff to Wi-Fi like that it just
doesn't and so they have to build a very
specific device with a very specific
radio that can make that work and so
that's why it's only like one crappy
little device and it's not a big enough
carrier to like get good devices because
nobody's going to go out of their way
for republic Wireless if they were
business on the back of a gsm network
that handoff is built in natively that's
why t-mobile can do it because all you
have to do is turn it on right like
Wi-Fi calling is not new it just doesn't
work with cdma yeah all right so let's
talk about sprint since you were
mentioning them yeah Sprint is rolling
out LTE and six more play miss six more
markets and expanding a few that they
already have which is nice and they're
also buying the rest of clearwire's so
the other 49 point something percent
that they don't own for some 2.2 billion
dollars basically this is a big spectrum
grab and so Sprint is actually I think
it could be one of if not the largest
spectrum holders in the country in a
while in outright own spectrum because
they have all the items bactrim they
have a huge chunk of pcs they have all
of this clearwire spectrum at 2,600
they've got a lot of spectrum well
really utilize them now speaking out for
scripture to back it up yeah speaking of
rolling out LTE you know every carriers
that's what they're doing nowadays
except for t-mobile
um next rides and Verizon did the same
thing you know for verizon uh had 16
more markets they're up to like 470
markets or something like that now and
they also expanded on other markets as
well enough for a fact because I have
able to get in my house and I did not
have that before so speaking of me
having LTE at my house and using it that
leads us into the next giveaway this is
a once it once again the last couple
questions haven't really been so much
about Android but more about you know us
the people on the show we want to give
back to the people that watch us or
listen to us from time to time and our
fans of the show so this is this is my
question actually John Wayne asked
question about you will like you that's
all yeah we didn't mean I'm just here
for you guys yeah yeah yeahs scott and
dan and I here for you done Johnny's not
he's just I'm so alright so Derek's
question is what phone am I currently
using as my daily driver first person to
comment on that wins ten dollars of
google play credit the first person to
give the name that Derek often uses for
it on this show the bonus bonus when I
gratification yeah to win danza
gratification what do I refer to this
phone as and comment refresh go looks
like we have a winner oh I'm assume
people know that I call it the dicks
that's grown as close to know I'd say so
Trevor there is a stipulation on this
the HTC DNA is correct but we can only
give play crafts people that have
working phones at this time whoa now it
Trevor actually does have a working
phone his uh he had what like what a
horrible sad version of an android phone
do you have since you broke your nexus 4
I guess I'm like it is something like
crap box phone that he had
is like all right so yeah so the HTC DNA
is right HTC droid DNA now I would have
accepted that as well or the droid well
actually the droid dicks to actually
doesn't make any sense because the D
actually stands for this but uh yeah so
the deluxe of became the dicks the DI
AXA DLX yada yada yada so we're gonna
stop saying that one day yeah so HTC DNA
Trevor experiment releases Trevor I will
I will give you the code even though
you're using some crap box phone right
now since you are getting your nexus 4
fix next week basically Trevor's a rom
developer oven it t he flashed a new
nightly onto his up phone and it bricked
it and he couldn't even get to work
again he had to get a new one if factory
images for that know it fast but didn't
work oh yes amen Trevor does like down
to the metal box and everything this is
not just a rom it Elizabeth it's
basically like a new phone alright so we
all one more giveaway let's let's do
some real quick patent wars really a
real long show tonight so then go so
apples a big pinch to zoom patent was
preliminary struck down by the US patent
and Trade Office is one that Sampson was
found in fringing on in 21 out of 24
devices and because the jury did such a
horrible job and actually explaining
with after they came up with the numbers
they put down it's gonna be really hard
for the judge to walk back those damages
which clearly ought not be paid for a
patent that wasn't valid without
actually having a brand new trial for
damages so more problems in the Apple
Samsung case including judge Koh ruling
that apple will get absolutely no bands
or injunctions on samsung products so
suck it Apple Apple quickly appealed in
european news though Samsung is
withdrawing all of its injunction
requests against apple and then
strangely the EU is apparently
investigating them for antitrust
problems of requesting injunctions
against
other people's devices for patent
infringement which they're no longer
doing so bad timing um google apple and
research in motion free strange
bedfellows are coming together to by
about a quarter or about a half a
billion dollars worth of kodak patents
which is good news ricotta because that
covers most of their outstanding debt
and is good news really for all
smartphone users because hopefully it'll
be less patent crap to do with camera
patents ah is that really what's going
to happen i mean it is a gun on me like
Oh everybody's got enough patents and
then we can't really know the three
companies together are bidding on them
so all three companies will basically
share ownership of that you're bigger
than pretty much so also they'll all be
using the same patent in the first place
so you can't sue and say oh you're
infringing on my patent because your
patent is my patent okay interesting so
that'll definitely undercut some of the
camera patent wars for smartphones um
that's good for the rest of these real
quick here dancer yeah google lost a I
to see judge meant against apple on a
proximity sensor patent but there's
still a bunch more pending there and the
FTC case against Google looks like it's
dying which was quickly followed by
Microsoft doing a whole lot of whining
Microsoft has been whining a lot lately
lot yes what else they gonna do design
of a phone operating system oh yeah
exactly I like I want them to succeed
but they're not going to okay we ready
