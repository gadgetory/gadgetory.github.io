with android authority we're reporting
live from Mobile World Congress in
Barcelona it's 2013 thanks for tuning in
i'm here with omar javaid and he is the
vice president of all the mobile
products for HP and what he has right
here with us is HP's first foray into
Android in the form of a tablet so I'm
gonna let him take it away and I'm going
to let him talk about what HP strategy
is with regards to Android and what we
can expect in 2013 and beyond excellent
thank you Darcy look I really appreciate
you guys spending time with us look so
we we have a big announcement as you
mentioned it's our first Android product
and we I think really kind of surprised
the industry by by our first foray not
only to the Android but into a really
aggressively priced product which we're
really proud of its we call it the HP
slate7 so as the name implies it's a
7-inch android product it's running
Android jellybean 4.1 it's got a couple
of really interesting capabilities I
think given its given its price point it
really has premium Build construction so
we have a stainless steel chassis as
well as nice soft touch backing sorry
for interrupting but what is the price
point so in the US will be offering it
at 169 dollars in Europe it'll be at 149
year over that's fantastic very
aggressive yeah it's a very aggressive
price point I think most importantly we
haven't gotten to this but it's fully
backed by HP so what you'll find with a
lot of so-called value products is
nobody knows who to call for support if
support is forthcoming right and you
guys cover this area extensively so I'm
sure you know about it better than I do
just talking to various companies out
there but this will have full HP support
which is you know global support we're a
very you know we operate in nearly every
company so you know for people that have
this product they get the the support
and care from HP that they know and
trust okay so if you could just take us
through the specs I'll be sure we're
looking at a 7-inch profile correct and
it has a really really nice aluminum or
metallic sort of bezel actually it's a
great great observation it's a stainless
steel stainless steel part yeah so it's
stainless steel with laser etching nice
and nice soft touch back yeah really so
good for grip okay and as you pointed
out at seven but it's actually we've
tried to make the borders of narrow so
you can rip it quite nice i've probably
bigger hands and mostly it was a 16 x 10
ratio almost i actually yeah but it's a
16 by 9 so it's a standard 16 by 9
aspect ratio and it has a front-facing
and rear-facing cameras which is pretty
unique for a product in this category
megapixel on the front and the rear what
are we looking at so front is vga rear
is three me at three megapixels is very
good and so let's see in the internals
inside what sort of processor we look
talking about yeah so it's a dual core
okay a nine nice processor operating at
1.6 gigahertz very good the base
configuration has one gigabyte of RAM
and eight gigabyte of flash storage okay
very good and microSD for stl for a very
good correct and talk about the beats
audio on the back how did that work out
so you know it many people who are
familiar or customers of our laptop
products know that we've been pretty
aggressive about implementing about
implementing beat beats in our product
line there this is actually the first
tablet with the the beats technology
Beats Audio technology
and that's a combination of things it's
enhanced audio circuitry as well as
software absolutely I think consumers
are very familiar yeah with the beats
brand it yes yes they re and they love
it yeah so bring it back to release
dates when are we going to see this in
stores so will launch in the u.s. first
that'll be early April okay and that
again is at 169 and rest the world
starting in Europe will be May from a
onward or at 149 Europe one now another
thing I want to talk about is you know
the death of palm OS you know an https
general strategy are we going to see
more mobile products with android
embedded and you need to speak about
maybe some phones are you producing or
letter an RD or can you just talk about
android and HP and what we can expect
going forward sure well look we we can
only talk about the products that we
announced today I know a lot there's a
lot of speculation about what we're come
on about what we're going to do and what
we're not going to do our CEO Meg
Whitman has said that we will and we
must get back into the smartphone market
yeah so that part is public and we are
absolutely committed to that but we
don't have a timeline as to when we will
do that or what products those will be
so you know but but we're committed to
doing that I'm very good very good well
I think a lot of us will agree that
Android is the first class ticket to the
top so we're very excited about the
product and we think we have high hopes
for its success and you know we're big
fans of Android excellent well we wish
you all the best and I want to say thank
you very much for your time really happy
to see you guys find the tro some
hardware with android on board likewise
likewise thank you for your interest
well thank you very much and maybe we
can collaborate and have a giveaway for
our visitors day indeed alright well
