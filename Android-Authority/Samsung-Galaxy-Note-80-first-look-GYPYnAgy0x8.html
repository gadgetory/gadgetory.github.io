first look at the Galaxy Note 8 it's a
brand new device from Samsung here it
does incorporate some s-pen
functionality which is pretty cool it
features an 8 inch display of the LCD
variety is 1280 x 800 resolution now in
terms of his thickness we're looking at
a seven point nine five millimeter
profile making a slightly thicker than
the ipad mini additionally it weighs in
at around three hundred and thirty eight
grams so not too heavy and not too light
either obviously quite with a thick
bezel the display actually it's very
very bright Samsung has great display
technology now it's not the sharpest
display on the market but it still is
more than sufficient and adequate for
ebook reading into the things of that
nature so other than that it has a very
very fluid TouchWiz interface
essentially like a larger galaxy note 2
TouchWiz withdrawal familiar with and of
course it does bring the s-pen
functionality which some love actually
it has a mode that we were just informed
of called smart reader mode which will
adjust the contrast to make it emulate
that of a book that you would be reading
Bobby other than that internally we're
looking at two gigabytes of RAM it has
an XC notes a nine quad-core 1.6
gigahertz processor so not the fastest
but more than sufficient for a 1280 x
800 resolution display obviously really
really fluid now it does have the
plastic that we've come to know Samsung
using most of the products as of late
initially I just gave it a little bit of
flex it is a very flexible device and
you can see a little bit on the display
hopefully they bring it to market with a
really aggressive price point but can
Cena has the s-pen you know if you're a
creative individual or your person that
likes to draw to make notes on the go I
think that it'll be is probably a device
that you like the performance is quite
good you can see our main man Joshua
Vergara there on the ground
yeah all across the line and what's the
ultimate test how quickly does it rotate
very quickly very very smooth so this is
the first hands-on look of the galaxy
note 8.0 from Samsung we're here live in
