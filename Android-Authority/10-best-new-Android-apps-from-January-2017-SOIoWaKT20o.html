Joe Mande the Android a30 app guide it's
about that time of month to round up the
best new Android apps that were released
in January if you want to check out any
of these apps for yourself you can find
those links in the video description
below a DW launch or two has been in
beta for a while but made its grand
reopening in January the new a DW has a
ton of features including a modern
design custom widget building theming
eye contact support and tons of
under-the-hood changes the modern design
reflects out of other modern browsers
such as the pixel launcher and nova
launcher
it also backs up these new features with
decent performance and low battery drain
you can download it for free or pay the
money for the pro version fast Kade
launcher is an interesting concept
it's a launcher application that
replaces your home screens with its own
unlike most it actually puts a keyboard
right on the main screen you can use
that keyboard to type in text to search
for contacts applications and other info
the idea is that you can access
applications and contacts quickly and
you can even make calls right from the
main interface it still needs some work
but it's a fun little concept and it's
also free most cash diary is an
application that tracks your mood the
way it works is that you make diary
entries over the course of your average
day the application will then track your
mood as time passes once it gets into
its groove it can tell you what your
pattern is for being happy or for being
upset it also comes with a slick
material design interface that's very
easy to use you get the basic features
of the application for free you can also
pay the $2.99 which will integrate your
social media accounts into the app so it
can gather more information
posture is an application that wants to
improve your posture it does this by
using your gyroscope and a screen
overlay when it detects that your phone
is in a position that is too stressful
for your neck it'll pop up a little icon
in the middle of the screen to remind
you to straighten up it also includes
various settings so you can control how
often the application checks to make
sure you're doing it right there are
also some seaming elements if you want
those it's fun to use and generally
unobtrusive and it's also totally free
screens is an application for people who
actually like split screen mode in
Android nougats the application allows
you to create a quick shortcut on your
home screen it opens two applications
into split screen mode you simply open
the app select the two applications that
you want give the
or cut a name and the created shortcut
will appear on your home screen and our
testing it worked well enough most of
the time for it to be really enjoyable
however there are some combinations of
apps that simply don't work well
together in any case the application is
completely free if you want to try it
squeezed is a financial application that
helps you manage your budget it uses a
friendly material design inspired
interface that allows you to move
quickly around the app once you sign in
you'll be able to see financial insights
and comparisons to your bills to help
you save money the application also
boasts 128-bit SSL encryption to help
make you feel more safe one of the
things you'll be asked to do is sign in
using your bank accounts and we totally
understand if that's not your thing
otherwise the app is completely free to
use stringify is a new competitor to
IFTTT you'll be able to create automated
actions with this application that your
Android device then performs
automatically a few examples include the
ability to share Fitbit goals to
Facebook open your garage door as you
pull up or even set the lights to a
certain way when it's bedtime as you may
have guessed by now the application is
compatible with a variety of smart
gadgets along with various apps it's
free to download but it is currently in
beta that means there are going to be
some bugs system panel 2 is the latest
system monitor app from next app it has
been entirely rebuilt from the ground up
and looks a lot different from its
predecessor it features material
designed the ability to monitor most
systems on your Android device and route
access for even more stats if you're
rooted every feature is available in the
free version and the pro version simply
removes advertising the only bad part is
that Android nougat is very strict on
what is running on your Android device
and this app can't fix that otherwise it
looks good and it works well to tastic
3d is a fun little Google application
that lets you create animations it comes
with a variety of characters and objects
that you can use to get started or you
can make your own if you're interested
along with creating the animations you
can also narrate them choose from three
story arcs to help you along and you can
export the videos and share them when
you're done it's not a professional
level application but it's still pretty
fun to use and it's also completely free
weather wiz is a newer weather app that
looks fantastic it features the basic
weather info including the current
temperature hourly forecasts a 10 day
forecast precipitation wind cloud cover
you bien
decks and dewpoint it also has one of
the coolest weather radars that we've
ever seen you can also track multiple
locations if you want to every feature
in the application is completely free to
use and you can buy additional themes as
optional in-app purchases and that about
does it for this one folks if you want
