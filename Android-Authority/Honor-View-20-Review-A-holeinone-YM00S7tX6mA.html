Android Authority and this is the honor
view 20 this is one of the first big
flagships of 2019 it's also one of the
first smartphones with a hole-punch
camera or hole-punch display whatever
you want to call it and I gotta say I
like it it's definitely a big
improvement over the knotch especially
notches that were as big as something
like the pixel 3 XL this takes up a lot
less space it's smaller it's less
intrusive and it takes away a lot less
of your screen now if you're curious
about how this whole punch effects apps
games or the general UI the short answer
is it really doesn't the hole punch does
shift things like your carrier signal
bars and Wi-Fi indicators more towards
the right but otherwise it does affect
much of anything most apps aren't really
affected by this whole punch at all
because most apps don't usually utilize
the top edge of the screen every once in
a while you will run into an app or game
that doesn't account for the whole punch
but it's a pretty rare occurrence so
most of your favorite apps are gonna be
perfectly fine when you're watching a
video there is obviously going to be a
little bit of content missing but that's
no different than what we had with
notches and this is definitely a lot
less distracting something that's kind
of interesting about the hole punch is
that honor still allows you to hide it
in the software as if it was a regular
notch so I guess if it bothers you that
much you can do that if you want but I
actually think you lose more space by
hiding it the screen itself is really
nice it's a six point four inch LCD and
not OLED but it's a really good-looking
LCD it's got very minimal bezels on all
sides and it's bright colorful and
pretty easy to see outdoors it's a
great-looking panel and I haven't had
any issues with it inside of that hole
punch is a pretty high resolution 25
megapixel front facing camera and its
really great for selfies if you're into
that sort of thing it captures good
detail and does a great job with
handling skin tones
it also has portrait mode porcha
lighting and beauty mode to enhance your
selfies or make
look a little more dramatic if you'd
like and these modes are also available
on the rear camera the rear camera is
Sony's latest 48 megapixel IMX sensor
and the view 20 is one of the first
smartphones to have it but we're
expecting to see this one on a bunch of
smartphones this year overall I've been
really impressed with the image quality
that this camera produces the photos are
sharp there's a ton of detail color
production is vibrant but still pretty
natural and even though I haven't been
able to use his camera in sunny
conditions because there's basically
been no Sun for the past week where I
live
dynamic range still seems pretty solid
it does have a I scene recognition which
is the same scene recognition that we've
seen in other recent honor and Huawei
phones and this will enhance your photos
based on the subject and overall scenery
where I appreciate the AI Scene
Recognition the most is in low-light or
nighttime photography the photos with AI
enabled are brighter with more detail
better color accuracy better dynamic
range and just an overall cleaner image
with less noise aside from the hole
punch and super-high resolution cameras
the rest of the phone is a pretty
standard smartphone experience it's
running Android Pi with the same magic
UI 2.0 software that we saw on the magic
2 and it's got the same powerful Kiran
980 chipset that we've seen in other
Huawei and honor' flagships like the ma
20 pro and it's paired with plenty of
RAM so performance is great even during
more intense things like gaming it also
has a new liquid cooling system inside
that utilizes AI to help with thermal
performance and as far as I can tell it
seems to be doing its job pretty well I
haven't ran into any issues with the
phone getting hot or noticeable loss in
performance if the phone gets warm while
I'm gaming or doing other intense tasks
battery life performance on the view xx
is also really good it's got a large
4000 milliamp hour battery and I'm
getting around 7 hours of screen on time
pretty easily which is definitely well
above average battery life and I'm
typically ending the day with around 50
percent battery life left so I'm
actually only charging this phone ever
the other day typically midway through
the following day and that's not
something you can say about a lot of
smart phones out there so that's pretty
impressive
now something that you might be
surprised to find on the view 20 is a
headphone jack which is pretty nice to
see for a high-end smartphone in 2019
and it even comes with an IR blaster if
you want to use your smartphone as a
remote the overall design of the view
Tony is nothing out of the ordinary it's
a metal and glass slab design that's
pretty similar to a lot of other phones
out there the one thing that makes the
view xx a little more unique is this
v-shaped pattern on the back glass I
personally don't mind it I think it
looks pretty good and I like that
manufacturers are continuing to
experiment with different colors and
patterns and gradients this view pattern
is pretty simplistic but it's different
enough to make a stand out from a bunch
of other smartphones and the way that
light reflects and bounces off of it
makes it look pretty awesome the view
Tony is one of the more affordable
flagship smartphones to hit the market
and because of its price point it's not
gonna have all the bells and whistles
that you might want in a smartphone it's
not officially water resistant and it
also doesn't have wireless charging so
if both of those features matter to you
or are deal-breakers you'll probably
want to spend a little bit of extra cash
and look elsewhere there are a ton of
great options out there that have both
of those features but if you're okay
with missing a couple of features and
still getting a high quality flagship
smartphone the view 20 is a really solid
choice and it also has that hole-punch
display if you want to hop on that trend
a little bit early but that's really it
