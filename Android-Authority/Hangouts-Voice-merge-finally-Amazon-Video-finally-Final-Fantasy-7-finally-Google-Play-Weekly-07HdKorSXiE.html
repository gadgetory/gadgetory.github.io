Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly in
this week's episode we're going to talk
about Google Hangouts final fantasy 7
amazon instant video and a whole bunch
of other stuff so let's go first up this
week is a new rumor that Microsoft may
be buying minecraft the wall street
journal reported that they had sources
that said that Microsoft wasn't talks to
by Mojang who is chiefly responsible for
Minecraft we're not entirely sure why
and we're not entirely sure it's true
because it is a rumor and you know grain
of salt the price is reportedly two
billion dollars and mojang has had
success with Microsoft in the past with
its Xbox version of Minecraft which is
reportedly responsible for about
one-third of all of its revenue if
anything happens we'll tell you about it
a new app study was posted late last
week by app Annie that shows that
handheld gaming may be circling the
drain and it may be mobile gaming's
fault it's not happy news because I love
my PSP but the numbers don't lie mobile
gaming has increased dramatically over
the last year while handhelds are down
about twenty five percent we know
correlation does not equal causation but
we're definitely sure that mobile gaming
is at least partially responsible
because people carry their phones around
way more often than their handhelds it's
not good news but it's news next up
Square Enix has announced that final
fantasy 7 and final fantasy 13 is coming
to Android kind of it won't be in game
format but rather in streaming format
Square Enix is going to let people rent
games for a nominal fee and then they're
free to play them using streaming it's
not overly expensive and hey at least
these games are actually going to be
playable on Android but there are some
bad things it's only going to be
available in Japan for a while and
you'll of course need an internet
connection after months of speculation
and rumors the Amazon Instant Video
application is finally available for
Android the only really bad part is you
have to use the Amazon Appstore in order
to get it some may argue that another
negative aspect is that it doesn't come
with chromecast support streaming which
only really matters if you own a
chromecast I'm personally just happy
that this is a thing that happened and
i'm sure the app will be updated and
improved over time to include the things
that doesn't have right now last up this
week is some good news google hangouts
and google voice have finally been
merged into one
the news will no doubt bring joy and
happiness to pretty much everybody along
with the integration comes a gigantic
new feature which allows people to call
each other for free over hangouts so if
you've been hesitating on getting
hangouts there's no real reason not to
get it anymore if you want to try it out
to head to the written companion in the
video description below and we'll have a
link there to download the new apk so
wants to see some trending applications
as usual if you want to check any of
these applications out you can find the
links in the written companion which is
in the video description below clearly
the first trending app this week is the
hangouts dialer in order to make phone
calls on google hangouts you'll also
need this nifty little application it's
pretty much just a dialer application
that's connected to your google hangouts
accounts it looks really nice it's
totally free and if you use google
hangouts you should also have this
application next up is month the
calendar widget this application is a
calendar widget and a bare-bones
calendar application that includes an
incredible 70 themes across two widgets
they sell theme packs like SwiftKey does
so it's a system many people are already
familiar with it's a good-looking widget
and there are a lot of themes to match a
lot of styles it's free to try so why
not right Angry Birds Stella was
released this last week and pure a fan
of plastic Angry Birds this is going to
make you happy it's clearly aimed at a
more feminine demographic which isn't a
bad thing at all and was actually kind
of enjoyable to play but again only if
you actually like Angry Birds it's free
to play in that cute little pink bird is
pretty awesome the score has updated
their application for the upcoming
football season it now includes scoring
play visuals player comparison data
movement visualizations and situational
team splits along with some performance
improvements small tweaks and bug fixes
if you're looking for your next sports
app to make it through the season this
is a really good one to try last up this
week is the official Expedia app it has
undergone a huge you i change that puts
it more in line with the android design
standard it also includes some new
features and a limited time offer that
gives you twenty five dollars off your
first hotel booking up one hundred
dollars or more it looks way nicer than
it used to and if you're planning a trip
