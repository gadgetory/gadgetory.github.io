handy from Android Authority Google went
about releasing Android nougat a
different way than years past regardless
of how you feel about it the official
release is out now which means it's time
for us to take a closer look this is an
overview of android nougat
if you've been following the developer
previews then most of this isn't going
to be new to you the interface is
essentially the same as the final
developer preview and for those who
haven't seen this yet not all that
different from Android marshmallow the
home screens still function the same way
with the app drawer still present Google
now to the left of the home screens and
the notifications and settings in their
typical places there are some new
features hanging around the main
interface which we'll discuss here
momentarily but in terms of navigation
it's pretty much the same as marshmallow
some of the elements remained pretty
much the same and those include the
Google now page left of the main home
screen and the app drawer both of these
elements haven't changed at all the
quick settings have been revamped since
marshmallow but again there isn't much
here that's new from the previous
developer previews for those who don't
know there is now a little set of
toggles when you first launch the
notifications they can give you even
quicker access to some settings this
then expands to the usual quick settings
menu when you flip it down again in the
quick settings you can edit the layout
to make it whatever you want it to be
any edits you make on the regular quick
settings are also reflected in the quick
toggles so you can customize both at the
same time the quick settings are also
now paginating so you can have multiple
pages of quick settings if you want this
is useful because app developers will
eventually be able to add their own
toggles and you don't have to leave any
behind if you don't want to aside from
that the settings shortcut is still in
its usual place and you can tap the face
icon to change users long pressing the
settings shortcut unlocks the system UI
tuner and long pressing the individual
toggles will launch the settings menu
for that particular setting while we're
in the vicinity let's check out the
notifications they've received a
permanent visual revamp that makes them
visually flattered
this creates a wall of notifications
that takes a few days to get used to but
they're actually very enjoyable once you
do the big features here are that the
notifications are bundled so they don't
take up
much space you can unbundle them by
clicking the top half of the
notification you can also quick reply
straight from the notification panel
without opening the application do note
that not all apps can do this yet but
most of the popular ones should aside
from that you can have swipe the
notification one way or the other to
access the notification settings for
that application so you can deal with
those more quickly the recent apps
screen received a bit of an overhaul as
well the application cards are now
larger and easier to read although the
change won't improve your experience all
that much you can swipe away apps to
close them as usual and Google has
finally placed a clear all button at the
top right hand corner along with that
you'll be able to quickly switch back
and forth between two applications by
double tapping the recent apps button
you don't have to be in the recent apps
screen in order to use this feature but
it will pop you there for a second when
you do do note that it will only use the
most recent application and the second
most recent application for this feature
and it should also work in multi window
mode speaking of multi window it's now
an official feature you'll be able to
access it two ways the first is opening
the application you want on the top
panel then you long press the recent
apps button and it will launch multi
window and then you can choose the
second app the other way is to go to the
recent apps screen long press the top
border of an application card and then
drag it to the top of the screen once in
split-screen mode you can press the home
button and navigate to your phone
normally however the next application
you open will be the bottom app in
split-screen mode once you're in there
the top application is locked in but you
can change the bottom one if you want to
there is a slider in the middle that you
can move to give one application more
space you can also slide this slider all
the way up or down to exit multi window
mode quickly if you prefer the only
other way to exit split-screen mode is
to long press the recent apps button
there were a ton of new things going on
in the settings menu and will start with
the visual tweaks when you enter the
settings you'll be able to access a
slide-out menu that lets you quickly
jump to any other page in the settings
this is great if you're hopping around
multiple settings pages at once at the
top of the main page of the settings
menu there is now a suggestion section
that will prompt you to set up parts of
your device that you may not have
otherwise have known about
you can follow the suggestions or
dismiss them as you see fit it's worth
noting that if you have alarm only mode
enabled that will also show up at the
top of the settings where you can
dismiss it if you want there are also a
variety of changes inside of the
settings so let's dive right in the
first one is under data usage you can
now activate a new data saver feature
that essentially prevents everything
from using a data connection unless
you're using the app directly handle
with caution because it will prevent
your emails from coming in under display
there is now an option to scale your
display up or down in other words that
let you make stuff bigger or smaller
this little accessibility feature is
great for customization or if your
eyesight is even worse than mine the
settings for apps also got a small
addition at the bottom of any given
application settings page you can see if
the app was installed through the Play
Store or if it was side loaded you can't
do anything else with it but that info
is there just in case you need it under
storage if you go to the Explorer option
the built-in file browser received a
slight visual overhaul you'll now see
little cards instead of a giant list
like you did on marshmallow you'll also
get a fully functional slide-out menu
with additional browsing options under
the user section you can add emergency
information such as your name allergies
blood type emergency contacts and more
you can access this by clicking the word
emergency on your lock screen and then
you'll have to click it again at the top
of the lock screen and then you'll be
able to see all of the information under
the developer options you'll notice that
webview is no longer an option under
webview implementation it's now only
Chrome and that's good because now
webview is where it belongs in a
graveyard also under the developer
options are two options to force
applications to be moveable to the
external SD card and be forced into
multi window even if they're not
supposed to
I really wouldn't mess with these but
they are there finally that brings us to
the under the hood changes there were a
freaking ton of them so we'll just
mention them briefly the most noticeable
is that Android nougat now uses Unicode
9 emoji which contains 72 new emoji they
have also been redesigned with a more
consistent look and feel to them it's
been noted by many smart people that
gender and color could still use some
work but that should come in future
updates Android nougat now comes with
support for Vulcan API as well as Java 8
the Vulcan API has been heralded for a
year now as being the future for mobile
games so this is very good news the
Android runtime has been modified so
that it uses both ahead of time and just
in time compiling this results in faster
boot times especially after updates and
faster app installs from the Google Play
Store there is a new lighter doze mode
that is kind of like doze mode junior it
still lets notifications through but
many background tasks will be designated
to a maintenance window where they can
do their normal things this doesn't
affect regular doze mode which is still
present there is now a seamless update
feature baked in that you'll never have
to see this essentially allows for the
operating system to be updated without
you having to sit through an
installation screen it does this by
maintaining two system partitions that
switch back and forth as they get
updated no current phones can make use
of this but future nougat phones will
there have been numerous changes in
optimizations and nougats to prepare for
daydream which is Google's VR platform
this includes optimizations to the
software that control sensors and
graphics as a side effect the old
daydream section in the settings is now
called screen saver we'll learn more
about all of that stuff later this year
the security encryption in nougat has
been revamped from a full disk
encryption to a file based encryption
long story short it's easier for the end
user and still provides tons of added
security for the phone and it will be
able to boot without requiring a pin
those are the big ones but there are a
ton of smaller tweaks like the revamped
media server and the new permission that
lets apps ask for permission for only
one folder on your internal storage
these are too numerous to list here
because we'd be here all day it was also
announced shortly after release that
nougat will be receiving regularly
scheduled updates which is likely to fix
bugs combat security threats add new
features and keep everything running
smoothly it is worth noting that many
things such as dark mode and the RGB
tint mode did not make it into the final
build of nougat there is an invert
colors mode as well as a couple of other
developer oriented toggles that are
completely useless to us average folks
so it's best to ignore them for now okay
that about wraps it up for this one it
was meant to be a
quick overview but when it's an entire
operating system updates even a quick
overview can take eternity what we have
here is a continued maturation of
Android as an operating system it's true
that we didn't get a new design but
material design is pretty awesome anyway
and I don't blame Google for not wanting
to leave that one behind just yet
the majority of changes are things you
won't notice or aren't readily available
yet especially things like Vulkan API
which can take some time to proliferate
in terms of performance the Nexus 5x had
no trouble running this whatsoever
it's definitely daily drivers safe we
are going to dive into Android new get
in depth over the coming days and weeks
so make sure you keep it tuned to
Android authority comm and our YouTube
channel in order to see all of that and
that about does it for this one folks if
you want to keep watching we have my
original developer preview quick look
video linked up there on the screen and
in the video description below if you
want to check that out like I said we
have more nougat goodness plans so keep
it tuned to Android authority because we
