everyone is going crazy over an
announcements that Motorola made here at
Lenovo tech world a new phone in the
Moto line that makes modularity a snap
it's Josh Picard from Android or D
what's going on buddy and this is e and
here it is the Moto Z newly announced at
Lenovo tech world the Moto Z is a new
take on the Moto line going a step
further of course than the Moto X it
brings modularity and brings it in a
snap those connectors on the back and
bottom portion of the phone are able to
take in with strong magnets a number of
different covers but also a number of
different new functions based upon the
different peripherals that you put on to
them but first let's talk about the
actual phone itself 5.5 inches in the
screen comes with a AMOLED quad HD
display and it makes for a rather large
device but not really anything too out
of the ordinary when compared to other
phablets of its size it is a very thin
device especially the mode of Z not the
Moto G force which has a little bit more
girth to it and a bit of a chamfered
edge on the sides underneath the surface
you can pretty much expect all of the
same from a flagship device of
Snapdragon 820 and four gigabytes of RAM
along with pretty much all of the
different connections that you would
expect including NFC for stuff like
Android pay overall it's a very nice
feeling device it might be a little bit
big for some people at 5.5 inches for
the screen but it does feel very premium
and the regular moto Z that I have in my
hand right now actually feels quite
light the Moto Z fours as you're seeing
in the shop right now is a little bit
beefier a little bit heavier and it has
that shatterproof screen so you can drop
the phone and you're not going to have
to worry about the screen ever
shattering overall though the look is
quite nice but the camera hub on the
back does stick out quite a bit now the
small things about a phone tend to
really excite me and then camera hump
even though it does protrude out quite a
bit is covered up by the different moto
mod covers it actually makes the camera
very flush with the body and it's a nice
little addition to have on
an incentive that you can have to have
an actual cover for the phone to
customize it the way that you want to be
among other things the although z-force
has a few different specifications when
compared to the original brothers II
first of all its battery is larger at
3400 milliamp hours compared to 26
hundred million dollars and then you can
also get the fast charging the faster
between the two where you can get half
of the battery in 15 to 20 minutes after
that the camera is 21 megapixels instead
of 30 mo compared to it and of course
the Moto G Force has the shadow proof
screen so even if you are able to drop
it should still be fine as we've already
mentioned the Moto Z and the Moto G
Force have different cameras the
interface is pretty intuitive and pretty
simple to use but the actual cameras
themselves will be 13 megapixels for the
Moto Z + 21 megapixels from the Moto Z
force we weren't able to take any
samples from the cameras that we were
using so we will just have to wait until
we get our hands on for review units to
bring you our review of the cameras of
these two phones now the Moto Z is a
very thin device and it's very lovely to
hold in the hand is also quite light the
modal force motors the force rather is
of course going to be a little bit deep
here and a little bit thicker and
heavier but one omission that you're
probably noticing as I rotate this
device around in my hands is the lack of
a headphone jack no there's not going to
be a headphone jack on the Moto C or the
motors of course instead it will come
with an adapter that goes into the USB C
port and that is how you're going to
have a 3.5 millimeter
for this phone now the software on the
Moto C and the Moto G force is really
familiar it's very similar to a stock
version of Android complete with the
vertical Abbe drawer different quick
settings menus and of course the
settings around here with the recent
apps cooler right here everything is
pretty much what you would expect it to
be and of course we still have the
different dots on the top and bottom of
the front of the device made for the
active display the active display is
still here stole a very nice feature to
have on these phones makes it easy to
look at what's going on on the phone
without having to actually turn it on
but of course the main story with the
Moto Z and the Moto Z Force is
modularity this is a arguably easier way
of getting modularity on a device as you
don't have to pull the battery out or
even turn off and turn on the phone
again you just have to snap on the
peripheral to the back of the device and
you're good to go there are a number of
different covers that moto maker will
provide so you can change the look of
the phone whenever you want to and it
actually feels like this film because of
how thin it is it needs to have these
covers to sort of round out or even
complete the look and feel of this phone
there are a few different peripherals
that are available including battery
cases and incipio has already made a few
extra battery cases that snap right onto
the back and provide even more power to
make sure that the battery life goes as
long as you need it to there's a pico
projector which goes on to the back and
does make the phone quite thick but it
does have a pico projector inside that
can be angled onto the wall or onto the
ceiling so you can easily provide
presentations or just watch anything
that you want on this bigger screen and
finally there is a JBL speaker that goes
around the back of the device actually
adds a lot of growth to it but it does
have a 10 hour battery inside and
provide some really great sound that you
can hear in the following clip
overall we're pretty impressive when we
see in the Moto Z darn few trade-offs
like what the headphone jack and the
fact that there are two different
versions both of which have different
features - really both but overall both
of the phones bring modularity to a
different level and they also make them
a snap you still get the ability to
style the phone whichever way you want
and it's a pretty nice way of just
changing the look without having to go
through the model maker again and
getting a whole new phone
overall the modularity is a wonderful
idea that might actually be executed
properly because it's very easy to just
snap on and snap off different functions
onto the device and moto thinks that
it's going to be a very innovative step
forward for smartphones and so there you
have it for this hands-on with the moto
Z and the Moto Z force these two phones
are very exciting and even though there
are some trade-offs with some of the
features and the fact that you get the
Moto mods to add even more functions to
the device it looks like the trade-offs
will even everything out and this could
be a very worthwhile device to have
later in the summer and later on in the
fall when unlocked versions come out so
keep it tuned to Android authority for
even more on this new Moto line of
phones and make sure you stay tuned for
our camera reviews and also comparisons
that we make between this and other
devices in the flagship market this year
