Authority what's going on everybody here
we are with the other of the two Nexus
announcements here at the Google event
in San Francisco the Nexus 5x in a
partnership with LG we are seeing an
update to the Nexus 5 from a couple
years ago and you know what talking
about the design and the feel right here
it actually feels really familiar the
Nexus 5 had that very plastic key that
sort of soft plastic feel on the back
and that's exactly what we feels like
here as well it also has a very similar
lightness to it but of course the Nexus
5x is bringing some new additions to the
ecosystem Google is updating everything
to Android marshmallow version 6.0 and
those features include certain things
like the Nexus imprint which includes
this fingerprint reader on the back that
will be able to turn on the device with
just a simple press of under 600
milliseconds in terms of how long it
takes for it to register the fingerprint
wake the device and unlock it but we're
not going to be putting a fingerprint on
there just yet they do have these codes
on here so Android M of course want to
unlock the device but what we have here
is a full HD 5.2 inch display which
feels really nice in terms of size and I
already told you that the design is
already getting some pretty high marks
from us here because we do enjoy this
particular feel it might not necessarily
be the flashiest of materials but it
still is very functional and very easy
very accessible is probably the word
that's best used to describe this
underneath the surface of that full HD
display is a Snapdragon 808 with 2
gigabytes of RAM which might be a little
bit paltry compared to all the other
heavy needs that the other devices have
3 gigabytes might have been better but
that's what you get in the Nexus 6p now
on the front here we have a single front
firing speakers here not the dual
front-facing speakers that are found on
the Nexus 6p and if you look on the
sides it does really have that design
from the Nexus 5 with this little panel
that could be that that separates the
front and the back the volume rockers
below the power button over here and
heading over to the back I already
mentioned
fingerprint sensors here but the Nexus
logo is in landscape which was always
something that we loved about these
devices the camera package is actually
very similar to that of the Nexus 6p not
only are we going to get 13 almost 13
megapixels I should say but it will also
provide a updated application that
provides a number of different functions
not the least of which is new HD 4k
capabilities now I'm over in the video
portion right now and go back to photo
you'll be able to see that HDR plus is
right here and is easily changeable
using this one toggle right here we are
going to get our hands on these units
soon enough so we can show you really if
the camera quality is up to snuff so
we're really looking forward to that
we're taking a look at Android
marshmallow the updated version of
Android OS now you also see here that it
is a vertical scroll in the app drawer
which is a little bit different but it
does allow you to have your four most
frequented applications here on the top
which is pretty nice recent apps screen
is pretty similar but as I go to the
recent apps screen we do have a couple
pages here well be able to show you now
on tab which is a brand new feature you
probably saw at Google i/o earlier on
but stock and standard here in Android
marshmallow hold the home button and
it'll sense from the screen various
portions that are searchable in Google I
know you saw there at the website had
something about Marty Friedman and there
it is it showed it very easily just a
lot of different terms that are probably
very obviously searched in Google are
going to be pulled by now on tap of
course the other addition we have here
is a USB type-c port on the bottom that
will provide fast charging which is
always a very good addition but the
battery under need for a 5.2 inch full
HD display it's actually pretty good
with a twenty seven hundred million
power unit underneath this phone will
probably last about as long as we really
wanted to and with additional battery
saving features including the doze
feature then we should be able to get
maybe even more than a day and a half
worth of battery life on here but we're
going to of course test that when we get
our full
units as far as availability goes the
Nexus 5x will be available in the Google
store starting from 379 for the 16
gigabyte model which is the base model
compared to the 349 from last model of
the Nexus 5 that makes a little bit of
sense a little bit higher price but you
get some extra features as well so you
can stay tuned to Android authority for
that and even more from us here at the
San Francisco event as we're taking a
look at the two new Nexus devices and
the other announcement that they made
here keep it tuned to Android or our for
reviews and comparisons of these phones
to the rest in the Android ecosystem
today because we are your source for all
things Android i've already</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
