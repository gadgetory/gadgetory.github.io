straight from five to seven in the line
of Samsung Galaxy Note devices so we're
going to take a look at what is
different between the two while
revisiting the Galaxy Note 5 as a phone
that may be you might still want to buy
it's Josh of a guard from Android
authority what's going on everybody and
this is the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 versus
the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 now we're
treating this video still as a vs. but
also as a way for us to look at the
Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and revisit it as
a phone that you might want to buy if
you don't want to spend all the money on
the brand-new version of the Galaxy Note
and with that in mind there was one
thing that was very clear about the
Galaxy Note 5 it's that this was going
to be the design language that Samsung
was going to use moving forward and that
is of course dual glass panels with a
metal frame and even though some people
were bummed out by the fact that the
note 5 took a cue from the galaxy s6
there was one thing that softened the
blow that curved on the back even with
the curve though this is still a pretty
large device to handle and in one hand
it might be a little bit tough to use
side to side and top to bottom but now
we have the samsung galaxy note 7 that
not only had the curve on the back but
also added it to the front yes the
design language of the galaxy note line
and with galaxies in general probably
are going to have the curved edge
display available now across the board
the result however is a phone that is
symmetrical and for all intents and
purposes quite beautiful actually and
having the curve on both the back and
the front meant that the sides felt less
sharp and it actually helped with
handling as the phone sits just
beautifully in the hand and you are able
to get left to right a lot easier than
before even if top to bottom is still
kind of tough in one hand one aspect
that was really publicized about the
Galaxy Note 5 was the s-pen and it's a
new s-pen with a clicky top that was
able to go backwards into its slot far
enough to actually break it thankfully
with the galaxy note 7 that has been
addressed as the pen does not go farther
than that clicky top so you won't have
any chances to even break it the
displays are for the most part the same
you get 5.7 inches in the size and quad
HD in the resolution
and of course both of these are Super
AMOLED displays so you get the higher
saturation that can be toned down in the
settings but the note 7 does add a
couple of new things along with that
curve and one of them is the edge UX the
edge UX comes back from the galaxy s7
edge and if you are an avid fan of it
because of its easy way of adding
another place to get shortcuts and some
extra information then that obviously
puts the note 7 up top but there's also
the always-on display which is an easy
way of always having time a calendar or
a little bit of information available at
all times even when the phone is on
standby there is a pretty significant
shift in the performance aspect because
the exceed o 7420 of the galaxy note 5
was what they used across the board
samsung really stuck to its guns when it
came to their own processing packages
and I did use the note 5 quite a bit in
New York around the time of the
announcement of the galaxy note 7 and it
did a good job playing games like
Pokemon go and Final Fantasy without any
issues but with the Samsung Galaxy Note
7 the exceed knows is a processor that's
only available in certain markets for
most places you're going to get the
Snapdragon 820 which is still a powerful
processor and it's basically the one
that you would want to have in a
flagship today one place of the galaxy
note 7 may have stumbled a bit is in its
RAM capacity now four gigabytes of RAM
is the standard it is the de-facto
amount but having a little bit more
could have put the note 7 over the top
in terms of power user features
especially when you consider all that
this phone can do and the s-pen there
might have been a little bit more need
for extra RAM just to keep the phone
smooth and snappy all the time the note
5 is obviously going to falter when it
comes to hardware and that is very
apparent now with a lot of phones that
have plenty of power of user features
now one of those is expandable storage
but on top of that the Galaxy Note 5
comes in at a base 32 gigabytes of
on-board storage and that's simply not
the case for the note 7 which is always
64 gigabytes with its micro sd card
slots when it comes to battery life
you'll get a pretty standard experience
either way with the note 5 still able to
perform very well for a full day and
then you can use fast charging or to get
a quick charge on-the-go that it can
still be said for the note 7 which has
an updated version of fast charge that
is even faster than before so with
either of these phones the battery
shouldn't be that bad and with the note
5 I was still able to get a full day
without any issues even after all of the
absent all of the wear and tear that I
put on to this boat and there's
definitely a wow factor when it comes to
using the iris scanner but I will admit
that after using the note 7 for quite a
while the fingerprint reader is still my
go-to way of unlocking the device in a
quick way so let's check in real quick
the note 5 was still a very good daily
driver when I was using it leading up to
the launch of the note 7 and until the
note 7 came out and I used it as my
daily driver since the note 5 didn't
have many holes when it came to his
experience it's only when the note 7
showed us what we could have that the
note 5 started to feel like a
second-rate phone in comparison but
still for anybody out there that needs
basically the essentials 32 gigabytes
without expandable storage a processor
that still works really well even if
it's somewhat dated and a design
language that might still be a little
bit uncomfortable for some like myself
the note 5 is still so far a very good
companion but then I had a good time
using it as a my daily camera in New
York now it doesn't come as any surprise
that Samsung has been good at their
pictures and their videos no matter
which of their phones you get but with
the Galaxy Note 5 I found myself taking
a lot of shots in New York and leaving
my DSLR back at home so with that in
mind the pictures between the note 5 and
note 7 are actually not too far off in
quality structurally speaking the lower
aperture of the note 7 means slightly
better bokeh and slightly better
low-light performance but for the most
part you'll be able to get the same type
of performance between these two if
you're in good lighting situations and
speaking of low-light the note 7 does
take a cue from the galaxy s7 with 12
larger dual pixel megapixels on top of
its lower aperture not to mention the
fact that those dual pixels provide even
faster autofocus and that's something
that I really enjoy using especially
during videography so the note 5 still
proved to be a good companion to have as
a camera on the daily I still enjoyed
all of the pictures I got from here and
I did post a lot of them on Instagram
and I even use some of the video footage
on a vlog but another thing that I loved
about the note 7 is that its
front-facing camera can record videos in
2k resolution which is
perfect for vlogging and finally in
software the note 5 never really was a
slouch when it came to its version of
TouchWiz but now with the note 7 they
don't even really call it TouchWiz
anymore because they've really
streamlined the interface the note 5 was
still a very functional operating system
you're able to get to pretty much every
part of the operating system without any
troubles and with all the different
features you could use that are kind of
out of the way so that there aren't so
many dialog boxes just in your face
trying to make you use all of those
features using this phone as a simple
daily driver
TouchWiz didn't do a bad job at all the
main thing about the s-pen in the note 5
was that I could use it for screen off
memo all of that carries over in the
note 7 but in the note 7 Samsung
actually put a couple of new features
that might actually prove useful for a
lot of users one of the main ones is a
Gift Creator now the gift creator could
be really fun to use and you can send
fun gifts to everybody on the other hand
screen off memo can be pinned to the
always-on display so that actually
proved to be a little bit more useful
than before and all of that results in a
software package in the note 7 that
feels incredibly stacked there's still
so many capabilities in this version of
Samsung's operating system and it has
been streamlined to look a little bit
easier on the eyes but from there
there's so much to do in the note 7 that
it might feel overwhelming at times the
same went for the note 5 but this time
around it's almost as if Samsung put a
little bit more thought into what
features users might actually use rather
than all the ones that they might not
but of course that's only part of the
equation and those little steps forward
in the software actually permeate across
the entire device where the note 7
actually feels like a power user found
again that was not the case with the
Galaxy Note 5 and for somebody like me
that used it primarily as just a daily
driver to get typical tasks done the
note 5 was a wonderful device and if you
are that kind of user it's still a great
value for the money especially since its
price will go down now that the note 7
is out but if you're a big power user
that needs the expandable storage more
onboard storage and also all of the
capabilities that the s-pen will now
provide then of course the note 7 will
be the phone that you're looking for if
you've been holding on to an even older
phone and you need to save a little bit
of money the good news here is that the
trade-offs between 5 &amp;amp; 7 despite
skipping 6 they are significant but
ultimately not do
breaking as always thank you guys very
much for watching and hope you enjoyed
this versus between the Galaxy Note 7
and the galaxy note 5 we wanted to
revisit the galaxy note 5 simply because
we do think that it's still a good value
for the money and since I used it as my
daily driver leading up to the note 7 I
did come down to one conclusion the note
7 did enough to feel fresh and move
forward from the note 5 but if it was
not announced at that time and if it
didn't even come out I would still
probably have a good time with the note
5 you can take that for what you will
and decide if the note 5 might be a
better value for the money that you're
looking to spend keep it tuned to
