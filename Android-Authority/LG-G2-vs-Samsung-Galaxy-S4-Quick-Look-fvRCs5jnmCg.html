Authority what's going on everybody and
here is your quick look at the LG g2 and
the Samsung Galaxy s4 now if you haven't
seen our full review of LG's newest
flagship phone please make sure to do so
here we are taking a look at it and
Samsung's flagship one of the first
things that you notice about the g2 is
it's updated button layout instead of
putting the power button and the volume
rocker on the sides they have been
relocated to the back to be pressed by
your index finger this is different from
the classical layout of the s4 but it is
a lot easier to get used to than you
might think it doesn't take very long
for it to feel natural Samsung's tactile
home button up front has no LG
counterpart as the g2 uses software keys
material-wise were looking at very
similar phones here both employ the
glossy plastic that can feel a little
bit slippery to the touch in the hands
however they do feel equally as light
the s4 was initially surprisingly light
for such a packed phone and the g2 echos
this you can really throw either phone
around with no problems then your bezels
on the g2 do mean that the screen on it
is a tad bigger but otherwise the screen
handling experience is very similar in
either device speaking of the screens
the g2 has point two inches on the s4
giving it a little more real estate to
work with it is in this case a battle of
the g2 s I P s screen that lends itself
to high brightness while the Super
AMOLED of the s4 is well known for its
high saturation the s4 does pack a
little more pixel density at 441 PPI as
opposed to the 424 on the g2 but
honestly side by side we see equally
very high quality in either screen both
are capable of great viewing angles and
the colors of the g2 s IP S screen
actually rival the colors of the Super
AMOLED so there's no doubt that either
screen will bring you a fine experience
when you look under the hood the g2 gets
a bit of the advantage with the
Snapdragon 800 the higher performing
counterpart to the Snapdragon 600 that
is found in the s4 it also gets the
updated Adreno 330 instead of the
tried-and-true 320 without a doubt there
is real speed between these two phones
as going through their elements and
multitasking are easy and incredibly
smooth but then the g2 sports a
non-removable 3000 milliamp hour battery
as opposed to the 2600 milliamp hour
removable unit of the s4 and though the
g2 sports more onboard storage at a base
32 gigabytes
that's the
standard while the 16 32 and 64
gigabytes available in various versions
of the s4 is expandable it is in the
camera that the g2 is a bit of a pioneer
packing optical image stabilization
which will be a hot item to have in the
coming year LG does keep up pretty well
as Samsung's camera additions but
doesn't quite pack as many different
modes of course in the s4 there are a
lot of creative modes to enhance your
smartphone photography however with the
OIS and the g2 not only will videos
benefit from the stabilization but a
better ability to flood in light for
darkness situations can give it we yet
another edge and to round this out we'll
turn these bad boys on and look at the
software in the s4 we were given new
ways of navigating various situations in
the UI and LG wanted to add in a few of
their own while the g2 packs some of the
same features like smart stay and smart
pause on top of all of the cue features
that LG veterans may already be familiar
with it added in a few new ones ones
we'll mention here are the knock knock
feature which allows you to wake or
sleep the phone by tapping twice on the
screen and the slide aside which puts
aside the current app with a
three-finger swipe the s4 is by now well
known editions of hand gestures and
floating finger air views give it its
own unique flavor in TouchWiz compared
to LG's Optimus UI ultimately it's all a
personal matter if any or some or even
none of these additions prove practical
or useful for you and so there you have
it a nice quick look at the LG g2 and
the Samsung Galaxy s4 it's pretty
obvious who LG is targeting here and
even though there are quite a few
similarities between these phones there
are also plenty of differences that do
well to separate these two flagships
we'll have more on the G tune soon so
stay tuned to andrew authority for all
of the upcoming action</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
