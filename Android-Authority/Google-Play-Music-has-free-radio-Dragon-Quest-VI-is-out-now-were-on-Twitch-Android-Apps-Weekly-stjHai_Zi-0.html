show is brought to you by hex lock hello
again ladies and gentlemen I'm Joe Hindy
the android 30 appt guy and welcome back
to another episode of android apps
weekly we got headlines we got news
let's talk about it first up this week
we'd like to announce that android
authority is now on twitch we've decided
to check out the platform so we could
bring you even more mobile gaming fun so
go subscribe and keep an eye out for our
next live stream we play games we
chatted up and we'd like to have some
fun a potential upcoming android game
called kill the plumber will let you
actually kill mario once and for all the
game is a parody of the popular Mario
series except you play as the bad guys
as you attempt to keep Mario from
winning the interesting thing here is
the Apple App Store turn this app down
so we'll see how it fares on Android
Facebook has announced a new algorithm
for their photos that will be able to
identify you in pictures even if you're
not facing the camera this unique and
slightly frightening algorithm is
expected to roll out to the services
very soon and it boasts a really good
eighty-three percent success rate and
identifying people a new commercial for
Google Translate has unveiled that the
application translates over 100 billion
words every single day the idea behind
the commercial was to show how it's
changed how we communicate and what are
the most translated phrases they are how
are you thank you and I love you in our
last major headline this week google has
announced that Google Play Music will
now have free ad-supported radio this
means you can enjoy the various
playlists and radio stations without
buying an all-access pass as long as you
don't mind a few advertisements much
like Spotify and Pandora right now it's
for the u.s. only but we do expect
expansion eventually for even more
Android apps and games news don't forget
to subscribe to our newsletter in the
video description below where we'll have
all the stories from the last week even
the ones we didn't have time for in this
video if you're so inclined you can also
sign up with your email address and will
beam this information directly to your
inbox every single Friday all right
folks it's time for that part of the
show where we talk about the apps and
games that made a big splash this week
as usual if you want to check any of
these applications out you can find the
links in the video description below
microsoft released individual word excel
and powerpoint applications to tablets
earlier this year to massive success
after a few months of rumors those three
applications are now finally available
for android phones as well as android
it's the tablet versions are already
known to be fairly high quality and
powerful productivity apps and we've no
doubt that the phone versions will be
the same way do beware that you will
need a Microsoft account in order to use
all of the features to their fullest the
game on project is an interesting game
discovery application that aims to help
you find mobile games that are to your
liking the way it works is you sign in
answer some questions and then you tell
it what games you've heard of and know
about it will then recommend games to
you based on your decisions some of the
questions could be potentially awkward
but the developers swear that they do
matter it's worth a look if you're
looking for some games dawn of the
sniper is a new freemium game where you
play as a sniper and you go on missions
to do what snipers do best which is
shoot people the game includes easy to
learn mechanics plenty of levels and a
variety of weapons achievements and more
the in-app purchases for this game
aren't too bad one of them is to remove
advertisements and you can beat the game
without purchasing anything really it's
a fun little time waster and it's worth
a shot get it a shot Square Enix has
released Dragon Quest 6 on Android this
is the final chapter of the zenith Ian
trilogy and you can find the other two
parts on the google play store as well
it's a little steeply priced at 1499 but
there are no in-app purchases the game
has also played in portrait mode like
most of the other Dragon Quest games the
graphics are a bit retro but this game
was originally released in the mid-90s
and so that's to be expected if you like
JRPGs this is a great option last up is
siege fall by gameloft this game caught
our attention at e3 for its decent
graphics and simple premise it's much
like games such as clash of clans or
boom beach except with better graphics
and a longer story line there are some
release date bugs and some may not like
the in-app purchase strategies but this
is one of the more decent freemium games
to be released this year it's worth a
shot if you like strategy games and you
don't mind in-app purchases thanks again
for watching the show everybody but
let's get down to some serious business
hecks lock is a security application
that's aimed to help you protect your
applications the way it works is you
choose a profile and then you select
which applications are locked down on
that profile from there every time
someone tries to enter those
applications they'll have to enter a
password before the application can be
opened you can't select virtually any
application installed on your device
which means you can keep friends out of
your video games
keep kids out of your work email and it
works really well for keeping Jays Broda
out of your browser so we stopped
downloading pictures of durian fruit to
your gallery it's free to use and the
only in-app purchase is to remove ads
we'd like to thank hex lock for their
supports of the android apps weekly show
