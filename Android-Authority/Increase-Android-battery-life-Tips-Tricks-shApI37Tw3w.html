day busy with work making calls replying
to SMS shooting emails fighting info on
the web and suddenly you run out of
juice Android devices are smart mini
computers but there's a price for that
for one they need more battery power
than none smartphones how do you make
your battery last longer so you can use
your device longer hi I'm mark welcome
to Android Authority in this video learn
several useful tips and tricks to
squeeze more juice out of your Android
devices battery the first tip is a
common-sense one turning off features
that aren't in use particularly features
that can little down your battery level
fast which features are these for
starters there's Bluetooth Wi-Fi
portable Wi-Fi hotspot' GPS mobile data
and NFC leaving them on will eat a chunk
of your battery power so kill them when
not in use if you use these features
frequently it can be a big pain in the
behind to keep turning these features on
or off during the day to keep your
sanity you can use the power control
widget to quickly toggle those features
just place the widget on your home
screen and tap on the buttons haptic
feedback and also eat battery power
those little vibrations that you feel
when you interact with a UI or when you
get alerts is powered by a small
vibration motor which Jesus
battery-powered
guess what happens to your battery if
you turn that motor off if you want a
more automated approach to controlling
these power sapping features you can
seek the help of apps such as automated
Tasker or Jews defender disabling the
options in settings location services
can also help conserve power of it this
way too no app will be able to pinpoint
your precise location with the help of
either Wi-Fi networks mobile networks or
GPS without your approval also if your
device allows you to you can use the
restrict background data option to
prevent all apps or individual apps from
downloading or uploading data in the
background this can also conserve some
of your battery power
if you must connect to the internet and
you
and choose between Wi-Fi or mobile data
choose Wi-Fi as it eats less battery
mobile network connections tend to
fluctuate so your device's antenna will
need some extra power to keep the
connection strong and stable same thing
for phone calls your phone tends to use
more energy when making calls in a low
signal area this tip can actually be
summarized into a bottom line find
strong at Brick signals you'll be using
your battery more efficiently that way
another area where you can save more
battery power is an app data syncing app
update frequency and app notifications
or alerts many apps need to sync data
with external servers naturally the
process uses battery power apps like
Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS readers
news apps weather widgets stock tickers
and alike need to fetch updates from the
internet at regular intervals if you
want to save battery power you need to
pull the reigns in you can disable auto
syncing for such apps or set them to get
updates less frequently or at the very
least be extremely selective with which
app to allow the auto sync some widgets
need to be placed on leash too because
they connect to the internet to fetch
updates and data weather widgets for
instance again you can lessen the update
frequency for such widgets also use
widgets sparingly widget overpopulation
can speed up battery drain and slow down
your device along the same vein add
supported apps also contribute to faster
battery drain such apps fetch ads off
the net and upload user data for
targeted ads and in the process consume
battery power opt for add free apps most
are paid apps though but you can find
well-developed free apps that don't use
ads you can also save battery power by
restricting notifications do you really
need to be notified about everything
that all of your apps do allow only
important notifications to go through
for everything else turn off
notifications if you have a jelly bean
device you can go to settings apps then
go through the apps on the all tab and
uncheck the show notifications option on
each app's info page
this is probably not news anymore the
brighter your screen the more power it
uses therefore dim the lights and lessen
power consumption go manual on this one
instead of using the auto brightness
feature auto brightness uses power
because it activates the light sensors
to detect light levels from the
surrounding so it's not a very viable
solution at all if you want to conserve
power and as I've told you earlier turn
off unused features including the screen
set your screen to sleep or time out
quickly after becoming idle if your
device allows it set the screen timeout
to 15 seconds to tell you the truth I
know of some former iPhone users who
converted to Android simply because of
animated wallpapers live wallpapers look
cool and awesome but they also use
device resources especially battery
power you might argue that they use
minimal power but minimal is still
something to someone who wants to
squeeze every last drop of juice from
the battery therefore prefer static
wallpapers to live wallpapers or if you
really can't live without any home
screen animation at least choose to
stock live wallpapers or those that are
well coated and if your device uses
organic light-emitting diode or OLED
technology or its am OLED and Super
AMOLED siblings you can conserve more
battery power by using a black wallpaper
and a dark theme unlike LCD technology
which uses backlighting each OLED pixel
produces its own light and thus uses
power so if the bulb is lit power is
eaten black pixels are unlit bulbs so
they don't eat power therefore a black
background means many unlit bulbs lesser
power them as an app been hogging down
your CPU and eating your battery power
fast uninstall it there's no use for an
app that constantly misbehaves hogs
resources and suck out your device's
juice big-time to help you identify
these delinquent apps you can use apps
such as watchdog task manager light it
alerts you when a black UMES too much
CPU power that intended eliminate these
apps to help increase battery life also
always keep your apps up to day updates
not only fix bugs or add features but
also often help the app consume less
power
some OEMs too
versions of Android include a power
saving mode feature that can help cut
down on power consumption with active it
usually limits CPU performance disables
haptic feedback lowers screen brightness
disables mobile data and lower sabryna's
level of the browser's background but if
you're a heavy user this mode might
degrade performance so when using your
device intensively you might want to
disable power saving mode if you've
routed your Android you're in luck if
not it's probably high time to do it a
rooted device opens up several more ways
to lessen battery consumption one way is
to remove apps that OMS and network
carriers pre install on your device some
of such apps are actually useful but
most others are just energy-sapping
bloat another way is through the use of
CPU control apps such as set CPU for
root users no-frills CPU control and CPU
tutor all these need route such apps let
you set a lower CPU speed which also
lowers battery use or if needed you can
max out your device's performance power
by using the highest CPU speed but this
will drain your battery faster of course
a third way is through custom kernels
and custom roms many of which promise
more efficient use of resources and
better battery life third-party Android
developers often offer slimmer
trimmed-down and lighter versions of
Android that also eat a blast power if
the tips and tricks that I've been
talking about for the past few minutes
still don't satisfy your need for longer
battery life there are still a few
things free to try one is to buy a spare
battery if your device has a removable
battery pack prefer OAM batteries to
third-party batteries ôm accessories
tend to last longer and are more
reliable than third-party accessories of
course you may also buy third party
high-capacity extended batteries or
portable juice packs also known as
portable battery banks but do some
research first and buy only from
reliable manufacturers lastly learn how
to take care of your battery for example
for lithium ion batteries don't fully
discharge your battery before recharging
such habitus harmful to your battery see

devices battery life requires discipline
and responsibility from you as user it
requires energy saving habits in this
video I've shown you several ways to cut
down your energy consumption and extend
