not sure if everyone's prepared for so
what's up guys lon here from Android
Authority and I'm joined here with Chris
and we just got out of the Chromebook
session here at Google i/o where they
announced with pretty big news about
Chrome OS and Chrome OS is pretty
awesome if you've ever used it it's
really simple very fast easy to use and
that simplicity is a little bit of a
double-edged sword because you can't do
more intense things like edit photos or
videos or play high-end games but that's
about to change with what they announced
here today so Chris you want to go ahead
and tell them exactly what it was that
they talked about sure well the big news
of course is that Android apps are now
coming to Chrome OS later this year over
a million Android apps will be available
on Chromebooks in the coming months
obviously opening up a huge amount of
potential for Chromebook users as well
as for developers of Android apps a
massive massive new audience for Android
apps Chromebooks sorry Chrome OS has
actually just become the second most
popular OS in the US with Chromebooks
outselling Mac's for the first time so
yeah it's probably pretty massive news
both for developers and for users of
Chromebooks and Chrome OS yeah I think
it's pretty awesome that we're gonna be
able to get all these Android apps in
Chrome OS because not only is this going
to increase your approach productivity
with Chromebooks but it's also going to
increase your multimedia experience so
you're gonna be able to download pretty
much any app that is on Google Play
you're not limited to anything really
you can download snapchat you can
download Twitter Facebook all the social
media apps you can download any games
that you want to play like clash of
clans was an example that they showed so
if you have a touch screen supported
Chromebook you you can take advantage of
games that are that rely heavily on
touch so it's pretty awesome I think
it's gonna be gonna open a lot of new
doors for what you can do on a
Chromebook so what do you personally
think about all these Android apps
coming to Chrome OS well I mean it's
very exciting for sure one of the things
I'm a little concerned about I mean a
Google is saying that the
transition phase will be pretty simple
you know you developers can test their
apps already to see what they need to do
but considering the amount of problems
we've had just getting tablet-optimized
apps I kind of wonder how long the
transition period is going to be to get
a really rewarding Android app
experience on a much larger screen I
mean most tablet apps are just blown up
versions of us of a smartphone designed
app so I wonder if we're going to have a
fairly lengthy process where a lot of
apps on Chromebooks are just going to be
even more blown up and that's just kind
of going to be a little bit ugly I mean
things are gonna need to work with
touchscreen keyboards shortcuts and a
mouse that's that's a level of
complexity I'm not sure if everyone's
prepared for so hopefully developers
will get on board very quickly but I
feel like there's gonna be a lot of
not-so-pretty app experiences on
Chromebooks in the near future yeah that
is sort of my concern as well because
they did talk about being able to
snapchat on your Chromebook but snapchat
is a portrait oriented app and
Chromebooks are obviously everything's
in landscape so I'm not entirely sure
how apps like snapchat are really gonna
work unless developers or the developers
of snapchat snapchat make the app
support landscape mode because otherwise
it's gonna be a really awkward
experience the same way it doesn't
really work out all that well in the
tablet and as far as when it's going to
be coming they did say a few weeks for
the developers and a few Chromebooks
will be supported at the time and then
they're gonna be rolling it rolling it
out to more Chromebooks in the future so
a lot of very exciting stuff but that's
pretty much it as far as our thoughts on
the Android apps coming to Chromebooks
there's still a lot more to come here at
Google i/o 2016 so stay tuned for the
rest of our coverage
