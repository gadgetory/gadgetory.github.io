android authority and today we're taking
a look at the HTC droid DNA now i
actually got to take a peek at this back
in november when we covered its official
announcement by HTC and verizon at that
event there is one thing they wanted to
make very very clear and that is that
they want users to think of the DNA as a
phone not as a phablet after using it
for a while I'm inclined to agree even
though it isn't all that much smaller
than say a samsung galaxy note 2 there
is a difference and over time that
becomes a key difference that's very
very noticeable anyway let's get started
with the review beginning with the specs
obviously the most talked-about spec of
the HTC droid DNA is its 5-inch 1080p
screen with a pixel density of 441
pixels-per-inch but the other specs are
impressive as well the DNA runs a
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 pro chipset with
a 1.5 gigahertz quad-core Krait
processor it has two gigs of ram and 16
gigs of internal storage 11 gigs of
which are actually usable the rear
facing camera is 8 megapixels while the
front facing camera is 2.1 megapixels
both are capable of capturing 1080p
video at 30 frames per second while the
HTC droid DNA is built from plastic it's
a very sturdy phone I haven't noticed
any flimsiness in my time with it and
the creaking of groaning you sometimes
notice with larger devices wasn't
present here while there isn't anything
particularly stunning about the DNA's
rounded rectangle design there are a few
nice touches like the relatively small
bezel and the red highlights that
lighten up the otherwise black and grey
color scheme like a lot of recent
devices the droid DNA is light on
hardware buttons on top you have the
power button sim card slot and headphone
jack on the right side we find the
volume buttons and on the bottom the
covered microUSB slot on the back we
have the 8-megapixel rear
facing camera and flash along with an
assortment of logos and on the front we
have the 2.1 megapixel front facing
camera and three capacitive buttons back
home and recent apps as you may have
already heard the display is the
crowning jewel of the HTC droid DNA I
was initially very skeptical about a
1080p screen that was only five inches
but when I first saw in person that
skepticism faded away you will always
notice it but rendering of text icons
and of course 1080p video are greatly
improved by the screen sheer pixel
density as to be expected from a phone
with specs like this one the droid DNA
performs very well in the time I've been
using it I haven't encountered a single
hiccup or incidents of lag apps open
very quickly scrolling through home
screens and the apps menu is very fluid
and the few games I've tried run very
smoothly and look great in the process
the HTC droid DNA runs Android 4.1 jelly
bean skinned with HTC Sense 4 plus now
since has its fans and its detractors
but personally I find it one of the
least offensive user interface overlays
so far there hasn't been much talk of an
update to Android 4.2 but it's very
likely in the pipeline for an early 2013
release when it comes to other software
the usual bunch of google and verizon
apps plus a handful of anna's on apps
are included as well as slacker radio MX
serve and of course facebook the HTC
droid dna's camera is one of the best
smartphone cameras I've seen in a long
time colors are well represented images
or crisp and it works very well in low
light situations the 1080p video capture
is very nice as well movement is smooth
and while this sample video you're
singing may not show it well colors are
very vivid the battery is easy
the weakest aspect of the droid DNA at
only 2000 20 milliamp hours it simply
isn't going to hold up for as long as a
lot of other phones not only is it small
but it isn't replaceable either for the
purposes of this review I've been using
the DNA fairly heavily and i've only
been getting about 12 hours of battery
life before i need to charge a bigger
battery would have been a huge
improvement besides the battery the only
other two really negative aspects of the
droid DNA are the lack of a microSD slot
and the relatively small amount of
internal storage on the other hand the
DNA is fast the screen is gorgeous and
audio files like me will really
appreciate the fact that it has a
dedicated amp just for the headphone
jack which really will help your music
and other audio sound a whole lot better
now that about wraps it up for our
review but if you have an opinion you'd
like to share about the HTC droid DNA
let us know in the comments below now if
you're interested in knowing how the DNA
stacks up against the samsung galaxy
note 2 we did a video back in november
that may be of interest to you it's
called HTC droid DNA vs the samsung
galaxy note 2 if you're not sure which
of the two phones might be for you make
sure to check it out I'm Chris look for
android authority and thanks for
watching
