hindi the android authority app guide a
lot of people don't like farmville too
but a lot of people like farmville too
now you can play it on android and we're
gonna check it out to see if it's any
good if you play farmville before then
there's going to be very little about
this game that you don't already know
the basic gameplay elements remain
pretty much the same you plant crops
feed animals build things craft and sell
items expand your farm complete missions
and all that jazz just like you would on
the desktop variant of farmville 2 there
are a few things that you can do that
you can't do in the desktop version like
foraging for items but even those things
follow a similar pattern and mechanics
there are a few more differences you
cannot set down plots of dirt and plant
whatever you want now each plot of dirt
can only grow one kind of crop at a time
and you must build various plots in
order to get various crops that may seem
restrictive but Zynga makes up for it by
removing all other restrictions and so
far as I can tell water appears to be
infinite and you no longer need energy
to craft items the game connects to both
Facebook and Google+ and it also has
Google Play games achievements if you're
into using those it features the similar
mechanic of asking friends for various
items in game so make sure you know
someone else who is playing otherwise
some of the missions will get really
hard to complete there are also in app
purchases they can get you coins keys
and speed gross stuff should you want
those but you can get along just fine
without them perhaps the most
interesting part of this game is the
connectivity you can connect this new
farm of yours to your existing farmville
2 account on Facebook if you have one
it's a little bit of a pain to get it
connected sometimes but once you do it
you can actually ship items between
farms and that's actually kind of cool
I mean fans of the desktop version are
gonna love being able to send water to
their desktop farm because their water
is severely limited whereas on the
mobile version water is plentiful and
infinite however you can only ship from
farm to farm a couple of times a day so
if you do intend on enjoying this
gameplay mechanic make sure you take
full advantage otherwise you'll have to
wait several hours for your next
delivery the design is nothing special
for an Android title but it isn't bad
either it's essentially the same
graphics as the desktop variant but they
are sharp and colorful which is a plus
the screen is laid out in a manner that
is easy to understand and getting to the
various parts of the game isn't
difficult or confusing at all which is
also a big plus like all farmville games
the long
you play the more cramped your farm gets
and even after just a few hours I found
myself rearranging items on my farm so I
didn't accidentally click the wrong
thing
I suppose that's unavoidable after a
point and thus will be something
everyone has to deal with eventually
overall the design is fairly good the
controls are designed in a manner that
makes sense and the interface is easy to
move around you really can't ask for
much more than that ok so here's what we
liked the ability to shift to your
desktop farm is awesome especially since
the mobile app gives you unlimited water
and things that usually take hours to
make like flour can be accomplished
fairly quickly on the mobile version
people who play both versions will
definitely find this feature extremely
useful oh and you can ship from the
desktop version to the mobile version
too
so it does work both ways the mechanics
and controls are simple to understand
and easy to use things do pretty much
what you expect them to do and work how
you expect them to work the graphics are
sharp and colourful one of the hallmarks
of the farmville series is having a game
that's fun to look at and the mobile
version is no exception
it has Google Play game services cloud
saving and social media connectivity
with Facebook and Google+ these are all
good things
lastly it doesn't have the restrictions
that other games in this category have
you're not bottlenecked by a lack of
energy or power I played this game for
several hours without being required to
stop there are in-app purchases but if
you use your resources wisely they're
almost entirely unnecessary and here's
what we didn't like so much you should
probably have all of your other apps
closed out before playing this game I
had a bunch of apps running in the
background before attempting my first
time and it kind of lagged a little bit
on my note 3 I can see people who
multitask heavily having performance
issues and people who have older phones
may also have performance issues this is
a farmville game and thus uses the same
farmville mechanics this means there
will come a point where you realize that
all you're really doing is watering
plants harvesting plants making things
out of plants etc the repetitive nature
of the title is definitely one of its
biggest weaknesses lastly you will need
to have friends on Facebook to unlock
the full potential of this game like all
farmville games
Zynga really promotes that social gaming
aspect of their titles so if you don't
use Facebook or have Facebook friends
who play you may end up getting stuck at
some parts of the game you can buy your
way past them using items provided
in-game or eventually you may have to
buy your way past them using real money
and I feel like
people are not gonna like that second
option overall I was surprisingly
impressed with farmville to the
mechanics are friendly and familiar if a
bit repetitive but frankly if you are
interested in this game you knew that
already the integration with the desktop
variant brings an element of uniqueness
that you simply don't see in similar
titles and I like that a whole bunch
that said if you don't have friends who
play this game and you don't play the
desktop variant the mobile game will
feel a little bit lacking farmville 2 on
mobile is supposed to be played with
farmville 2 on desktop and with other
people who play both games it is not a
standalone experience but rather in
addition to a much larger ecosystem and
you can definitely tell so if you fall
into that category you should enjoy this
game quite a bit because it complements
the experience you're already having if
you don't you may still enjoy the game
but not as much and for not as long if
you didn't like farmville before
watching this video you're probably not
gonna like it now and you probably
shouldn't play it at all here's the
thing guys I am NOT a farmville fan I
expected to walk into this review and
say many hurtful things about xanga it
was gonna be really sarcastic and I was
gonna have a lot of fun with it however
there is very little that is actually
wrong with farmville 2 and Android and I
begrudgingly give it my approval if you
want to try it out the download link is
