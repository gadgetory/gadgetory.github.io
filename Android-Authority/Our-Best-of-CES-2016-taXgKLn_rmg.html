what that means here's our roundup for
the best that we saw at the Consumer
Electronics Show of 2016 here we start
off in the wearable space and a
manufacturer that we didn't necessarily
think would take on Android wear has
done so at CES casio is now here with a
sport and rugged watch the ws DF 10
Android wear SmartWatch it's a very
different take on Android wear as the
body itself is very rugged and meets the
standards that withstand shock humidity
radiation vibration high in low
temperatures and even ice and water
there are two screens actually on here
as the Android wear iteration can
actually be turned off and what you get
is a monochrome display that can last
for up to one month that is great to
have and will bolster the one day of
battery life that you can get when using
Android wear exclusively it's not
necessarily all about style with this
watch though we do think that for a
rugged watch we think it looks pretty
cool but this is all about substance and
delivering the best bits of a SmartWatch
and a regular watch in one device and
the ability to switch between the two is
something that we are really happy to
see and casio has done a good job of
giving us one of the first examples of
what this can look like from wearables
we move into virtual reality and HTC is
continuing to refine their VR headset in
their partnership with valve and now
have created a better version of the
vive called the vive pre now this was
shown at show stoppers this year with an
HP Envy Phoenix PC which is great to see
because now we have a consumer computer
that has been made specifically for this
VR platform it's more streamlined and
even smaller in its form factor and
there's even a front-facing camera that
will help the user keep from running
into any obstacles while being immersed
inside of its world the demo is still
incredible even though it's one that
we've seen before but our own lawn when
was able to put on the HTC vive pre and
experience it for the first time and as
you can see here he was very happy with
what he saw
very large tablets have been a thing
this past year and at CES 2016
Alcatel brought out their version of a
form factor that is generally used
quote-unquote in the kitchen a 17.3 inch
screen makes the Alcatel OneTouch access
a very large companion to have when
cooking in the kitchen but can be used
in a number of different other use cases
and that is because it's sleek design
language allows it to be easily
transportable around the home given a
kickstand and a carrying handle that are
integrated into the body that means that
you'll be able to use a large screen for
multimedia for web browsing and general
Android usage but a replacement home
launcher is able to segment the screen
into one half a webpage and then the
other half a couple of areas where you
can get even more functionality and
multitasking for media and even more a
huge 10,000 milliamp hour battery keeps
it lasting long when not plugged in and
the inclusion of dual back JBL speakers
and USB ports are even better additional
features for this very large tablet the
small little stick or rather dongle
provides a lot of functionality on the
one end you connect it to a computer and
on the other end you connect your
existing Android smartphone running
Android 5.0 and above any computer then
with the software installed will make
the Lenovo Lync provide your phone as a
window or fullscreen application on the
computer this particular functionality
makes it so that the screen of your
phone could actually be controlled by
the mouse and keyboard of your computer
so you can perform a lot of functions
using that rather than even having to
use your phone or if you just want to
have your phone propped up on the side
it can provide a second screen so that
you can move right over and control the
phone without ever having to take your
hands off of your mouse and keyboard we
just think this product is really damn
cool and it provides a seamless and
often very fast solution compared to
others that are already available in the
market whether it be through Wireless or
through software and lenovo has been
able to keep the Lenovo link pretty easy
to access you just have to put two
pieces of software one on the phone and
one on the computer and you're good to
go
if you're the type of person that needs
to multitask without ever having to pick
up your phone and focus on the computer
that's right in front of you the Lenovo
link and provide you a number of
functions that make the Android smart
phone bridge its
to the computer you're already sitting
in front of now we can move into the
smartphone arena with the honor 5x it's
another great phone for the honor line
that we have already enjoyed a couple
iterations of in the past year but this
time the 5x brings affordable flagship
specifications that would otherwise be
found in a $300 or more phone and brings
the price down to just $199
it has a vastly improved software
experience with a lot of tweaks that
have been ironed out and provides a
great all-around experience and even
then because of Huawei's pred agree we
have an excellent fingerprint reader on
the back still the premium build makes
it feel like it's not even just $199 but
for that price you are still getting a
great experience all around that many
users should be able to enjoy up next is
a phone that can actually yell first in
this particular regard and is made by a
company you may not have even heard of
letv brings its leigh max pro to the
forefront and you should be paying
attention because it is the world's
first Snapdragon 820 equipped smartphone
there's a very large display up front at
six point three three inches but despite
that the all-metal build and the small
bezels make it pretty easy to yield in
one hand it also has a fingerprint
reader found on the back and it did work
pretty well for us and despite the time
that we were able to have with it we did
think that the Snapdragon 820 was able
to speed along pretty well that said we
did put a benchmark onto here using an
to tube benchmark and it scored
incredibly high which makes us really
excited to finally get this phone in our
hands as far as content goes letv is
focusing on their pedigree of video
streaming content dive just a little bit
deeper into the operating system on here
you're going to get straight into live
streaming content that should look great
on this quad HD display and run very
nicely given the Snapdragon 820 it's the
first phone of its kind and we are
looking forward to getting this
particular phone so we can see what the
Snapdragon 820 can do for all of the
other flagships that will be coming
later this year and to finally round out
our best of CES 2016 we do give our
final award to the Huawei mate 8 Huawei
is back again and at CES they provided
everybody that was there at their press
conference with a copy of the mate 8 so
we could really spend some time with it
the premium hardware has already fell
and is something that we love since the
mate7 and the Nexus 6p of course but
underneath the surface we have the most
powerful Huawei made Kiran 950 available
now and in our testing thus far while
some of us have been using the mate 8 as
our daily drivers ever since we got it
at the show we haven't been able to
really make it slowed down all that much
the speed is undeniable on here and with
the emotion UI at the forefront you'll
have a different take on Android that is
still highly functional has a lot of
features it is a somewhat larger phone
than many might be used to but the small
bezels keep it from being way too
unwieldy and the premium build makes it
feel pretty secure in the hands that
said it does provide really great colors
in good contrast and for media it is
already pretty fun for us and of course
because this is why way you can expect a
best-in-class fingerprint reader on the
back that has been a joy to use in
previous iterations and continues to be
so and finally power is a great part of
the mate 8 as a 4000 milliamp hour
battery includes rapid charging and
Huawei claims that one and a half days
of heavy usage is possible on here with
two and a half days available for the
average user and that rapid charging
will be able to get the mate eight up to
one day's worth of usage with just half
an hour of the charge and with that we
have all of the best that we did see
here at CES 2016 and we hope that you
enjoyed all of our coverage of these
great devices we hope that you are
looking forward to our full reviews of
everything that we listed in this
