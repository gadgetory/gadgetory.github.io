an authority and we are live here at CES
2015 taking a quick hands-on look at the
ZTE grand X Max Plus so with a name like
the grand X Max Plus you can expect a
pretty large phone and that's exactly
what you're going to get as far as the
design goes ZTE didn't really do too
much with this phone it's essentially
just a rectangular black slab made of
polycarbonate but it does feel quite
nice in the hand and the build quality
is surprisingly good especially for a
budget device on the front of the grand
x max plus you're looking at a massive
six inch 720p HD display which really
makes this phone great for consuming
media like watching videos playing games
or even browsing the web even though it
is 720p resolution stretched across a
six inch screen
overall it still looks quite nice and
the large size also makes it great for
getting some work done because this is a
budget device you're not going to get
the latest and greatest processing
package but you're still getting the
very respectable snapdragon 400 and two
gigabytes of RAM even though this is a
relatively mid tier processor you're
still going to get great performance
with this phone whether it's playing
games browsing the web or even just
swiping through the interface you're not
going to have too much of a problem
using this phone and you should be able
to get pretty much anything you want
done whether it's for work or play
taking a look at the camera you're going
to find a 13 megapixel sensor on the
rear which should be capable of taking
some really high quality images
especially with the suite of features
that ZTE has built into their camera
software there's a pro mode for people
who really want to have a granular
control over their photos and there's
also a fun and auto mode for people who
just want to be able to snap their
photos really quickly and get on their
way on the front is a 5 megapixel
wide-angle lens which not only makes it
great for taking better selfies but now
you can fit a lot more people into the
frame like your friends and family which
makes it great for taking what ZTE likes
to call a group B with such a large bone
like the grand X Max Plus you can expect
a very large battery inside so you're
looking at a 32
milliamp hour battery and even though
the battery life is untested at this
point you can probably expect this phone
to last you through a full day and
possibly even more especially when you
consider that the display is still only
720p resolution finally let's take a
look at the software the grand xmax plus
is running on android 4.4 kitkat so it's
not quite lollipop but hopefully we will
see a lollipop update soon but it is
running on the latest version of KitKat
on top of Android 4.4 KitKat is ZTE zone
custom skin what you will find to be
very colorful but it's also very easy to
use which is going to be great for
anybody looking to get into a smartphone
for the very first time which is really
what this phone is going to be all about
but there you have it for the grand xmax
plus by ZTE stay tuned for more coverage
of CES 2015 there definitely is a lot
more to come make sure you subscribe to
