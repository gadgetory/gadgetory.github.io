original android hangout show on google+
I'm Derek Ross and I am Scott Anderson
I'm Dan Charleston I'm Johnathan
Franklin this week on android authority
on air we're going to announce last
week's contest winner we're going to
talk about some apps like the Google
Play Store Babel we'll keep some devices
some rude and ramen news which we
haven't hit in a long time got some
carrier information they're continuing
to LTE all the things and we've got some
some patents Microsoft and Oracle on
nokia they're hating on google and we
don't like it so ice let's get started
let's let's talk about this contest so
so last week I was sick I wasn't around
for the content as you guys gave away a
nexus for charging orb right yeah okay
how'd that go i had good response i saw
there's like a couple hundred calm i
threw three and four hundred comments or
something on the post and then the
jumper 300 or 350 entries so a lot of
people entered only one convened
obviously well i have that winner and
that is patrick Tremblay Patrick we are
going to be in contact with you if not
already and just give us your shipping
information and we will ship out the
charging orb to you congratulations once
again look for a message on google plus
we'll get your information that way so i
think you picked unique did you actually
recommends not i entered i put the
hashtag is there a general grilled us
out isn't it a general rule of thumb you
know that family of employees and yeah
elves can't win well you know what
joshua said it was international i
thought that included me apparently not
apparently didn't that's okay he did d
duplicate it and i'm pretty sure yeah
he's stripped away people like us well
Patrick is an international winter
actually he's from Canada well there you
go alright so congrats again Patrick all
right so uh so Scott let's uh let's talk
about the google play store pre-show
Scott and I were talking and I was
saying I
loved the new update and I like it
because it's a completely revamped UI a
holo light if that doesn't look like
anything like the older ones using like
Google now style cards it's much more
minimalistic much cleaner content is
actually easier to find you know and
there's featured cards with content on
what large cards it things aren't hidden
it's much easier to find what you're
looking for you know not that I thought
the old Play Store was that bad but
using the new version I think wow it
really was that bad so besides you know
on major UI changes uh the icons now
match the website so if you go to play
it out google.com on the web those icons
and category names are now mimicked on
the android app so it makes things more
seamless and we added more simpler to
find the checkout process is easier when
you're going to order a movie and one
thing i like is on the old Play Store
you could put a pin on there so if
anybody gets your phone you know you
lose with friends family kids kids trust
me he got to put this on a few kids and
I'll go buy apps all the time well on
the old Play Store you put a pin on
there and you had to put the pin in to
buy a nap right well if somebody went
into the manage applications and went to
google play store and had clear settings
you know clear the cache clear data
would clear the pin so now there's no
pins now you're free to go to buy stuff
right that's kind of a false sense of
security well now that's been changed
thankfully and its password restriction
based upon your google account so you
can set it up to enter your Google
account password every time you go to
buy something and it's synced to the
cloud so if somebody goes in and clear
zap date it's not going to screw you
over it's nice I like it works out well
so on I love it yeah obviously I'm
talking good stuff here so you know a
fan what what's up buddy uh okay it is
a brand new UI and it is really really
nice to my eyes it is more Google now e
it does not flow like Google+ does like
the Google+ cards on the mobile that'd
be kind of cool might be a little bit
too much though but basically I don't
think it shows as much as the old Play
Store did I think that the the bezel
basically between the cards is too much
for a phone now on a tablet if you ever
to use the new UI on a tablet like the
Nexus 7 it is beautiful and it works
it's great but I the condensed size not
so much that's my two cents then John
you had a comment yeah um I agree it it
could be smoother it looks a lot nicer I
do feel like the old Play Store was
trying a little bit too hard to be kind
of like Windows Phone 7 in the whole
tile featured thing another thing that
irks me it's not so much related to this
update but it's something they need to
fix with mobile play is like when you
have curated at lists a recommended at
list and you go to like reading two
point oh I think was the one this week
they're still pushing like crappy iOS
ports and they're like who Rose who runs
through these lists like engadget is a
recommended out where the verge is
non-existent on there and the bird is a
great app and the engadget phone app is
trash so who's you know they kind of
need to not necessarily punish
developers that don't accommodate you
know good UI design principles but they
definitely don't need to reward them for
a mediocre effort in my opinion
personally I think you need to stop I
mean it curates people from your google
plus so I think you need to stop
circling people that are downloading the
engadget at no I'm not talking about the
the personalized results i'm talking
about the ones that
put up for like these are reading apps
that you can try that they you know
tavaris Ford puts the list together and
apps like engadget or on there and the
engadget app is terror yeah it is gray
bad i think google just knows that
you're circling people that love that
app I understand though I think that
maybe some some rains need to be
tightened yeah i mean i think the the
sort of DUI direction that they're going
is nice and it's not terribly surprising
that their kind of car doing all the
things given methias four days
background of carting all the things in
webos so it's not really big surprise
that that's where androids going with
him on board but it looks good just like
i did in webos so I I think it's a
welcome change yeah I really like the
fact they kind of all you I colors you
know it's really distinct that you were
looking at books or you were looking at
movies or you were looking at apps I
mean you just kind of know because the
whole bar and everything is just a
different color which that's nice yeah
it makes it very easy so all we need now
is for google play music to get updated
off the honeycomb Tron theme and we'll
be okay astronomy could use an update to
that's true too maybe maybe that's uh
that's coming with the next version
android maybe that's coming at i/o here
next month if they wait till I oh I'm
gonna be upset you guys release all the
things right now because the candy got
this week wasn't good enough just leave
all the things alright so let's talk
about something that might be released
at i/o or we're in the our colleague
nate nate swanner he thinks that it's
gonna be released uh before I oh and you
know what it could be let's let's talk
about Babel for a second um Emily babel
babel babel boo boo whatever let's just
talk about unified messaging I don't
care what you call it well no no no the
name there's a lot to a name it's not
it's like me Babel
yeah they're not gonna call maple you
think at this an internal code name yeah
so oh no I think it very well could be
Babel it could be Babel and it could be
spelled that way but Babel think anybody
would pronounce it Abel I think babe
oils inside joke probably either way
what besides how it's spelled and once
it's called talk about some leaks um
some confirmation that we definitely I
mean if there's any doubt in your mind
that it's not coming um some users this
week reported deleting their chat logs
in gmail and when they did it said hey
the conversations been deleted however
because one or more conversations as
part of Babel chat some parts of the
conversation may be available on other
devices meaning that you may have
believed the conversation from gmail but
since Babel was rumored to sync
everything that means that somebody can
pull up the conversation on their device
even though you delete it from gmail and
that's basically what it was saying so
that showed up for a few users meaning
that it's coming and they reference you
know Babel so it's definitely definitely
real I &amp;amp; goo goo groups has also been
hemorrhaging bug reports about Babel
where someone was talking about another
app in chrome and they said well I'm not
running the Babel chat app or this has
nothing nothing to do with Babel in
things like that and you know just
seeing developers talking about it in
google groups you know and the developer
chat means it it's definitely coming so
some more reassurance some more leaks
now let's get into some actual feature
leaks Babel is rumored leaked just that
it will sync across all devices like
like I said it's going to be on iOS it's
going to be on Chrome gonna be on
Android your notifications are going to
be synced which means no more redundant
notifications which kind of happens now
with google talk and messenger once you
read a notification from say your tablet
it'll be gone from your desktop browser
Chrome or it'll be gone from your phone
you know you won't need to go to all of
your device
isn't swipe away all your notifications
yeah so they're gonna be synced which it
was great um supposedly there's going to
be a desktop app which means it's going
to be browser independent I don't know
how that you know works with the rumor
of it working with chrome as well but
obviously it's going to happen to if
it's gonna work with chrome alas so
we'll see where that girls yeah sorry uh
yeah it could just be you know a chrome
app packaged as a standalone application
right like you can get a computer to run
html5 and other web stuff locally just
yeah what up into an application and
serve it well I mean that's what they're
doing yeah with the notification thing
yeah in the dev channel I mean they're
doing it right now and they could just
unveil it in front of us I mean they're
just kind of getting ready I guess but
the fact is is that it's browser
independent in the leak meaning that
that means it's like it's a native
windows app is what I'm thinking it
sounds like oh and also I mean I could I
believe it still works if I exit out of
my Chrome browser I don't know if that's
true though it well then the chrome
process will get tactical here for a
second so if I close down chrome those
are there's a chrome process running in
my background for it a background task
running actually for the google talk
chat so the chrome doesn't actually
fully closed it just keeps process open
for a background app so why wouldn't it
just do that because would be it would
act like a standalone basically because
it says because the leak says browser
independent meaning day yeah Adam
browser installer the point is though
the service that chrome is running in
the background could be duplicated as a
standalone item it could be that's the
only case you need to break out so make
to make what would otherwise run as part
of chrome or in chrome as browser run
independently is just one little sliver
to break out as a standalone yeah well
we never got map really a little sliver
of a feature to you know I mean who
really cares if it's independent or not
independent Lin yeah more more focus on
the actual features of the app itself so
right now it's only going to support
talk hangouts in messenger will be
unified but there is a ray of hope for
those of you that were hoping for google
voice integration the the league said
that voice will eventually be merged as
well but there's no timeline so that
could be you know a year from now who
knows John you had a comment just uh the
root of them putting this together
really is their meebo acquisition too so
if they put out a dentist top
independent app there's nothing saying
they couldn't put a kind of a all-in-one
chat out that does jabber xmpp and you
know a lot of other protocols to try to
give somebody a true all-in-one solution
even if they're using yahoo i am or
whatever just give them a quality yeah
and that's a good point it could be just
like meebo was it could be when they say
you know it a desktop app that's browser
independent that means it that could
mean it's just a website you go to and
it's a it's a web app which would be
browser independent of the work on any
browser were you so so yeah i said if
you're running IE or firefox or safari
you could go to let's say table.chat
enough google com you sign in you load
your web app and there you go or you can
install the chrome extension if you're
in crowd last on the on the list here of
leaks that there's going to be tons of
emoticons tons of a maschi there's gonna
be apparently 800 different ones ranging
from smiley faces to animals to anything
that AOL chat used to have so if you're
into that it's gonna have it that's good
right that sounds like overkill the end
so a group if you're in a like right now
let's say all of us are a group chat you
know where we're sitting now we're Babel
and right pickle refer chat back and
forth to one another and we say hey we
want to do it
you just hit a button just similar to
messenger you can take a group chat to
hang out that that features gonna be
there um conversation the records so no
you're not going to have to go into
gmail anymore to search for
conversations it's going to have a
history built into the to the app or a
accessible history from the app and
apparently this is going to have a quote
first class iOS experience so that's
good it's not surprising most of googles
apps are first-class experience on iOS
as well oh yeah well for the maps maps
is exactly over there in the dark side
yeah I referenced it like it's like it's
good over there if you're stuck behind
that massively high wall at that that
walled garden alright so to Ascot let me
give you your my app guide we have any
other apps to talk about here before we
move on to some devices Chrome Beta got
full screen with nice chrome beta yeah
so let's say well first of all it's
awesome to have your home screen as the
browser it's just awesome if you haven't
used like dolphin or any other browser
that's used it you haven't experienced
it you just know chrome it's awesome and
hopefully this kid gets to the stable
built quickly basically when you scroll
down it's just the top bar just kind of
floats away very nice and if you have a
smaller screen allows you to view more
of a bigger screen again allows you to
view more very nice I think and it's you
know less buggy it is getting a lot
better I really can't wait I do you guys
think that they're gonna come over the
dev channel for mobile I admit I think
the beta is the dead channel for mobile
no that's stupid why would they have oh
well though the mobile is already kind
of a poured over from the desktop anyway
where you already have the dev channel
so I mean maybe but I just don't see it
i want the dev channel well who knows
god maybe that'll be announced at i/o
there will be there major chrome
announcement won't have anything
else it'll be announcing the chrome dev
channel free Android the sons of killing
me alright so let's talk about some fun
stuff let's talk about no late
accessories so uh Nexus devices are
known for a couple different things you
know timely updates um what else are so
this is the time the update latest
version android you know factory images
you know from google and late
accessories i think that's pretty much
part of the deal that it's kind of like
a hidden feature it's not really
interested it's not one that's really
talked about a whole lot but Nexus
devices have fashionably late
accessories and that's just something
that fast lately they're just late yeah
they're just little late just so uh
nothing fashionable about it till five
or six months isn't fashionable no not
exactly just amber 6 learn coming up to
the party with a fifth of vodka in your
hand when you're already trashed while
everybody else is happening pretty good
so so so what are we talking about here
Daniel what would happen with Nexus
devices this week well the the Nexus
time God accessory that you announced a
glass I suppose believes in a Nexus
device but there's been a lot of glass
rumors coming this week so TechCrunch
confirms the Google is going to shift
glass within a month which does make
sense because Google i/o is it about a
month yeah that makes sense because what
a developer's supposed to develop on
yeah exactly yeah so that that made that
makes a lot of sense there's also rumor
out there that Google is looking to hire
for tea glass advisors for support the
river says it's a one year contract in
new york city of Los Angeles or San
Francisco with possible detail work
involved so hiring people up probably
going to be no on the streets talking
people showing off glass so I mean that
makes sense now that you know we don't
like to confirm or knocking on confirm
your rumors but it's a device
rumor let's say glass ends up being
three to five hundred dollars retail
cost that's still a lot of money for
somebody to spend on a device a type of
device they've never bought before so
you have to sell it to them so and the
rumor is that there's going to be glass
events around the country and these
retailers or I'm sorry these support the
support staff will will provide support
to you know journalists to people in the
media to celebrities to people with
these events they're going to be
actively talking about glass they don't
want them to get it you're like I don't
know how to use this thing you know they
want these people promoting glass to to
know what they're doing so it makes
perfect sense you don't want somebody to
promote your product it doesn't even
know anything about it yep I once
imagining like Canvassers on the streets
showing it off to people like you like
on Times Square or something like that
yeah exactly look you see street vendors
and stuff doing stuff like that that
sort of stuff so that like the ordinary
person walking by can actually like sit
down and see it get an idea what is this
thing before they go and spend that much
money on something especially because
Google's probably gonna sell it online
and give me like I don't have a clue
what this thing is I've never been
touched one that was the interesting
part of that rumor that said no rumors
are rumors who knows they may or may not
ever come to fruition but they said that
there's a possibility that Google
wouldn't open up 3 stores around the
country as you said in Los Angeles and
San Francisco and New York so they would
have a retail location where people who
come in and try that and that kind of
goes back to that whole rumor months ago
about a brick-and-mortar store that Andy
Rubin said nope not happening so who
knows yeah I mean glass really is the
kind of product that feed retail front
end because something that consumers
need tactile experience they need to
touch it they need to see it literally
in order to get a feel for whether or
not they're going to want it the other
way you can do this with a place for
them to come in and do
so yeah the other big glass rumor is
that Google is going to be launching a
collective for investing so investing
into developers producing applications
for and on google glass yeah I'm I mean
uh John do you have some reason for that
um well as far as the putting people on
the streets another one you have to do
is kind of condition people to a new
technology like that anyway its exact
average person that looks at glass is
like thinking is a little bit Tony Stark
so get people out there in the streets
work with people showing them after all
the media like you know the bad side of
glass people could be recording your
every move and you have to get people
accustomed to the fact that this is the
shift and technology moving forward yeah
you should give them accustomed to hey
this really could be a creepers device
and this is how you fight that I know I
going to be I'd so another thing that
came out of the glass collectives
announcement was during during their PR
announcement one of the firms involved
said that they back to handful of apps
already and they mentioned in Twitter
which it South by Southwest a month ago
we found out that there was an Evernote
app in new york times app you know gmail
google+ and path but twitter wasn't
mentioned so i don't know if they come
on board since then or not either way
there's gonna be a twitter app so those
of you then Like Tweet you know there
you go you know and I think that you
know as you're walking down the street
or whatever and and you want to send a
real quick message to Twitter you know I
think glass is a perfect Avenue for that
you know you know because Twitter is
about you know real quick short status
you know messages now so you say a few
words by voice command no post this
picture that I just took without
someones consent to Twitter you know
because that's what we're going to do
I'm kidding more glass will actually
spell the word
quickly so all these are you spelled
sentences might just disappear I mean I
like Syria we don't even need cheap yeah
it's so let's talk about some more
hardware news more device news um today
to thing two big things happen for
samsung one the Galaxy Note 8 is now
available here in the US and to the
galaxy mega 5.8 and 6.3 were officially
announced so so let's talk about the
note 8 real quick first of all let's go
on the Megan name manga heck stupid game
alright so so we saw the Mobile World
Congress we saw the note 8 then they ate
point oh I asked two gigs ram x no cpu
1.6 gigahertz quad-core um aesthetically
it's basically it looks like a larger
galaxy s3 but it's a note so it has no
functionality but in so it's like a
hybrid between the two and I in my
opinion when you guys have created at
skul it looks like yeah it's very large
yeah so so it's a it's a bigger galaxy s
device but it has no functionality so
the big thing is is here in the US it
doesn't have phone capabilities but
across the pond it's a it's also a phone
so I don't understand why carriers here
in the US don't allow that I guess they
haven't found a way to completely screw
over phone based tablets or tablet based
phones yet once they decide on how to do
that then they'll probably start
allowing it to operate here as a phone
oh I mean a very good answer so uh how
much does it cost starting today you can
get it for four hundred bucks comes with
$25 google play gift card $50 drop off
50 gigabytes face for 42 years so if you
want you know if a note 2 is a little
small and a note 10 is a little big you
can now get a new
made here in the US that's not bad of a
price so so now from an eight inch
device it you can't make phone calls
here in the US however a six point three
inch device maga which is pretty darn
close in size you can toast a nexus well
yeah yeah well basically uh I i really
want somebody that's good with like you
know video editing in photoshop to take
like Sega's logo and have it like
transformed like the galaxy like logo or
something up and fly across the screen
is this and Sega you're like mega and
you'll win in animation yeah yo you'll
win something Scott will give you some
time talking about jelly beans you're
gonna get you better hold your word to
that people are gonna start sending you
their address Josie's um so so let's
talk about this mega device the Megas
even though they're they're half an inch
apart they are in size difference they
have exactly the same internals um one
point actually that's incorrect they
don't have exactly the same internals
very very similar internals um
processors a little bit faster on the
bigger guy the screen is a little bit
better on the bigger guys to 720p on the
six point three inch the 5.8 is in
interesting resolution you know it's 960
x 640 like that's gonna look really good
on a on a five gets q8 p so on a
five-year five point five point eight
like that things will look pathetic like
I don't look really good it's gonna look
crisp and clear your ella is on 6.3
ain't gonna be much better oh yes it'll
look like retina especially miss Kenton
yes so so are these gonna be like why do
these things have budget displays when
the display is the biggest thing on them
well I think their budget phones as the
dual-core middling processors and one
and a half can go into brand would
suggest first of all why would you make
a budget huge phone why not because I
just wrap her head around why would you
make a big budget
hi miss are looking for phones on a
budget who want big note size phones to
know Samsung's of dealing with that
market I don't believe there's a niche
in the world that Samsung doesn't think
they can market a device to it's very
true I'm up with a new nissha people
they will build a brand new device just
for that don't worry people samsung will
eventually have a device for you just
hear what Danna I think that's actually
the nail on the head that you just hit
Samsung has so much money because it
they're the number one Android
manufacturer that they can literally
just throw a handful of phones at a wall
and whichever one doesn't break they'll
sell em oh so enough of them to cover
the costs for all the other crap they
made yeah yeah I really think that's
they're doing they're there it's a big
crapshoot for them and they make so much
money that they they can afford to blow
money putting out devices that don't
make sense and if they end up selling a
few of them who cares the Galaxy Note 2
and the galaxy s4 will carry them
through what I had wonder I would love
to see the list of phones it gets
rejected what about the galaxy win that
was announced this week don't just think
about it the sheer amount of ice they
put out what is the list of devices
again they get rejected aren't they made
of metal are they high quality really
nice have a rejection Department Scott
they believe it up if that is true I'm
sorry Samsung you guys make great
devices and we're glad to have you you
yes in the android community but what
you're doing is just bobbling the
armands you know yes but we like it
though because I'm one of those people
that need a niche device and eventually
I hope it will come because Samsung you
will make it for me wanna sit as Samsung
device you had the Galaxy Nexus yeah
love that phone to death it was great
for the mandated verizon so it's okay if
you're not down with
samsung if you're not down with Sammy
you can uh get some cheap phones from zo
me right to him yeah two new devices soz
i owe me is the company that owns the me
you I custom rom and they have been
putting out devices for a couple years
now in China that only sell in China
that you can get them imported to the US
relatively inexpensively um but they've
been hugely successful in China that
keeps selling out every time they do a
run so they announced two new devices
what is the me to s and that one's got a
4.3 inch IPS 720 screens that should be
a pretty nice display with a 1.7
gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon 600
processor so that's filling it this is a
Chinese company right yes okay these
names they make sense American isn't it
is way better than American natives or
phones yeah because Vizio is an American
company and its name makes perfect sense
no I'm talking about the phone names
like the method of e2 yes yeah that
makes sense over to the mega my god it's
a reasonable point as opposed to the
samsung epic touch 4g long term
evolution that's a tongue twister yes 2
gigabytes of ram 16 or 32 gigabytes of
internal storage eight or two like mega
i think the 2011 so that's be a pretty
powerful phone as i always been bragging
about it beating the s4 in synthetic
benchmarks really though that's based on
their say-so so take it with a grain of
salt or not be a bill hole in the UF you
can get them imported to the US
typically they are hspa+ only and the
cost in u.s. dollars is 319 or 367 so
that's for the 16 or 32 so cheap devices
from this before shipping them into the
US
they also announced a cheaper lower end
phone sort of this one has a larger four
and a half inch display of an unknown
density a 1.7 gigahertz dual-core s4 pro
processor which I'm pretty sure they
really need Snapdragon 400 um one
gigabyte of ram 16 gigabytes of storage
only than the same cameras and battery
and then this one's only nine and a half
million or thing so it's an earlier than
half millimeters mega and it's also a
lot cheaper it only two hundred and
thirty nine dollars that's already jus
39 that's that's awesome oh yes our
budget phones were of that quality yes
and that kind of price yeah really
catches they usually make like 300,000
unit batches yeah and that's why I
wouldn't like the the 1 gig of ram
though that's my only gripe about that
yeah the the to play is definitely the
lower headphone but I mean the ass at
320 and 370 are not expensive devices
you see those letters and I know exactly
what phone you're talking about and yet
when you see like Derek touch mega I've
no idea we're talking about it okay baby
Samsung will make the the galaxy mega
Genesis lot of that I'm gonna be so
pissed at that point you know they
really are just looking to get sued
maybe the asus consider the transformer
prime you know the make genesis is
getting okay we should stop we should
get serious for a second let's get
serious also it talks about something
custom rom world Derek yeah so over it
routing and ramen is in place yes yes
it's actually it's actually a place in
the canada phone are we so cyanogenmod
continues to
see em all the things so the today
actually cyanogenmod released milestone
three monthly version 3 stable version 3
whatever you want to call it m3 that
just means it's it's better more stable
than a nightly build and they usually
stop they do like a code freeze and stop
a feature freeze and try to fix bugs and
everything and getting a stable it up
tighten it up and release a an M build
so that came out today for handful
devices and the list keeps growing so
check it out if you're CN fan it's
fairly stable Scott you rock and CM are
you still down with the pink unicorn
down with the pink down with the pink
mm-hmm I'm I'm like an I have tried some
others um I wasn't see him for about a
week I did like it um just not something
that I was used to I probably need to
give more time yeah let's so let's talk
about another up-and-coming wrong this
one actually hits home for Dan and I um
Oh actually you to Scott because these
guys were actually on the show a couple
times a long time ago like a year ago we
need to have him back anyways so we're
gonna talk about chameleon OS for a
minute aka chaos rom a little bit of
background on them here before we get in
some features chaos rom was born from me
you I it it's an open source ultra
alternative to meet you I because right
now me you I or mi UI is closed source
um so a brief history of why this
happened every week is I owe me which we
just talked about them the makers of the
me to a in the me to s they they put out
a weekly build of their custom rom and
it's it's a Chinese ROM it's you know
there's no it's not open source so no
one really knows what was changed and it
comes out with new features bug fixes
and so forth and chances are there
is new bugs and new things are broken
and things are changed and the guys over
at miui us they they try to make changes
to it and to port it to new additional
devices they translate it from Chinese
to English and so forth and they get
these to get the ROM working on tons of
devices that weren't originally
supported and it becomes basically more
of a pain in the ass for them as time
goes on because new bugs get introduced
new features get introduced new things
happen on a weekly basis and they try to
port these roms over the devices and
things just break then on the Y and it
becomes a real pain so what they decided
to do a long time ago was to reverse
engineer the me you I theme engine and
to bring about the same type of awesome
user customization and theming that new
UI has but open source it and build it
into an AOSP rom and that's what they
did and the census changes colors you
know themes so easily they call it a
chameleon ROM or chameleon OS or chaos
for short so anyways a little bit about
it here features are pretty simple um
there's a lot of features i guess it's
built on top of signage not so it's
fully open source it's highly customized
such as the launcher is completely
redesigned and not allowing things such
as gestures you know previews and
scaling and so forth the advanced theme
manager which is reverse engineered from
me you why is included and it allows you
to mix and match various themes so much
more than the CM phim engine does if
you're not really familiar with me you
want it allows you to go in and changing
your icons to one icon set your status
bar to another maybe your lock screen to
another your boot animation to another
messaging theme to this the framework
theme to that ringtones for this font to
that I mean is insanely customizable and
you don't it you can pick and choose
from various themes to you know get your
feet your phone or your tablet you know
to exactly how you want it to be
I has customized status bar and
customized toggles customized messaging
as i said the messaging actually layout
has been the revised as well and the
neat thing is you can directly manage
your installed app permissions directly
from the wrong which is pretty cool and
as a guy that used to love me you I back
in the gingerbread days I honestly
haven't ran it since Ice Cream Sandwich
came out you know I'm gonna try it out
here I actually haven't well the only
device I had that support it is is my
Nexus 7 and and I don't install a lot of
roms on my Nexus 7 just cuz I like to
keep it clean in stock but from time to
time I do test out of rom for you know
review and reporting purposes so this
weekend I plan on giving it a test run
and so I can give my official opinion on
it but from what I'm hearing so far from
the developers and from people that I've
tried it some people say that it's
awesome they love it and you know that's
a lot of potential there is it done with
the baked oh yes it is down with Tamika
you should give it a try like my Maker
will have some fun with it yeah it's
edit it and there's a nice thing about
it is yes it is a new rom but it does
support mtz themes which is the miui the
me you I theme so you can go ahead and
install all those themes that are out
you know there's thousands of themes
already available for it now they do
have their own ctz theme you know that
specifically for chameleon but you don't
have to use it you can use any of the
existing ones that are out there so
that's pretty awesome on I do want to
try it out i don't know if i'll stick
with it on a tablet just because I don't
like a tablet that customized but if I
didn't have this this phone but I got if
I didn't have the DNA I definitely be
running it right now so if you have any
questions about me you I go ahead and
drop it in the comments here and uh will
forward it on to the developers if we
can't answer them in directly and maybe
we'll have them on the show here in a
few weeks we haven't had them on then in
a long time
alright so let's let's talk about some
some carrier news dan what are carriers
been doing here over here in the US yes
so last week we mentioned the t-mobile
and MetroPCS the their merger was kind
of on the rocks because the metropcs
shareholders are kind of myth because
the offer it's probably three or four
dollars below per share below metros
current market value basically the
shareholders are upset that they aren't
getting their money's worth out of the
bio and t-mobile is come back and
increase their bid in what they said is
their best and final offer so it's kind
of in the shareholders court now whether
or not they will accept the offer um so
we'll see how that goes they're voting I
plead with the end of the month so in a
couple of weeks we will know whether or
not that deal is going through it's
already gotten cleared by the DOJ and
the FCC so it's just up to metropcs
shareholders now AT&amp;amp;T is rolling out
more LTE in three or four new markets
and expanding several others they've
also rolled out their plans for some 67
new markets to be deployed over the
summer so definitely look forward to
lots of new 18 tlte really everywhere
Sprint is also rumored to be turning on
some 21 new markets in the next couple
of weeks so lots more LTE coming out
from really everybody all over the US
with whoever your carrier is at this
point and then across the pond
everything everywhere is announcing
plans to double the channel width of
their LTE network which is very
technical on the back end but
essentially what they're doing is making
the pipe wider the pipe that all the
traffic goes through wider by double the
diameter so it's going to speed things
up a lot it's going to allow for a lot
more customers as people continue to
join their network and it's really going
to set them up sort of in the long term
especially for moving towards
lte-advanced which they also announced
their plans to look into so everything
everywhere is definite LTE in the
UK another plan to have or they I think
they already have half of population of
the UK covered they're planning to
expand that pretty rapidly from here so
definitely good for for our friends
across the pond then other industry news
the fair search Alliance which is made
up of Microsoft Oracle nokia expedia
tripadvisor a bunch of other companies
have filed a formal complaint against
Google in the European Union basically
they're complaining about to
anti-competitive practices from google
the first one is giving away android for
free yes that's right microsoft and
oracle are telling the world that open
source software is by nature
anti-competitive what yes good like
Apple does and take a free operating
system and make people pay for it yeah
exactly yeah I mean that's just a
shocking position to be taken all of
those companies can triple not all of
them but Oracle in Microsoft and Nokia
contribute to open source communities
they're upset because Google is
licensing products on top of a glass in
it exactly example for the second piece
of them that's the second piece of the
complaint just they're complaining that
the Google Apps suite so that's the Play
Store gmail talk the whole kind of sweet
perhaps the tends to come with every
device they're basically saying that's
anticompetitive too but the problem with
that argument is that the manufacturers
can choose to not release a device with
Google software nemeth on Amazon does it
lots of companies do it in China and
other places abroad it's not
particularly common in the US but there
were a couple of years ago a few devices
on verizon and been set as the default
search so Oh am definitely have the
choice that they never had with Internet
Explorer so would microsoft and and
these other companies actually put in
the complaint is that companies can't
really choose to not use Google's
products because all of the other
alternatives are tear
let nobody wants them well that that's
basically because we and everybody else
can't build a program to compete with
the programs that google makes they're
being anti competitive yeah that that
doesn't make any any sense in an
irrational person's mind no no not at
all name is cheaper Microsoft and Nokia
who does the exact same thing your
phones that they may still have
microsoft software on yeah whatever
Microsoft is butthurt because what do
they do for years in the final of the EU
caught up with them and said no we need
to have a menu saying pick your browser
on installation so they got screwed for
so now that they're looking to bring the
same thing based so good double screw
they were approached and they said no
and then they got double fine they're
like okay you're not gonna buy ball well
you know we're gonna find you double and
yeah whoo that hurt yeah yeah I mean
there are patent maximalist maximalists
and catagory maximalists at Google
haters of for cute out there who are
laughing at this filing because it's
just so outrageous maybe to claim that
open source software is anti-competitive
because it's free is just ridiculous
there's butthurt because nobody wants to
buy their freakin ecosystem on the
mobile and eventually and it does up
there yeah then in other European legal
news apples slide to unlock patent and
that's the 381 patent in the US was
invalidated in Germany the lead once
they're struck down and it never should
have been issued since it's intuitively
obvious that didn't they make fun of us
patents yes and I I kind of liked that
because of the US patent system needs to
grow up a little bit yeah yeah in US
patent news this week there is a pretty
telling report about the processing of
the USPTO with
last several years so there was a big
stink probably about 10 years ago maybe
more about how the bad and trade office
was more or less just rubber-stamping
everything something kind of cracked
down on it and started paying attention
but said that that was at the same point
when everybody realized that you could
just buy a patents and rode on suing
people and make tons of money doing it
without having to actually make any
products or do anything so people
started filing a lot more patents which
then led to a backlog so the outgoing
patent trade office manager as his big
shining achievement is that he cut down
on this backlog which means that the
approval rate has gone up words of
ninety percent ninety percent of every
application submitted gets approved a
meany percent that's wrong sixty percent
of all patents that are reviewed in
front of a court or reviewed by the
USPTO gets trucked out I would argue
would be more than that I think that's
just based on how many have actually
been struck down you know I mean there
should be maybe even a process before
Pattin gets approved where someone that
would be able to contesta submit
something to them you know helps them
out with the prior are with the yeah
having it it's not a very public process
and the the patent trade officers their
job in terms of performance is rated on
how many applications did you approve
now how many did you process how many
did you approve when that's the way the
job is set up all you're going to do is
approve applications because that's your
job your job is to approve applications
it's not your job to review them and
analyze that and actually think about
them it's just your job to approve them
the other problem with that is that
companies can submit like 42 different
types of Appeals when it gets rejected
and so the way the pet and trade office
likes to scream their numbers is by
counting each one of those resubmissions
as a separate one that's a rejection
when that patent eventually gets
approved
they just counted as one approvable in
five rejections instead of just one
approval hmm so that's why the number is
a lot question night meat and USPTO
whatever mantra net but yeah they're the
companies are just resubmitting their
patents until they happen upon an
inspector that's going to rubber stamp
it and why not exactly there's no
disincentive for companies there's no
disincentive for filing bogus patents
there's no disincentive for refiling the
same bogus patents over and over and
over and over again because it one will
stick to the velcro wall yeah and
there's no disincentive for getting a
bogus patent and then suing the crap out
of other people for it and then having
it struck down with lightning there's no
disincentive for any of it no it is not
a good situation I wonder what's gonna
happen something's gotta happen I wish
I'd have got so many things in America
yeah it's a good place here though it is
a good place yeah just don't we do I owe
a lot to screw things up here everything
like we really try just to make we
really try our hardest to screw a lot of
things up like are you talking about you
personally are above the US
so I was I just talking about the u.s.
Scott was very okay when he's fine so
what though we had a question or two
earlier in the show here um about with
the Nexus headphone well Scott Anderson
just happens to have a nexus headphone
so if you want to see what that looks
like here it has a nice little Nexus
symbol on it well it's still there hey
it looks I can't bar our laughing mega
all right so so Scott inquiring minds
want to know did you buy the nexus USB
cable no and even if I did I would not
admit it you know if you did buy the
nexus USB cable I want to see an
unboxing video okay I think that would
be a very exciting I would love you know
I haven't looked on YouTube has anyone
done a nexus USB cable unboxing it it
would be amazing if they packaged it
just you know extremely well you know my
little hood open lining in the bottom of
it or something the packaging was ok ok
so to be awesome Charlie we know will
care about packaging how does it sound
okay first of all the packaging was ok
uh sound is ok alright so so you know
those Galaxy Nexus headphones that we
got with our verizon galaxy nexus oh it
blows those out of the water ok there
they're definitely a lot higher quality
than those good yeah that's always
aiming for and I needed one with a
microphone how much do they cost with
shipping morning some twenty bucks that
you know what if you went down to like
Best Buy and picked them up that's what
you're gonna pay a best buy for an a
average quality pair you know 20 30
bucks yeah you can get you know some
some extreme generic for 10 bucks ten
bucks or you can spend a hundred dollars
and get don't
that yeah i would never spend that
amount of money on headphones but that's
me I'd some places under apple earbuds
ah how much clothes I have no idea I've
never bought them i don't buy iOS
products I don't think their hunger I
think they're like probably 50 or 60
about now are you serious and I think
ones with the mic are like 40 I don't
know that somebody go to the forbidden
website I mean all right well I think I
think that what you get for questions I
think I think we're done and we're done
on time you know on time so so how did
