by bitdefender mobile security the
Samsung Galaxy s5 is definitely
Samsung's powerhouse but how does it
stack up to LG's powerhouse age Joshua
Pagar from Android Authority what's
going on everybody and this is the
Samsung Galaxy s5 vs. the LG g2 when it
comes to design the galaxy s5 does
introduce a very welcome change from the
glossy plastic and brings in a textured
soft touch finish on the back though
overall the design aesthetic is very
similar to the s4 before it's and the
galaxy note 3 you have the same button
layout all around basically but the Menu
button has been done away with for a
recent apps button
speaking of button layouts LG attempted
something very different with the g2 now
while it is still made up of a slippery
and glossy plastic that is fingerprint
prone what is really unique about this
device is the button layout because it
is now on the back of the device that is
supposed to be used by your index finger
convenient or not this positioning
allows for a very clean look to the
front of the device and helped along
with the ultra thin bezels of the g2
which really makes this display shine
through we absolutely have no
distracting elements on the front
overall it's a battle of soft touch
plastic for the s5 that may or may not
look good according to your standards
and then of course the curved back with
the button layout on the back of the g2
and in either case you do have a pretty
pleasurable device to hold now both
devices do feature 1080p displays with
the LG g2 coming with a slightly larger
5.2 inch IPS LCD display compared to the
5.1 inch Super AMOLED display of the s5
you're not going to find that much
difference in the sizes here but we will
say again that the bezels on the g2 are
quite small which is very attractive to
us either way though the colors are very
vivid and the brightness and the viewing
angles are not issues with either of
these smartphones both of these phones
boast Snapdragon 800 processor while the
s5s is a slightly updated version that
is clocked in at 2.5 gigahertz compared
to the 2.2 6 gigahertz found in the g2 2
gigabytes of RAM and Adreno graphics
offer best-in-class processing packages
with the s5 just getting the slight
nudge of being faster microSD expansion
is missing from the g2 which is always
one of the advantages of Samsung devices
and built-in storage is available at the
standard 16 or 32 gigabytes
now while the LG g2 does boast a bigger
battery
which likely accounts for its slightly
extra thickness it has a capacity of
3,000 milliamps over the 2100 milliamp
our unit is found inside the s5
however the s5 much like many other
Samsung devices does remain with a
removable battery so if you have a spare
then you'll have more power than the g2
now one part we're really excited to put
through its paces in this comparison in
the future is a camera fight because
both of these devices offer very good
optics while the 13 megapixel rear
shooter of the of the LG g2 comes with
optical image stabilization which is a
big deal Samsung has definitely upped
its ante with the 16 megapixel ISO cell
camera we're very excited to see what
kind of camera quality we get from
either device and see how they stack up
to one another when you look at the
software over the last year or two you
might find that if these two companies
weren't rivals in terms of their
software offerings they'd probably be
more like brothers after all both UIs
are very bright and colorful almost
probably bloated and cartoonish in their
appearances and are packed with long
lists of features that you may or may
not use useful LG g2 features include
the knock-on which will be updated to
the knock code and while the s5 is
loaded with a ton of new software
enhancements like the magazine UX and
the kids mode you do also have some
hardware additions like the fingerprint
scanner and the heart rate monitor on
the back one thing is absolutely certain
that in these two iterations of these
two companies flagship devices they are
trying to offer a lot for the user
experience you just have to take a look
at the settings toggles in the
notification drop-down to see just how
much they both offer now when it comes
to the camera software they both aren't
all that different either by offering
numerous modes filter settings and
really it's only a question of which
device offers more that you would want
and so there you have it for this quick
look at the flagship devices for Samsung
and LG both do provide very
full-featured offerings however the g2
does change it up a little bit with that
different button layout on the back
while the s5 pretty much just takes the
formula they've always been giving and
continues to add on top of it whichever
one is better for you depends on which
one offers what you need for your
experience so keep it tuned to Android
