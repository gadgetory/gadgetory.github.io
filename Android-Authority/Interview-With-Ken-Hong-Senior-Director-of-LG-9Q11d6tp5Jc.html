2017 and I have the pleasure of being
with one of our favorites and an old
time friend of ours that android
authority and my personal it's ken Hong
ours thank you sir global communications
director for LG mobile so what do you
think about CS 2017 what do you see that
was cool one of our one of the best
shows I've been to and I've been to
quite a few it's it's there's a lot of
energy this year very very exciting year
for innovation not only from us but
other companies as well to be honest
with you I haven't actually seen the
show we've been so busy at our own booth
yeah you know I can't step away because
there's a line of people wanting to talk
about what we've brought to CES this
year and I'm happy to do so hopefully
after we talk i'll have a chance to
wander around the bed yeah yeah a lot of
stuff people have been telling me to
check out yeah no I agree with you uh
well you know I know and kenna we're
talking about this before but I was
invited to go see LG display and i know
this is every company but we were seeing
some AK OLED TVs in there curve
wraparound stuffing like we were talking
about before you know I I believe that
LG has one of the strongest brands in
consumer electronics you know whether
scroll thank you home appliances or home
entertainment mm-hmm on the mobile side
of things you guys had a lot of
innovative stuff you know around the LG
g5 you know to be 20 yeah what do you
think of talked specifically about
mobile I mean 2017 is like arguably the
most competitive frame time I've
witnessed in the mobile industry
Samson's trying to come back after two
PR nightmare so with the Russian
machines and their notes at seven better
if you ask Google what does LG have
coming for us well first of all I let me
address that elephant in this booth you
know innovation sometimes leads to
problems mistakes I mean Samsung is the
only one and we definitely do are you
know we're not gloating or you know
taking I know any sort of a positive
message away from that it's a negative
for the whole industry yeah when
innovation leads to problems like that
so again if you innovate you're going to
take some risks yeah you know you don't
innovate you don't move ahead by not
doing things like that so again for the
sake of future CES is I hope to see
companies push the boundaries more we've
pushed and there have been things in our
past that you know have not worked out
and we're going to try to correct those
in the following year I mean some people
may say that our last G Series you know
we we definitely lost focus you know
possibly we'll see what happens with
with a g6 but we definitely do not think
that people should stop taking risks
exactly yeah mm I mean I risk taking
this kind of got the industry to where
it is I hope it continues I mean things
have kind of about in a little bit flat
line you know consumer interest is
actually declined substantially on
device launches I've noticed you over
here cuz I study the analytics so we can
stay keep the lights on I'm creating
content I mean we've got virtual reality
you know we those 360 stuff we have
faster processors faster networks and
what's the next big thing well if I knew
that I wouldn't be working at out gee
I'd be doing my own startup yes my you
know five to put money down it would be
something related to AI I you know
whether it's robotics or deep learning
or what have you I think and you know I
don't I never use the word cloud because
what does that mean come on they're all
part of this very very wide general
ecosystem but I I think it's gonna be
and it might not be this year but it
will take a few years obviously but
it'll be very very low level III think I
think that's the direction everyone's
going in the tech industry uh your we
introduce robots at this show yeah you
know that is the hardware version of the
AI exactly right but we're definitely
focusing there that's so cool to hear I
mean from what I've read right now
artificial intelligence of his access
and interface eighty-five percent of
times for audio and so seeing like 2016
was like a year partnerships you know a
lot of partnerships we had like you know
like a hallway and and so forth right
but this alexa opening up the rate
I mean do you think LG is going to be
trying to create something in house or
buy something like you did with webos
absolutely i mean amazon has the best in
the business when it comes to that data
and the you know and the information and
the content on the voice quality we you
know we've got a long way to go we're
not a software company yeah you know we
have to do software for our hardware but
we're not a software company at all and
so we need a partner that is good at
software right and Amazon you know they
may be e-commerce but there there's a
lot of software knowledge beyond that
right so you know they're never going to
do an exclusive partnership with any
company they're going to open it up wide
similar to what Google has done with
Android so yeah we're definitely willing
to play you know play that role of one
of many of Amazon's partners and a lot
of companies that this show have
introduced you know hardware that uses
Alexa yes yes and I think that's good
for everyone you said something last
night which I can't stop thinking about
I don't know if I can shared mmm it
might cause a little bit of all the
night if I put it over a little bit of a
riff of the audience and you said I'm we
are looking young yeah we're looking at
a reality beyond Android you know
perhaps in time and yeah I mean you
mentioned like Internet Explorer all
right well no I'm just I you know I I
don't think there's you know any
hardware or software in this case that
you know that that we can say will be
the standard forever yeah I mean we all
thought that about Windows is it I mean
with chrome you know with Chromebooks
and so forth you are looking at competi
competition others have come and gone I
you know Mozilla tried you know to do a
firefox OS sailfish you gotta you know
you got to be ready for the next thing
whatever that will be we are not you
know we are not saying that this is
going to last forever or that this will
end soon we are saying that in this
field you got to be ready for everything
yeah so whether that's Firefox OS or
sale
sure whatever you just have to be ready
for something that we cannot control
there's three billion on controlling it
but look pretty building Android users
yes and and and you know we are not
about to say that there's something on
the horizon but I definitely think you
know you just have to be ready for the
next big consumer trend we're not
controlling it again you know we're
responding to consumer wants and needs
you know look at look at webos you know
it used to be mobile and then we turn it
into a TV oh not interested we're not
interested in in webos for mobile and
people are like oh please bring it back
and why would we bring it back it was
mobile it failed we turned it into T is
great success for those communities now
this show we've introduced it into an
appliance oh yeah how crazy is that so
yeah in the fridge unlike a touch screen
right yeah on a touchscreen come on our
interview fridge you're seeing Android
for the first time in history outside of
a TV and outside of a smartphone how
cool is that I mean that's really cool
yeah you just have to be ready for
everything yeah but definitely
software's the future I mean it talked
with the refrigerator you know
scattering in the products is to come in
okay this in the last four days look at
the recipes recommending it to young yep
anyway it's the software is the future
but you know we're a hardware company we
don't you know pretend to be anything
else we are a manufacturer we are
technology yes what we're also
appliances yeah so you know you have a
couple companies in the world right now
that can do a lot of different things
but at the end of the day we are
manufacturers yes you are and we are and
we do some OEM work we also do some you
know we do a lot of things behind the
scenes people a lot of people don't
realize that we make you know we make
machines for other companies soon
absolutely and so it's it's a it's a
very very exciting area to be and have
our own brand as well as help other
companies create brands well the
technology with our manufacturing
prowess I know it's especially I mean
you guys have so much expertise across
so many different segments that it's we
want to talk about that that's what I'm
that's what I'm here to talk about not
just phones not just TVs but the fact
that there are companies like us who can
pretty much you know get involved in
whether it's solar energy
whether it's uh you know washing
machines or car parts we do it all so
2016 LG vs. samsung you know who do you
think won 2016 what's the win how is the
how is the winner magic perception and
trust towards the brand consumer
perception and trust towards the brand
impossible to say only because it really
depends what the question is like is it
about branding is it about revenues I
mean of course company like Samsung is
much bigger than us yeah so you know
when it when it's talk when you're
talking about you know sales and
revenues they're always going to be that
that's just one or number two in the
world right yeah that's true ah but it
you know I think we hold our own I think
scrappy so ji has really a strong fans
when it comes to certain products yes
especially appliances and display yeah
so that nice widescreen monitors um but
we have a lot of work to do another
areas so again it depends on the
question and it depends on who you ask
because if you're a fan of TV's you know
LG may be very strong there but it may
not be very strong in another area yeah
we gotta work on those other areas I hey
well I think you guys are doing a great
job you're thank you uh thanks for your
help well man I love you guys you know I
really uh thank you for your time Ken
all right RC all right sir appreciate it
thanks lucky bay android authority CS
