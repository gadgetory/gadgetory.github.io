Authority and I figured today we take a
little bit of a break from the normal
stuff that we usually do here on this
channel like the reviews and the verses
and all the other typical stuff and do
something that's a little bit more
laid-back and fun so today I'm going to
talk about what's on my Android phone
how I typically have it set up the apps
that I use and the apps that I can't
live without so let's go ahead and get
right into it
all right so the phone that I'm
currently using right now is the galaxy
s7 edge and this is one of the phones
that I normally typically default back
to when I'm not reviewing or testing out
another device but no matter which phone
I'm using I always have the same exact
setup
so the launcher that I have is the
Google now launcher and I like to
sponsor it because it's really simple
and it's really clean and also because
it has the Google now home screen on the
left side which I really like because it
makes it really quick to get to on top
of that I have a pretty simple setup
there's nothing too crazy going on here
I just have a clock up top here this is
just the default clock that comes with
the Galaxy a7 so whatever clock I can
find by default on a phone that's just
the one that I use and it's a really
clean looking clock so I decided to use
it and then down the bottom here my
bottom dock I just have the dialer
Hangouts which I use for chatting on
hangouts and also as SMS the app drawer
in the middle obviously the Google Play
Store and the Chrome browser and then my
folders I have four of them I have a
Google folder a social media folder
productivity and a games folder and the
Google folder is pretty self-explanatory
it doesn't really have anything to
surprising in here I have Gmail the
Google app Google Maps calendar photos
YouTube and Google Play Music which is
my music service of choice and then the
last app here which is a Google app that
does not typically come pre-installed on
smart phones is the Google opinion
rewards app and this app is actually
pretty cool because you can gain free
Google Play credit just by taking
surveys and the surveys are really quick
and simple they just ask you
really basic questions like when was the
last time you went to Walmart or when
was the last time you went to Home Depot
stuff like that really simple stuff and
then you just get credit for it and then
surveys take about thirty Seconds to a
minute to fill out so the next folder is
the social media folder so I have
facebook facebook Messenger Instagram
snapchat Twitter an app called group
mean which is a a chatting app for
chatting with a lot of your friends or
whoever you want to chat with I use it
to chat with a lot of my gaming buddies
on clash of clans which I'll talk about
in a second and then the last app here
is just the secondary app to Instagram
called layouts which allows you to make
those grid type photos where you can
stitch multiple photos together the next
folder is the productivity folder and
this folder is sort of a hodgepodge of
stuff but they do have work-related
stuff in here as well the first app here
is slack for communicating with a lot of
my colleagues here at Android Authority
the next app is uber everybody knows
what uber is uber is for getting a ride
and then I have PayPal for sending and
receiving money and then the next app
here is my Bank app which is first
federal as a bank you've probably never
heard of because it's pretty local I
think but I use this app to check my
bank account to make sure nothing's
going wrong then I have the Nelnet
application for paying off my student
loans because I was a student at one
point and then the next three apps are
actually for controlling the lights that
you see and a lot of my videos like the
lights that are on this desk here and
also the lights that I have in my living
room but the lifx app here is really
clean very nice looking as easy to use
you can turn your bulbs on and off just
like you normally would expect to and
you can also set different themes change
the colors also set different effects
like make the light strobe or make them
cycle through different colors or even
have them beat to the music that you're
playing in your house and then the
Philips hue app is also really clean as
well it's really nicely laid out you can
change the brightness of your lights you
can change the colors you can also
change the scene of the lights so
whatever it is that you're feeling at
the moment you can change
you can see that I'm changing them right
now so if I want this Arctic Aurora I
can do that and lights will
automatically change to blue or you can
make your own scenes as well which is
what I have here which is just basically
an all purple / pink being because
purple and pink sort of look really good
on camera which is basically the only
reason why I use that color not because
it's my favorite or anything but it just
looks really good on on camera so I like
to use a purple and pink but anyways the
next app that I have besides lifx
and Phil too is an app called on switch
and this this app here is a total
lifesaver because instead of having to
use both lifx and philips hue separately
i can actually just use the on switch
application which lets me control both
my wife expose and my philips hue bulb
in one app now the app is a little bit
buggy it does freeze from time to time
especially if you haven't opened it up
in a long time and it's also it's in
it's in desperate need of a redesign to
say the least it kind of doesn't really
look all that nice but it works
extremely well there's a lot of
different effects that you can download
some of them are free some of them are
paid but you can check those out if you
want then you can also make the lights
strobe or change color stuff like that
same thing you can do with lifx
and you can also set different groups so
I have one for controlling all my lights
in the apartment so I can turn them all
on and off with one switch and I also
have separate ones for just the office
and one for the ones I have in my living
room which are the light exponents so if
I want to turn these off right now I can
easily do that and I can also just turn
them back on just like that so it's
really simple really easy to do and then
lastly the last folder that I have here
is the game's folder and the two games
that I have right now our clash of clans
and clash Royale both are supercell
games and I've been playing clash of
clans for like several years now which
sounds like a really long time
especially for a mobile game most people
don't really play mobile games that long
but it's a really addicting game
especially if you've invested a lot of
time
even maybe a little bit of money into it
and the next game that I play is clash
royale and this is basically sort of a
spin-off of clash of plans but it's a
completely different game entirely and I
don't really I have a love and hate
relationship with this game it kind of
annoys me but I still continue to play
it and I'm not really sure why because
it just drives me up the wall and kind
of makes me mad a little bit at times
but it is what it is this next app here
is kind of a funny one this is how to
tie a tie and I don't really wear ties
all that often so whenever I have to
wear one I sort of don't really remember
how to tie one and this app is really
awesome because it has a bunch of
different knots that you can tie for
your tie the only one I really used is
Windsor but there's a bunch of other
different ones like a half windsor
diagonal Atlantic whatever you want to
do with your tie this app is really
useful for that but yeah that's really
it as far as my layout is concerned I
like to keep things very simple and
clean as you can tell because it makes
it a lot easier to switch from one phone
to the next when I have a particular
setup that does not take me a long time
to do and there you have it guys
