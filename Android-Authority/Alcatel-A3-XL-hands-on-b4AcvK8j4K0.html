Alcatel has announced a new large budget
range phone this is the Alcatel a 3x Val
a six inch device low-cost consumers in
mind focusing on budget minded markets
and consumers Alcatel has put together a
decent budget level device in the a3
Excel from the top down you're looking
at a six inch display at 720p resolution
not only is this a little unimpressive
but the capacitive multi-touch is
limited to just five points of engine a
media tech Mt
1 point 1 gigahertz processor takes
along keeping 1 gigabyte of RAM and use
and the 8 gigabytes of internal storage
leaves you the user with just three
point eight gigabytes of usable storage
good thing there is support for up to 32
gigabyte microSD the cameras offer a
similar story the 8 megapixel rear
facing sensor with up to 1080p video
capture includes software features
including a 4 x digital zoom and a few
beautification modes like we've seen on
other front-facing cameras the a3 excel
packs just 5 megapixels up front keeping
things simple with up to 720p video
capture manual camera controls will keep
enthusiast please but the settings limit
a 16:9 aspect ratio to just one
megapixel resolution
unlike many budget devices you'll enjoy
biometric security on the h3 XL as there
is a fingerprint sensor on the back up
by the camera like you'd find on a later
model LG phone or the Nexus 6p finally
keeping the lights on is a 3000 milliamp
hour battery a decent sized power brick
for a device with just a 720p display
putting the phone to use you'll find
Android 7.0 new gear with an ear stock
Android
the device is fluid we notice no major
hang-ups or delays navigating the OS or
opening some of the default apps this is
not to suggest the phone is a snappy
performer but not half bad considering
the specs we are seeing no price has
been announced as yet with Alcatel a3
Excel headed for the Asian Middle
Eastern African and Latin American
markets in the first part of 2017
followed by Europe in quarter two be
sure to stay tuned for more great
coverage of CES 2017 and all the best
that Android has to offer here at
Android Authority because we are your
