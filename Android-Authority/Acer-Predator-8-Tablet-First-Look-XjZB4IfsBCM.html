authority and the selection of gaming
tablets are few and far between but
you're about to have a new one to pick
from pretty soon this is your first look
and hands-on of the Acer predator 8 the
predator line from Acer is meant to
deliver a high-end gaming experience and
the predator 8 is a very uniquely
designed Android tablet that is meant to
bring the gaming experience in a small
compact form factor it's an 8 inch
tablet and you can already see right off
the bat that it has a look unlike any
other tablet with very sharp and
aggressive body lines and the corners
where the speakers are located flare out
from the main body there's one speaker
in each corner for a total of four
front-facing speakers and this is what
Acer likes to call predator qua do which
is meant to deliver an audio experience
like no other and I have to admit they
do sound extremely good the full HD IPS
LCD display features a resolution of
1920 by 1200 with zero air gap
technology and Acer claims that it
supports a hundred percent of the NTSC
color gamut which is pretty impressive
for a screen on a tablet as to how
accurate that claim actually is it is
hard to say but it is a very
good-looking screen with great viewing
angles color saturation and brightness
on the inside the predator 8 houses the
latest Atom x7 z8 700 processor by Intel
with an Intel HD graphics GPU 2 gigs of
ram and 32 or 64 gigs of internal
storage with the option to expand up to
an additional 128 gigabytes fire microSD
for a device designed with gaming in
mind the amount of RAM sounds a little
bit low but the Intel chipset should
make for a solid gaming experience and
good all-around performance the predator
8 also comes with what Acer calls tax
sense technology that provides
vibrations and tactile feedback on the
screen and throughout the body of the
tablet when gaming similar to what you
would experience on a DualShock
controller on the ps4 this is meant to
provide for a more immersive experience
when gaming and it definitely does add
to the experience and the vibrations are
nice
and strong but not overly so that they
feel like a distraction should you ever
need to take pictures or do video chats
there's a five megapixel main camera on
the rear and a two megapixel camera on
the front and both of these cameras most
likely aren't going to be anything
impressive since this tablet's primary
objective is gaming and simply because
cameras on tablets are typically more of
an afterthought than anything else for
the software the predator eight is
running on android 5.1 lollipop and it's
a very stock like experience with the
exception of a lot of pre-installed
bloatware but otherwise acer has done a
pretty decent job at keeping the OS as
clean as possible the predator 8 tablet
will be available in the month of
November for a price of $299 and if
you're looking for a gaming tablet that
could potentially rival the Nvidia
shield the predator 8 is most likely
going to be your best bet as always
