with Android authority and you're
watching our video review of the vivo
III map so the V 3 max does look at
least a little bit similar to a phone
starting with AI and ending with own
regardless it would be pretty dismissive
to ignore vivos unmistakeably premium
design vivos implementation of a
metallic shell combined with carefully
crafted curves gives the v3 max a
remarkably nice look and feel and while
some will be hesitant to purchase the
goal variant you should know that the
gold is very light and barely noticeable
in most lighting build quality is
excellent here and the physical softness
of the metal makes the V 3 max feel a
bit unique in the hand relative to other
similarly designed smartphones although
the latter does come at the expense of
being a tad slippery and less scratch
resistant for what it's worth our unit
only accumulated a couple of minor
scratches after a few weeks of use
however the three capacitive keys found
on the bottom of the V 3 max are
unfortunately not illuminated and the
choice of a Menu key rather than a
multitasking key may seem fairly odd
although it is understandable once you
realize that fun touch OS offers
swipe-based multitasking the 5.5 inch
1080p display looks pretty good with a
good amount of saturation and great
viewing angles it is lacking a tad in
terms of contrast however and sunlight
readability is surprisingly bad
strangely enough the front display
material feels a bit plastic light which
makes it more susceptible to
fingerprints and scratches you'll likely
be happy with the display overall but
when compared to displays on phones like
the Xiaomi me 5 or even meizu m2 note
there is a noticeable difference in
terms of quality the V 3 max is being
marketed as faster than faster and it's
no slouch when it comes to day-to-day
performance despite its mid-range
Snapdragon 650 to processor the B 3 max
performs well enough to be comparable to
phones with higher-end chips like the
Snapdragon 808 of course fievel's
implementation of 4 gigabytes of RAM
surely helps in that regard while also
leaving plenty of room for multitasking
there's also the adrenal 510 GPU which
results in a very positive experience
when playing even high-end games like s
well 8 in the US the v3 max is able to
receive HSPA+ in all areas on the AT&amp;amp;T
network and some areas on the t-mobile
network call quality was notably
Pleasant with the vivo and it's always
great to see unlocked dual SIM devices
you can repurpose the phone's nano SIM
slot from micro SD card up to 128
gigabytes if the 32 gigabytes of
internal storage just isn't enough and
you're cool with using the micro SIM
slot exclusively we were quite impressed
with the fingerprint reader found on the
back of the v3 max as it was able to be
both the Huawei Nexus 6p and Xiaomi me 5
in our testing vivo has included a hi-fi
audio chip for higher sound quality
through headphones and the difference is
noticeable when compared to other
mid-range devices however unless you use
higher quality headphones and stream at
a higher bitrate it's difficult to
notice anything day-to-day beyond a
minor difference what you are likely to
notice however is the high quality of
the speaker which impressed us with its
loud volume and low Distortion although
many prefer front-facing speakers the
speaker here is still pretty good
although the battery is relatively small
at 3000 milliamp hours we consistently
reached 6 hours of screen on time with
variable usage and often noticed
impressively long standby times
sometimes more than 24 hours
there are several power consumption
profiles available for use within the I
manager app if you do need to extend the
battery life further and once the phone
inevitably does run out of juice you can
take advantage of the phone's fast
charging technology of course we have to
talk about the 13 megapixel rear camera
with phase detection autofocus and good
lighting conditions we
we're generally happy with the images
that the V 3 max produced as most came
out sharp with good color reproduction
and plenty of dynamic range we did
notice that the device tended to
underexpose however especially when
shooting outdoors thankfully this can be
quickly adjusted with the well
implemented exposure compensation slider
unfortunately we were pretty
disappointed with the phone's low-light
performance is it offered results that
were oftentimes just too noisy and
distorted it's also worth mentioning
that the phone is not capable of
recording 4k video a feature which some
users may miss at this price point
although the camera software does have a
strong iOS vibe it's very functional and
easy to use but many different camera
modes are easily accessible and offer
first-time explanation which will
definitely help guide some users things
do get quite interesting once we take a
look at the v3 Max's software it's
running vivos custom fun touch OS 2.5 on
top of android 5.1 lollipop
unfortunately because it is shipping
with the one-and-a-half-year-old
lollipop certain features like Google
now on tap and fingerprint reader access
for third-party apps are missing with no
substitute although that is a little
annoying fun touch may not be so fun for
stock Android enthusiasts as the OS
makes several major changes like moving
the notification toggles and the
multitasking menu into a control center
and removing the app drawer with that
and app names like eye music I theme and
I manager it's difficult to deny that
VEVO has found a great amount of
inspiration within iOS overall fun touch
OS is fairly easy to use but it can take
some time to get used to there are also
certain areas that feel like they could
use more polish but there are also some
very nice features like s capture which
gives you several options when wanting
to share your screen the vivo v3 max is
now available globally in either gold or
rose gold you can pick it up in India
for about twenty four thousand rupees or
about three hundred and fifty-five
dollars the vivo v3 Mac
is a smartphone that is great at many
things like design performance audio
battery life and camera quality however
like any other smartphone it does have
its flaws we would have loved to see us
availability and us 4G LTE support as
well as better glass covering the
display and a less iOS like software
experience and while it does shine in
many key areas the xiaomi nee 5 is
simply a more well-rounded option for
about the same price unless you need the
even better battery life better speaker
or just prefer the beat frame axes
design you may be better off by
purchasing a shell me me 5 instead with
that said vivos efforts are not to be
diluted we must note that this is still
a great mid-range smartphone but with
today's highly competitive market great
only goes so far thank you for watching
