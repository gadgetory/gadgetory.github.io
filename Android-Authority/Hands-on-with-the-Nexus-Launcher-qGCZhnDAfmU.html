what we're expecting to see running on
the upcoming 2016 nexuses it may not
look like much but there's actually a
whole bunch of funky stuff going on
that's nothing like the stock Android
launcher you already know the best part
of it is that you can install it on your
phone right now I'm Chris Colin with
Android authority here to take a quick
look at the leaked Nexus launcher so
what have we got well there's a date
widget you can't move or resize and on
the other side we've got this little
pill shaped Google button tapping it
brings up search as usual but tapping it
again launches Google now don't worry
you can still swipe to the right to
access Google now in the same familiar
fashion you're probably used to down the
bottom of the home screen you'll see
that there's no app drawer icon anymore
but we don't have endless screens full
of apps either what we do have is a
little arrow which does the exact same
thing
tap in to bring up the app drawer
instantly or slide it up to enjoy the
cool transparent animation while plenty
of people will hate this new launcher
this is actually an old Android feature
that has been resurrected if we jump
into the launcher settings real quick
you'll see that we have a few toggles
including the option to remove the app
suggestions from the top row of the app
drawer so if you're not a fan of having
Google Suggest apps you based on your
habits you can just get rid of them
entirely heading back to the settings
you can also disable the dedicated
Google now screen and turn home screen
rotation on or off in landscape mode
you've still got access to Google now on
the left and the app drawer arrow sits
on the left hand side there's also a
fancy new wallpaper picker we've got a
wallpaper summary up the top here and
you've got access to all of your own
photos as well as the stock launch of
wallpapers but there's also a bunch of
nice curated collections to choose from
as well not only is there a huge list of
beautiful images in each section you can
also opt in for what's called daily
wallpapers once enabled this will
display a new wallpaper every day
downloading them automatically from the
cloud and from what I can see there's
some really great stuff in here so it's
worth checking out those circular folder
windows from the dev
user back but as this is a pre-release
launch oh we don't know yet if they'll
still be there when everything is made
official alongside the new nexuses if
you want to get the Nexus launcher on
your phone you just have to flash the
zip file linked in the description below
via custom recovery this is because it
needs to be installed as a system app to
support swiping right for Google now and
accessing the new wallpapers if that's a
bit too complicated for you you can just
install the apk but as you can see on my
galaxy s7 edge you can't access Google
now of the swipe and when you launch the
wallpaper gallery the Nexus launcher
crashes which brings me to my final
point what exactly is the Nexus
launchers status when we already have
the Google now launcher is it a
replacement and alternative a special
launcher just for Nexus devices we
really don't know at this point in any
case if you're not a fan of the new
launcher you can always just switch over
to the Google now launcher or any other
for that matter but with only a few more
weeks to go until Android 7.0 the new
nexuses and the nexus launcher are
officially unveiled we don't have long
to find out
