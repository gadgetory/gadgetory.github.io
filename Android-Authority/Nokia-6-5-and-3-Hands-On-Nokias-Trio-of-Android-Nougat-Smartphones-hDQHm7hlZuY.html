authority and well it looks like Nokia
is back and they're back with three new
Android phones we have the Nokia six the
Nokia five and the Nokia three and the
great thing about these is that no
matter which one you pick you're getting
some excellent build quality with a six
and five being machined out of a single
block of aluminum while the three
features and aluminum frame with the
polycarbonate back
they're also all running Android newgate
and it's a completely stock build of
nougat Nokia kept it this way to keep
the experience clean and simple and to
make it easier to keep up with Google's
monthly security updates the best part
is you get Google assistant built-in
across the entire lineup the same Google
assistant we've seen on Google's pixel
phones and Google home the Nokia six is
the biggest out of the bunch and also
has the highest specs it's got a 5.5
inch 1080p display three gigabytes of
RAM 32 gigs of on-board storage and it's
being powered by a Snapdragon 430
processor there's an 8 megapixel front
facing shooter and a 16 megapixel camera
on the rear with dual tone LED flash and
it also features dual speakers with
Dolby Atmos driving the audio experience
it'll be available in four colors with
matte black silver tempered blue and
copper there's also a limited edition
art black version that's glossy and
comes with 4 gigabytes of RAM and double
the internal storage
the Nokia 5 sits squarely in the middle
of the pack with a 5.2 inch IPS HD
display 2 gigs of ram 16 gigs of storage
and same Snapdragon 430 processor it's
got a 13 megapixel camera on the rear in
8 megapixel camera on the front and
comes in the same format color options
as the Nokia 6 the only other real
difference here between the Nokia 5 &amp;amp; 6
aside from the specs is that the design
is a rounded metal body whereas the
Nokia 6 has sharp and distinct edges
will be flat sides all around the Nokia
3 rounds out the lineup with a 5-inch
screen two gigs of ram 16 gigs of
internal storage and 8 megapixel cameras
on both the front and the rear but
instead of a Snapdragon processor like
the Nokia 5 and 6
the Nokia 3 features a mediatek
quad-core processor instead if you want
a small phone this was definitely the
one to get as it's the easiest one to
use in one hand and despite having a
polycarbonate back and not being fully
made of metal the build quality is still
pretty solid
the Nokia 6 has been available in China
for quite some time now but the entire
lineup will be available globally
- of this year starting at 229 euros for
the nokia 6 189 for the nokia 5 and 139
for the nokia 3 although whether any of
these devices will be coming to the u.s.
is still a question mark at this point
