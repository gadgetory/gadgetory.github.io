Aoife is coming to a close the Berlin
son has moved away and the clouds have
moved into its place I know that sounds
really corny but that is truly how i
feel about leaving Aoife this is my
first Aoife and nostalgically this is
going to be a big moment for me to
remember because the fact that I covered
Aoife means that I'm nearing my first
year as a tech reporter tech journalist
whatever you want to call it a youtuber
a tech youtuber so Eva marks a very
important time for me because now we
have CES and that's pretty much when I
started last year I say yes as far as
the convention actually goes there is a
lot to love about Aoife in Berlin the
thing is you have to remember that this
is not just a mobile conference while
mobile does have a very big focus here
at Aoife it's not the only thing that
you'll see you'll see everything from
home appliances two ovens two vacuums
and robotic vacuums and stuff like that
the messe itself actually is one of the
biggest venues that I've ever been to
and as far as a tech show goes it's one
of the hardest to navigate actually at
CES you have just a few huge buildings
and you just have to weave your way
around to find the actual spot of the
thing you're trying to report on but
here some vendors have their own huge
room and then there are a bunch of other
buildings there are upwards of twenty
eight buildings here and all of them
have a different function and the
problem is everything is listed like
6624 the second floor 634 the third
floor and then they're just arrow is
pointing everywhere you don't
necessarily know where you have to go
until you actually sort of get halfway
there and then you start to see sort of
the light at the end of the tunnel so
the meso is definitely one of the
toughest then used to cover because
there's so much walking and you could
get lost really easily but in this last
day or two that i was here at Aoife i
think i got the hang of it finally so
things went a little bit smoother this
time around and of course we have to
talk about the Galaxy Note 3 it's the
biggest release obviously and everyone's
going to be talking about it for weeks
to come until it finally comes out and
gets into people's hands but as far as
the galaxy note 3 is concerned I
actually really love most about it what
I love most about it is that back that
new material that they're using yes they
keep saying that it's pretty much
like leather but it really isn't it's
textured plastic don't get fooled other
than that it's great to see LG coming
back into the tablet game and that's
super great the LG G pad it's it's a
good device and it kind of takes the
best of all the worlds that we all want
from our devices the plastic material
the aluminum material all put together
you got the plastic front in the
aluminum back after that of course like
I called it at mwc this pass februari
Sony is going to take my heart every
time I go to a show and this is because
they have great design on top of great
features on phones that honestly have a
bit of a nostalgic factor because Sony
is a company that we've all grown up
with and we just for me I want to see
them succeed at least in in a number of
different ways with that in mind the oh
Namie phone or now the Xperia z1 is a
great device it is a lot like the Xperia
Z so you might need to take that into
account but other than that it's it's
it's a greatly designed phone this
xperia z design was still very well
received and it comes with a lot of
great features especially that 20 that
21 ish megapixel camera the g lens oh
man oh man you want to know a story ok
my favorite moment from this entire trip
hands down has got to be from my second
night so that morning Bogdan had left
and I was taking care of all of the
coverage at Eva pretty much by myself
and I ended up hanging out at the Intel
block out which is honestly the safe
haven I can't thank the guys at mobile
geeks and Intel for making for allowing
us to be there and for just just for the
existence of that it was great I
would've known about it if it wasn't for
our friends over at mobile geeks but
anyway so we're over there and I'm
taking care of all of my stuff and I'm
trying to give videos on i ended up on a
live stream so that's amazing hopefully
we'll be able to see the footage of that
later on and i even did a video with the
grit ashley Esqueda from TechnoBuffalo
so that was that was wonderful as well
but at the end of the day I ended up
going with mobile geeks with Nicole and
Sasha Pallenberg of mobile geeks to a
party essentially when you come to
events like this you pretty much have to
find as much free food as you possibly
can just to keep things as cheap as
possible because the taxi fare alone to
and from your hotel to the venue can
really make you broke but anyway I ended
up going to this party and this was the
day that I wore my android authority
shirt
and I used I warrant for this for the
live stream but then when I found what I
found out was we were going to a
Microsoft party so it was a it was a
little it was a little pork arias to be
to say the least I wouldn't have thought
it was that bad if I didn't walk into
the restaurant that Microsoft's having
the party and I didn't hear the person
who was giving a speech for whatever
reason say Android says they have a lot
of updates all the time but Windows
Phone updates are more substantial when
I heard that I went plaster white and I
was super scared about being like having
android on my chest while sitting there
luckily for me I put an extra shirt
inside of my bag a button up shirt and I
kind of mosey outside I put my stuff
down and I put my I start putting my
shirt on and I like start buttoning it
up and the culture I figure out where I
am it looks outside and as I came in
here and I'm like wait so Sasha sees me
and I'm like I'm trying to cover my
android or your shirt and he just starts
busting up yes so funny just that the
comedy of this entire situation that I
had to cover up my android or t-shirt
because i was super afraid that I was
gonna get the crap beat out yeah I don't
Microsoft show Microsoft party so as you
can see it is literally the end of the
day for me there's one more day of evil
laughs but i've called it a wrap today
the sun is starting to go down and we
obviously have the clouds in the sky
covering everything up I just wanted to
be here and give all of you a huge
thanks for for watching all of our
coverage for being there right there
with us at Aoife I tried my best to give
you a glimpse into what the experience
of Aoife is like in a few videos and I
really hope that you got a lot out of
our coverage and I cannot even begin to
give you my most sincere asst thanks for
being there with us but as always thank
you very much as Josh Berg are from
android authority thank you very much
for watching I can't even say it enough
take care everybody and we'll see you at
CES</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
