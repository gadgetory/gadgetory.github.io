team found some new life and began
working on their next release the idea
was to bring some fun new features that
helped improve the user experience while
maintaining all the things that made
Paranoid Android one of the best AOSP
roms out there instead of putting up
builds as alpha and beta releases the
team decided to forego those and go
straight for a stable release that
releases here and we're going to take a
quick look at it
floating mode is actually a floating
window that you can use to view your
applications without having to open the
entire app this is useful for things
like replying to quick messages or
checking on something on the fly without
having to stop what you're doing the
good news is that the window is large
enough to make it useful for practically
any application with the one downside
being you can't really move it around
all that much there are three ways to
make floating window mode happen the
first is by long-pressing any
notification it'll turn dark and then
you'll see the option on the right side
tap it once and the application will
open in front of whatever else you're
doing do note this does not work with
all apps you can also go into the recent
apps view and find the icon there each
application has its own little box and
the icon will be at the top bar next to
the close button tap it once in the
application will open in floating mode
the third way is by far the easiest and
it's a toggle in the quick settings
called floating peak you enable it in
the quick settings and then when you get
a notification you can click on the
heads-up notification to automatically
open up a floating window once it's open
you'll have full functionality across
the entire application to do what you
need to do once it's done you simply hit
the back button and return to whatever
it was you were doing before we found
that if you don't have any applications
open when you create the floating window
it'll automatically open the most
recently used application in the
background just in case overall it's the
best system-wide implementation of
floating windows that we've ever seen
and it's really easy to use or ignore it
if you don't want it
OTS or on-the-spot controls is something
that Android tablets have had for a
while already to some degree when you
drag the notification shade down for the
first time you'll be asked if you want
to turn the feature on if you miss the
opportunity then you can find the option
by navigating to the system settings
than to backup and restore and then
finally to feature preferences
this is a really simple feature the way
it works is when you slide down the
notification shade like normal you'll
see your notifications like normal no
magic there however if you slide your
finger down over where the clock usually
sits you'll be able to draw down the
quick settings in one swipe it's true
that this mimics the functionality of
just swiping down with two fingers but
that's difficult to do when you're
holding the phone in one hand the only
issue we found with it is if you're
using larger phones and your thumb may
not make it close enough to center to
pull down just the notifications however
if that does become an issue you can
always turn the feature off otherwise we
recommend you leave it on because it'll
save you a couple of swipes once you get
used to it in Android marshmallow you
have the capacity to move your quick
setting tiles around however if you want
to delete them or add more you'll have
to go into the system tuner and do it
the hard way
and Paranoid Android this functionality
is baked directly into the quick
settings you'll be able to move quick
tiles around as usual but you'll also be
able to drag them to the top and throw
them away like you do with icons on your
homescreen at the top of the status bar
there is a plus symbol where you can see
all the tiles that have been removed and
you can rehab them to the quick settings
at your discretion this is turned on by
default and is usable immediately after
boot so you can customize as soon as you
want to of course there are plenty of
features carried over from Prior
releases that are still there now for
instance paranoid Android has
CyanogenMod themed support and virtually
any cm13 theme from the Google Play
Store should work on this ROM
system-wide immersive mode is still
present and you can set the status bar
and navigation bar to disappear pretty
much whenever you want it to it will
reappear when you swipe up from the
bottom or down from the top just like it
usually does in any application with
immersive mode this release of paranoid
android also retains support for layers
if you want to know more about rro
layers we took a closer look and are
diving into Android M series from last
year and we'll have that linked up for
you in the video description below if
you want to know more
as usual the power menu has been altered
to include a reboot option a screen shot
option and an airplane mode toggle you
can also get reboot to recovery etc in
the developer settings if you so choose
interestingly the robbed doesn't appear
to come with any root access by default
you'll likely want to flash the latest
supersu zip
with the rum and gaps if you want to
keep root it's also worth noting that
there are additional features for
oneplus and oboe owners such as gestures
and more involved kernel features
overall paranoid android seems like a
very competently done rom it maintains a
lot of the features that made it really
good in the first place but it also adds
in a few new things for people to play
with we were especially impressed with
how well the new features have been
integrated everything feels like an
extension of the operating system with a
natural fluidity that isn't generally
typical for a custom ROM it seems to
work pretty well and we didn't have any
force closes or performance issues but
to be fair we've only been using it for
a few days and your results could vary
that said it is stable enough for daily
driver use if you are interested if
you're interested in the following
devices are supported by paranoid
android the Nexus 6p the Nexus 5x the
Nexus 6 5 for the Nexus 7 2013 edition
Nexus 9 the oneplus one the oneplus 2
the oneplus X and some various Sony
devices if you want to try it out for
yourself we'll have the download links
listed for you in the video description
below and that about does it for this
one folks if you want to keep watching
we have a video where J sounds up the
best Android phones as of june 2016
linked up on the screen there and in the
video description below don't forget to
