Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly it's
CES week which means hardware is
stealing the show as per the norm but
there were some pretty cool software
things to get announced and there is of
course some app news so let's take a
look our first bit of news this week a
v8 was bought out by Yahoo at CES this
year to the attune of 50 million dollars
for those who don't remember a beaut is
a launcher / personal assistant that's
not unlike the Google Experience
launcher the reactions so far have been
mixed some people are excited to see
Yahoo take a long tour like a v8 and see
what they can do with it on the other
side of the spectrum people still think
it's 2008 and that Yahoo is still
terrible and will only make things worse
so far yahoo has announced that nothing
about a v8 will change except will be
using their own money to make it better
faster what is interesting about the
whole thing is a v8's ability to deliver
contextual content based on the location
and the time of the day it's also been
rumored that Yahoo is in talks with
Robin labs about obtaining a google now
style virtual assistant so there's an
outside chance that they're combining
these two ideas to create a sort of
Yahoo Experience launcher that has a
very real possibility of not being
terrible just prior to CES samsung
announced what they're calling samsung
Smart Home what this is is a system that
allows you to connect all of your smart
gadgets together so that you can control
them the idea is actually really cool
the idea is to connect your wearable
devices smartphones tablets TVs and
other smart appliances together all in
one big ecosystem that you can control
you can then do things like tie your
washing machine to work or your oven to
clean itself you can even do things like
view your house using connected devices
that have cameras like your digital
camera the big issues with this are that
Samsung devices will be the only
compatible devices at launch which means
for most people it's going to be very
expensive outfitting their homes to make
this work on the plus side you'll be
able to control your TV AC washer dryer
and more with the Galaxy gear and this
will go down in history as the first and
probably only thing about the Galaxy
gear that doesn't suck Google is always
buying up smaller companies either to
improve their portfolio or to bring us
new products this last week they
purchased a popular application timely
for an undisclosed amount the buyout
comes with some immediate benefits for
people who haven't tried timely yet the
app is now entirely free with no more in
app purchases and no more obnoxious
social media sharing to unlock parts of
the application you can
right now in the Google Play Store and
we'll have a link for you in our written
companion even though the app had some
shady social media tactics the design is
almost universally liked and most people
in the media including us are hoping
that elements of timely will show up in
more Google Apps and possibly even
Android itself until may be working to
bridge the gap between Android and
Windows once and for all as word around
the internet is that they're working
with PC makers to make Android apps run
on Windows PCs according to the verge
the Android apps will run in a virtual
machine the key beings who make the
virtual machines practically invisible
so it appears as though you're running
just the application this would bring a
whole new world of choice and
functionality to current Microsoft
products this is a highly controversial
move by Intel because it would mean that
you don't actually need an android
device to run most of what makes Android
great which are the applications not
surprisingly Google isn't too excited
about the idea and surprisingly neither
is Microsoft according to sources Steve
Ballmer things running Android apps
would interfere with the unified
operating system goal of Microsoft but
we can just add this to the
ever-increasing list of dumb things that
Ballmer has said because Microsoft has
everything to gain and nothing to lose
if this actually happens our last bit of
news this week is my personal favorite
thing to come out of CES so far and
that's PlayStation now PlayStation now
allows you to stream PlayStation games
to your smartphone or tablets instead of
having to buy them and download them
seriously it's pretty awesome especially
if you're a fan of the PlayStation 1
into game library it's been demo'd at
CES a few times but it's not been
released to the public yet word is it
there will be a closed beta opening up
toward the end of January with a full
release planned by the end of summer
there are no details yet as to what it
will cost so how can you get it sony has
stated that it'll work on the
PlayStation 3 the PlayStation 4 most
2014 Smart TVs and of course smartphones
and tablets eventually some have stated
that there will be a discernible lag in
the controls because you're streaming
the game and not playing it on your
device and the graphics can suffer if
your connection vows out similar to that
of Netflix that said this can be a great
option to play some really epic titles
on Android devices without downloading
10 gigabyte games and without studios
having to port games to the platform so
who wants to see some trending
applications as usual if you want to
check any of these applications out you
can find the links in the written
companion which is in the video
description first up is a 3d live
wallpaper called space HD not only did
it make the best apps of 2013 list from
google play but it also made their app
list of apps to watch for this week it's
a gorgeous live wallpaper with see
from space in addition a recent update
added the Andromeda galaxy more comments
improved animations and more stability
it's only a buck and let's face it you
spend a buck on a lot of things that are
less awesome than this poweramp ended
the year and began this one with some
serious update some of which include
fixes for KitKat updated icons Romanian
translation many many Bluetooth fixes
and additions and improved ex fat and
ntfs support it's one of the highest
rated and most beloved music players on
Android and we can't think of a reason
that this isn't worth the money to pick
up if you enjoyed candy crush saga
you'll probably get a kick out of the
next game out of those developers called
farm heroes saga the gameplay isn't all
that different but the graphics and
atmosphere are so if you were getting a
little tired of candy crush you wanted
to try a similar game in a new
environment it's worth giving this one a
try the jelly is a newly announced
social network that's sort of a mixture
between Yahoo Answers an Instagram you
essentially take the pictures post them
and then ask a question about that
picture and then people answer you the
official Android app was released many
people believe it needs to be polished
and it's a brand new network so there
isn't too much content yet but if you're
a fan of being an early adopter it can't
hurt to try it we really doubt there are
many people anymore who don't have
Pandora or at least I've heard of it
they updated their app recently to add
alarm clock settings this is to compete
with iHeartRadio which lets you start
your day with your favorite radio
station and now Pandora does as well of
course they've also had a really active
last couple of months so if you haven't
used it in a while maybe it's time to
give it another chance well that about
does it for this week ladies and
gentlemen I'm Joe Hindy the android
authority map guy and this has been
