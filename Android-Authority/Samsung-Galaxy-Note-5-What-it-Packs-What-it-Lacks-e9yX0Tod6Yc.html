to you by harrys.com so now that it's
official in the galaxy note5 is out
let's talk about what it packs and what
it lacks first what it lacks now this
may sound a bit harsh but the Samsung
Galaxy Note 5 is just a larger copy of
the galaxy s6 with curves on the back
Samsung's Note series has always
differentiated itself from the Galaxy S
lineup in many ways but this is not the
case this time around Samsung devices
have always been characterized by their
storage flexibility allowing you to use
microSD cards while most other
manufacturers took those rights away
Samsung did away with expandable storage
when they released the galaxy s6 and
since the note 5 is based on the s6 the
same applies in the new phablet no more
microSD card slot for you now you would
think because there's no expandable
storage option Samsung would offer a
hundred and twenty eight gigabyte option
but such is not the case that just
doesn't make sense to me I don't quite
understand it the note series has always
been driven by geeks people who want to
really SPECT out big device to not only
use their phone for a phone but actively
use it for productivity these are power
users and taking away the expandable
storage I might be able to understand if
you gave us 128 gigabyte option I don't
know what Samsung was thinking and not
to beat a dead horse but there's also no
removable battery removable batteries
are important to many of us the ability
to carry multiple batteries and swap
them out on the go changes the whole
experience of your device battery life
becomes much less of an issue
not to mention once the battery gets old
you don't have to jump through hurdles
just to install a new one even worse the
3000 milliamp hour battery here is
actually a bit smaller than found on the
galaxy note 4 though it is bigger than
the galaxy s6 now some of you may think
of this as a gimmick but let's talk
about the lack of an IR blaster once you
can replace your remote control with
your smartphone you really don't go back
some smart phones out there sport ir
blasters
allowing them to control TVs sound
systems cable boxes stereos and more
some devices are great and they will
discard the need for an infrared
technology at some point but we haven't
reached that milestone just yet
nonetheless Samsung did build a beast of
a phone let's talk about what it packs
and we'll start with the S Pen the pen
now uses a spring release mechanism and
some say it's there to help you remove
the pen from the device but actually
it's used as an anxiety soothing tool
you can click it when you're bored
Samsung has refined the air command menu
making it much sleeker and aesthetically
pleasing of course you can still use
action memo smart selects screen right
and S noted more it's still one of the
best smartphone stylus pens we have seen
to hit the market and we've got to talk
about that this could be the best
smartphone camera in the industry this
is one area in which the samsung galaxy
note5 won't disappoint it sports the
same camera as the Samsung Galaxy s6
this 16 megapixel sensor with iOS
optical image stabilization can produce
some of the best images around hands
down and look at that large gorgeous
screen as it goes with new flagships the
note 5 screen touts a qHD that's 2560 by
1440 resolution in addition this happens
to be a Super AMOLED display at
technology which is known for its vivid
colors and deep blacks it may not offer
the most accurate colors but they sure
are their funnest and most striking the
note 5 also has a lot of sensors aside
from the usual things Wi-Fi Bluetooth et
cetera the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 also
sports NFC fast charging wireless
charging in addition users can take
advantage of a fingerprint reader and a
heart rate monitor and finally the phone
is just gorgeous it's a very well
designed device it's very premium sleek
looking so what do you guys think is it
worth the trade-off when you talk about
the pros and cons let me know in the
comments below I won't know how many of
you are excited or maybe a little
disappointed let me know the reality is
