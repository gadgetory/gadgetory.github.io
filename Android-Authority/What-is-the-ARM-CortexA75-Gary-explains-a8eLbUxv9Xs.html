Thoreau's now this is the second video
that I'm doing this week
last time I covered dynamic the new
processor architecture from arm and
today we're going to be looking at the
new high performance processor for arms
called the cortex a 75 so what is the
cortex a 75 and what does it bring to
the table well let me explain now the
court in a 75 is a processor that can be
used inside of a new dynamic cluster and
that's what the last video was about and
it could be mixed and matched with the
new cortex a 55 which will be in my next
video now the a 75 is a high-performance
processor and it's inspired by and take
a lot from the cortex a 73 but it's more
than just a tweak there's a whole bunch
of new stuff in here that have really
made this a great processor so let's get
down to performance what do we see well
according to armors at 22 percent
performance increase so compared to the
a 73 and will you translate that also
just things like floating-point numbers
when you look at things like memory
bandwidth overall in protein their
benchmark like Geekbench you may even
see up to a 34% increase in the
performance scores that you get from the
benchmarks but the key thing about the a
75 it borrows the ideology from the a 73
and then it can do sustained performance
maybe remember the a 73 was a great
processor because unlike previous
processes it was capable of making a
peak performance but its peak
performance was actually the same as
it's sustained performance so what that
meant is that when we get previous SOC s
usually made me run a benchmark on it
and it gives you this great score but if
you ran that benchmark for a long time
then actually the processor performance
would start to dive because it would
start to heat up and to maintain that
heat dissipation specification so the
phone doesn't burn your hand and so that
the process they can get rid of that
heat it would have to lower its
performance
now the a 73 and now the a 75 has this
idea that the peak performers and the
sustain
performance are almost exactly the same
thing which means that although we might
just get good scores in the benchmark it
means as you're using the phone for long
periods playing games or your web
browsing using all through the day
you're actually gonna find that
performance remains the same and that's
one of the great things about the 873
and it's also a great thing about the a
75 now as I mentioned in the dynamic
video because we've now got this greater
single straight performance there's also
the opportunity for SOC makers to put in
a single core tech 875 core amongst a
whole bunch of cortex 855 cause maybe
even in a seven plus one configuration
or in a two plus six configuration that
will still hack see have a very good
silicon footprint which means the costs
will be good but actually you'll get
that great single thread performance
which really helps you eyes and certain
types of applications still much more
responsive here look at some of the
micro architectural changes that we find
in the a75 compared to the a 73 the
first thing to note is that we've gone
from a two way superscalar process with
what the a 73 was to a 3-way superscalar
processor of course now we've got the l2
cache is per core just because that's
what is defined now as part of dynamic
and that also be true in the cortex 855
of course it can be used in dynamic and
of course it comes with access to the l3
cache which is across the whole cluster
for those who are into the l1 cache is
now a 64k 4-way associative cache and
there is a very good low latency on
getting data from the l2 cache the eight
mt5 also had a state-of-the-art branch
predictor which enables it to sustain
the performance and keep those
instructions flowing down the pipeline
even when there are tight loop
situations
now branch bridges are a very glamorous
part of SOC design but basically if you
think about it like this when a program
is running the CPU is fetching the
instructions from the memory is the
coding and the mem is executing them and
at some point if the program jumps off
to different completely part all those
bits that have been fetched and started
to be decode previously are now invalid
because a program is now running
somewhere else and our branch predictor
works out where the programs
jump to next and make sure the
instructions are coming down the
pipeline ready to execute even when the
program has jumped off now the a75 has
got a new Brock predictor it's an
improvement over one that's in the a 73
and that helps improve performance and
keeps those instructions flowing down
the pipeline now the a 75 has got seven
independent issue cues now what that
basically means is that different types
and instructions can be run in parallel
so if you're loading something from one
part of memory and the next instructions
are loads of meals from another part of
memory well actually you can do those at
the same time because you're not going
to use both of them until maybe the
third instruction so they get happen at
the same time and there are several
different cues from what can be executed
at the same time again that improves
performance now one of the things we
hear a lot about today of course is AI
and neural networks now a lot of these
things are not using long complicated
floating-point numbers they're actually
finding that you can run these neural
networks using much less lower precision
16-bit floating-point numbers and in
fact there's even some types of dot
products as vector multiplications that
can happen in just an 8-bit integer and
so armored than a lot of work to improve
the performance of 16-bit floating-point
numbers and all these integer 8-bit
integer dot products so that as we move
more and more into using your networks
in our software as we use more and more
seeing AI assistants in our mobile
phones the underlying hardware is able
to run the instructions needed to make
those more efficient and so there you
have it the cortex page 75 is a new
high-performance core from arm that will
be used inside of a dynamic cluster
along with the cortex a 55 you've got a
great improvement in the overall
performance maybe as much as 34-percent
in a benchmark like Geekbench you've got
a great single thread performance
increase which means we might see this
use in different types of combination no
longer just like four plus four
combination but maybe a one plus seven
or we might see it in a different kind
of configuration maybe a five plus one
we'll have to see that lots of options
for CPU makers to use we of course we've
got the new the continued sustained
performance along with that increase in
performance and
cause there have been improvements
throughout the microarchitecture
including the stuff we need for neural
networks and for artificial intelligence
