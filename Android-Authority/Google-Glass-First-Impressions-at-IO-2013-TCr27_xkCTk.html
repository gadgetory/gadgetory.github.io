ahead and put on the glass aw it's just
a little bit weird because this is my
first time ever and I've been very not
too sure what to think yet but here we
go whoa that's it that's the best that's
the best reaction you can have them when
we put it on so these glass that our
friend Peter let us use are obviously
set up to turn themselves off when it
understands that it's not on somebody's
head which means it's it's not
horizontal like this once you put it on
it displays the glut at the time it did
just time out so what I'm gonna do is
look up look back down it is very
non-obtrusive it's not too heavy it
doesn't weigh your head down at all and
of course to activate it you look up
then back down and you see the time
right in your periphery if I look
forward I can see everybody everything
is still clear but in my periphery I
just have this little piece that shows
the information I don't look up again
it's got 12 28 ok glass ok glass Google
Android Authority take a picture
and what it does is it takes a picture
of everything I see that I'm looking at
like they like we kept saying the
moscone Wi-Fi is a little weird down
here so right now it is looking through
google you don't have to close your left
eye in order to get there actually it
works just fine if you just kind of look
this way so yeah there it is android
authority it does have the bone
conduction speaker so it is reading to
me what's going on now if I tap it here
what you can do is on the side here is a
little they don't want to call it touch
screen because it's not a screen but it
is a touchpad so you can can kind of go
vertically and get more android
authority stuff showing me a Google+
post that we did showing me chris
smith's post so a lot of cool stuff
about android authority now if you swipe
down like this it does go back to the ok
glass so you obviously have to get used
to it because the head motion makes you
need to reactivate it and the timeout
the time out time is actually pretty
short so let's say it again ok glass get
directions to palomino San Francisco
there you go palomino restaurant on
spear street from going tonight all
right so going back down and we're just
coming back to the front and I'm just
going to go through it shows me the
picture that we just took android
authority the search you just did and a
couple of the posts that Peter made it's
an interesting technology I see that it
has a lot of benefit day to day the
problem with that right now is that
Google needs to develop their services a
little bit more if i were really really
busy used google now a lot for reminders
and things like that this would have a
lot of benefit it also has a lot of
benefit when you're in i would say
metropolis kind of like San Francisco
when I'm walking around things will pop
up photo spots
you know or if you're going to your
movie things will pop up like that
that's where I see the benefit to it so
first impressions is a it is it is a
very nice device when you first put it
on you think some of my friends out
there will say it looks like a decode a
decoder from Dragon Ball Z so you know
it's over 9000 stuff like that but
really it's it is unobtrusive I can
imagine myself wearing this for a long
period of time without my ears and my
head and my nose starting to like kind
of feels sore from it because it is very
very lightweight and that's cool coming
to IO you see everybody well not
everybody but a lot of people wearing
Google glass and it might look a little
bit odd at first but once you try it out
yourself you realize just like many
products that are in their early stages
this is a product made for its potential
right now it's all about potential and I
see the potential being pretty immense
imagine traveling and when you're
looking up at a sign that isn't a
language that you don't know maybe you
snap a picture of it or in real time
it'll just start to translate it for you
that would be really great the voice
recognition is really good Peter was
right it does seem to work very well so
if you're talking to somebody and it
picks up what they're saying then you'll
get the translation right away so all of
those all of those things all of those
features that were hoping come for glass
it's it is really up to the developers
and that's why it's something like
Google i/o exists so that the developers
can really get in touch with these
products and learn what would be great
for you and I think that's really
awesome about google glass it's a great
example of what starting from the
beginning and you get to see the
progression how important something like
that is for kind of the average person
right now there's not a lot of benefit
once they build it out and we do have to
thank people like Peter who is an early
adopter of glass because his kind of his
work will get us to where it needs to be
so we thank Peter for all his work and
all the explorers for all their work
because without them this won't go
anywhere
honestly for me I could see myself using
it once it becomes a little bit more
robust but the way it is right now it's
more or less something I would use for
fun I suppose but certain applications
like getting directions to somewhere or
getting a quick status update or giving
a quick picture online I do think that's
a cool that's really cool as well so
guys this is nate swanner from google
i/o 2013 i have peters glass probably
not giving them back I don't know how
that's really going to work out but
we'll see thanks guys so yeah that's
just a quick demo of google glass we
want to thank peter once again for
giving us his time and for allowing us
to try it on ourselves and as always
it's android authority your source for
all things android and we'll see you
from google i/o the second day of the
conference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
