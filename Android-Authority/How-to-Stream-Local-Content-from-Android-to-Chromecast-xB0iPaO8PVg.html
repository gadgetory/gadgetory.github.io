for developers and this removed the
restriction on hardware needed to be
white listed for developers this became
a huge opportunity to allow users to
cast their local media to their TV there
are two applications that I'm covering
from the Play Store that lets you stream
your local content to your TV all casts
created by ClockworkMod and castaway
created by primetime coder let's put
these two applications head-to-head
we'll begin our quest of local media
casting with all casts all cast was
created by one of the most known Android
devs on the scene clockworkmod or better
known as Koosh this application has been
teased for several months now but it's
now ready to be used with chromecast
this application is simple connect to
your chromecast or any other DLNA device
and that you'll be taken to your gallery
the gallery starts to list at all then
it goes to photos and the last tab is
then videos there's also a section for
audio as well using the application is
pretty simple scroll to find your media
and then press on it then it plays on
your playback hardware like a chromecast
you control the media from the
application or the notification bar next
up is an application that has little
exposure as of right now it is cast away
by developer primetime coder this
application pretty much has all the same
functions as all casts connect to your
chromecast scroll through your list of
images or videos and then press on the
item you want to play this application
only supports the chromecast hardware
and only images and videos what I did
notice though is that this plays gifs as
well and it also used the Google
recommended holo interface this allows
you to slide between images and videos
fluidly the free version is ad supported
with full functionality and as a premium
version as well that removes the ads
now that it gave you an overview of the
applications let's talk about how they
work in the real world when opening all
casts it takes you to an option screen
to pick which device you want to stream
to a full list of all supported hardware
is in the Play Store once against your
gallery you'll notice they clean
interface that uses holo you can swipe
between the menus flip through your
gallery to see what you're looking for
there's also a side menu as well that
separates your audio from video having
the option to play audio is a treat
especially if you keep your music on
your SD card the application is in its
infant stages and thus sometimes it
crashes and other times just flat out
does not play I'm sure the dev will iron
these bugs out but the interface has
been updated as of late and the dev is
really working on to get these issues
resolved the dev actively updates this
application and it is getting better
with each revision if you want to stream
your media to a variety of different
hardware in a simple easy way this is
how to do it on the flip side cast away
only connects to chromecast it's taking
the approach and specializing in one
thing playing your content on your
chromecast it does photos and videos
that's it
but this is the easiest way of doing
this the holo interface makes it jump in
between videos and images quick and easy
in the videos play within a few seconds
there's a bit of sluggishness on larger
videos and after a few additional
seconds of buffering the videos play
with no issues being able to control the
application from your lockscreen
really gives it that true chromecast
feeling watch a video on your big screen
TV and quickly access the remote for
your mobile device lockscreen and that's
what chromecast is all about and it does
have the occasional hiccup where the
video just cannot be played but simply
closing the application and reopening it
has alleviated this issue for me
99% of the time this application was
published February 22nd and already it's
clean and it works really well but be
mindful that this application is going
to have some growing pains so the choice
is yours a jack-of-all-trades in all
casts or the master of one and
wait let me know what you choose down
below our guys my name is Kevin aka the
tech ninja you can find me on youtube
