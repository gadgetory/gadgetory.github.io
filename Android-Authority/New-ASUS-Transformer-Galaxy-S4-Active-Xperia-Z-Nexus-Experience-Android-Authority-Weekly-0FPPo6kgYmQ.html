authority what's going on everybody and
it's time for another dose of the week's
top Android news it's android authority
weekly we start with a ton of computex
news and asus asus asus quite literally
because at their keynote for this year's
computex at taipei they announced three
new products for the upcoming year we
start off with the new Transformer Pad
Infinity a Tegra 4 powered beast capable
of 2560 by 1600 resolution in its 10
inch screen you'll be able to extend
that resolution even further through the
ability to output a fork a signal
through the hdmi port on the device 4k
that's like way more than 1080p the
second device announced by asus is a
transformer with a little bit of an
identity crisis the transformer book
trio is a tablet capable of running
Android and Windows 8 I know right now
before you get too excited the dual
functionality is only available when you
have the tablet attached to the keyboard
dock this is because the bits inside the
tablet run Android and the bits inside
of the dock run Windows 8 pricing is not
available yet but I'm guessing as does
our community that it's going to be
around the same price as a notebook so
now you can get all fancy so will you be
using android or windows today so yes
the last announcement recovering from a
sous is of a new phone pad and now it
comes with the little friend the tablet
in the States and a huge phone
everywhere else is now getting a note
like stylist so now what you're getting
is a intel atom dual-core processor an 8
megapixel camera front facing speakers
and then of course that included stylist
more computex news comes out of Intel's
camp with their new murrayfield
processor we may start to see some
variety from the arms and the
snapdragons of the android world as
Intel's presence grows the next
iteration is a lower powered 22
nanometer processor with a focus on
battery life the previous processor
midfield was already pretty beastly so
we're gonna have to see what murrayfield
can bring us we don't yet know how many
cores the 2014 slated processor has but
come
you know us we got to have a lot of
course come on come on and now we get
into a lot of Samsung news if you
haven't been following the patent wars
and I know you're probably tired of it
just like me well Samsung did get a big
court win over Apple this week it was
ruled that Apple has violated a samsung
patent effectively causing a sales ban
on some apple products now before you
ask they aren't any current devices well
Apple has since vowed to appeal yeah big
surprise but what is interesting is that
Samsung is not making a peep about the
swim why well maybe Samsung is too big
of a company to boast about a small wind
like this true to form a debate sparked
out in our comments and you're welcome
to join in on the conversation here on
this video or at the written article at
android authority calm let's get back to
devices Samsung stayed in the news this
week with the announcement of a
variation to the galaxy s4 following the
trends of water resistance and does
proofing that we're seeing these days
the galaxy s4 active was announced and
it is a ip67 certified device that is
dustproof and can be submerged in up to
one meter of water for up to 30 minutes
apparently it's supposed to handle
anything from the most rugged mountain
trails to the roughest rivers which
means it's perfect for kids one of our
commenters made the good point that
though this is a ruggedized phone that
we're seeing now it's still a high-end
device very fair point it's not
something that we see every day rest
assured that we're going to get our
hands on at the moment it gets out in
the states which is going to be sometime
this summer and we're going to test it
out thoroughly yeah then we're going to
dunk it in water we're probably going to
drop it and then for the dust proofing
we're going to gather a bunch of dust
and then oh that's disgusting speaking
of the original Galaxy s4 it may not all
be sunshine and rainbows like some
people predicted Samsung's flagship
device may not achieve as high sales as
was previously anticipated as some
analysts report what resulted was a
massive sell-off by some investors now
we know that analysts can sometimes get
things wrong but what we do know is that
Samsung pulled back on their 30 million
unit projection for q3 and said it may
be 20 what we also know is that Samsung
sales in the States still remain very
high and our remaining pretty steady so
the reports are somewhat conflicting
have you gotten your s4 yet do you plan
to let us know in the comments below
okay let's move on to something a little
more cheery like the NSA peeping in on
your phone records in a court order
uncovered this week it was found that
the NSA wants every call every day of
verizon's telephony records all of them
no discrimination no specifics just all
of them of course customers of the phone
carrier in the US are naturally freaking
out rest assured that they are not
listening in on the calls they just want
to know who called who and when yeah
that's better also the data is just
about the call so no personal
information is going to be revealed okay
as to why only verizon and nobody else
well perhaps it has to do with the
carrier's reach and their scope as to
what will be done with the information
on the other hand maybe the NSA is
looking for anomalies after all the
court order was issued shortly after the
Boston Marathon bombings if you're a
customer of verizon or even if you're
not let us know what you think in the
comments below or at the written article
found at android authority calm and
finally we end on a piece of good news
for all of you sony fans out there after
first the samsung galaxy s4 and then the
HTC one it looks like the Sony Xperia Z
is going to be the next device to get
the nexus experience given some tips
from sources and then Sony's long time
commitment to AOSP this is very likely
to happen and in related news around
half of Sony Xperia Z users around the
world all collectively went damn and
then a final nugget of information
suggests that Motorola will indeed be
coming out with the Moto X only one
though as X doesn't seem to pertain to a
line of phones but rather one particular
device so the coming months look like
they're going to get pretty exciting all
right that'll about do it for this
