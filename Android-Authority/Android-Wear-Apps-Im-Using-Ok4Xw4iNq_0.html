since I got it at Google i/o and this
week Android wear was officially
released and if you want proof about
just how much I've been using the G
watch well check out this really cool
watch tan my full review of the LG G
watch is on its way probably to come
quite soon after this particular video
which I'm doing to show you some extra
ways of tweaking Android wear to really
fit your lifestyle and to really get
some of your tasks done the core
functionality is what the focus will be
of my LG G watch review and also the
Samsung gear live review so in this
video you can see some more creative
ways of how to use Android web so it's
Josh regard from Android Authority
what's going on everybody and these are
some extra ways of how to use Android
wear so before I get started you
probably know about a number of
different applications that are
available for Android wear if you have
one and you go into the application and
browse compatible apps you'll see a slew
of applications everything from lift
that will allow you to call cabs using
the watch to all the cooks so that you
can take a look at recipes step by step
in order for you to create nice dishes
there are also quite a few applications
that are not listed in that particular
area and unfortunately for some of us
who really are into Android wear we
either have to wait for our applications
to magically appear on the watch and
then we realize that they support
Android wear or you can do what I do
which is pretty much troll the internet
for all the information about upcoming
applications there are two particular
places that I go to that some of you may
be interested in all of your editors out
there the Android wear subreddit is
doing really well and people are putting
up news everyday about things that are
coming out now we're store basically
consolidates all of the applications
that either support Android wear or are
made specifically for them yes there are
applications that you can install on
your phone that just are standalone apps
that are put onto your watch and that is
kind of what I'm focusing on here in
this video so those are a couple of ways
for you to take a look at all the latest
that is coming out for Android wear and
whether you have the LGG watch or the
Samsung gear live you should be able to
use all of those and keep up with what
you can do on your wearable so if you
were to go to the dictation area but
also tap on there to be able to take a
look
at the menu you can go all the way down
to start and it will show all the
applications you have installed on the
watch itself and in this case I have one
called bunting and now essentially what
bunting is it's a application that
allows you to dictate tweets it's a very
easy way of tweeting out to your
accounts basically the application is
really simple all you have to do is just
log in to bunting to your Twitter
account and from there you're good to go
anything you dictate to this application
is going to go straight to your Twitter
accounts last night I put out a tweet
that just said optimize and right now
I'm going to go ahead and put out a
tweet just to show you how easy it is to
use the next moment is only a moment
away it takes a little while for it to
get through but once it's done you
should be able to go to my Twitter and
you'll see that particular quote on my
Twitter feed and that's bunting so just
to show you really quick another way of
getting to it is through the dictation
you just say start in any of the
applications that are installed on your
Android wear to start them start bunting
and there you go
easy way to get to your Twitter to be
able to share out to the world and now
the next one I'll show you is called
wearable widgets now this one was just
released it just got it's Android wear
support it's a application that allows
you to display as it probably says in
the name already widgets on any of your
smart phones or wearable technology and
in this case Android wear is the newest
in its additions wearable widgets does
have one functionality that I think is
really great though is the fact that it
keeps a persistent notification on your
phone so that will always show up here
on the watch now the reason why that's
really great is because one of the
limitations of Android wear is the fact
that when you open up an application
like let's say bunting like I just
showed you when you're done with it it
goes away that means you have to go back
to this menu or dictate the application
opening itself in order for you to get
back to it Android or rather wearable
wearable widgets on the other hand
allows you to have it open and then from
there be able to swipe away and the
notification will still be there so you
can always just click on it and you'll
go straight back to the widgets subtract
keep things a little bit simple it was
one of those functions that I really
needed was volume control and this was
the way for me to be able to get it
so that's wearable widgets now if you're
wondering if watch faces can be created
and downloaded on there of course they
can be I'm going to go ahead and just
show you one right now and it's called
the binary watch face this is one that a
developer did put together and it looks
really great a very clean looking binary
clock as you can see right here it will
be at the end of the list and you'll
have to go over all the way in order to
finally get to it and there it is the
binary watch face and there you go
there's one thing that I did notice
about all these custom watch faces
though it's that the actual cards that
might come up in the in the prone
position here where the where you're on
the watch face they can somewhat cover
the design so if you're good about your
notifications and you do swipe them all
away then you will get a clean looking
watch there but as you can see already
here it's covering up the bottom row of
those binary binary dots so it's a
little bit unseemly in that sense but
it's not that big of a deal something
that you just will have to take into
consideration talk hall at its core is
able to allow you to change certain
settings on the phone and yes volume is
one of them but I want to show you where
widgets as that example taco the main
function that it is able to do that at
least to me is the most useful is it's
able to initiate tasks or tasks now if
we head over to my task a real quick
basically all of these steps will allow
the phone not only to simulate the taps
that are needed in order to initiate my
playlist but also wake up the phone and
then put it back into a lock screen at
the end that's what the secure settings
areas are for now I will tell you that
in this particular example my phone is
rooted and that's the reason why I can
run shells like the input taps that are
there you root is required for you to be
able to do that but essentially what
this will allow me to do is be able to
initiate a playlist without me ever
having to touch the phone because I can
initiate it from tackle and easily head
down to taco which comes up as a card
because it is a persistent notification
as well swipe over to the right and
there it is my first action that I'll be
able to just tap and here we go so there
you go you saw how quickly that happened
I was able to get the music to play on
my phone it just woke up on its own I
simulated some taps on there using X Y
coordinates of the screen and there you
go the music started playing a Tasker is
one of the most powerful applications
for Android and I just got started using
it because of taco line every and I
after some tweaking I finally figured
out how to get the playlist to initiate
the way that I wanted it to via the
watch itself and that's by just pressing
a button in the taco area right there so
that's one of the other applications
that really shows that with a little bit
of time you should be able to get a lot
done on Android wear and with Tasker the
capabilities somewhat can be endless
open Flopsy droid start game here we go
does this look familiar well this is an
app this is a game rather that was set
up by a developer basically just looking
to recreate the game based on all of our
favorite little bird
and this is just this is all running on
my watch right now and if I really
wanted to just waste some time I could
just say open Flopsy droid or open it
from my apps area the start area and
here we go we have a whole game right
here that has just played via taps there
are a lot of apps in the Play Store that
are available that are not on that list
that you'll find in the official area
that the Android wear application brings
you to and these are just a few examples
of what are available from watch faces
to these particular applications Android
Authority will have its own coverage of
Android wear as applications come out
but like I told you there is an app in
the Play Store called wear store that
you can use in order to find the latest
applications as they come out as it is
getting updated on a regular basis so
yeah this is just a look at Android wear
some of the extra ways that can be used
and I think tasks current taco is one of
my favorite ones and of course there are
things like Flopsy droid which are
pretty interesting so keep it tuned to
android authority for my full review of
the LG G watch talking about the core
functionality in that particular sense
and also the Samsung gear live which I
just received today so an unboxing and
an initial setup and impressions will be
available for you keep it tuned to you
for all of that and even more and don't
forget about the content from my
colleagues in Android you know who they
are and after that keep it tuned here
