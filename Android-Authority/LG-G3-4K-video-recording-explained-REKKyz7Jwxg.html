brought to you by the LG g3 hey what is
going on guys lon here from Android
Authority and today we're we talking a
little bit about 4k and how you can
record 4k on your LG g3 so what is 4k
well 4k is a resolution also known as
Ultra High Definition the same way 1080p
is a resolution in the same way 720p is
a resolution and 4k isn't quite the
standard just yet but it's on its way to
being the standard so we're seeing a lot
of 4k TVs out there now and we're even
seeing cameras that are capable of
recording in 4k and we even have
smartphones now that can record in 4k
and the LG g3 is one of those
smartphones that is capable of doing
that but let's talk a little bit more
specifically about 4k and when it comes
to the actual resolution of 4k you're
looking at 3840 by 2160 there are some
other resolutions that fall under 4k
that actually classify as 4k but we're
just going to talk about 3840 by 2160 in
specific just because that's going to be
the one that you're going to see most
often and 4k it's got its name for a
couple of reasons
4k because it's four times the pixels of
1080p so comparatively speaking you're
looking at over 8 million pixels with 4k
compared to 1080p which has a little bit
over 2 million pixels so there's quite a
huge difference between the two a very
big disparity there and another reason
why it's also called bore Kay is because
if you take the number 38 40 and you
round it up the number that it would
round up to is 4,000 so hence the name
4k but that is where the name comes from
and that's sort of a little backstory on
what 4k is and with the with 4k you're
going to get a sharper image more
clarity and
a lot more detail and even though this
video is being rendered in 1080p I'll
still go ahead and show you a clip that
I shot with the LG g3 in 4k side-by-side
with the identical clip that I shot on
the g3 as well in 1080p so you can take
a look at these videos side by side even
though this video is in 1080p you can
still tell that there is a noticeable
difference between these two clips that
the 4k video just looks much cleaner
much sharper there's just a lot more
detail to be had pretty much a lot more
everything to be had overall and like I
said the LG g3 is capable of recording
in 4k obviously because I just showed
you this clip but how do you record in
4k with the LG g3
well let's go ahead and take a look so
first thing you're going to do is
obviously fire up your camera app on
your LG g3
and secondly you're going to open up
these settings and if you don't see the
Settings icon which is going to be in
the bottom right corner just tap on the
three dot menu on the upper left corner
and the Settings icon should appear it's
going to look like a little gear so go
ahead and tap on that icon and once you
tap on that there's going to be another
icon it says 13 megapixels if you tap on
that you will see an option that says
UHD which is 4k recording and you'll
also see it says 3840 by 2160 if you go
ahead and select that you will you are
now in 4k recording mode and all you
have left to do is hit the record button
and you are now recording 4k video on
your LG g3 and that is all it really
takes to record 4k video on the g3 and
even though the LG g3 isn't fully
capable of playing back 4k content the
quad HD display with a resolution of
2560 by 1440 is going to allow you to
enjoy that 4k content a little bit
better than you would on a smartphone
with a 1080p display or even a 720p
display but that is it for this video
