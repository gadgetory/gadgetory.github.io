I'll talk about two Android phones that
have been on many people's mouths these
days the Samsung Galaxy s3 GTI 9 300 and
the Bond phone the sony xperia TL t 30p
also known as the Sony Xperia T l LT 30
80 on atnt these are too cool phones
each one having a certain appeal watch
the rest of this review to find out
which one appeals to you most if you're
looking for a phone that is easy to
carry around you won't have any problem
with these phones they have nearly the
same size as in our pocketable but the
galaxy s3 is definitely taller for
thickness though I find the galaxy s3
slenderness more perceptible than the
Xperia T's these are predominantly
plastic phones yet they are not as
fragile as some people would have you
think in fact the Xperia T looks solid
and feels very solid the galaxy s3 2 is
a sturdy phone the front of each phone
is simple and uncluttered on the galaxy
s3 it's mostly black screen and dark
grey bezels with brushed metal design
plus accents provided by the phone
speaker grille Samsung logo and
elongated home button there are
capacitive buttons here on each side
you'll see them only when they light up
the touch panel is surrounded by a
blueish grey plastic frame the front of
the galaxy s3 has a businesslike air to
it on the Xperia T the front is all
black accented only by the silver Sony
and Xperia logos you see the bezels more
clearly if the screen is lit instead of
capacitive buttons the Xperia T uses
virtual on-screen buttons for navigation
the face of the Bond phone definitely
looks simpler and more minimalist than
the galaxy s3s the glass touch panel is
surrounded by a black plastic frame that
bevels towards the phone's edges which
gives the phone some sort of
three-dimensional feel the friend of the
Xperia T has a mysterious air to it a
blueish grey plastic frame makes up the
sides of the galaxy s3 and holds the
power button at the right side had phone
jack at the top volume rocker at the
left a microUSB port at the bottom the
sides of this phone are simple and
uncluttered and the buttons are very
accessible to the fingers in the case of
the Xperia T the sides of the phone are
made of the same material as the
back and it's one with the phone's back
panel the headphone jack is at the top
microUSB port at the left and just the
phone mic at the bottom the right side
of the phone is the busiest side you can
find here the compartment for micro SD
and micro SIM cards underneath this flap
and down here the power button volume
rocker and dedicated shutter button I'm
not quite fond of this position of these
buttons because I find them hard to
reach when holding the phone in portrait
but they're in perfect locations been
holding the phone in landscape just as
the friend of these two phones looked
lovely the backs of these phones are
lovelier on the galaxy s3 you get a dark
bluish grey polycarbonate backplate with
the same brushed metal design as the
phone sides and bezels this is a
removable back cover which I like very
much it's very thin and light but it
seems sturdy beside the micro SIM slot
there's a slot for a micro SD card for
up to 64 gigabytes the battery itself is
removable so I can replace this with a
new one if it reaches its lifespan on
the Xperia T is a soft touch rubber back
panel that doesn't attract fingerprints
as fast as the galaxy s3s glossy
backplate does it's a non removable
backplate but despite that I like the
way that it curves towards the middle
when I hold the phone I feel that it is
rusting or leaning securely against my
hand both phones have amazing high
definition displace but use different
screen technologies 4.8 inch HD Super
AMOLED screen on the galaxy s3 and 4.5
inch TFT capacitive touchscreen on the
Xperia T movies videos and games are
amazing on these two High Definition
displays especially with the Sony Mobile
BRAVIA Engine the Xperia T tends to
produce brighter colors than the galaxy
s3 the galaxy s3 on the other hand
produces more saturated colors but I
find them more realistic and truer to
life than expertise these stunning this
place make watching HD videos perfect on
both phones both can play 1080p videos
without choking or lagging aside from
playing videos excellently the galaxy s3
has the pop-up Play feature that allows
you to multitask while watching a video
this feature is not available on the
Xperia T 4 audio playback sound level
and quality are actually wonderful on
both phones there stock music players
have
simple interfaces and leave a lot of
room for flexibility in the form of
equalizer presets multiband equalizers
and sound filters and enhancements that
make listening to music simply
delightful two different processors
power these phones a dual-core processor
on the Xperia T and a quad-core
processor on the galaxy s3 in general
both phones run smoothly and fluidly
though I noticed some lag on the Xperia
T when launching apps and scrolling
between home screens the Samsung phone
uses the TouchWiz nature UX while the
Sony phone uses the time scape UI each
of these has a lot to offer to its
respective fans the galaxy s3 smooth
performance can be attributed to both
its quad-core processor and to Android
4.1 jelly beans project butter the
experience only Android 4.0 Ice Cream
Sandwich rich in itself isn't the laggy
version at all but why stay with an
older version when a newer and better
one is already around though sony has
promised Android 4.1 jelly bean for the
phone next year in terms of storage the
galaxy s3 simply outweighs the Xperia T
on the Samsung phone you can get a model
with inbuilt storage of up to 64
gigabytes plus up to 64 gigabytes more
of external storage experi has only a 16
gigabyte model but thankfully you can
add up to 32 gigabytes of microSD
storage bringing total storage to 48
gigabytes the Xperia T 13 megapixel
camera with Sony Exmor R sensor blows
the 8 megapixel shooter on the galaxy s3
aside from that the Xperia T also has a
dedicated shutter button the makes photo
or video capture truly one-click making
the phone double as a very thin digit
cam the cameras on both phones can shoot
1080p videos too but you can also shoot
at lower resolutions although their
cameras differ in megapixel sizes photo
quality of the galaxy s3 can easily
match that of the Xperia T given
adequate lighting the phone's cameras
are both fast and snappy too though in
our testing of the cameras and low-light
settings galaxy s3 photos turned out a
bit noisy and dark yet the experience he
produced crisp and clear images the
galaxy s3 bares the standard features of
the earlier jellybean camera app but
also includes
great additions from Samsung such as
burst shot best photo share sha
voice-activated and image
stabilization for videos providing power
to the Xperia T is an 1850 mAh lithium
ion battery for up to about seven hours
of talktime on 3G on the galaxy s3 is a
2100 mah lithium-ion battery with about
12 hours of talktime on 3G the galaxy s3
clearly provides longer battery life but
then again battery life will always
depend on your actual usage habits in
some I find that the galaxy s3 offers
more power and better performance than
the Xperia T it runs the penultimate
version of jelly bean on quad-core power
and gives you up to 128 gigabytes of
storage it has a responsive camera that
snaps great quality photos and videos
although with only 8 megapixels against
the Xperia T 13 megapixels the HD
displays on these two phones are also
wonderful though each one might appeal
to different viewing tastes and though I
personally favor the galaxy s3 over the
Xperia T you shouldn't easily dismiss
the Sony phone it's dedicated shutter
button awesome display and unique phone
design just my tide you over I've made
my choice but yours leave a comment and
