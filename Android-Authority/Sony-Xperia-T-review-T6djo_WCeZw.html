this is April from Android Authority
agent double-oh-seven better known as
James Bond is known for electronic
gadgets and technological wizardry and
when a device appears no matter how
briefly in one of the James Bond movies
that device is automatically associated
with notions of reliability toughness
and technological advancement such a
thing occurred with Sony's newest
Android phone the Sony Xperia T LT 30 P
and the Sony Xperia T l LT 30 80 both
phones are currently referred to as the
Bond phone is the Xperia T's Association
the double-oh-seven well-deserved sit
with me through this review and find out
Sony has always been known to break the
mold when it comes to its Android phone
designs the Xperia T is no exception it
is solidly built suave and smooth and
with hardly a sharp corner its size and
made our pocketable enough for Mr Bond
or Mr Bond wannabe it isn't exactly
feather-like but it's not rock heavy
either though it feels rock solid
it doesn't creak when you grip it
tightly with your fists the phone's
front is all black accented only by the
silver Sony and Xperia word marks the
front is clean and simple no hardware
buttons here just the notification light
sensor speaker grille front camera and
microphone the top and bottom edges of
the front beveled towards the top and
bottom sides where they meet the back
panel this phone has smooth corners and
doesn't have sharp edges the headphone
jack sits at the top and is highlighted
in silver only the microUSB port is on
the left side there's nothing at the
bottom side the phone's right side is
where things get a little busy the slots
for the micro SD and micro SIM cards are
underneath this flap right below this
compartment are the power buttons volume
rocker and camera shutter I'm uh stay
that these buttons are dangerously
situated in an area that can easily be
pressed by the base of my thumb also I
would need to bend my thumb further
downward to be able to access these
buttons I find it inconvenient and
uncomfortable especially with one-handed
use the phone's back is made of soft
touch rubber and contrasts nicely with
the industrial era of the phone's front
the material prevents fingerprints and
smudges this non removable back panel
curves downwards from the top and bottom
edges towards the center
I find this curve somewhat sexy and it
gives the phone and distinct Xperia this
bump though looks ugly and the
loudspeaker hole down here is a little
bit too deep it can easily accumulate
dust and dirt over time before point 55
inch TFT touchscreen brings a sharp
high-definition display at 1280 by 720
pixels resolution and density of 323 PPI
colors are vivid and true to life images
are sharp you'll see fine details when
zooming in on images though to me the
dark tones and videos appear grainy in
terms of processing power the Xperia T's
Hardware appears to be a little bit
behind especially in this age of
quad-core processing the Xperia T uses a
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 MSM 82-68 chipset
with a dual-core 1.5 gigahertz Qualcomm
Krait CPU and Adreno 2 to 5 GPU these
are complemented by one gigabyte of RAM
and 16 gigabytes of internal storage
microSD expansion is also supported up
to 32 gigabytes the Xperia T is also
PlayStation Certified yet the Xperia T
shows several signs of sluggishness
there's noticeable lag when swiping
between home screens navigating the app
drawer and loading high-resolution
photos browsing is generally smooth but
zooming in or out of a page takes about
a second or so while video playback and
games such as dead trigger don't freeze
or stutter dual core processing becomes
most perceptible when launching apps
which takes a few seconds to load as for
the camera I am quite happy about the
dedicated camera shutter button it's
quite a convenience for mobile shooter
books like me the 13 megapixel camera
captures great photos especially
outdoors or with adequate lighting
colors are vibrant without being overly
saturated this very same camera is
capable of 1080p full HD video capture
though I found the image stabilization
function somewhat disappointing
auto-focus also sometimes lets me down
worse the autofocus motor makes enough
noise that it can actually be caught on
video
or multimedia playback the Xperia T
comes with Sony Walkman app as the
default music player with
straightforward and intuitive controls
you can also enjoy a better sound with
clear bass a five band equalizer and X
loud the Xperia T can also play 1080p
full HD videos without gasping for
breath the phone comes with a non
removable lithium-ion battery pack with
capacity of 1850 mAh expected to power
the phone for about five hours of video
playback seven hours of talktime and 16
hours of music playback for an Android
phone associated with agent double-oh 7
I was expecting the Xperia T to at least
come with Android 4.1 jelly bean out of
the box alas I only got Android 4.0.4
Ice Cream Sandwich Sony reportedly plans
to upgraded to jelly bean sometime in
2013 Sony's Timescape user interface
gives the phone a distinctively Sony
look and feel if you've ever used a sony
Android phone before the experience will
not be too alien to you it's a very
attractive functional and user friendly
UI all in all the Sony Xperia T LT 30p
or Xperia T ll t-38 II is a great dual
core Android phone and may be suitable
for those who don't need too much
smartphone horsepower its overall design
is sleek smooth and suave although most
of its hardware buttons are located in
an uncomfortable position its build is
undoubtedly solid and its size is
comfortable enough for use on the go its
display is bright sharp vivid and simply
gorgeous but expect lag in navigation
and app launching it has a powerful 13
megapixel camera that can capture crisp
and vibrant photos although this camera
can be disappointing when shooting 1080p
full HD videos although overall the
Xperia T is a good phone I feel that
James Bond deserves something better and
something faster do you feel the same
way
