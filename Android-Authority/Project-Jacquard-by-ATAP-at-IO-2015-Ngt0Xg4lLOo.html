thority what's going on everybody and
behind me here at Google i/o 2015 I am
looking at eight tab now a temp is a
wing of Google's developmental strategy
that creates certain projects like
project tango that I showed you last
year where you had a tablet or you can
actually see using all of the sensors a
depth sensor as well you can actually
map out to the entire area of a place
you can see that video from last year
they have the same exact kind of demo
here which is a couple of more in use
case scenarios but this particular video
I wanted to show you a project jacquard
which is another example of what Google
is trying to do to move forward in the
world of tech to not only bring tech to
everybody but also to evolve it so that
it is accessible for everybody we saw
that with VR already and now we're
seeing that with a melding of tech and
fashion yes behind me at you're going to
be seeing in a number of Clips right now
we have little chips a sewn into actual
fabrics that should become ostensibly
tech clothing now clothing and clothing
and fashion and tech have always been
sort of melded together we have a lot of
clothes out there that already read
let's say biometrics and whatnot but
there's a different take on that
particular premise right here and it
involves input now you can already see
in this fabric already that there is
very visibly a a little chip that's
there but it's also woven into the
actual fabric itself that has to be
stitched or woven together in a very
particular kind of pattern and that is
the surface on which it will take all
the input there were a lot of examples
here and as they showed at the a tab
talk this morning they want to show a
bunch of different use case scenarios
not only using input for being able to
change let's say the music on your phone
but also there was a display here that
showed just how the algorithm shows your
touch is on the screen and you can see
that right now the Android angle on this
of course is the fact that you would be
able to use this input in order to
control your Android device and google
play music was the example that they had
of course on here but there are other
uses on it as well and if you put
bringing the IOT example there were
actually some bold
we're hanging from above the example and
by pressing and swiping a certain number
of ways on that little piece of fabric
that's woven in a certain fashion then
you would be able to change the color
dim the lights or even turn them off so
really the idea here is melding together
a piece of technology into a piece of
clothing so that it doesn't really take
away from the look of the clothing the
clothing will just remain the way that
it is but aside from just having sensors
for various types of purposes like let's
say knowing how many drinks you drink
one day is an example that I heard
earlier or knowing just how far you want
if you want to look at biometrics this
could be another way of using that's a
fashion and fashion so I fitness inside
of fashion using a little bit of tech
rather than having to wear something
like this polar monitor that I have
right here you could probably have it
already woven into your clothing and it
would not only be able to take your
biometrics but it would take some input
as well so kind of eliminating certain
pieces of accessories or fashion by
making the fashion we wear everyday in
the fashion we need to wear everyday
accessible in the tech world so this was
just a really nice example project to
cart you want to bring you a quick look
at it they already had the a tab talked
this morning but they had examples right
here at the a tab area so I wanted to
make sure to show you how cool it is in
an actual video nonetheless a type is
really working on some pretty awesome
stuff project your card is just one of
them project tango is way back there and
you will see probably a little bit more
from them and hopefully this kind of
stuff will be available soon they
already announced that one of the
partners that they're working with among
many others was Levi's so imagine having
some jeans that already have some input
on there so you don't even have to take
your phone now you can just pause your
music by tapping a small part on your
jeans I'd be pretty awesome but in any
case keep it tuned to android authority
