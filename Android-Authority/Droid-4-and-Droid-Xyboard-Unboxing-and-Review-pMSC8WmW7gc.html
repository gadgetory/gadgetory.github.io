and today we're going to be doing a
two-in-one review and unboxing we're
going to be reviewing the droids are
droid 4 and giving a little unboxing and
see what's inside of these two
magnificent boxes so it's a let's get
started now i'm going to start the
mission off of the droid xyboard this is
basically Motorola's new way to compete
with the new tablets out right now even
though this is competing against such
tablets as the transform Prime and the
new lenovo tablets it's it's pretty much
it's a it's a competitor I'm not going
to say it's one of the best right now
but it's definitely it's a cool tablet
let's get right into it it's um has this
over casing slides out of the box
presenter with this inside it's really
nothing new you got your manuals which
is basically it's in Spanish too okay
just start manuals and you're also
introduced with a charter here it's
actually an AC wall charger they're
really getting to the way of a seawall
turns with tablets now I like it because
it's more of efficient way to charge
your tablet they also give you a USB to
microUSB cable so that you're allowed to
you know done for computer use if you
don't want to use model casting and
stuff like that and then they include
this stylus pen and this is only a you
can I don't really want to take out the
packaging because I do have to send this
back but it does come with a triple a
battery see if we can focus in triple a
battery and it's a stylus pen and this
is only available in box for the droid
xyboard 10.1 not the 8.2
now
to motorola's new tablet their king of
all tablets right now so some main
features on this it features a texas
instruments omap 4430 processors if this
is the the same processor that you will
see in a droid razr and the droid for
which you will later see in this video
it also comes with one gigabyte of ddr2
ram memory and some major features are
it has a 5-megapixel front rear facing
camera and a 1.3 megapixel front facing
camera
to Honeycomb uh it's definitely gonna
County comb but always morale has to
have their little stupid flair to it and
I have my motorola look on the bottom I
really don't why is that needed why and
they just screw it up all of this really
looks like ice cream tangled a little
bit when you kind of yeah it's iffy now
I'm going to show you some of the apps
that are that are on the device got a
lot of bloatware amazon kindle which is
pretty useful to verizon apps really
isn't needed but you know it's verizon
like to add their own thing men NFL
which is removable I believe let's golf
to is removable as well and you've got
some social networking things the one
major thing is moto cast of course music
from your computer stream and Netflix
i'll show you netflix a lot of people
love netflix on their mobile device
we're waiting forever for this on an
android tablets and phones but we
finally got it malaysian toy story yes
Toy Story is a great kids movie it's
also cool this is the part when he's
trying if you haven't seen it I'm sorry
this is the part when he's trying to
save his friends and be in the garbage
truck all right yeah but anyway you can
see it's really clear it's it's pretty
cool the one thing on the netflix app
that was really laggy so let me show you
it's sometimes am i moving now you know
like it is that's not just a video
that's the I'm slag and I'll show you
web browsing whoa we'll go to android
authority calm there is the best new
site in the world right there for
Android
it slowed in the mobile site will make
it load the full site know people love
to see this is right on Wi-Fi by the way
this is not so but this is not 4g LTE
and you can see it loads it up not fully
loaded yet as quite a few topics and it
runs pretty smoothly i think the
rendering though is really laggy like if
we were to only god what's going on whoa
Oh see how slow that rendering is yeah
that's what I'm talking about right
there word of course the lag is a big
thing and yeah the software runs pretty
smoothly on this I really just think the
amount of bloatware is pretty
unbelievable
so we're going to round things up here
on the droid xyboard 10.1 it is
different from the 8.2 in the
eight-point tune is known as a media
model which I guess it's probably called
that because of its portability I really
don't see the differences the only major
differences are of course the screen
size and the battery this features a
7,000 milliamp hour battery which is
massive and of course the tablet so it
can it can fit that the 8.2 has like a
almost 4,000 milliamp hour i think this
tablet can get up to or 10 hours of web
browsing so of course android authority
for 10 hours straight it's a lot of
articles so it would take around 10
articles to read all the words and watch
the videos i think it could fulfill your
needs there is three models for this
right now there is a 16 gigabyte there's
a 32 gigabyte and is a 64 view bite the
16 gigabyte in turn this is we're
talking internal storage right now this
has no SD card expansion the 16 gigabyte
runs for 529 99 ok the 32 gigabyte runs
for sixty to ninety six hundred twenty
nine dollars and ninety-nine cents and
then the 64 gigabyte runs for seven
hundred and twenty nine dollars and
ninety-nine cents getting really hefty I
mean this is a tablet and you're almost
paying full costs for a phone at that
point when you think about it but yeah
the one thing the things I love about
this device is definitely the durability
of it it feels a strong tablet it
doesn't feel like it can bend in one
hand motion it look at this that's
rubber on the baths is more of a metal
type feel this is more of a rubber at
the top but anyway the durability is
great and I think that this tablet is
great for the average user and how does
this compare up to the the Asus
Transformer Prime you know that's that's
your take on it I do think this tablet
is cool because the accessories that you
can get on it there's the HD dock the
cases the wireless keyboard stuff like
that alright the protective portfolio is
one big accessory as well this is will
from android authority xyboard 10.1 only
here and next is the droid for review
and unboxing stay tuned
alright so we are now looking at the
droid for part of this review it's an
unboxing review of the motorola droid 4
we're at the bat you can see that is the
same styling box of the droid to android
3 a little flack right here that comes
right up um so this is what we've got
we've got a micro USB to USB adapter for
your computer we have the the AC adapter
so that plugs into the USB side which is
different from the xyboard remember we
showed you the AC adapter which is much
different this is cool you might be able
to see it right there see that it's a
little key that actually goes right in
that top hole right there two unreleased
this casing that accesses the SD card
now even though the battery is not
removable it's still like it shows it
but it's just not you know you don't
think it's just not removable but that's
where you access the SD card and then
finally on every single device is
manuals master your device you'll be
probably mastering your vice in this
review will boot up the device for you
here
has the same processor as it would on
the design board their razor it is a
texas instruments omap 4430 processor
one point two gigahertz dual-core it
also has one gig of ram it has an eight
megapixel camera with a 1.3 megapixel
front-facing camera
when you scroll in the device there is
definitely a significant lag you can see
it there and you can see really closely
let's try to get it even closer you can
see you like a black shade you see that
always wore as the voicemail so I'll go
back look at that voicemail see that
black shade that goes across that's a
big issue they should address that
that's this motorola plane around the
software's yeah that's the one big thing
that I found terrible on this phone
right when I open it up I kind of find
it disappointing um honestly this will
probably be able to upgrade Ice Cream
Sandwich we're not exactly sure yet but
it's most likely to upgrade and we're
going to go to the applications and see
what this thing has it's got you know
the Amazon Kindle just everything the
device set up a guided tour is some
social networking apps it's about the
Moto active all the bloatware on here I
think that they could have cut down the
verizon apps and that would relieve some
of its you know the duties of the phone
but it's pretty responsive except for
that that little lag and shaded black
when you scroll I'm going to demonstrate
some netflix for you guys we're going to
watch some top gear just for a few
seconds it's a it's pretty it's it's no
right quality i think the cyborg
definitely is a better quality when it
comes to the picture it's more HD this
is it's alright i guess i'll show you
pretty clear hi guys this is like a TV
show too
I was oh great so that demonstrate some
netflix for you now when i go to the web
browser note that i am using Wi-Fi and
not the verizon's 4g signal so we're
going to go to android authority com see
how fast this loads up alright now we're
going to load it it's just about there
of course it's still loading because
there's a few articles in the page but
it loads it up pretty quick the
scrolling is pretty decent on it there's
a bit of a lag and the rendering the
rendering actually isn't that bad it's
not as bad as it wasn't as I bored
xyboard is actually pretty lucky but
yeah the when you zoom in the pictures
are are pretty crisp the text you it's
definitely it's clear it's readable and
it's a nice device when it comes to web
browsing now i really never gotten to
the keyboard of the phone it's a 500
keyboard and each key is independent on
its own little platform i should say on
most keyboards they're they're usually
there's separate buttons but their own
like a layer that connects all of them
so let me turn the sensor off this is
lay that connects all of them so like
each key feels like it's on a keyboard
beats a lot of the keyboard phones are
right now talk time is up to 12.5 hours
and the battery is a 700 1785 milliamp
hour battery that's not bad for this
phone I think they could have done a
little better and seeing that we just
got introduced to the razr maxx which is
insanely good on battery life offers a
qHD display which is pretty easy to read
text always remember that this is
offering an SD card compatibility which
these I board doesn't have which we
reviewed earlier so this is basically
the droid 4 it's the motorolas new
keyboard phone backlit keyboard nice
display very tet responsive just update
this thing ice cream sandwich without
any lag of the transitions and we will
be all good this is he droid 4 and we
just did a droid xyboard review earlier
my name is will from the android a third
this is a two in one review of some of
the hottest Motorola devices on the
market thanks guys stay tuned for mobile
world congress at the end of februari
