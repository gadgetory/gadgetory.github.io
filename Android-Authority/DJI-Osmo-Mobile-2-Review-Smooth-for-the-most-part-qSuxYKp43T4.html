everybody and in this video we're going
to talk about a gimbal an update to a
gimbal that a lot of you out there might
be using already I'm of course talking
about this the DJI Osmo mobile 2 now the
original Osmo mobile is something that
you might be familiar with already and
it has been a viable tool for creatives
that use their smartphones primarily for
photo and video but the DJI Osmo mobile
2 comes with a few enhancements one of
those enhancements is the weight of the
gimbal it's now lighter than before and
that is achieved by removing the spare
battery compartment which used to be
down here but there is a trade-off here
as there is now eight quarter twenty
thread that allows you to mount this
gimbal onto any tripod there have been
other changes to the design mainly in
the controls once you have the phone
mounted in your using the DJI Go app all
of these controls can be used to trigger
the shutter or to move the gimbal around
however there was a trigger on the
original Osmo mobile that was used to
change the modes you could tap it in
order to change the mode or to lock the
horizon and you can double tap it to
reset the position of the phone that is
now a function that is on the front in a
face button that has a big M on it
there's a zoom slider on the left
opposite of micro USB charging ports
that we do wish was USB type-c but at
least it powers the big battery that's
inside that can go for up to 15 hours
now 15 hours is a lot of time that you
might end up using for something like a
live stream and one nice thing about
this gimbal is that it also doubles as a
power bank so if you're going to try
doing stuff like a live stream you would
be able to power your phone using the
built-in battery of the Osmo mobile - so
the design has been somewhat refined but
there is one huge addition to this that
might make this a very affordable gimbal
as we'll get into that later
incredibly useful for even more than
just creative smart phone photographers
and videographers and that is the
portrait mode right now I have the
gimbal in the usual position which is
where you would get a landscape
orientation but also this clamp is now
spring-loaded
which is a little bit of a pain to use
sometimes because you really have to
wedge your phone in there but once you
loosen this back portion you are able to
rotate this into a portrait orientation
which is huge but there is one problem
that I have with this portrait mode the
clamp only rotates in a certain fashion
so that you have to remove
the phone in order to change the
orientation and then of course when you
change the orientation you have to reset
your adjustments in order for it to be
balanced now I know what you're thinking
stabilization has gotten better on
smartphones over the last year or so so
why would you need a gimbal well there
is one place on the phone that doesn't
have that kind of stabilization and that
is right here on the front facing camera
using a gimbal like this just makes
things a lot smoother and you can get a
little bit more reach because there is a
handle so you can get the camera a
little bit farther away from you for a
better shot there are some things to
take into consideration though remember
when you're using a gimbal like this and
you want to have smooth movements not
necessarily fast or rapid because the
motors might not be able to keep up with
you and even then some of the phones
even though this gimbal is able to take
on bigger phones some of the phones
might be a bit top-heavy or just heavy
in general so if you have it in portrait
mode like this here's an example of what
might happen you go a little bit too far
in the access to the point where the
motor can't really keep up anymore
obviously the main function of a gimbal
like this is to just stabilize the phone
so that you can use whatever app you
want you can for example in the pixel to
just open up the camera app hit record
and then you have really stabilized
video but to get the best experience out
of them Bosma mobile - it's best to use
the DJI Go app now unfortunately this is
where I have to give you some of my
frustrations because I have been using a
beta version of the DJI Go app now
that's an important disclaimer to give
because the software could get better
and if I give DJI some credit the DJI Go
app is a lot better now than it was back
when the original Osmo mobile came out
but DJI does have a history of shoddy
Android development and if you've ever
used a DJI product with an Android phone
then you know what I'm talking about
there are times when the app will just
crash or it might not even connect to
the product that you're trying to use
and unless you're using the latest
Android phones you might have a give and
take situation here sometimes it's going
to work perfectly like it did with me
back at CES or it would be like
yesterday where the app pretty much
didn't work about 80% of my day now
again I was using an unreleased beta
version of the DJI Go app but if you go
to the app in the Play Store it already
has support for the Osmo mobile - so
what is beta is technically not beta
anymore and the reason why is because
this is going to be on sale at the Apple
Store exclusively for at least a short
period of time and then it will be open
to everybody
so when it works the app is actually the
best way of getting the most out of the
Osmo mobile - not only does it trigger
all of the different controls that you
can use but the app itself has a lot of
great features you have a couple of
features for photos including a an
automatic panorama mode that moves the
gimbal around in order to get a perfect
panorama shot and of course you have
manual control so you can change your
ISO your white balance and you can
change whatever you need to get the
perfect frame for video there are a
number of really creative and fun modes
that you can use like time lapses or you
can add in some motion by having the
gimbal move in a very smooth motion and
still have the aesthetic of a time-lapse
and then of course you have hyperlapse
which is when you would take the same
time lapse photos but you yourself are
moving so it makes a very stylistic
video there's a level of convenience
when you're using the controls down here
especially with the shutter button and
also being able to move the gimbal
around if you want smooth movements so
if you're able to get past the loading
screen of the DJI Go app then you might
be able to have one of the best
experiences with this gimbal the way it
was meant to be used but of course with
this portrait mode you're probably going
to end up using a gimbal like this more
often in places like I do stories open
up Instagram and go into the stories
area hit record and you have a
stabilized video that allows you to
really step up your social media game
what you're seeing right now we're a
bunch of clips that I used while we were
at CES and while we were in downtown
Vegas where I was able to get some
really awesome shots and really people
were asking what I was using in order to
get these awesome shots and in reality I
was using a smartphone a pixel - but it
just happened to be on the Osmo mobile -
so as with most products there is of
course a give and take with this and I
will admit that I was incredibly
frustrated with the app itself and
hopefully that is going to get better
over time however for now the DJI Osmo
mobile 2 is available as a straight
stabilizer and I think that a lot of
people will want to get this because in
the past it was a creative tool but now
it's something that pretty much anybody
can use especially if you're into social
media so with the price points it's
actually kind of a no-brainer for a lot
of people who want to have more
stabilized footage and that's because
the DJI Osmo mobile 2 comes in at 129
dollars that's an incredible price and
even with the kinks that still have to
be ironed out you could get a great
stabilizer that really gives you some
more ops
when it comes to your video content so
as always thank you guys very much for
watching and hope you enjoyed this
review of the DJI Osmo mobile - I still
really enjoy using this gimbal even if
it's just as a stabilizer at those times
when I can't get the app to open so like
I said hopefully the app will get better
and DJI has improved it over the last
couple of years since the original Osmo
mobile but for now this is a really
affordable gimbal that you can use to
make your social media videos that much
better like what you're seeing right now
