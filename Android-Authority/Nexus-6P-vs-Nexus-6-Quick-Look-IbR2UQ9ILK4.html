what's going on everybody and here we
are with a comparison of the two Nexus 6
devices the brand-new one being
announced today along with the Nexus 5x
we're taking a look of course at the
Nexus 6p now I do have my Nexus 6 over
here on my right hand and the first
thing I'm going to notice is a
substantial size decrease not
necessarily just in the size but also
the design itself lends itself to better
handling so we have a 5.7 inch screen on
both of these I'm in the case of both
devices we have quad HD displays but the
Nexus 6p is AMOLED and if I just unlock
the device right here you can see the
difference in the displays here just
taking a look at what we have underneath
the surface of course I have lollipop
here as the operating system on the
Nexus 6 and marshmallow is what we're
getting standard in the 6p heading down
to software we're just going to go ahead
and show that Easter egg roll quick
Android 6 Android 5 so there we are with
lollipop and marshmallow now what's
great is that a lot of the features from
the original Nexus 6 that we really
liked including the dual front-facing
speakers returning to 6p which is
awesome but this metal construction
really gives it a better feel the
plastic on the back along with that
curved on the backing that Motorola put
in the Nexus 6 reports you made this a
little bit unwieldy but now things are
just that little bit more rigid and a
little bit easier to really grip and the
metal allows it to have a heft that like
that makes it sit in the hand just a
little bit more securely and then we
also have the fingerprint reader on the
backing right here that will be used
with Nexus imprints and the ability to
wake and unlock the phone in under a
second we'll be able to it was really
nice to have on these two Nexus devices
as far as specifications go through
Snapdragon 805 is what powers the Nexus
6 and the Snapdragon 810 the latest in
qual comes line powers these 6p and of
course you're going to have the kind of
speed that you would expect from a Nexus
device the cameras are also updated in
the new Nexus devices the Nexus 6p has a
twelve point three megapixel at four by
3 ratio camera on the back but also has
VH
4k video recording there are going to be
some enhancements especially to the hdr+
capabilities of the camera app but we
also have a laser focus for both of the
new Nexus phones something that's the
Motorola version of the Nexus is not
able to boast but of course the other
main additions are inside of Android
lollipop Android marshmallow rather
updating from lollipop with a few very
key enhancements one of the ones that
I'll be able to show you just in this
video right now is the ability to use
now on tap now that we have a page open
you just have to hold down on the home
button and now on tab will come up
unfortunately the Wi-Fi is pretty spotty
at the moment so I won't really be able
to show you that but you can see the
original 6p video that I created with
our hands on showing the now on tap
capability right now but really those
are just the changes from the original
Nexus 6 to the 6p as far as battery life
is concerned we are looking at a larger
3450 unit in the 6p which should be able
to power the phone for quite a while
popping down to the bottom here you are
going to see the change in the charging
port the charging port on the bottom
being USB microUSB on the original Nexus
6 is now USB type C so that standard is
really going to be moving forward but
what's great is that the Nexus 6p is
also going to have fast charging in the
new USB type-c port which is always a
great addition to have the Nexus 6p will
start at 499 dollars and is available in
the Google store but we are told that is
going to be available across a number of
different manufacturing partners store
department stores and also carriers as
well so the Google store will be the
main place that you can get it but there
are going to be a few other avenues you
can get it as well so now it's just a
quick look at both of these particular
phones we are comparing the two new
Nexus devices with the originals and
you'll be able to see all of those here
at Android or decom because we are your
source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
