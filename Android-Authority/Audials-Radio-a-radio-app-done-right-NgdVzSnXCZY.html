handy the Android authority app guy and
in this video we're gonna check out
audios radio audios radio is actually a
pretty simple radio app it's catalog
contains over 90,000 radio stations from
dozens of countries around the world
included is talk radio music radio of a
ton of genres and all of your old
favorites from the AM and FM days when
you listen to radio stations it'll set
up a pre buffer and then it essentially
just streams whatever is playing on the
radio directly to your device you can
use this on just your device speakers or
connected to other speakers using the
headphone jack or Bluetooth to get a
really authentic radio experience audios
radio is very easy to use you simply
open the application to get started if
you want to although you do have the
option to create an account as well the
application works perfectly fine with or
without an account but it should be
noted that creating an account allows
you to use the sync feature between the
mobile and desktop versions of audios
radio once you're in the application all
you have to do is browse all the various
radio stations then pick the one you
want to listen to you can also search
for stations using keywords or station
call letters if you want you can even
add stations if the application doesn't
have your favorite one after that you'll
wait a few moments for the pre buffer
and then it'll start streaming the audio
it really is that simple and it only
takes a few moments to get in and listen
to the radio the peripheral features are
where things get really interesting
there's a feature called zap that takes
what you're listening to and then
suggests this radio stations that play
similar types of audio you just hit the
zap button and you'll be automatically
connected to another radio station that
plays more or less the same kind of
stuff you were just listening to and
that makes discovering new radio
stations really very simple it also
comes with an alarm clock and a sleep
timer both are very simple to set up
just set up a time in the alarm will go
off with whatever radio station that you
want do note that you'll have to
actually be on the station and listening
to it before you can set it as an alarm
the sleep timer is even more simple just
set a time limit and the app will keep
running until that time limit runs out
also included in this application is a
light and dark theme switcher an
equalizer so you can change the sound
based on the station very quickly and
the application is one of the few in
this space that come with both airplay
and chromecast supports the last feature
I want to mention is the record feature
using this you can actually record songs
you hear on the radio for playback later
this reminds me of when I was a kid and
I used to use the cassette tape recorder
on my stereo to make mixtapes from the
songs
I liked on the radio it's stored on your
device and you can rename it and move it
as you please these files are also
recognized by other music players audios
radio can also read your music in case
you want to listen to your own stuff for
a little while okay here's what we liked
about audios radio the interface seems a
bit cluttered at first but once you make
your way around it's actually very easy
to use you can move around quickly and
find stuff pretty easily every radio
station has a wealth of stuff that you
can do you can record any radio station
view similar radio stations use the Zap
feature and there's even a news tab that
shows the station's Twitter and Facebook
feed if it has one it has a fairly good
list of peripheral features the alarm
clock and sleep timers both work well
and they're easy to use we appreciated
the equalizer even if it's only a 5 band
as usual chromecast and airplay support
are always good features to have audios
radio actually works pretty well of
course I was testing it using a
rock-solid superfast internet connection
so that's to be expected
there weren't any hissing sounds or
dropouts although if you do experience
those the application has settings that
let you change how it works in order to
avoid that from happening
I actually really like that you can
access your own stored music and videos
the players aren't as powerful as a
dedicated music app or a video app but
it is nice if you have a song you want
to listen to really quick the Zap
feature is actually kind of fun to use
your radio station hits a commercial you
can quickly zap over to another one that
plays the same kind of stuff that isn't
playing a commercial some smaller stuff
is fun as well being able to add your
own radio stations it's useful if they
don't have your favorite one recording
songs on the radio worked well although
it is hard to get the start and finish
just right sometimes we also like the
themes and the opportunity to stream in
different bit rates on stations that
have that option and here's what we
didn't like so much a couple of the
things about the application can be
finicky sometimes logging in with
Facebook took a couple of tries and
adding a radio station took me a couple
of tries as well it only costs a few
extra seconds and it does inevitably
work but be prepared to try again a
couple of times the equalizer is there
and it does work but it is only a 5 band
which somewhat limits the changes that
you can make the design is really nice
and we like the tile set up on the front
page but we would have liked to have
seen a little bit more info on that
front page it looks great in landscape
mode but in portrait mode it looks a
little empty and there's a lot of stuff
that developers could have put their
overall audios radio is a very solid and
capable radio app it organizes its
content extremely well considering how
many radio stations it supports and it
makes it
simple to add more the peripheral
features like chromecast and airplay
support the alarm clock the sleep timer
the equalizer and the zap feature make
the application feel full-featured and
run it out without making it feel
bloated or heavy the issues are few and
far between and include mostly minor
nitpicks with regards to the design and
small issues with the features audios
radio is a truly solid radio experience
of one of the better ways to enjoyed AM
and FM radio in the digital age if you
want to give it a shot it's totally free
with no in-app purchases and you can get
to it by clicking the link in the video
description below and that about does it
