Hindy the android authority app guard in
this quick video we're going to take a
look at the best new Android apps and
games from February of 2015 new button
by IFTTT is a software button that
allows you to customize your Android
experience you set up a button with a
task to do something and that task gets
done every time you press the do button
fans of ifttt should definitely check
this out and it's a pretty nifty tool
for just about everyone draw slasher is
a hack and slash game where you use your
finger to draw your attacks this was
once a popular game on the PS Vita and
the Android release is a pretty decent
recreation it features a fast-paced game
plenty of swiping and ninjas there's
also no in-app purchases Square Enix has
released a new RPG called heaven strike
rivals this is a tactical RPG similar in
gameplay mechanics to Final Fantasy
Tactics the graphics are pretty decent
and it's free to play with plenty of
stuff to do beware though as the title
is suffering from some launch day issues
limbo is a monochrome horror game where
you play as a kid who is looking for his
lost sister the game has already
received praise for its interesting
graphics and creepy misty atmosphere at
its heart it's a 2d side-scrolling
platformer and puzzle game and it
doesn't have any in-app purchases
picturesque is a free lockscreen
application that came out of Microsoft's
garage project it grabs beautiful
wallpapers from being frequently to keep
things fresh and also shows things like
weather news notifications calendar
events and more they're still working
out some issues but overall it's pretty
solid screen pop lock screen messenger
is a picture sharing service similar to
snapchat and others the catch is instead
of opening an application that screen
pop puts the photos right on your lock
screen so you can view and respond
without ever unlocking your phone the
application is going through some
release date issues as well but it can
be fun for people who are into this kind
of stuff sling TV turned a lot of heads
in February by allowing people to get
some decent TV channels streamed over
the internet for only twenty dollars a
month the application is having a few
issues here and there but nothing too
serious it's a great deal for cord
cutters even if the channel lineup is a
little bit limited smart weather
wallpaper is a live wallpaper that
changes based on the weather so if it's
rainy you will have a rainy wallpaper it
also changes based on the seasons and
the time of day overall it's an
attractive option even though there are
some bugs that still need be worked out
sound hood is a customizable volume
panel where you can control things like
your system volume ringtone volume etc
and one of the few that doesn't require
root access to do so its claim to fame
as the ability to put lollipop devices
into actual silent mode which is
something that is tedious and confusing
to do without it it also has a few other
nifty and unique features the score
eSports app is a sports app that covers
predominantly eSports such as dota 2 and
other video games it represents a
monumental stripped in mainstream sports
coverage because this was the first
major sports media company to officially
cover eSports the app itself is actually
very good to YouTube kids was released
late in February and it's a YouTube
experience that caters to young minds
it's full of playlists that show kids
educational and entertaining content
that caters specifically to their age
range every parent in the world should
have this application without a shadow
of a doubt once again I'm Joe Hindy the
android authority app guy why are here
why not subscribe to the android
authority youtube channel if you're
hanging out for a minute we have a
couple of awesome videos for you to
watch right over there and they're also
linked in the video description below

all of these applications as always

wonderful day
