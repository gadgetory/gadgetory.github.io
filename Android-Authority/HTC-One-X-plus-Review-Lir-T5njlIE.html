companies take their already popular
devices and change them just a little
bit sometimes it might be for the better
sometimes it just might be for the
unique well HTC has done the same with
its 1 X and given it a plus but is it
really that much better than the
original 1x is it worth it to jump ship
if you've already owned the original 1x
well we're here to find out hey it's
Josh Berg r400 authority what's going on
everybody and this is the HTC One x+
from AT&amp;amp;T I think that's all of it the
HTC One x+ is the mid-year update to a
previously popular device with a faster
processor a lot more storage and a coat
of paint this newly updated phone hopes
to bring a little change that will help
it go the extra mile the original 1 X in
white was such a nice looking phone but
this time around
HTC went with the basically all-black
design and the plus at least for this
AT&amp;amp;T version the 4.7 inch Super LCD
Gorilla Glass display is surrounded with
a black border soft keys are on the
bottom and the front-facing camera and
speaker grille are on the top next to
the micro SIM tray coming around the
back the HTC n Beats Audio logos are
found between them eight megapixel
camera and the speaker grille at the
bottom the volume buttons are on the
right side directly opposite the
microUSB charging port in a previous
popular HTC phone the incredible the
charging port was lowered down on the
phone which made the grip tough when
plugged in having it higher up is a much
better choice the unibody material that
surrounds the screen and the rest of the
phone is made up of a matted
polycarbonate that helps in the
comfortable feel of the phone the way
comes in at around 135 grams but feels
very balanced and perfect in the hand
the only discomfort might come from the
power button found at the top near the
headphone jack users of non HTC phones
might be used to having it on the right
side next to your thumb so some hamm
gymnastics might be needed to
comfortably get to the power button and
then bring the HTC One x+ back down to a
neutral grip especially for people with
smaller hands other versions of the One
x+ have a red trim most noticeable
around the camera
but this 18 t version is all black the
phone nonetheless is a great looker and
even if it doesn't come in white it
still looks great this way coming around
to the screen the same 4.7 inch screen
from the original one X makes a return
capable of 1280 by 720 resolution this
is the very screen that received quite a
lot of praise and for good reason
watching content on here is truly a joy
as colors are rendered beautifully and
text is as sharp as ever the curved
Gorilla Glass allows for multiple
viewing angles and the brightness is
more than adequate even in broad
daylight which brings us to the hardware
in which there is already one big
improvement in storage coming from 16
and 32 gigabyte models before the 1x
plus comes stock with an incredible 64
gigabytes of free space alright it's
actually around 57 but that's still a
great number the lack of expandable
memory should be made up for with this
as I don't think anyone will really
complain about having over 50 gigabytes
of free space speaking of no expandable
memory the unibody of this phone means
that the battery is not removable or
replaceable either while there might be
a compromise in the storage Department
the larger battery here unfortunately
doesn't quite keep up with all of the
new digs it certainly holds up during a
day of typical moderate usage but my
battery drain of looping a playlist of
videos brought it down to half battery
in around three and a half hours
furthermore doing more intensive tasks
like playing the included Mass Effect
infiltrator brought down 10% of the
battery in just 15 minutes
it looks like the updated processor
brings with it all the speed and
performance you could want but requires
a little bit too much from the battery
but that processor definitely deserves a
mention an updated version of the
original NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor found
in the One X now brings in 1.7 gigahertz
over the previous 1.5 the result is a
very snappy experience that rivals some
of the best out there today the Tegra 3
processor and graphics combo might not
be the Snapdragon s4 pro but the
experience in practice is really nothing
to brush off so easily for example in n
+ 2 - benchmark it may not surpass the
Galaxy s3 or the top dogs of the LG
Nexus 4 or Optimus G but it is still
considered a top-tier phone and it
really should be as this is a locked
phone my t-mobile card obviously
wouldn't work in here but I was able to
borrow someone else's ATT Micro SIM for
quick testing purposes as such the 4G
LTE of of 18 T is indeed fast even if it
isn't as widespread as Verizon's
coverage other than that you have the
Wi-Fi GPS Bluetooth and in this case HTC
media link which uses a module plugged
into the HDMI port of your TV and then
wirelessly to your phone to act as a
bridge apparently you just swipe your
three fingers up and whatever is on your
phone appears on your screen on the TV
now I don't have this module but it's
very intriguing maybe sometime I'll find
a way to test it out and I'll let you
know how it works and now we get to a
pretty big part of this phones unique
identity HTC Sense now I had the HTC
incredible with Sense Froyo and while it
was a nice OS the jelly bean version
found in the 1x plus shows really how
far it's come
speed has a lot to do with this but
various aesthetic changes add to this
unique UI first of all HTC S should be
commended for getting out their version
of jellybean before most of the other
devices which still sports skinned
versions of Ice Cream Sandwich the
lockscreen retains the ring method which
has four unchangeable shortcuts right
above where you would swipe up I was
never a big fan of this unlock method
but thanks to the speed of this phone
it's just a quick swipe up and you're
done anyway in the settings it is
possible to change the overall
appearance of the lock screen and the
widgets that are displayed you can have
clocks social widgets or nothing at all
the general Android interface has a
decidedly black and white theme to it
that can be modified in the settings
actually quite like the different ways
that sense presents situation
that stock Android would use blue hues
for like when you get to the end of a
menu another nice and welcome setting is
the ability to change the behavior of
the recent apps soft key whereas in
stock Android menu buttons are purely
contextual it is possible to make the
recent apps button do its default
behavior one held down and then become a
menu button when simply tabbed or vice
versa speaking of the recent apps screen
these are all presented like a cover
flow which is also quite nice all in all
sense is a great UI that is unique and
easy to use in a way it and other UIs
deserve their own in-depth review to go
through all of their features but that's
for another day I do have to mention on
this thing though that I commend HTC for
getting jellybean even if it is 4.1 on
the One X but it does present an
interesting situation let's look at
Google now doesn't it look just like the
one found in stock Android this is also
the same for all other custom phone you
eyes and objectively it just doesn't fit
in with any of those skin interfaces
either it will stay this way or the
phone companies will have to find a way
to skin Google now - and now we get to
the Beats Audio a feature that got a lot
of attention with the original One X and
then was ultimately deemed not quite as
significant as the hype as far as I can
tell the Beats Audio and this updated
model is the one that should have gotten
more attention it should have gotten all
the attention because it really is that
good well there are no ways to tweak how
beats works which I still don't quite
understand the simple activation of the
audio enhancement really does make music
better highs and mids are given an
incredible boost in order to keep up
with the powerful bass and the bass
itself is made fuller and richer adding
more dimension it should be noted that a
good pair of headphones is more
important than anything else but I can
definitely say that Beats Audio does its
job
just like ones I used to know well truth
top and finally we have the camera
remember how in my lg optimus G review I
was excited to see improved optics on
all Android smartphones
well the already great camera of the
original One X makes a return here and
is a very impressive specimen I mean how
often do you get to hear the technical
aspects of the camera in your smartphone
this 28 millimeter F 2.0 lens has the
same specs as one of my dedicated camera
lenses that being said the quality of
the camera is really quite good and the
resulting 8 megapixel pictures have good
colors without much grain video is
available at full HD 1080p as well and
includes image stabilization or rare
thing for smartphones so it is
definitely possible to get some good
footage and pictures from this camera as
you can see here and in the footage at
the beginning of this video the
interface may not be as awesome as the
jelly bean 4.2 camera but it is still
easy to use and the options are overlays
on the viewfinder rather than separation
bars the front facing camera deserves a
mention too as it has been upgraded to
1.6 megapixels but that isn't the main
reason why pictures from this small
camera are surprisingly detailed and
crisp
another very rare thing for smartphones
this all should make hangouts and
self-portraits that much better and so
there you have it the HTC One x+ is
perhaps the full realization of what the
manufacturer and perhaps the consumers
wanted out of the very well received 1x
a faster processor does drain the
battery faster in those intensified
situations but then again the incredible
64 gigabytes of storage and Beats Audio
improvements lend much to this updated
devices appeal ultimately if you have
the 1x before or you still have it I
don't think there's too much here to
justify jumping over and paying the
upgrade price but if you have never
experienced the 1x like me or even a
high-end HTC phone this is probably the
best place to start for my full written
review head on over to Android Authority
