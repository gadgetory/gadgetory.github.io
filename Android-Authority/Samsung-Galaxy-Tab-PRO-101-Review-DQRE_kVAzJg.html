also brought with it a pretty stellar
tablet release in the Note 10.1 2014
edition moving into the pro territory
however meant updating the rest of the
tablets and in the case of the Tab pro
10.1 is it more than just a note 10.1
without the s-pen well let's take a look
because it's Josh regard manager I
thought oh what's going on everybody and
this is the Samsung Galaxy Tab pro 10.1
from the get-go you might think that you
already know what to expect from the
Galaxy Tab pro 10.1 after all the faux
leather that was started in the no pro
10.1 2014 edition returns here and
rounds out what is essentially the
standard Samsung affair when it comes to
pretty much all their devices the
buttons on the front come in the usual
trio though the Menu button has been
replaced by a recent apps button and as
is the case for many 10-inch tablets the
power button and volume rocker are found
up top one looking at portrait mode and
then you also have the dual speakers on
the sides that are predicated by a micro
SD card slot which is found on the right
side when you have this tablet in the
hand it does pretty much handle the way
you would expect the 10-inch tablet to
feel it is just a little bit bigger than
would allow for some easy typing but
also it provides a really great
experience when it comes to all of the
media especially because of this screen
using the thin profile and the flat
sides allow for an somewhat easy grip
but ultimately handling this tablet will
be just a little bit more of a chore
than it is a breeze or Samsung really
didn't want to compromise is with the
pro tablets screen resolution which all
come with 2560 by 1600 high resolution
goodness across the board and on a
10-inch tablet we may have already seen
this resolution with the Nexus 10 but it
works just as well here if not better
299 pixels per inch provide good
sharpness for all of the text you might
want to read on here and the colors
shine through as you would expect from a
Samsung display while we are more fans
of the sub 10-inch form factors there is
still much merit in having a 10-inch
screen tablet and the tab pro proves
exactly why providing a very fun
experience performance was also a non
compromising area as the non LTE version
we're working with here sports the XE
knows 5 octa with a 1.9 and 1
three gigahertz quad-core combo back to
my Molly T 628 graphics and as you would
expect the processing package gets the
job done even under the heavy load
called touch wits yes there are
instances of stutter here and there but
that is more touch whizzes issue than
the processors so nonetheless the
general performance and multitasking
capabilities of this tablet are not in
question as you can get whatever you
need done provided you've wrestled with
the software to get there in the first
place now this is not a comparison with
the note 10.1 obviously but we will say
that the lack of an S Pen is made up for
by what is otherwise a standard tablet
fare that has everything Samsung could
possibly add in thrown in the 16 or 32
gigabytes of on-board storage gets the
boost from the always welcome microSD
card slots if you really do need mobile
Internet connectivity there is an LTE
version of the Galaxy Tab 10.1 that
sports the Snapdragon 800 instead as its
processor the dual speakers are always a
welcome sight and on the Tab pro 10.1
they certainly get the job done allowing
for very loud volumes in order to easily
share your media with anyone around to
watch or listen extra Samsung
connectivity also makes a return in the
form of watch on this pretty robust
controller system that allows you to
manipulate things like televisions
basically consolidating your tablet and
TV viewing experience
and finally the battery was also a case
of no compromises as you get a huge 80
to 20 milliamp hour unit in here that
really powers this thing for days quite
literally as with the right usage you
should be able to get anywhere between
two and three days worth of usage and
with heavy usage you should still be
able to have some charge even when you
go to bed it's pretty much a given
nowadays that cameras on tablets are
considered rather secondary but that
doesn't mean Samsung isn't trying to put
its best foot forward what we get here
is an 8 megapixel shooter that is backed
by an app sporting quite a few features
including some of the very modes found
in the galaxy s and Note series devices
it's hardly a primary camera primarily
because you probably won't be taking
shots out in public with this tablet but
when you do need it in a pinch the
camera here can certainly get the job
done and finally we come to software now
if you followed our other pro tablet
reviews you would know by now that why
an enhanced version of TouchWiz does
bring some new things to the table
it's basically still touched with which
is perhaps its biggest flaw after all
the often bloated and otherwise pretty
cluttered motif of Samsung's UI gets the
addition of the magazine UX which was
once an exciting new addition only to be
bogged down by bugs used primarily as a
front end to Flipboard the second
screens don't provide more than just
glimpses into new sources and when you
actually want to dive in it takes you
through the layers of the app before you
can finally get to your destination not
to mention the hang-ups you might run
into when you're trying to customize the
experience are certainly very sad to see
outside of the magazine UX you still get
the same multitasking abilities with the
multi window which works as you would
expect from the Samsung device and for
anyone out there used to a more stock
like experience in Android the recent
apps button brings back a familiar form
of multitasking to the fray which turns
out to be very useful in the end all of
the magazine pages and even all of these
small aesthetic changes that were added
into this tablet don't really shake the
fact that you're still using TouchWiz
and in the end that's really the only
thing holding it back because while
TouchWiz is one of the most
full-featured software Suites out there
it is also not perfect at doing any one
of those things the Galaxy Tab pro 10.1
has just started going on sale for the
hefty price of $4.99 while you do get
quite a few extras in the installed
software suite and added vouchers for
various services the question for the
vast majority of users is if that price
justifies the core experience and the
answer to that question will depend on
how powerful you want your tablet
experience to be since the tablet
experience is heavily media based the
Tab pro provides everything you might
need to make that fun experience a
reality but you get what you pay for and
in the case of the high-resolution
screen and the powerful performance it's
just unfortunate that the software
experience is so inconsistent but you
might have already expected that from a
Samsung device and if you can get past
the high price tag you just might have
one of the best 10-inch tablets out
there today and so everybody thank you
