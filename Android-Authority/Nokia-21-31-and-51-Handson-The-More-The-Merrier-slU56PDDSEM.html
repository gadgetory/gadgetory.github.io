the Android smartphone market lately
with hmd releasing a ridiculous number
of devices over the last two years these
devices have largely delivered on the
Finnish company's promise of pure secure
and up-to-date and often with
well-crafted attractive designs and
appealing price points now we have three
more devices bearing the moniker the
nokia 2.1 3.1 and 5.1 as the name
suggests these are iterative updates
over their point two zero predecessors
bringing slight bumps and specs and
features whilst retaining the
entry-level price points and focus on
robust design and secure software all
these devices then will be coming with
Android one now or Android go in the
case of the nokia 2.1 and that means no
bloatware a stock experienced three
years of security patches and two years
of major updates it also means that all
these phones will be getting an update
to Android P down the line but it's not
all good news these devices all lack NFC
meaning they won't be able to support
contactless payments with Android pay
and they all come with a microUSB still
in 2018 even for lower end devices
that's something that could be upgraded
at this point still it's a great lineup
in many ways and hmd says it's keen to
demonstrate its ability to listen to
feedback and respond in an agile manner
so let's take a closer look and see if
they've succeeded first up then the
nokia 2.1 is running android Gale Oreo
as mentioned it still offers a 2-day
battery life as well thanks to a crazy
four thousand milliamp hour battery and
optimizations that ensure it will
consume 30 percent less current hmd
claims you'll be able to get an extra 12
hours of battery usage based on its
tests this seems like a smart move as
hopefully hmd can target not only those
in the market for a budget phone but
also they're looking for a secondary
device to take on trips and the like
otherwise it comes with a 5.5 inch HD
720p LCD display that's half an inch
bigger than the original nokia 2 and in
a very welcome design upgrade it also
comes with dual front-facing stereo
speakers
it looks nice too with a polycarbonate
body available in blue and copper gray
and silver or blue and silver
the nokia 2.1 should also bring a big
upgrade in terms of performance it's 50%
faster than its predecessor driven by a
Snapdragon 4 to 5 chipset with 1
gigabyte of RAM only has 8 gigabytes of
internal storage and only 4 point 7 5
gigabytes of that will be available to
the user fortunately this can be
upgraded to 128 gigabytes via expandable
storage it has 8 megapixel cameras on
both the front and back and all this
will be available for $115 from July
2018 it will be available first in
emerging markets next step up is the
Nokia 3.1 the formula Nokia 3 is
actually hating these biggest seller to
date so this is an important device for
the company this device will also be the
most affordable Android 1 phone when it
launches and claims to offer premium
flagship like design for less to that
end it boasts a body made of CC
aluminium with a dual diamond-cut at the
top and bottom and dual color
anodization just like we saw recently on
the nokia 7 plus it comes in blue and
gold black and silver or white with wine
red the screen is actually a little
smaller than the 2.1 of 5.2 inches but
otherwise a similar 18 by 9 720p LCD
display once again it's getting an
upgrade in terms of the performance the
nokia 3 will be 30% more powerful thanks
to a media tech 6 750 SOC and 2 to 3
gigabytes of RAM it comes with 16 to 32
gigabytes of expandable storage and an
improved 13 megapixel primary camera and
another 8 megapixel front-facing camera
this one will be available very soon in
June 439 euros in the base 2 and 16
gigabyte model or 169 year race for the
3 and 32 gigabyte variant and that
brings us finally to the Nokia 5.1 like
settle of Nokia's top-of-the-range
devices it's crafted from a single block
of 6000 grade aluminium so it should be
pretty tough it borrows the satin copper
from Nokia 8 but also comes in tempered
blue and black the IPS LCD display is
larger and higher resolution than the
original 5 at 5.5 inches and Full HD
plus or 443 PPI there's another 8
megapixel camera around the front with a
16 megapixel camera around the back it
also gets another performer
boost and is 40% more performance in
this case with its mediatek 675 5
chipset and 2 to 3 gigabytes of RAM
again once more also comes with either
16 or 32 gigabytes of expandable storage
and both the Nokia 3.1 and 5.1 will also
benefit from unlimited photo storage on
google photos
thanks to Android 1 this one will be
available from July 4 189 euros or 219
euros depending on the RAM and storage
configuration for those in the market
for solidly built affordable handsets
running pure versions of Android these
devices are wants to watch if there's
one thing that hmd has demonstrated so
far is that it's capable of crafting
attractive and solid devices even at
their lower end but of course we won't
know for sure how this line that pans
