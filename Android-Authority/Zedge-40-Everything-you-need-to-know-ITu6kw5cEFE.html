handy the Android authority app guy said
she's a very popular application used by
millions around the world to find
ringtones games and wallpapers they've
recently released a huge update to their
application and in this video we're
gonna take a closer look at it let's
start out by saying that even though the
app has been totally updated the base
functionality is still pretty much the
same so in this mini review we're going
to focus more on the changes than the
app itself that said the news edge is
beautiful in the old interface it was
functional but it wasn't much to look at
you selected a category from the main
screen and then you started scrolling
again it was functional but not overly
optimized or fun to look at in the new
interface the new design elements allows
edge to spread out its content and make
it easier to search and sort the pop out
menu from the Left lets you easily
switch to whatever content you need to
search and swiping between categories
lets you narrow your search faster and
easier this allows users to use edge in
ways that were unavailable in the prior
design aside from the easier navigation
the new design also puts an emphasis on
all of its content rather than just some
of it it's easier to stumble on the
gaming in live wallpaper sections
because it's easier to see what those
sections can offer the last thing we'll
talk about is the new recommendations
engine the app allows you to surf just
like you normally would but it will now
make better recommendations than it used
to at the end of the day this update is
just what the doctor ordered for xej its
stated design was functional but it was
time for a change it's worth noting that
the content itself is pretty much the
same as it used to be but with these new
features it'll be easier to surf more of
that content faster let's face it the
old design was not the way to serve
through a hundred thousand wallpapers if
you haven't tried it yet we recommend
you do it is a free app once again i'm
