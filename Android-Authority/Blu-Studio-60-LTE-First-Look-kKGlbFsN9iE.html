Mandarin authority and we are still here
at CES 2015 hanging out with blue taking
a look at their latest flagship this is
the studio 6.0 LTE and this is a fairly
large phone it has a six inch display on
the front so it is pretty big and if
that's the type of phone that you like
this is a phone that you're probably
gonna want to check out here so like I
said it is a fairly large phone but it
feels pretty good in the hand it has
some nice curves to it and overall it
just feels really solid but the six inch
screen on the front here comes in at
1080p resolution so it's pretty sharp it
has really nice looking colors viewing
angles are quite good as well so it's a
pretty good looking screen but just to
recap over some of the other specs here
you're looking at a Qualcomm Snapdragon
400 processor clocked at 1.6 gigahertz
and the camera on the back here is 13
megapixels as you can see right there
and there is a flash right next to it
and then on the front you're looking at
a 5 megapixel camera so it's pretty
pretty decent resolution for the front
you'll be able to take some pretty
nice-looking selfies I comes with 16
gigabytes of internal memory there is no
microSD card expansion but it does have
2 gigabytes of RAM so you should be able
to do anything that you want on this
phone fairly easily without too much of
a pickup and as far as the operating
system goes you can see right here it's
a pretty stock build of Android here
it's Android 4.4 Kit Kats so and since
its stock they're gonna get some really
great performance and you're getting
you're going to get a very clean
experience hopefully we'll see an
upgrade to kick an upgrade to lollipop
soon rather but as of right now you're
just looking at a very stock version of
Android it also supports LTE as well and
it should be compatible with GSM
carriers like t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T but this
has been a quick look of the studio 6.0
by blue it is available now for the
price of 275 you can find it on Amazon
but that's pretty much it we're still
hanging out here at CES 2015 this is the
last day we still have a little bit more
coverage to come so stay tuned for that
and is
keep it locked here on Android authority
because we are your source for all
things Android and CES 2015</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
