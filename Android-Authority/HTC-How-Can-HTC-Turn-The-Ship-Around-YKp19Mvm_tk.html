brought to you by domain.com so HTC has
delivered its quarterly reports and it
doesn't look pretty but the CFO did
promise that they have a new product and
a new category is that hopeful or just
double speak for we don't know what the
to do real briefly let's start with the
numbers the embattled Taiwanese company
announced that it is back in the red
with a net loss of 252 million us HTC
provided a couple of graphics that
illustrate how deep the quagmire is
consider that the Q 2 2015 was the first
full quarter of availability for the HTC
One m9 it was the time for the m9 to
show its mettle and really helped HTC
return to growth instead the device
actually held back HTC and the reality
is it's going to get worse before it
gets better if ever HTC CFO Chang
outlined the three areas that the
company will focus on over the next few
months in order to return to profit HTC
intense serious cost-saving measures
which could mean people losing their
jobs HTC said they will also try and
address premium segments but not
flagships HTC called this a premium
mid-range that sounds like more desire
phones and finally HTC hopes to
capitalize on new segments like VR where
it boasts it has a first mover advantage
but VR still uncharted water and we're
skeptical it will provide HTC the
deliverance that it needs I feel a
little bit like a broken record over the
past ten years there has been a
smartphone war and the reality is Apple
one it's over they pwned everyone else
that's not opinion that's just fact
before you guys freak out and say I
should be fired for saying something
positive about Apple on an android
authority show but it's the truth they
have ninety two percent of the markets
profit that doesn't mean ninety ninety
two percent of the market share don't
get me wrong it just means they make
gobs more money than any other
manufacturer Samsung is a distant second
an HTC and LG and sony and all those
other wonderful tech companies have a
sliver of the pie on the best days so
what is HTC supposed to do well suc CFO
said all the right things
said they were in a cut costs focus on
their profitable devices which are the
desired devices and he was going to come
up with a new product and a new product
category that's all the right things you
want to say to your shareholders
investors the question is can HTC
execute now for those of you been
watching for a long time you know I'm
really excited about new wearable
categories new categories of products
that take advantage of the internet of
things but what do you think what is a
new product category then HTC can blow
up they don't have to be first but they
do have to be first in the mind what
gadget or or solution or problem do you
think HTC could solve I'd be really
interested hear it in the comments below
yes I have been sending Oh t-shirts see
people actually get them and you have
about two more days to come up with a
domain name that has a dot-com that is
Android related and somehow makes me
laugh show us the power of a dot-com
please why because no domain name
extension tells your story with the same
level of trust as a.com or.net domain
name dot com and.net domain name
extensions and Jack credibility in to
your online presence and who doesn't
want more credibility you can say
fifteen percent on domain name and web
hosting is when you use our coupon code
android at domain.com check out don't
forget fifteen percent off when you use
our coupon code android when you think
domain names think domain.com alright
guys i have a sort something out earlier
in this week I did a best android
smartphone 2015 edition and a number of
people in the comments felt that the
tenth option the ZTE axon was mentioned
by me because it was a sponsored product
whoa anytime a service or product is
sponsored I will say this episode of
Android Q&amp;amp;A is brought to you by
domain.com that every time I would never
suggest a product or service that was
sponsored and not tell you that it was
sponsored that would be seriously
unethical and is never going to happen I
think people have a hard time believing
that ZTE could make a premium quality
phone and they hit it out of the park
with this phone hopefully they continue
to do so don't forget about my brothers
and sister and Android we're working
super hard to be
