or D and we're taking a quick look at
Samsung's newly announced Galaxy Note 7
versus the samsung galaxy s7 edge
they're surprisingly a lot of
similarities with these two devices but
there's a pretty significant amount of
differences as well that separate the
note 7 from the s7 edge first off the
designs are the typical Samsung design
that we've seen for the last couple of
years now both the note 7 and the s7
edge feature in all glass and metal
design with glass on the front and rear
panels and a metal frame with rounded
corners and tapered edges that make
these two phones feel extremely solid
and very comfortable to hold they're
also both crazy fingerprint magnets but
this isn't really all that surprising
anymore and it's just something you
should expect by now when dealing with
phones made predominantly of glass just
like the s7 edge the note 7 has a curved
edge front panel it's not quite as
drastic as the s7 edges but you can
definitely tell that it's there the
metal side rails are quite a bit thicker
on the note 7 so if you had problems
with a lot of accidental presses with
your palm or fingers on the s7 edge of
screen it doesn't look like it'll be
that much of an issue on the note 7 the
note 7 does have a slightly larger
screen at 5.7 inches versus the 5.5 of
the s7 edge but otherwise these two
displays are pretty much identical
they're quad HD and Super AMOLED so
they're extremely sharp bright saturated
contrast II and pretty much what we
usually expect from a Samsung screen
with the note 7 having a larger screen
is obviously going to be the larger
device out of the 2 but it still feels
extremely manageable in one hand and
it's actually a couple millimeters
narrower than last year's Note 5 even
though the screen size didn't change the
buttons and ports are all in the same
locations including the headphone jack
and single speaker on the bottom but
instead of going with microUSB like they
did with the s7 edge Samsung has finally
made the leap to USB type-c with the
node 7 the USB type-c port does offer
fast charging which is great for
charging the 3500 milliamp hour battery
B even though the note 7 is the bigger
phone the s7 edge is the one with a
slightly larger battery at 3600 milliamp
hours but I personally don't think it's
going to make that big of a difference
the rest of the hardware specs are where
you're going to find these two phones to
be very
very similar they're both packing
fingerprint sensors the Snapdragon 820
and same four gigabytes of RAM which I
suppose could be disappointing if you
were hoping for six on the note seven
but either way these are all top-notch
specs and with Vulcan supported games
being released with the launch of the
note 7 you'll be able to take advantage
of that right out of the box with the s7
and s7 edge Samsung brought back micro
SD card expansion and water and dust
resistance again and those features have
trickled down to the note 7 this
protects not only the phone but also the
s-pen which means if you really wanted
to you could write with the note 7
underwater the S Pen has also been
improved with a smaller tip that mimics
a ballpoint pen and more levels of
pressure sensitivity and all this means
is you're going to get a much more
accurate and precise writing experience
a few new features and enhancements have
been added to take advantage of this new
S Pen including the ability to translate
text or images by hovering magnifying
the screen and creating gifs the screen
off memo has also been improved giving
you the ability to scroll to write
longer memos and has also been
integrated into the always-on display
feature so you can see a note that you
wrote without having to unlock the
screen on a hardware level the cameras
are exactly the same there's a 12
megapixel camera on the rear and a 5
megapixel camera on the front and
considering how good the camera is on
the s7 I think it's pretty safe to
assume the picture quality is going to
be identical on the note 7 where things
have changed is in the camera software
it still has all the same functions and
features that we saw with the s7 edge
but it's been revamped with a slightly
new look and Samsung made it a lot
easier to navigate with one hand using
simple swipe gestures so you can swipe
to the left to get to the camera effects
to the right to access all the different
camera modes or swipe down to switch to
the front-facing camera sitting to the
left of that front-facing camera that
you won't find on any other Samsung
smart phone right now is the iris
scanner that uses infrared to scan your
eyes and it seems to work extremely well
especially for a first generation
feature and will give you an extra layer
of security on top of Samsung's already
pretty reliable fingerprint sensor with
the software you've got Android
marshmallow with TouchWiz on both and
for the most part it's a very similar
experience but on the note 7 Samsung has
cleaned things up a bit which you'll
notice in places like the notification
shade and the settings menu it feels
much more streamlined and it's nice
to see that Samsung is still continuing
to improve their interface to take
advantage that curved edge glass Samsung
has also ported the edge UX features
from the s7 edge to the note 7 so you
have all the same stuff like the apps
edge task edge people edge stocks sport
scores and news all available at the
swipe of a finger but what do you guys
think of the new note 7 is it just an s7
edge with an S Pen or does the note 7
offer enough to separate itself from
Samsung's other flagships let us know
down in the comments below and if you
enjoyed this video please give a thumbs
up there's definitely a lot more
coverage to come on the galaxy note 7
