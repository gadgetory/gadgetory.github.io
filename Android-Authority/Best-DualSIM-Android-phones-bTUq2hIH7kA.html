dual SIM card support well for one
reason you can have two phone numbers on
one phone when traveling you can also
have your regular plan on one SIM card
and then take advantage of the best
deals where you're travelling to on the
second SIM card
pretty cool when I do that the ladies
think I'm Jason Bourne
really really you couldn't just shut up
you had to go the first step is B 1 plus
5 the 1 plus 5 is the latest flagship
smartphone from oneplus sporting
top-of-the-line specs smooth and snappy
performance and a wonderful software
experience even better it's one of the
few phones out there that comes with
dual SIM by default meaning even the US
model can support two SIM cards the one
plus 5 is powered by a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 835 processor with up to 8
gigabytes of RAM other specs include 16
and 20 megapixel cameras and it's
running a much more refined version of
oxygen OS a top of android 7.1.1 nougat
the battery will also last all day long
on a single charge even though the
device is missing a couple of notable
features like ingress protection and
microSD card expansion we still think
the 1 plus 5 is worth the 479 dollar
price tag and next up is the LG G 6 and
certainly the most standout feature of
the G 6 is its 5.7 quad HD display with
its interesting aspect ratio of 18 9 and
rounded corners it also comes with a
Snapdragon 820 1 processor 4 gigabytes
of RAM a dual nano SIM card slot plenty
of on-board storage and an ip68 rating
for dust and water resistance and dual
13 megapixel rear cameras it's worth
noting that not all G sixes are created
equal though for example the g6 that's
coming to the u.s. is the only variant
that supports wireless charging while
the hi-fi quad DAC is exclusive to South
Korea and certain markets in Asia
what's more the g6 with 64 gigabytes of
storage is only available in a handful
of markets now of course this list has
to include the gallic
cs8 and si+ the good news is that there
is a dual-sim Android phone variant of
the galaxy s 8 the bad news though is
that it's not officially available in
the US or the UK meaning you'll have to
go the import route it should come as no
surprise that the Galaxy s8 NSA plus
feature top-of-the-line specs great
cameras an all new design that many
people love this time around
Samsung included a curved screen on both
the s8 and si plus as well as a unique
18:59 aspect ratio that allows for a
much more comfortable in hand feel the
company even ditched his famous physical
home button and included on-screen
navigation keys the new Samsung decks
dock lets you use your s8 as a desktop
computer and there's also the new gear
360 camera that allows you to shoot
video in 4k and livestream to YouTube of
course there's also the new Galaxy S a
compatible gear VR headset complete with
a controller for easier navigation next
up let's talk about the huawei mate
9 Huawei has done a great job and making
its way into the mainstream over the
past few years first with the Huawei p9
and now with the mate 9 with a big 5.9
inch display a powerful kuren 960
processor dual sim capabilities and an
impressive camera setup the mate 9 may
be one of the best big phones of the
year while this display is only 1080p
and its software is a bit audits
sometimes we still think the high price
tag is worth it if you're after a
smartphone that offers exceptional
battery life and incredible performance
this standard mate 9 delivers in spades
if money is no object and you want a
smartphone that's unattainable to most
customers the porsche design mate 9
might be worth your wild now if you like
that but you want something just a
little bit smaller look no further than
the Huawei p10 or P 10 plus the P 10 and
P 10 plus are the first devices to
launch with Huawei's new interface on
top of Android 7.0 nougat compared to
the mate 9 Huawei says the improved
interface brings some notable
performance improvements as well as a
smarter theming engine that will adapt
to the colour of your phone under the
hood these devices sport Sakura 960
processor 4 gigabytes of RAM
64 gigabytes of on-board storage and
microSD expansion plus both phones come
with dual 12 and 20 megapixel
rear-facing camera setups with optical
image stabilization both devices also
have Leisha branded 8 megapixel front
cameras I know I'll probably botched
that lekha
like I don't know why I said Leisha let
me know what it is in the comments below
but in any case you're also going to
have a hard time getting your hands on
one of these bad boys if you live in the
u.s. Huawei currently plans to bring the
P 10 line up to around 30 different
countries in March but the US isn't on
that list you can probably import from
another country if you'd like but be
prepared to pay a little extra if you're
gonna go that route and last up is the V
20 and as of last year it was basically
the phone for power users it has a big
quad HD display Qualcomm Snapdragon 820
processor plenty of RAM and onboard
storage dual 16 megapixel rear facing
cameras a removable whoa 32 hundred
million power battery of course the
unique 2nd screen makes a return this
year along with the addition of quad DAC
military standard durability and it's
also running Android 7.0 nougat if top
of the line specs and an impressive
feature set is what you're looking for
you really can't go wrong with the LG v
20 so what did you think of my list let
me know in the comments below or on
