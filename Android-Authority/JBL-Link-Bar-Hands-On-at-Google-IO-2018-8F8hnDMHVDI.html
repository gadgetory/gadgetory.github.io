Authority and today I'm checking out the
JBL link bar now essentially what this
is is it's like a Google home but it's
really made for Android TV so you can do
things like control YouTube controlled
Netflix just start playing any movies or
a different content that you have with
your Android TV now yeah the Google home
can already do this this is a sound bar
it kind of plays into the full
experience so you can just ask it to
play different music you can ask it to
play different content on your TV and it
will just build its built in directly
with Android TV so it's gonna be able to
do all those things now still just a
speaker - so you could just play music
whenever you want to but the cool thing
about it is they can actually recognize
what inputs that you have in your TV so
you can ask the sound bar to change
inputs if you want to switch between say
your Playstation your Xbox or just your
Android TV so you can watch Netflix so
it really has that better inner
communication between your TV and
December itself mesons is running google
assistant you can still control your
lights in your smart home anything else
that Google assistant can really control
whether you want to talk to your nest
you want to talk to your light system
you want to start music in the other
room you can still do that here it is
really just a centralized hub that works
best in a living room situation with a
big thing like a TV now because this is
JBL they also have the link 20 and the
link 10 all these different people
assistant speakers and this
and compare with them so that you can
play music altering your house there's
also an additional sub woofer that you
can buy if you want so that will just
help to get a little more bass fidelity
out of this thing if you really just
want to get the best music experience
possible we're gonna have a lot more
information on the website lots of specs
lots of pictures and this is going to be
available in fall of 2018 now they
haven't announced a price point yet but
we'll make sure to make that available
to you as soon as we know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
