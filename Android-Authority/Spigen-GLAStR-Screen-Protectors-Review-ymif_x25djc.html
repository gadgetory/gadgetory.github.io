name is Kevin the tech ninja and today
I'm here to answer a question for you
now a question that I see comes in a lot
is about the glass tr technology that
spigen uses on their screen protectors
people want to know what the big fuss is
about and do they warrant the price tag
at $30 it actually makes them the most
expensive screen protectors on the
market are they worth it let's find out
a quick disclaimer I am NOT the best
when it comes to installing screen
protectors so you will see a few bubbles
here and there if you are good at
installing screen protectors then you
won't have any bubbles with this
installation comparing these to some
cheaper screen protectors I've used I've
had a lot more bubbles in the cheaper
ones than this one and you'll see why
shortly
suspicions glass see our technology
allows for rounded edges and it makes it
lightweight but it's still three times
stronger than standard film protectors
the glass is chemically treated with
Auto phobic coating that prevents
fingerprints and other contaminants from
staying on the glass which makes them
not shatter if they break all the screen
protectors I'm reviewing come with the
same standard items microfiber cloth
squeegee disposable wipe instructions
and an authenticity card for its
warranty the first screen protector I
installed was the 9h model instead it's
made for extreme durability and a grippy
surface this elation went smooth and
it's what you'd expect from a flexible
glass surface you line up the cutouts
and apply pressure down and use the
included squeegee to press the air out
from the bubbles the screen protectors
cover the back in recent buttons and
also have cutouts for the speaker grille
camera and also the home button the
screen protector is a little bit thicker
than most screen protectors you'll ever
use but it actually makes installation
for me a little bit easier it doesn't
fold and peel in the corners over the
past few days I did a few tests on it to
see the durability I scratched my keys
on the screen with a little bit of force
and left no mark
the protector makes the screen feel
harder as well the screen feels smooth
and it's somewhat slick flicking swiping
all felt fluid and simple with it on the
screen protector is made for durability
but it's not as grippy as they said it
will be though now this screen protector
I was the most excited about this is
what spigen calls anti pink this screen
protector just like the first one I
covered is made from thin glass but
what's special about this one is that
when looking at it at an angle it
becomes dim the best way to install this
is to line up the cutouts with the home
button just like before use your thumb
or the squeegee and apply pressure to
the sides once you have it on there
press out any more air bubbles with your
thumb or anything that you have handy if
you do have additional bubbles you can
then peel it back and apply downward
pressure and just like before the screen
protector covers the front of the device
but it does have a cutout for the
necessary things like home buttons
speaker grille and camera the screen
protector has about the same thickness
and slickness and the anti scratch
qualities from the first one I covered
and it's almost flush with the home
button so that means you don't have a
noticeable chrome lip around my home
button and it may be an adjustment
period to really get a good feel for
things and as you can see from the video
the anti peek works as promised when
moving the phone at an angle it actually
goes completely dead yes it ruins your
viewing angles but still that's the
point of the screen protector and we're
looking at a head on it looks like a
normal phone with the screen protector
on the screen protector does make the
screen a little bit more dim but it's
actually not noticeable at all
now this third screen protector is a
thin one coming in at just two tenths of
a millimeter most Cree protectors at
this size are made out of a film-like
material but just like the previous two
this one is made from a thin layer of
glass now it's not as flexible as the
larger one so installation was a bit
tricky but I've pretty much followed the
same workflow as before that was just a
bit more careful and a few bubbles in it
but it was mainly from my lack of skill
than anything else wants to protect
yours on this thing is downright
invisible you quickly forget that it's
on and when using your phone like you
normally do the screen protector does
not get in its way at all I mean it
covers the whole front with the proper
cutouts and after having it off for a
few days I did notice it became a bit
slippery when using it and it attracted
more finger prints in the previous two
now I'm not really sure that that's
durable
as a thicker ones as well but it did
pass my key scratch test which is really
good to see now I do recommend this
great protector if you want to protect
it from normal wear and tear like key
scratches or anything like that now
lastly is the 0.23 millimeter rounded
flat natural fit screen protector this
protector is very similar to the
previous one but it's a tad bit thicker
and it still has the same qualities as
before the insulation was a bit easier
because I had more grip on it and it was
flexible
all the edges are tapered so it should
not pill from the edges over time and on
the phone it actually fits a bit harder
compared to the very thin one that I
just covered beyond the installation and
the thickness all the same qualities for
the previous frame protectors are on
this one and it really retains the same
great qualities that the screen of the
galaxy s5 already has it has a nice hard
finish to it has a nice smooth surface
and the colours pop well the screen
protector does not dim any of the
colours and actually no the screen
protectors do it actually is 100%
transparent now this screen protector is
honestly the most balanced between them
all it provides great durability and it
also is pretty thin which it mostly
stays out of your way now you may feel
it when sliding your finger over to the
home
but that's about it so the
million-dollar question is is it worth
it
well Tamiya is totally worth it because
I keep my phone in my pocket and I have
my key scratch against my screen all the
time you know you can't lose change in
your pocket or if you set your phone
down and someone steps on it or just you
know a piece of dirt or anything gets on
your screen it may cause a scratch with
a screen protector as you can see from
the video I did put my keys against it I
put a lot of force on it it didn't
scratch the screen at all and there's a
lot of demos online you can check out
where someone puts a knife to the screen
and does all sorts of crazy things to it
and these screen protectors are pretty
good even if it does crack it doesn't
shatter with shards go into your phone
into your face it actually has a smooth
crack to it too so it actually is a
really good screen protector they back
their stuff up with a warranty so you
can always send it back if you have an
issue with it and that's why I really
like the screen protector so I do find
paying around thirty five dollars for a
screen protector versus one of the
flimsy ones for six dollars on eBay is a
good investment to protect your $650
