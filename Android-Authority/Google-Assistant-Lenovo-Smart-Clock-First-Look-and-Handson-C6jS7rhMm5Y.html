Andrew authority now humor at CES I'm
outside one of the big hotels here and I
want to tell you about a new smart
device that I saw yesterday we just got
built-in Google assistant so if you want
to find out more please let me explain
no other things here about CES 2019 is
it could be lots of devices with
built-in AI maybe Google assistant maybe
a lexer maybe something else but the
point is is that AI is kind of reaching
out into everything now sometimes the
choice of putting in AI is a bit stupid
it's just like adding AI and maybe we'll
sell some more but sometimes you see AI
in a device you think now that is a
killer app and in this particular case
it's the Lenovo smart clock with
built-in Google assistant now why do I
think that's a killer app I have an
alarm clock next to my bed I've had an
alarm clock near my bed for like all of
my life it was it's AI awards a child
and it's there and we use it every
single day I use it to find out what
time it is I use it to find out what
time it is during the night I want an
alarm to go off and it's actually
something that I use all the time but
it's just lay it hidden
now imagine now if I could put Google
assistant into that so it can do things
like set alarms obviously but also it
can be part of my wake up routine it can
say turn off the light so rather than
having to have a light switch by my bed
or get out of bed to turn the light off
I have a smart light and I say to Google
switch off the light set an alarm I'm
going to sleep and it's all built-in now
I saw one of these devices yesterday and
I think that I know I've done a great
job in integrating Google Earth system
into an alarm clock now a couple of
things you need to know about this first
of all there's no camera so obviously
this is going to be inside the bedroom
they've not included a camera it does
have a display because of course it's a
clock and it's a touch screen display so
it means you can actually navigate
around the kind of a special user
interface they've got on there which is
specifically because an alarm clock
using you know swipes and taps like you
were on say a mobile phone the other
thing that's important to know is that
it does have a mute button and it's a
physical mute but it electrically closes
off the microphones not software it
physically disconnects it so they cannot
hear if you don't want it to and I was
also speaking to the Google engineer
it's important to know that when it's
looking out for that keyword you know
hey Google that's all done locally it's
not always sending everything you say up
to the cloud that recognition is done
locally but once you said hey Google of
course then you are connecting to the
whole of Google's infrastructure now a
couple of things to say about what this
can do and I lose it too early you can
set up kind of a program you can set a
schedule a list of tasks that you want
to do when you say goodnight when you
say I'm going to fade it will switch the
light off it might you know change your
nest the temperature in your house to be
something more comfortable for nighttime
and then when the alarm goes off it can
also do a morning kind of routine it can
give you the news headlines it can play
you some music and that's all built into
it so it becomes more than just an alarm
- of course it's a smart alarm clock and
on top of that the display is very very
intelligent so of course when it's in
the daytime you want a bright display
and even you know dumb smart clocks have
a kind of a little sell photocell that
when it gets dark of a display dims here
of course it's a clever display so it
will really will just cut down the
lighting it'll change the intensity
actually brings it right down to a nice
level and in the morning before the
alarm goes off it actually starts to
rise that display light ever so slightly
a few minutes before your alarm goes off
so that you kind of get a bit of more
light into the room and then when
finally the sound comes on the music
comes then actually you're half way kind
of tall really being woken up so this
device will be available in the spring
and the key thing of course is the price
how much you're going to pay for an
alarm clock but a very sophisticated
alarm quite and I think the price is
very good
$79.99 ok there you go my name is Gary
