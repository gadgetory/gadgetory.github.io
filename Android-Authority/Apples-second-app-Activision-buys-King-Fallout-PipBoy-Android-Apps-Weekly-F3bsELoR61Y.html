weekly show is brought to you by jump
enroll eyeball hello again ladies and
gentlemen I'm Joe Hindy the android
authority Afghan welcome back to android
apps weekly this is episode number 114
so let's get started Facebook has
mandated that many of their employees
must switch to using Android devices
over their iPhones the idea behind the
switch is so more of them understand
what the Android experience is like
here's hoping their batteries die as
quickly as ours do when using the
Facebook app and the application itself
gets some much-needed improvements Scott
games has announced that there will be
another five nights at Freddy's game
except for this one will be an RPG a
trailer has been put out but otherwise
not a lot of details are available right
now there's no timeframe on release yet
but there will be a free demo to play
eventually it'll be called five nights
at freddies world in a surprising move
Activision has purchased king developers
of candy crush saga for 5.9 billion
dollars we're not entirely sure why but
this gives Activision a gigantic mobile
presence that it did not previously have
for now everything's going to stay the
same but expect to see some stuff next
year as a result of this the latest
humble bundle is now live it currently
includes six games with a seventh coming
soon some of the games include wise
chronicle one block legends rocket robo
and a whole lot more you can pay one
dollar and get three games or pay the
average and get everything at once give
it a shot and don't forget to give to
charity last up this week Microsoft made
a lot of people angry with some unsavory
changes to their onedrive policies free
storage has been dropped to five
gigabytes as opposed to 15 gigabytes and
unlimited storage is gone entirely this
is due to people backing up their entire
pirated movie collections and it was
using way too much space for even more
Android apps and games news updates and
new releases don't forget to check out
this week's newsletter which is linked

that made a big splash this week as
usual if you want to check any of these
apps or games out we'll have those links
for you in the video description below
first up this week is custom quick
settings this is an application for
marshmallow users that allows you to
create custom tiles in your quick
settings menu one of the lesser
documented features of marshmallow
is the ability to do exactly this and
the developers put together this nifty
application to make it easier for
everyone it's free to download and it
does not require root a long time ago
dead efecto is one of the most popular
first-person shooters are Android and
now its successor has arrived on the
Google Play Store it's a sci-fi
post-apocalyptic shooter complete with
horrific beasts zombie Type monsters and
plenty of things for you to shoot and
kill the graphics are pretty good and
the mechanics seem to be solid for a
touchscreen shooter it's free to
download with in-app purchases but just
be careful of those early bugs oh boy
here we go again apple has released
their second application to the Google
Play Store and this one is called beats
pill plus it's a simple application that
can be used by android owners to control
their beats pill speakers like the last
Apple application it seems to work
pretty well and do its job but the
Android communities loudest members
wanted to let Apple have it yet again
for what it's worth the application is
free the long-awaited companion
application from Bethesda called fallout
pitboy has been released to the google
play store and a show of good
sportsmanship the company released the
application to everyone even if you
didn't pick up the optional armband the
application itself lets you interact
with your fallout 4 game and check out
stuff like stats inventory maps radio
and there are even some minigames it's
free and if you're getting fallout for
it you should definitely also get this
last and certainly not least this week
is signal this application gained quite
the following after Edward Snowden put
his official endorsement into the
application it's a messaging app with a
plethora of security and encryption
features to help keep prying eyes away
from your messages it's completely open
source which is good and includes group
chatting phone calls and more if you
want security give this one a shot this
week's episode of the android apps
weekly show is brought to you by jump

side-scrolling platformer where you play
as a giant I with legs your goal is to
maneuver obstacles and avoid danger in
order to complete the levels the
gameplay is simple to learn but
challenging to master and you'll be both
jumping and rolling a whole bunch
despite its simple look the game can be
quite difficult at times it also comes
with google play games leaderboard so
you can keep track of who has done it
the best it's a great little time waster
