Andrew authority now at the end of last
year Qualcomm unveiled the Snapdragon
855 and this year we're going to see
lots of flagship devices using the new
processor now when those devices come
out of course we're going to test the
performance characteristics including
running benchmarks like pen to two and
Geekbench and also speed tests G now
while I was at CES in Las Vegas I was
able to test a Snapdragon 855 device and
that was the core comp reference device
a device that cocon build that it can
show the capabilities of an 855
smartphone and also helped their
partners build smart phones as well and
I went to his benchmarking session and I
was able to run speed is G and antutu
and Geekbench so if you want to find out
what I discovered please let me explain
okay so first of all let's look at the
traditional benchmarks Geekbench and
hand - - and see what results I was able
to get from this core comp reference
device so starting off with Geekbench
the current leader for the single core
score is the X 9810 with a score of 3300
and the fastest snapdragon 845 has a
speed of around 2400 now when I perform
the testings I found that the Snapdragon
855 has a score of 3518 that's how
massive 46 percent higher than the
Snapdragon 845 when it comes to the
multi-core test the current leader was
the Snapdragon 845 with 8850 the closest
X and oswald's with 8500 and the score
that the eight five five match was 11190
again a massive 26 percent increase over
the Snapdragon 845 and when it comes to
n - to the current fastest device is the
huawei mate 20 with the score three
hundred and six thousand six hundred
eight and the fastest Snapdragon 845
phone is the Asus phone with a score of
two hundred ninety six thousand seven
hundred and twenty six I when I tested
this Snapdragon 855 using the Qualcomm
reference device it's called three
hundred and sixty thousand four hundred
and forty four seventeen percent faster
than the fastest Snapdragon 805
device
on the market today I've also got the
GFX bench scores and you'll find those
in the article that accompanies this
video on the Android Authority website
now I also had the chance to run speed
test G and so ladies I brought a note 9
with the Snapdragon 845 in it and I
pitted it against the Qualcomm reference
device ran it side by side now the
current best speed for speed test G is 1
minute and 45 seconds by the pixel 3 so
let's see how the Snapdragon 855 does in
speed is G ok so we got the Qualcomm
reference device on the left with the
Snapdragon 855 I've got the samsung
galaxy note 9 on the right hand side
with the Snapdragon 845 and already we
can see that the 855 is going into it
clearly now we are expecting a lot of
CPU improvements here in the 855 maybe
not so much in the GPU but this test
will tell us how it really is in the
real world and clearly still the 8 5 5
really both phones are now into the
bloom test so the 8:45 is doing a good
showing it's certainly not being
completely destroyed here however the 8
5 5 is clearly in the lead now into the
s : look at that on the note 9 it
clearly overtook there the reference
device in that SP I liked it now we've
seen that on other test runs where some
devices can just blast their way through
that SQL liked it and it has now taken
the lead over the eight five five of the
eight five five is now having to catch
up and will it be able to catch up from
that thing and it has it's now got back
into the lead it's taken over it's in
the 16th fret test so look at that that
one test really did make it fall back
there but it's dug deep it's been able
to carry on and now here we are it into
the unity test already this will really
test the GPU and now the note 9 is also
going into the unity test it's looking
very smooth on the left-hand side there
this does look like a good solid run by
the 855 the 8 4 5 is also doing well 6
Arduino 640 vs. the Adreno 630 let's see
which one is going to come out top of
course we expects me the one on the left
so I'm always blasting now through this
thing much much better than actually
then the 845 is doing coming down to
that final castle scene which can be
quite tricky but the 8 5 5 is handling
well it's into the compression test and
it's tearing its way through that
because that advanced CPU can it come to
an end any moment now and what do we got
one minute and thirty seven point nine
seconds so
remember the over all time best time is
1:45 let's see what the Galaxy Note 9
can do in this test there you go one
forty seven point eight so clearly a win
there by the reference device ten
seconds faster than the snapdragon 845
in the note nine and there you have it a
clear win there by the Qualcomm
reference device that makes it the
fastest device that's ever run a speed
test G and I'm sure this year when we
see the flagship devices coming out
they're going to be turning in even
better scores as we go through the year
