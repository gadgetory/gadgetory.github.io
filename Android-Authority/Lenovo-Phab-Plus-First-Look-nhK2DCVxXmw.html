Authority and we're here at Aoife in
Berlin taking a look at the Fab Plus
this is one of lenovo's latest mid-range
smartphones and it's a pretty big one
literally if you couldn't already tell
by the name it's a phone / tablet hybrid
and lenovo said their reasoning behind
this device is because many people don't
make phone calls anymore and most of
their smartphone usage is from media
like games and videos emails text
messaging and web browsing so they
designed the phone that sort of puts all
that stuff front and center and still
has the ability to make phone calls in
the off chance that you actually do call
someone it does feel pretty nice with an
all-metal body so it's got some great
build quality but there's no denying
that this is a big phone or a small
tablet depending on how you want to look
at it the display is a six point eight
inch screen with 1080p resolution and
although a higher resolution like quad
HD might have made a little bit more
sense here
it does look fine with the 1080p
resolution and it's got great color and
brightness so for videos and games and
pretty much anything else I don't think
you'll have too much of a problem with
this screen just to recap the rest of
the specs you're looking at a Snapdragon
615 two gigabytes of RAM and 32 gigs of
internal storage that can be expanded
via microSD for up to an additional 64
gigabytes the camera on the rear is a 13
megapixel camera and there's a 5
megapixel camera up front for all your
selfies and video chats inside there's a
3,500 milliamp hour battery which
honestly sounds kind of small for what
is basically a miniature tablet so I
kind of wished it was a little bit
bigger like four thousand or even five
thousand milliamp hours would have been
really nice so it's going to be
interesting to see what the battery life
is going to be like for the software
you're looking at android 5.1.1 and one
thing that you'll notice right off the
bat with the software experience is that
lenovo has gone with a more stock like
approach so there's a lot less bloatware
and lenovo customization in general but
they did actually build in some tweaks
to help out with the one-handed
experience if you draw a C on the screen
this will actually activate the one hand
mode that can expand to a couple of
different sizes and also reposition the
screen to anywhere that you want which
is going to be really useful on a device
as large as this there's also a floating
bubble that you can reposition anywhere
on the screen that gives you shortcuts
to general navigation and other common
functions that you'd normally use on a
daily basis like the camera Wi-Fi and
flashlight for quicker access the fab
plus is going to be retailing for $300
so it's actually not a bad deal for a
phone / tablet hybrid aka a phablet so
if that's what you're looking for the
fab + might be a pretty good choice to
go with but that's going to be it for
this quick hands-on look of the fab +
