take a peek around the corner and see
what new technology is headed our way
from an Android version of Windows
continuum to a pillow that yells at you
if you start snoring this is top
Kickstarter's of the month hello
everybody I'm Krista Laura and every
month we'd like to take a look at the
top Kickstarter projects and see how
they work see how much money they raised
and now this first project is pretty
interesting if you ever been forced to
play with the Windows Phone this may
seem familiar I'm just kidding when
those ones are okay Microsoft made an
accessory called continuum allowing your
Windows Phone to plug into a monitor
allowing your phone to transform into a
fully functional desktop setup but
there's only one huge palm with this elf
and that was well you have to have a
windows phone just kidding they're not
that bad but now us android users have
our own continuum called the Superbook
the Superbook is a device that
transforms your Android smartphone into
a laptop and what's crazy is that this
isn't a device that's a middleman
between your phone in your laptop the
Superbook is the laptop and this kind of
a shell of a laptop meaning you have the
display you have the trackpad and have
the keyboard but internally there's no
processing hardware that comes from your
phone by simply connecting it to the
laptop shell via USB and it's all things
to the end romia map made by the
creator's themselves and dro miam once
you plug the phone in the app launches
and mimics a desktop setup you have your
desktop wallpaper apps and icons thrown
on their folder management and even a
cursor and it's much easier to do things
like edit documents or write code on a
full keyboard trackpad and a large
display versus a small touch screen and
it's also a great way to keep everything
in sync between your phone and pretty
much your laptop you can connect to the
internet using your phone's Wi-Fi and
even data and you can even access is
Bluetooth capabilities as well but
what's really amazing is that the
Superbook would only cost $99 if it
reaches its kickstarter goal so that
means if you or a family member needs a
laptop to surf the web or edit documents
and they already have a phone there's no
need to buy a $300 plus laptop because
the Superbook cost a fraction of the
price and is less complicated with this
unified experience so did Andrew miam
get enough support to bring the
Superbook to the market well they were
aiming for a goal of 50 thousand dollars
and there's still 22 days to go so
anything is possible but for now well
yeah they received 1 million dollars so
it's coming the next kickstarter project
is the Zeke smart pillow the world's
most sophisticated pillow the pillow can
do it all it can stream music stops
snoring analyze your sleep and
intelligently wake you up we spend a
third of our lives in bed and as
depressing as it sounds it makes you
realize how important it is to make sure
we spend that time of our lives
comfortable and make sure we are wasting
it by getting quality sleep to start the
Zeke smart pillow can help you fall
asleep by actually streaming music from
your phone out of the speakers from
inside the pillow and since your ears
are actually going to be resting on the
pillow itself you'll be the only one
able to hear the music so you won't
disturb your bedmate once you're asleep
Zeke will monitor your sleep cycles by
tracking your movement determining when
you're in a deep sleep or light sleep
it'll vibrate to wake you up if you set
an alarm but it'll do this intelligently
waking up a few minutes before your
alarm if you happen to be in a light
sleep cycle also the Zeke can listen for
snoring and is very precise with this
measurement being to the decibel if she
catches you snoring it'll gently vibrate
to encourage a new sleeping position and
of course it's comfortable Warwick Bell
and Miguel Marrero were seeking a goal
of 50 thousand dollars and they still
have pretty much an entire month to go
but they were ready reached well past
their goal with two hundred and ten
thousand dollars pledged so that was a
world smartest pillow now how about the
world's smartest backpack called the TLS
connect you ever start packing for
vacation and start to get really
stressed trying to make sure you packed
everything and then you're at your
destination and it's time to go home and
once again you have to make sure you
have everything but it's vacation times
it's not time to be getting stress and
the same can be said for going to school
are going to work but with the TSL
connect back pack made by twist you will
know at all times what's in your
backpack or what's missing from it by
tracking it with a nap
yep this backpack knows what items are
inside it and it will alert you when
something is missing and this all things
to these little tracker stickers that
you put on your valuable items they
communicate with sensors in the backpack
thanks to radio frequency identification
which uses electromagnetic fields to
automatically identify and track objects
through a radio signature you can then
name each tracker depending on what item
it's on and that's it the backpack will
then monitor when each tracker is
removed and alert you when something is
missing you can travel back and forth
with peace of mind knowing your items
are safe without even opening your
backpack now twist the creators of TSL
connect we're seeking a pretty huge goal
of three hundred and seventy-five
thousand dollars and so far they've only
received 27,000 so they still got a long
way to go but there's still 32 days left
so they got plenty of time and remember
if you're interested in supporting any
of these projects you can find them in
the link below lastly we have a keyboard
where the keys change color depending on
the notifications you receive is called
das keyboard 5q is based around the idea
that instead of having tons of alerts
reminders and alarms popping up on your
phone or hidden and Calendar apps or
other websites you can keep track of
notifications by using the color of the
keys on the desk keyboard 5q a premium
feeling open API RGB mechanical keyboard
each key can be programmed to a sir
notification or alarm a reminder and
thus alert can be anything on the
Internet maybe emails from your boss at
work or maybe an ending ebay auction or
a new upload from android authority on
youtube you can link this alert to a key
or multiple keys on your keyboard and
then customize the color of it so let's
say you have a show starting in four
hours the key could be blue and over
time it'll slowly start turning purple
as the time approaches until the show
has started and you could start blinking
or really do whatever you want is up to
you to program it and it's supposed to
work with the subconscious so in your
peripheral vision you'll always know
just how far away an upcoming event is
you can track it without even thinking
about it you can do this for messages
from certain contacts or even fun things
like when a goal is scored at your
favorite sports team the possibilities
are endless this project is just about
over if only a few hours left to go and
desk keyboard has
eat five hundred and thirty one thousand
dollars of their $100,000 goal well
that'll do it for this installment of
top Kickstarter's of the month if you
