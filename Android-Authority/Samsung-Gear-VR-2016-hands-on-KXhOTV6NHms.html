Samsung has a brand new VR headset to
accompany it and why is that you ask
well that's because it now uses a USB
type-c port instead visually the new
gear VR headset is mainly differentiated
by its new all-black finish there's no
more white with this one which gives
this new paint job a more cohesive
finish we wouldn't go for I say that
it's the most intriguing or stylish
looking headset which it's not but there
are still a few noteworthy changes worth
mentioning the first centers around the
headsets padding that are a bit more
substantial and you can see the extra
cushioning outlining the headset in
addition to those on the straps they
feel comfortable for the most part but
it's not something we'd say has the
greatest impact that actually goes to
the headsets wider field of view which
jumps from 96 degrees with the previous
model to now 110 degrees it's really
tough to say if it's a significant
change seeing that we didn't have the
old one on hand to compare against
however we did in fact try out this new
skateboarding experience using the new
headset it's like one of those virtual
reality rides that Samsung has done
before like the VR rollercoaster but
with this I was basically standing on
top of the skateboard at put on the gear
VR and I'm basically seeing this ride
through the eyes of the skateboard rider
and you're going downhill very fast
trying to stay balanced of course now I
really did take notice of the wider 110
degree field of view with the VR headset
but I was more concerned about the
experience and to me it was pretty
immersive granted the visuals weren't
the sharpest but at least you got a
sense of being on that ride because of
the way the skateboarding skateboard was
articulating just as before placing the
phone into the headset is done by
removing the protective plastic cover in
the front it's less transparent and more
solid with its tone they say that it
helps to reduce ambient light from
interfering with the lenses and of
course it's connected via the new USB
type-c connection since there's an
adapter for it legacy devices up to the
galaxy s6 line will be supported by the
new headset other changes to be had to
include the touch sensor
panel on its side so now it's in the
shape of a cubicle so it's like a cube
square hybrid and basically it does
offer a better distinction when you use
it and there's now also a dedicated home
button to get you back to the Occulus
home screen it's unlikely to recommend
picking this up if you already have the
existing headset well that's unless you
plan on getting the note 7 and actively
planning on experiencing VR it slapped
with a $99 price tag so that's going to
be tough sell given that the core VR
experience is still unchanged here so if
