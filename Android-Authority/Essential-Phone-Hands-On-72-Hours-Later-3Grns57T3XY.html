new smartphone vision to life and we
have been able to use this latest
creation for the last few days a phone
with basically no branding high-end
specifications supposed future proofing
and a future full of possibilities a
phone that begs the question posed in
its own name what is truly essential
this is Joshua Vergara what's going on
everybody and this is our first look at
the essential phone
it's one of the most anticipated phones
of the year so it's interesting to see
that the device was such hype is
actually quite understated our time at
the playground where the phone was
conceived and developed wasn't full of
fanfare or grandiose presentations but
rather a deeper look into the philosophy
that birthed the essential phone and
after a number of demos showcasing the
phones various features we were greeted
with what will be the sales kiosks for
the essential phone eye catching to be
sure but definitely not all that in your
face and the device itself continues
this kind of projection the smartphone
comes in black and white glossy and
matted in texture respectively and none
of the devices have any sort of branding
on them despite the exclusive carrier
rights afforded to Sprint and with the
screen off first glances at the
essential show a slab of tech just
waiting to show you what it can do so
let's get straight to the marquee
feature powering up the phone makes it
clear off the bat that this phone is
incredibly different a 5.7 inch quad HD
display is sprawled out on as much of
the device as it possibly can be making
for a 19 by 10 aspect ratio and some of
the most minimal bezels we've ever seen
all that really breaks the immersion is
a 8 megapixel front-facing camera which
has been given its own space at the top
that Peaks out from the top of the
screen
but even that little bit of interruption
just adds to even more uniqueness and
the design of this phone the titanium
and ceramic combination seemed to be
holding up quite well I did go through a
couple of accidental spills very small
drops though with this phone especially
since the ceramic material tends to slip
about a little bit too easily but as
essential has touted the titanium body
holds up pretty well and definitely is
not dented or scratched in any way what
might be a little bit surprising is that
this 5.7 inch display is actually pretty
easy to handle in one hand and I think
that's due to the body more than
anything the flat sides make for a phone
that is easy to grip and the phone
manages to not that need to be too
narrow or too tall and you still get
quite a bit
Real Estate's the display has been
performing quite well and even in broad
daylight I've been able to see
everything with the brightness cranked
all the way up to maximum but there's a
little bit of trickery going on when it
comes to the UI and that notification
bar at the top of course it's trying to
bleed all the way to the top of the
device and a number of applications
actually try to take advantage of it for
example Gmail will actually change the
notification bar to a red color and that
shows in the essential phone's UI
however there are other applications
that don't take advantage of that API
just yet
they have to get updated in order to do
so and Facebook is our main example
right now
and when notifications come down they
tend to have a little bit more white
space above the actual text then you
might be used to with your more
conventional device by powering all of
this is the Snapdragon 835 with 4
gigabytes of RAM and one interesting
development was the move to 128
gigabytes of internal storage throughout
which is good because you can't use SD
cards now here's where the semantics
come into play
what exactly does essential mean well
you can argue that the word essential is
not being used in this particular
category because there's no headphone
jack instead an adapter for the USB C
port has to be used and you can argue
that not having a headphone jack is the
very opposite of essential as far as the
battery goes you get a capacity of 3040
milliamp hours which we will be testing
for a full review but you might not need
to use fast charging via the USB C cable
that comes with the phone as there are
going to be other ways of charging the
phone via the connector pins this is
where the essential ads in the
modularity that has been touting ever
since its inception
unfortunately the essential 360 modular
camera is a bit delayed but that is the
main accessory that essential has
available right now it's going to take
360 photo and video and be able to pass
through via those connector pins an
essential says that they will have
plenty more accessories where that came
from including a charging dock that will
use those connector pins in order to do
basically wireless charging but without
the 360 camera you still have the
built-in dual 13 megapixel cameras this
combination puts together an RGB and
monochrome sensor in order to get the
most detail out of the pictures and we
will admit taking mono photos is
actually pretty fun because there's a
lot of detail in these black-and-white
pictures the color pictures are still
coming out fairly well but we're going
to do our full
on all of those photos for our full
review which is important to say because
even at the time that I am putting
together this video there was an OTA
that went out that updated the camera
app which is fairly simplistic and is
missing a manual mode and the update
added HDR and finally we can talk about
the software which is actually a big
highlight of this phone so far with envy
Reubens named part of the essentials
being it should come as no surprise that
the company has put some real thought
into what the Android iteration would
look like simplicity minimalism and
honestly essentialism are all part of
the philosophy here so I was happy to
see one of the lightest versions of
Android ever representatives at
essential posited that aside from
androids intrinsic applications only
about a half dozen are further added on
top so you get a really lightweight
version of Android with only the
essential applications installed and the
result has been a very speedy and smooth
experience so if there's one essential
piece to the puzzle
the lightweight but totally functional
Android software basically nails it
ultimately the essential phone feels
like a phone trying to cater to too many
people at once all of whom have
different definitions of the word
essential essential could mean everyday
specifications and features that no one
can live without or these visions of
modularity easy to harness 360 media and
a screen that just won't quit
could become the essentials reaching for
both makes the essential a continuously
intriguing phone to use and over the
last few days I've had a good time with
what has been a pretty reliable phone so
far but we still have to test out what
the camera will truly be like and how
long the battery will last among other
things it is unassuming at first but
then bursts with capability so we will
see where the lines are drawn in our
testing of the essentials for our full
review keep it tuned to Android or
thority for even more on the essential
phone we might do some comparisons but
you can definitely stay tuned for our
full review so you can see if this is
the phone that you have been waiting for
there's definitely a lot of hype around
it so stay tuned to see more about the
essential phone at Android Authority
