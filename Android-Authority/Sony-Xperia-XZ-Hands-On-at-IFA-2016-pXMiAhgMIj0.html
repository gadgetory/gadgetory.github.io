authority what's going on everybody and
this is our first look at Sony's
brand-new Xperia the Xperia X Z now that
might be a bit of a mouthful to say
especially when you consider that
there's a lot of experience that came
out this year and the other one is the
Xperia compact2 the xperia x compact
rather that you have a full video from
the lawn so you can take a look at that
if you want more about the smaller
version that is plastic and not
water-resistant but until we get to that
part we're taking a look at the more
premium XZ essentially what you have
here is a design that is somewhat
different from what we are already used
to from the Xperia line even with the
previous phones that came out at Mobile
World Congress what we see here is an
exoskeleton that has a bunch of the
panels on all of the different sides of
the phone and you can see very closely
here that there are panels it's not a
unibody design and it also strays away
from the dual glass panels that we
remember from back when we had the
Xperia z2 z3 and whatnot that said the
phone does feel quite good in the hand
and it's pretty accessible with a 5.2
inch screen but it is a full HD display
you're not getting 2k or even the 4k
from the performance model that we had a
number of months back that said however
the screen looks pretty nice and it does
a good job of showing this Xperia U I
that is actually a little bit more stock
than we remember there's even Google now
over as the second home screen and when
you swipe all the way to the left but
that said it still has the look of a
general stock Android which Xperia U I
tend to have in the past but we do like
it's more sleek look and it also feels
pretty snappy with the Snapdragon 820 as
the processor on here anyway as far as
the other internals go you will get 32
gigabytes of on-board storage if you get
the single sim Edition or if you get the
dual sim edition of this phone you'll
get 64 gigabytes of on-board storage
with microSD card expansion always
available from there you have three
gigabytes of RAM which might sound a
little bit odd in the world of four
gigabytes and sometimes more but so far
the phone seems to be performing just
fine and the battery comes in at 2900
milliamp hours but is capable of
charging using Sony's own charges that
are included with the phone and of
course this phone is IP certified for
water and dust resistance the same that
you would get in pretty much any Xperia
e ven though this time around the
compact Edition does not have this
certification and like I said already
you can take a look at that video over
from lawn here at Android authority now
the camera package is probably the most
important part about this phone because
Sony is always trying to push the
boundaries especially considering that
they are one of the biggest
manufacturers of camera sensors for
smartphones it's great to see that the
Xperia line is always going to be
rocking them and as far as the specs go
the 23 megapixel camera on the rear is
also backed by triple sensing technology
for focusing it's basically a hybrid
autofocus that uses phase detection
laser and color contrast autofocus in
order to improve some of the lowlights
performance but the camera is also one
of the first ones to come with five axis
stabilization now if you are familiar
with any of Sony's bigger mirrorless
cameras like the a7 line then you'll
know what to expect with this it's just
on a much smaller scale now with that
stabilization there should be better
low-light performance and even better
video performance because it is optical
and not digital meaning that even if
you're jittering around with the camera
it should mean that there's more
stabilization here than with any other
smartphone now I did do a rather
rudimentary test of this and just
recorded the video that I recorded with
the Xperia XZ and so far it looks like
it does a pretty good job but of course
we're going to have to put this camera
properly through its paces with our full
testing after we get a full review unit
the front-facing camera also gets a huge
adjustment to 13 megapixels and it's
using one of the Exmor RS sensors which
means that it's picture quality should
be pretty awesome especially if the
processing is where it should be and
again that's going to be something that
we have to test when we get our review
unit especially considering that the
design has been changed even ever so
slightly enough to make it feel a little
more fresh the streamlining across the
board with that big camera enhancement
makes this phone still pretty exciting
to us and as far as the Xperia line goes
we do think that it's been in need of a
bit of a refresh
and if this is the one that's going to
give us some excitement about Sony
smartphone line that we can't wait to
get our hands on our review unit and
bring you our main thoughts in a full
review so keep it tuned to Android
Authority for even more about the sony
xperia x z don't forget to check out the
X compact from one in another video here
at Android authority and remember to
keep it tuned here because we are your
