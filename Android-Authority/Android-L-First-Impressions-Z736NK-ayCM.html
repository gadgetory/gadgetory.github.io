about the new version of Android coming
this fall while those rumors are true
with the newest iteration of Android
Android L the Developer Preview was
released one day after the initial
announcement although everything is not
fully functional we would take a glimpse
at the next version of Android the
number one enhancement that L brings is
something you actually can't see the
system is now running art art which
stands for Android runtime was brought
in as a developmental peace with KitKat
and if you recall a few months back we
showed you how much faster it actually
is and being consistent with our tests
everything so far is pretty snappy it's
designed to replace the dalvik virtual
engine and results in substantially
faster performance material design is
the new scheme that Android L will
display it's flat it's colorful and it's
flashy a lot of the features they
announced in regards to material design
are not ready yet but we can easily see
where it's heading when navigating to
your dialer your speed dial contacts are
laid out in a metro s grid when tapping
into recent or contexts you have a
subtle splash of color this splash
follows you around the OS all actions
have some sort of animation to them
this makes the OS feel more alive and
less static the on-screen buttons
received a much-needed facelift as well
sporting a triangle circle and a square
this is the first time since Android 4.0
that we've seen such a major change in
the UI Department keeping up with the
theme of cards the recent application
window has been replaced the new car
layout does not have all the bells and
whistles running at this time but what
you can expect is to see individual tabs
from Chrome to show up as separate
instances notifications has been
reworked in Android L on the lockscreen
the rectangle widget displays in a car
layout and these notifications are laid
out by priority and some notifications
don't even show in this view at all if
you pull it down the notification then
display all notifications from here you
can slide your finger up to unlock
or slide your finger down to access the
notifications wrap down and quick
settings transitions will now have more
fluidity with them as far as incoming
elements outgoing elements and also
shared element and this will give it a
clean and fluid feel within applications
and between applications
none of the updated Google Apps from the
keynote are present in this version so
we are stuck with the system UI but we
have a great idea where Google is headed
and the future is colorful as always
