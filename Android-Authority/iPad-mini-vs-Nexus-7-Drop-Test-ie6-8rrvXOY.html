gentlemen I'm here from Android
Authority and today we're gonna be
dropping an iPad Mini and a brand new
Nexus 7 two of the hottest upcoming
tablets this holiday season probably
gonna be on everybody's wish list and
we're gonna do what we do and we're
gonna be dropping them here on the bay
of Hong Kong to see which one's more
durable let's drop them so you probably
remember our iPhone 5 drop test it was
done here in the bay of Hong Kong
obviously we have the iPad Mini and the
Nexus 7 and we're not going to be
dropping our tablet you know from our
air because this isn't a phone where do
people use their tablets they're gonna
use them about yay high just like they'd
hold a book right which is around four
and a half feet so for the purposes of
this particular drop test we're gonna be
dropping them on their sides we're gonna
be dropping on the back we're gonna be
dropping them face down now let's see
which one fares better in our drop test
now it's time for the first part of our
drop test where we drop the iPad Mini on
its side ready okay let's check it out
okay just a little bit of minor
aesthetic damage to the exterior bezel
here the screen still intact fully
functioning yeah other than that we just
have a too small little dents here just
on the side nothing major all right
it's time to drop the Nexus 7 on the
side just like we did for the iPad Mini
here we go not good guys not good Oh
okay so we have some really significant
damage to the Nexus 7 it actually did a
shatter we have a you know obviously the
display cracked in minor regions here
and we already see some plastics coming
off a really significant dent to the
side so it's not looking really good for
the Nexus 7 in the first round and here
we are for the second part of our drop
test the iPad minis held up really well
so far the Nexus 7 not so much so we're
gonna be dropping it on its back right
now let's see how it fares
okay now didn't actually fall on this
back you know it was a really hard
impact to the side here and obviously
just like we saw with the s3 because of
the thin bezel it just has a really in
fracture the whole display itself too
smashed is it still working oh yeah
after this play still working so that's
good but obviously really a lot of
significant cracks to the display really
really to bad or not alright so here we
are with the Nexus 7 it's the second
part of the drop test for it
the iPad Mini just smashed and shattered
up back there let's see how the Nexus 7
does on a rear drop test mmm okay guys
some really bad fracturing here the
plastics completely chipped off the side
of the display the back itself has
popped out a little bit yeah it's it's
not looking so hard for the Nexus 7
right now and let's just see if it works
okay this plate comes on am i able to
unlock it okay I'm unable to actually
use the touch screen anymore on the
Nexus 7 it's really unfortunate but it
oh it appears as though it's a
completely stopped functioning for the
display it does still power up but I'm
unable to use it so the Nexus 7 didn't
fare very well for that particular drop
test at all so here we are the third and
final part for our drop test for the
iPad Mini it shows us that no tablet is
impervious to destruction so we're going
to be dropping on its face down now just
for the PS the resistance let's see how
it fares
ready okay it's funny you know it didn't
actually drop on its face down it's
really hard to control that but as we
can see obviously it is still factored
the whole display itself but unlike the
Nexus 7 the iPad actually does serve
does still appear to be working no
actual scratches are damaging to the
rear but the display is completely
fractured and some plastic is actually
coming off on the side here so it's the
final time for the drop test for the
Nexus 7 we dropped all the iPad Mini and
everything like that so we're gonna be
dropping on its face now from about four
and a half feet high
obviously the displays already cracked
but let's see how it does anyway Nexus 7
face down drop test I'm ready
ready okay mmm I'm so sorry baby
and your jellybeans goodness alright so
as we can see obviously the display is
completely fractured there are elements
you know glass coming into my hands and
stuff yeah as we found out last time it
is no longer functioning the back
actually popped off on the rear
sadly the the Nexus 7 tablet the display
doesn't work anymore and it appears to
have sustained more damage than the iPad
Mini so guys don't drop your Nexus 7
like I did three times so we did it
again for you we came to Hong Kong we
got a brand new iPad Mini we got a brand
new Nexus 7 we dropped him in three
different ways
now although both are completely
destroyed and despite the fact that the
iPad Mini actually has a thinner bezel
the display is still working whereas the
Nexus 7 is completely non-responsive and
therefore it can't be used at all so
we'll let you be the judge which one do
you think held up better in the drop
test let us know what you think of our
videos let us know how we can make our
drop test better and don't forget to
subscribe to our Channel - it's dark
still Akuma here with Android thority

the iPad Mini vs. the Nexus 7 live from
Hong Kong diam</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
