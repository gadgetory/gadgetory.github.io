Hindy the android authority app guy
pocket is an application that lets you
saved things to your device for later
viewing in this review we're going to
take a look at pocket version 5 which
was just released by developers and
includes a whole lot of new features and
we're gonna check them out pocket has
been out for a while now and most people
already know what it does so we're just
going to focus on the new features the
biggest new improvement is a feature
called highlights highlights is a
function that will help you mow through
your unread content and bring the stuff
that may interest you the most to the
top of the list this is actually
extremely handy highlights will look at
what you consume the most and use those
stats to put items you may like the most
toward the top its source them by long
reads which are 1,500 words or more
short reads which are 300 words or less
the best items and items that are
directly related to what you read about
most often other improvements include a
revamped interface that looks clean and
helps you move around the app with more
ease also included is the new bulk edit
feature which lets you archive delete or
retag multiple items at once so how can
you use this well with pocket it's
always been really easy to grab stuff on
the internet and put it in your pocket
for quick reference later with this
mammoth update it allows you to engage
in more of that content with less effort
if you're one of the many that are
really behind the new features will help
you consume and organize your content in
a way that will help you actually get
through all of it so here's what we
liked the new interface is clean and
organized it's easy to move around the
interface and getting into various
categories this is a dramatic
improvement from the old interface
highlights is awesome it may take a
minute to get your personal reading
habits down but once it does it will
organize your articles and videos for
you so you can consume what you want
when you want bulk edits help you clean
up and organize things much faster this
may not be so helpful to people who are
always up to date but people who have
hundreds of articles backed up which is
about fifty percent of pocket users
according to pocket will love this in
terms of what we didn't like it was
tough to do because there wasn't
anything overly wrong with this
application fans of the channel know
that I don't get to say that very often
that said there were a few very small
things in the interface that were just a
little bit off in the articles view you
can't swipe between the my list and
archive tabs on larger phones or tablets
this means reaching up to tap the tabs
manually also the fonts and dark mode
could use a little bit of a touch-up the
dark gray text and the archive in my
list
text are only a couple of shades darker
than the theme itself and that makes it
a little hard to read nitpicks aside the
new pocket is everything you could
possibly ask it to be the new interface
makes it so much easier to move through
the app and to get to the content that
you want the highlights feature does a
great job of sorting through all of your
stuff to find the content that you wish
to have right then and there there is
virtually nothing wrong with this
application and we really like that if
you haven't yet we highly recommend you
try the new pocket once again I'm Joe
