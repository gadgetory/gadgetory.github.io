johanna the android authority app guy
final fantasy 6 was released today and
it's known as one of the best RPGs of
all time did square-enix do the port
justice and is it worth that $16 price
tag in this review we're going to find
out if you've never played Final Fantasy
6 before it's about a girl named Terra
who can cast magic in a world where no
one can cast magic she's liberated from
the enemy early on and asked to fight
against them with a resistance group
called the returners as you play things
get complicated you pick up about a
dozen playable allies and end up going
after the empire and kefka head-on which
carries you through most of the rest of
the game the game itself is pretty much
like every other Final Fantasy title on
Android to date with a few minor changes
here and there you walk around on world
maps and towns fly around on air ships
fight bad guys and use chocobos to move
from place to place while you watch the
storyline progress if you've played an
earlier Final Fantasy title before or
any JRPG for that matter you pretty much
know how all of this works one of the
biggest perks about Final Fantasy 6
isn't just the good story but also all
of the subplots once you get to a
certain point there is a vast array of
things you can do outside the purview of
the main story this includes all of the
new magicite bonus dungeons and extra
content that came with the 2006 remake
otherwise everything else is as it used
to be the enemies events story bosses
and more remained relatively unchanged
aside from the improved graphics as you
can imagine the controls have been
reimagined for use on a smartphone you
can now choose between four-way and
8-way controls so you can now move
diagonally if you so choose
unfortunately the controls are a tad
clunky as you can see here the input
takes a moment to translate to actual
movement this isn't a lag issue actually
but rather a delay in the input it kind
of sucks until you get used to it the
battle controls are actually a lot
different than prior ported Final
Fantasy games but thankfully Square
gives you a nice little help window in
your first battle so you can get it it
relies more on scrolling than tapping in
the whole screen is utilized so if you
want to scroll down on a character you
can slide your finger anywhere above
their window or in their window to
scroll commands and then tap to access
them it's a little difficult to get used
to at first but it's not so bad once you
do the menu remains pretty much the same
as prior Final Fantasy games you can
access all of the games music the best
Sharri and the game log from within the
menu now the game log can also be
accessed in the main screen in the top
left corner and it'll tell you what you
need
doing if you don't already know overall
the game mechanics are a step sideways
they are any better than Final Fantasy
four or five but they aren't any worse
either it's simply a different method of
performing essentially the same tasks
but we did like the extras in the menu
and the game log is actually helpful
about our only complaint is the clunky
controls so here's what we liked about
the game it's one of the best stories
ever told in an RPG most people in the
know in the gaming industry ranked this
is one of the best RPGs ever made it
really is a very good game the improved
graphics are fun to look at and it's
definitely a vast improvement over every
prior release the extras like the best
cherry accessing the soundtrack whenever
you want the in-game help the extra
content and others are a pleasant
addition especially for prior fans of
the title finally it has most of the
augments found in Prior Square Enix
smartphone titles like Auto battle and
game speed settings to help move the
game along at your pace lastly there are
some Google Play game services available
namely achievements and here's what we
didn't like so much many people
including me we're hoping for a full 3d
revamp like they did with Final Fantasy
4 and the rumors of this not being true
are disappointing the controls are
clunky again this isn't game lag but
rather a delay in the input and until
you get used to it you may find yourself
taking some unintentional extra steps
the 8 way controls don't really add
anything and I actually ended up going
back to 4-way controls I really hope
Square Enix fixes this particular
problem the DRM always connected means
you cannot play the game where there is
no internet access lay lastly some root
users have complained that you can't use
the game with exposed installed I have
exposed installed and as you can see the
game works fine for me so it's likely a
specific module or combination of
modules that are causing the problem if
you're unsure buy the game and try to
play it and if it doesn't work at the
refund inside the 15 minute refund time
there are also likely some device and OS
and compatibilities that we don't know
about yet also there is no cloud saving
double-lane at the end of the day this
is a classic it has an amazing story
great music and the improved graphics
make the game feel new again the menu
extras add some peripheral depth the
game log makes playing the game for the
first time easier for new fans and the
touch controls are about as good as you
can reasonably expect them to be aside
from the delay issue so is it worth the
16 dollars it's hard to decide I don't
mind trying to talk you guys out of
spending a couple bucks on a
legitimately good app or game
but 16 bucks puts this among the most
expensive games on Android so I'll put
it to you this way if you're a fan of
RPGs JRPGs Final Fantasy or Square Enix
or if you're personally wealthy this
game is a must-have because it's simply
one of the best if you don't fall into
that category I would recommend waiting
until Square Enix tosses a sale so you
can grab it at a more reasonable price
or at the very least wait until they fix
a few of these bugs it is a great game
it really is I've been playing it since
it came out 20 years ago but between the
issues in the price is difficult to
readily recommend it to anyone who isn't
already a serious fan of the genre for
