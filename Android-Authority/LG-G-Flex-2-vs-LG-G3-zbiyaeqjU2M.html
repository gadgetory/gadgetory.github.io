the G flex 2 for my full review let's
take a look at how it stacks up to some
of the competition in this versus the 2
LG Giants go head-to-head this is Joshua
freghar from Android authority what's
going on everybody and this is the LG G
flex 2 versus the LG g3
it's obvious where the differences lie
in this comparison when it comes to
design the curved display of the G flex
2 gives it a unique look and feel though
what once was the size of the G Pro
Series now fit squarely in the realm of
the g3 s territory the G flex 2 has been
shrunken down to the benefit of many
users who thought the larger 6-inch
original was just too big the curve
still goes from top to bottom helping
the phone sit very comfortably in one
hand but like with the original LG
claims the curved results in a more
resilient device all around this is due
to a self-healing back that is supposed
to make scratches on the back disappear
after some time and the benefit of an
overall flexible device that can take
some pressure when flattened the backing
of the phone is removable too much like
in the g3 which sports a brushed design
without the benefit of the self-healing
properties LG is now iconic button
layout is on the back as well with the
volume rocker and the power button
sitting below the camera optics that
also include the laser autofocus no
buttons on the sides means that both of
these devices can be kept pretty thin
despite the curve of the G flex 2
obviously skewing this a little bit and
upfront a pretty thin bezel keeps
everything looking quite svelte with 5.5
inch screens keeping everything just
within the realm of one-handed comforts
the LG g3 started many of the tropes
that D flex benefits from but the curve
honestly does help very much with the
handling the self-healing back of the
Flex does give it a little more grip
because of the somewhat sticky material
compared to the very smooth feel of the
g3 and while size has a lot to do with
the handling I do give the ergonomics
badge to the G flex because the curve
does make hand gymnastics easier to
perform displays on both of these
devices come in the same size but while
the G flex 2 brings a curve to its
screen it also lowers the resolution a
little bit the LG g3 screen was one of
the first to support quad HD or 1440p
resolution bringing high powered display
experiences into the mainstream but
there have been some reports of some
compromises with the g3 screen
a bit of over smoothing can be seen in
mostly text-heavy areas like in the
browser and with so much pixel power two
emotes certain elements might have a
slight stutter in place of completely
smooth movements such claims at least in
my experience prove to be fairly rare
and though the power of the quad HD
display might not be noticeable without
a keen eye
I still thoroughly enjoy mostly media
consumption from the high-resolution
screen but as was the case with the
original G flex we learned that the
second iteration has a lower resolution
that is just fine and just as enjoyable
and indeed 1080p is still the standard
of display quality only made a little
more immersive given the curve the
screen will often not be as close to
your face to make the curve fully make
sense but that's a trope that's left for
large LG TVs it's not hard to notice the
curve skewing the phone's scrolling
elements however it's an effect that
still hasn't gotten old I do notice that
some of the stutters I noticed in the
quad HD display were not present in the
1080p curved display making the case
that super high pixel densities could
indeed impede of general performance if
anything both IPS displays work very
well where they should rightness is good
in broad daylight and colors have the
vibrancy that makes all media look great
ultimately this comparison makes it even
clearer that our tried and true
resolutions are still viable in today's
cutting-edge environments you just have
to pick which enhancement you want the
curve or the bump up to a higher
resolution this seesaw of features on
LG's top devices continues to rock in
the performance Department even if the G
flex 2 is not technically supposed to be
considered the flagship device it still
comes with the latest and greatest a
Snapdragon 810 backed by the audrina 430
and up to 3 gigabytes of RAM while I
have had a good time with in-app tasks
and gaming on this device thus far I
will admit that there are some
performance issues when going through
the GUI in particular this can come from
a lack of optimization in this lollipop
edition of LG's interface but also the
sheer amount of bloatware that you
typically get in devices made for the
Asian market after all take a look at
all the apps that are already baked into
this Korean review unit if this will be
the first place that the Snapdragon 810
will prove itself I think that having a
localized version of the phone will help
it fare better in my testing the LG g3
on the other hand has what can now be
considered old technology the Snapdragon
801 with the audrina 330 and 3 gigabytes
Brown performance on the g3 has remained
reliable despite how fast the market has
been changing and with updates to the
GUI up until now getting through the
elements feels smoother despite what
little stutters I mentioned before due
to the quad HD resolution
obviously the cutting edge is a place
where many of us power users want to be
but while the Snapdragon 810 is a pretty
big deal many variables might be skewing
its performance experience in this very
first crop that includes a lollipop
build that could benefit from some
updates hardware on the G flex 2 focuses
mainly on its curve and as I stated
before it's supposed to help with
durability and handling the self-healing
backing if it is anything like the G
flex 1 will remove superficial scratches
over time but anything more than that
and you will have permanent marks this
is something I've already seen in some
preliminary testing removing the back
doesn't allow you access to the battery
bud to the microSD and SIM card slots
are still exposed speaking of the
battery I have yet to conclude my
longevity tests in just a couple days
that I've had this phone thus far but I
can give you an example of one days
power usage 10 hours is what it took for
me to get to critical power saving modes
though that was also with over three and
a half hours of screen on time which
isn't too shabby the 3000 milliamp hour
battery unit likely won't go the long
long distance but it should be able to
get you through a full day with a little
more frugal usage the battery of the g3
on the other hand is replaceable but
packs the same capacity my original
review of the g3 put the battery life on
par with its main competition despite
its higher resolution screen I've not
seen a big change since my original
review though I will say that being able
to replace the battery easily gives it a
bit of an edge in the long haul
otherwise the g3 doesn't really benefit
from any unique Hardware changes but it
does still support a microSD card slot
and all of the regular fixings for
connectivity both devices still have the
knock-on capability enhanced with not
code which you can use as a customized
way of unlocking the phone it's
important to note that my G flex 2 does
not work on US carriers for LG
connectivity and my testing will be
relegated to Wi-Fi and 3G Internet that
being said call quality has been about
standard for the G flex 2 as it was for
the GT the laser autofocus was well the
focus of the LG g3 and it brought very
fast focusing the top optical image
stabilization and
camera app that kept things really
simple it was a very well received
camera experienced by us and thus it
should come as no surprise that the
experience on the G flex 2 is largely
the same right down to the apps
themselves the experiences in shooting
with the lg cameras are largely the same
you get the simple elements for picking
resolution or changing from the decisive
number of modes that include HDR
panorama and dual shooting however magic
focus seems to have been left out of the
Flex 13-megapixel shots are available in
either iteration with video modes
including 4k recording and slow-motion
through 120 frames per second what made
the g3 camera interface so enjoyable was
the fast point-and-shoot capability when
in the minimal camera interface you can
just tap a point and then the lasers
focus on it quickly snapping the shot in
very little time
picture quality then takes on a pretty
similar fare in the G flex 2 as these
quickly shot photos show good color
reproduction to the scene this is to say
that there isn't a high level of
saturation in the post-processing that
you might be now accustomed to in
competitors cameras this is something
the photographer will have to decide is
a true benefit or maybe a detractor as
more vivid photos tend to be preferred
by users HDR modes do add a little more
color to the photos though its main
function of lightening darks in
clarifying blown out areas might not be
particularly strong the sometimes overly
aggressive noise reduction in the g3
seems to have returned however which is
the trade-off sometimes the pictures are
just softened a little too much and the
fine details can suffer
what does prove itself well is OIS plus
helping shaky hands capture clear photos
and helping video keep from getting too
jittery and sub portraits have been made
easier with a new gesture allowing you
to review the picture you just took with
a natural downward angle movement the
2.1 megapixel front-facing camera is
still just a standard performer however
full testing of the G flex 2 camera is
ongoing though it is clear to me in this
versus that it is highly familiar to the
experience of the g3 and finally in
software we're dealing with an updated
version of the GUI via lollipop in the G
flex 2 but the changes are mostly subtle
and as I mentioned before they may be in
need of some more optimization polish my
g3 still hasn't been updated so you will
see differences in the soft keys the
changes in the recent apps screen to a
Rolodex layout in the Flex and the card
centric style of the note
drop down in lollipop but from there not
much more has changed in the GUI as many
of the elements take on lg's typical
style the settings screen is still a
tabbed layout in the quick settings
above the notifications is still a
little too crowded for comfort the smart
notice widget does get a few more
capabilities but my most enjoyable smart
app experience is still the keyboard
which is just a blast to tap type on
with the Flex with a customizable height
and extra button layout with number keys
up top it's one of my favorite om
keyboards available the only real
addition to the Flex interface is a
peaking feature that is triggered by
swiping down on the turned off screen
which is basically a quick way to check
the time in the notification bar it does
remain however that the GUI is still a
little too cluttered for its own good as
my early performance issues seemed to
prove lollipop was a need and move
forward for Android but LG kept things
looking and feeling mostly the same in
the G flex 2 which might not be a good
thing to everyone and so there you have
it the LG G flex 2 and the LG g3 these
are definitely the two top dogs in the
LG camp and it should come as no
surprise that they are very similar the
higher resolution display of the LG g3
is its marquee feature but if you're
looking for something more unique at the
LG G flex 2 it has already impressed us
with its looks and its very nice feel
what points I do give the G flex 2 for
its noticeably faster camera experience
are somewhat taken away a bit by the
Numa lollipop edition of the GUI that
seems to lack the optimization needed to
meet Snapdragon 810 expectations that
said I'd thoroughly enjoy the G flex 2
so far and that basically means I still
enjoy all that the g3 offers it's just
that the flex is trying to bend the
rules making it a marginally more
intriguing choice as I already stated
before these videos are away from me to
get some real testing on the G flex 2 so
that later this week I can give you a
