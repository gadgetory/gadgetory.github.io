is Jace and this week we have to talk
about updates more updates and after
we're done we can talk about updates
again why because you all are on KitKat
crack I mean you have so lost
perspective on what's really important
in life that you even accuse me of being
on crack let me tell you I am focused on
real life and death issues okay like
focused on killing zombies okay I have
fun rumor time galaxy s5 may arrive with
a 64-bit processor now although it is
just a rumor sources familiar with the
matter have spoken to the korea herald
and suggested that the galaxy s5 may
come with a 64-bit processor or that
could just be a marketing gimmick to get
people like me to talk about it let's
talk KitKat updates so I know after the
last video about why Android updates
take so long many of you were asking how
the supplies did Nexus devices why are
kitkat abuse is taking so long on Nexus
devices good question so what we know
now is that it is believed from a
developer named Alan Sutton that there
is a critical bug that relates to
encryption and could have left encrypted
devices unencrypted abul if the user
entered the wrong password after the
update it appears that google wanted to
fix the serious problem before rolling
out the nexus for take-out update hence
the unusual delay some Nexus 4 users are
reporting that android 4.4 kitkat has
finally graced their phones and the
Nexus 7 and Nexus 10 were updated last
week users on Twitter however have
reported that the update weighs in at
about two hundred thirty eight megabytes
and that you will need to have at least
twenty percent battery life and
preferably at Wi-Fi connection if you
prefer to wait for the OTA be warned
that updates of this type come out in
waves and it can take days or even weeks
until they reach all devices Android 4.4
KitKat won't bring the nexus for the new
Google Experience launcher but there is
still a lot to look forward to
cyanogenmod teases new hardware partner
and they are just cruel about it too
they said this lots of rumors circling
the net we're not quite ready to lift
the veils but we can confirm that we
have a new hardware partner but of
course Andrew
authority can dig a little deeper a few
days ago opos former Vice President Pete
Lau resigned and while he didn't say
anything about why he left now posted
online that a perfect android flagship
devices in the works presumably in
partnership with cyanogenmod let's move
on to the new Android camera API Google
is working on a new camera API that will
bring new features and possibly improved
image quality to Android devices
including the Nexus line many reviewers
have panned the camera experience on the
Nexus 5 as inconsistent and mediocre
with some going so far as to call the
product unfinished Google acknowledged
the problems and said that a software
update could alleviate some of them
indeed code discovered and the publicly
available Android source code suggests
that a new camera API is in the works
that could improve image quality and
give access to new features new Android
camera API may bring Ross shooting face
detection and even burst mode let's move
on to google apps updates Google Drive
according to a Google+ post from the
development team the biggest update is
the addition of find and replace but
mobile users will also benefit from the
ability to insert tables and use name
styles other changes involve the ability
to rename scan documents before
uploading them as well as a new two
column layout for viewing docs on
tablets we also spotted a few minor
changes to the user interface which
feels sleeker and faster so let's talk
to Google Translate app this was a lot
of fun I wasted a lot of time playing
with this today I've tried different
apps like this before and this was quite
quite interesting so of course you can
input your language either audio like
verbally or texting and then have that
translated but now it is especially
helpful if you're alone in a foreign
country because it is gesture sensitive
so I can input my language and hand it
over to someone and the device
recognizes that movement and translates
it in that process and then when it's
handed over to that other person it
outputs that in either text format or
audio format it's fantastic now in the
past when I've used these things it's
been finicky and it was
easy to foil and in the beginning I it
made some errors but then it quickly it
seemed to adapt to my speech so I could
give it something that was relatively
fast and complicated and unrelated
phrases like like this ET la blondie
glide per dr cohn's vision man and cow
want yup mana pun felon it made some
mistakes there I said I lost my dog but
it's been otherwise like really really
good in the beginning I I asked it to
translate bitte Shin which you know
means you're welcome most people
translate as you're welcome and instead
it translated it as bitch but it has
otherwise been really hard to stump
fantastic update really enjoying it
moving on to google wallet earlier this
week Google started rolling out a brand
new app update for google wallet the
update introduces several new features
such as the ability to add credit card
and debit cards just by taking a picture
of them according to the change glog the
update brings support from new google
wallet card and even minor bug fixes and
a few unspecified performance
improvements these changes alone would
have made Google Wallet update pretty
significant but there's more for 4.4
kitkat users the new wallet update
brings tap and pay support let's move on
to google newsstand recently was
announced that Google merged goo
occurrence and Google magazine the
result is an application called google
newsstand which combines the features of
both apps into a single interface check
out her own joe hindy zhdi / look linked
below but he says all in all it is a
mammoth improvement check that out you
may have heard about the original apple
vs samsung legal battle but that was
decreed as a mistrial by Judge Lucy Coe
last year after she found that the jury
from the 2012 trial miscalculated the
amount of damages that Apple was
entitled to but suffice it to say that
unless one of Samsung's appeals succeeds
the result of this retrial is that
Samsung will have to pay apple a grand
total of eight hundred and ninety
million dollars and Samsung chose to pay
them in
knees no I'm just kidding it was just a
silly internet meme but Samsung will be
paying them and $30 use proprietary
power cords now worth noting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
