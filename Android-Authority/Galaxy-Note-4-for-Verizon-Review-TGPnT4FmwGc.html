brought to you by Norton security hey
what is going on guys laun here for
Andrew authority and it started off as
an experiment by Samsung that nobody
ever thought would have taken off and
here we are in 2014 with the Galaxy Note
4 Samsung's biggest and baddest
smartphone yet both literally and
figuratively and it's on America's
largest network for the last several
years consumers have been begging
Samsung to make a more premium feeling
phone and what better way to start them
with the Galaxy Note 4 well technically
it started with the Galaxy alpha but
with the note 4 we know this is
something Samsung is looking to continue
the note 4 features a metal frame with
chamfered edges and a faux leather back
but gone is the fake stitching from
before which was a much-needed
improvement although it's not entirely
metal the addition of the metal band
makes a world of a difference in how it
feels in the hand and will satisfy
anyone who's been waiting for Samsung to
make a phone with better build quality
it's certainly the most well designed
and best feeling phone yet quad HD
displays are starting to become a thing
now with flagship phones at least on
Android and it certainly didn't take
long for Samsung to get in on the action
the note 4 features a 5.7 inch Super
AMOLED display with 2560 by 1440
resolution and this is by far the best
display Samsung has ever made it's
bright beautiful text and graphics look
extremely sharp and colors pop off the
screen just as you would expect from a
Samsung made AMOLED panel while most
people might say it's hard to notice a
difference between quad HD and 1080p one
thing is for sure though is that this
panel will not disappoint and will be an
absolute joy to use for virtually
anything you do on a smart phone these
days the specs of the note 4 are also no
slouch it's a Snapdragon 805 with three
gigs of RAM and the adrenal 420
essentially the best specs you can get
on a mobile device here in late 2014
as you were expecting no.4 is fast and
can pretty much handle any task you
throw at it which is obviously a good
thing because the note 4 is designed to
do a lot you'll sometimes run into the
occasional TouchWiz lag but nothing that
could be considered a deal-breaker by
any means
for the most part it's a very buttery
smooth experience absolute quickly
multitasking is a breeze especially with
three gigs of RAM and with the adrenal
420 the no.4 can handle pretty much any
high-end game you throw at it without
skipping a beat
Samsung has always been really good with
their cameras and they've saved the best
one yet for the no.4 it's a 16 megapixel
sensor and it has optical image
stabilization this time around which is
a first for Samsung the camera is packed
full of features and depending on who
you are you may love it or hate it but
with all the different shooting modes
and manual controls you'll always be
able to get the shot that you want the
16 megapixel sensor takes very crisp and
vibrant images and with OAS on board
this time around you're going to get
much better low-light performance if
you're looking for the best camera on an
Android smartphone right now the note 4
is definitely one to consider and it's
not going to disappoint what the big
phone comes a big battery and the note
line pretty much led the charge when it
comes to big batteries on smartphones so
you're looking at 30 to 20 milliamp hour
battery and the note 4 easily lasts all
day on a single charge even with heavy
usage like playing a lot of games and
watching YouTube videos I never had any
problems making it through a full day so
with more moderate usage I have no doubt
that you could easily squeeze even a
second day out of it or at least a good
majority of a second day and even with
that quad HD display and all those
pixels that are being pushed the note 4
still manages to get some really great
battery life on the software side of
things the note 4 is running Android 4.4
KitKat with Samsung's own TouchWiz
interface and with the note 4 you're
getting all the bells and whistles all
of the usual staple features make a
return here like multi window motion
gestures s-health S voice and the
fingerprint scanner but since this is a
note you get features like one-handed
operation to make using you know four in
one hand a little bit easier you also
can't forget about that S Pen and what
the s-pen you get Air Command which
allows you to quickly do things like
create memos draw or write on
screenshots and crop images for scrap
booking just to name a few the note 4 is
meant to do a lot of things and while
the utility of Samsung's features is
debatable there's no denying that you
can get any
you want done on the note for whether
it's for work or play the Samsung Galaxy
Note 4 is available right now on Verizon
for three hundred dollars on a two-year
contract or $700 if you decide to go
without a contract and there you have it
guys for the samsung galaxy note 4 the
note line permits started off as a niche
product but with larger phones becoming
very popular nowadays the note 4 is
going to be a phone that appeals to
virtually anyone with the new metal
design the quad HD display and the
improved s-pen these note 4 easily
becomes Samsung's best-looking and most
powerful phone yet that's going to
satisfy both current and new Note line
