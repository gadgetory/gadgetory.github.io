from China brings super high
specifications unique design materials a
zoom lens and is priced lower than $400
but it's not coming to the West it's
Joshua Vergara what's going on everybody
and here it is the Xiaomi me 6 but
there's a bit of a disclaimer I have to
provide first I used it in the States on
the t-mobile network and as such I
wasn't able to get the best example of
the music's performance given the fact
that I couldn't use it on LTE networks
now this is common for Asian phones but
it does mean that this review is a
little bit less deep on the hard
specifications that said the phone makes
a really big splash off the bat with its
design it's not particularly different
in aesthetic from past's Shammi devices
but we applaud the company for trying to
be a bit unique and in this case we have
the ceramic Edition that also comes with
the highest configuration of specs the
ceramic shines beautifully it is
complemented by small gold accents
Xiaomi seems to spare no expense when it
comes to the materials but it almost
makes you wonder how the retail price
can be so low a tactile array is below
the 1080p resolution display that
includes a concave home button and
fingerprint reader combination the
fingerprint reader works well enough and
the other capacitive keys can be
customized in the settings and no your
eyes do not deceive you there's no
headphone jack on this phone though it's
a controversial move xiaomi told us that
removing it allowed them to put a bigger
33 50 milliamp hour battery unit now
despite this being a flagship device the
music's does fall behind with a 1080p
display when compared to the rest of the
flagship pack the LCD isn't really bad
in any regard though quad HD is more of
a standard this year however Xiaomi has
done well to make the LCD really bright
even in daylight and impressively dark
when the brightness slider is cranked
down to zero this level of brightness is
something that we would expect from
AMOLED displays but somehow Xiaomi made
it work with this phone overall there
barely any issues to be had with the
display though sometimes I did find it
troublesome to try and find the
brightness slider in dark environments
because I could barely see where it was
under the hood again Xiaomi spares no
expense the Snapdragon 835 is the
processor here putting it right next to
other current flagships today however
the music's does come in a lot of
different configurations that can
include
or or six gigabytes of RAM and up to 128
gigabytes of on-board storage and as I
alluded to earlier the ceramic Edition
that you see here is considered the most
premium of the bunch coming with six
gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes of
on-board storage I definitely took
advantage of the large amount of storage
for my camera usage but I also played
plenty of games on the v6 and in both
situations I found no reason to doubt
that the performance or the reliability
of the phone would be less than any
other flagship so as I mentioned earlier
I had trouble using this phone to its
fullest extent on t-mobile so I had to
rely on Wi-Fi and tethering to get
things done call quality was adequate
and was helped along by this dual
speaker setup which is similar to the
HTC 10 from last year with a bottom
mounted speaker accompanied by a unit in
the call speaker the audio this was
pretty good it had stereo sound but it
doesn't get all that loud things get
better when connecting headphones as a
built-in EQ provides a nice amount of
sound customization especially if you
use USB type-c enabled at earphones from
the company itself when connected to
HSPA networks I was able to get to the
end of the day without any issues and
I'm sure that would be the case for
normal usage however our Android
Authority battery testing app put the me
six at almost seven hours of continuous
on-screen usage with a mixture of gaming
browsing and video playback so I'm sure
that the 33 50 million power battery
will do a good job especially when you
consider a quick charge 3.0 helping to
juice it up in short bursts which brings
us to the software and the me UI it
follows suit of many other Asian roms by
not providing an Abbe drawer so this is
a bit of an adjustment for a user like
me but after some time I was able to get
everything organized but it still takes
a little bit of getting used to when
you're going through all of the
different folders to figure out where
you put something there are some extra
features built in but the me UI remains
just about what you would expect from
previous editions and besides this
version 8 is a beta global ROM that was
used so that I could actually review the
me6 all in all if you're familiar with
the me UI or really any other Chinese
ROM there isn't much else that really
differentiates this new version 8 and
finally the camera if you've been
following a certain trend in this review
you may notice that the music seems to
take a lot of the best features from
previous devices and puts them all
together that's definitely true for the
camera which is a dual lens system that
provides a 2 X optical zoom aside from
the usual wide
this is reminiscent of the iPhone 7 plus
and different from any other phones that
provide different focal lengths out of
LG's flagship lineup zoom can be quite
important to shutter bugs and Jamie does
well to provide one for picture taking
in particular now this is because the
zoom capabilities are not available for
video recording which is a rather
significant bummer but that said I did
enjoy using the music for video
recording optical image stabilization
helps keep all footage from getting too
jittery and there was a good amount of
detail in each piece of footage though
exposure might jump around from time to
time there was very little to complain
about other than the omission of zoom in
the movie mode like I mentioned I was
told that this wasn't a problem with the
hardware but it could be opened up in
the future via ami UI software update
the software on the other hand provides
extra modes including a pro mode but as
an automatic shooter it was quick enough
to get a good shot off even when using
HDR HDR is a toggle in this version
rather than an automatic mode and
keeping it on will often boost up the
shadows and add a little bit of
saturation pictures in broad daylight
generally came out looking pretty good
though the dynamic range left a little
bit to be desired as highlights tended
to be too bright when I tried to bring
up the exposure for better shadows and
this same effect was observed in HDR
adjustments as well and regarding the 2x
zoom it's nice to be able to optically
zoom into elements without a loss in
quality however I found that I wasn't
really using the 2x zoom in more
situations that I expected however there
is one situation that it comes in handy
the portrait mode heavily inspired by
the iPhone portrait mode Xiaomi utilizes
the optical zoom to tighten up the frame
while working to isolate the subject
from the background when subjects are at
most a couple of metres away then it
goes into a depth effect mode adding
boquete to the background the musics
does a decent job of this and it softens
out the edges but it does sometimes cut
the line a bit incorrectly and it's
noticeable when you zoom in but
especially in good lighting photos of
friends or colleagues yielded new
profile picture level shots lower light
situations make these and pretty much
any other photo suffer especially in the
finer details of the photos making this
a less than ideal indoor or maybe
nighttime camera which is a good way of
bringing the review into perspective
much like the portrait mode it is when
the phone focuses on a specific feature
or capability that it manages to provide
some high points but trying to do too
much just bogs down the overall package
the Xiaomi me6 is by far the
most capable phone that Dave made to
date the most unique of which goes to
the me mix of course but in its quest to
provide every feature we've loved in the
last couple of years it falls short of
perfection the screen does not flagship
grade the dual speaker is a bit reserved
the big battery sacrifices the headphone
jack and the dual camera is a proper
first for Android but isn't as capable
as we would like it's a give and take
with the Shamim e6 and it comes right
down to its price a price that is
equivalent to 360 u.s. dollars that's an
incredible price that would make anyone
in the West excited only it's not
available anywhere but the opposite side
of the world which is great for them but
a missed opportunity for us and
ostensibly for Xiaomi it might not be
perfect as a flagship but if you can get
your hands on it this cacophony of
features could be one of the best bang
for buck phones in existence this is a
pretty great phone and if you happen to
live in the different markets that this
phone is currently available in then you
should probably pick it up because it
comes in at such a good price point
however for everybody else what we're
seeing here is shammies move to a place
where there flagships could possibly
make a huge splash if it finally expands
beyond those markets but until then you
can keep it tuned to Android or atif or
even more about the Xiaomi me six more
of their phones and more from copy text
2017 which is where I am right now so
you can see any announcements that we
have to share from Taipei's biggest tech
show from there you can keep it tuned to
Android authority for even more because
we are your source for all things
