Android Authority and the Moto 360 has
been out for a little while now but it's
still easily one of the best Android
wear smartwatches you can get on the
market right now
it's really well designed and has
fantastic build quality so we're going
to put that build quality to the test
and see exactly how durable it is we're
basically just going to stress the hell
out of it and see how well it stacks up
so before we get started I just want to
go over exactly what it is that I'm
going to do to test the durability of
the Moto 360 so there's going to be
three different tests here and test
number one is the water resistancy so we
know the Moto 360 is ip67 but we're
gonna put it to the test anyways and see
exactly how long it can go underwater
test number two is the glass with the
Moto 360 having that beveled glass it's
not quite as protected as some other
watches so we're going to see how easy
or not so easy it is to scratch the
glass on the Moto 360 and finally test
number three we're basically just going
to wreck the Moto 360 we're going to try
to find a weight like a rock or
something and just drop it on the Moto
360 and see how well it fares but with
that being said let's go ahead and get
started with test number one alright so
here is my bowl of water and sorry I
don't have anything bigger like a fish
tank or something so this bowl of water
is going to have to do for now and I
have an HTC One m8 here to serve as a
stopwatch and here is my Moto 360 and as
you can see it is in working order it
does function and I'm basically just
going to put it in the water and I'm
going to check up on it every ten
minutes or so so let's go ahead just do
this and I will be back in about ten
minutes
all right so it has been 10 minutes so
let's see let's check up on it here so
there you go it's still working
yep still works no surprises there seems
to be working just fine the screen
lights up and everything so we're going
to go another 10 minutes and I will be
back again
so 20 minutes have passed let's see how
the motor 360 is doing all right and
there you go it is still working the
screen still lights up and everything
and I can still interact with it the
leather band is extremely wet at this
point but you expect it to be but other
than that it works perfectly fine I can
still interact with the screen if my
camera will focus but I'm going to put
it in for another 10 minutes and we'll
check up on it again so here we go
so at this point 30 minutes have elapsed
let's go ahead and see how the Moto 360
is holding up all right so the good news
is it is still working oh that's good so
yeah it still works I can still interact
with it still lights up obviously again
the leather band is extremely wet now
but you know what
for good measure I'm going to go and do
another ten minutes
all right so it is time for the moment
of truth it has been 40 minutes let's
see if the Moto 360 still works and when
yeah there you go the surprisingly it
still works it still lights up still
functions
if only my camera would focus on it but
that's okay it still works so that's
good news kind of surprising that it is
still functioning after all this time
obviously it's just really wet and it's
going to be interesting to see what this
leather band is going to look like once
it dries up but as far as the watch
itself still functions just fine and so
that's good news
definitely lasted a lot longer than I
expected
alright so the Moto 360 has passed the
water test with flying colors I actually
wasn't expecting it to I was expecting
it to crap out after about 30 minutes
but it fortunately survived so that's
good news but let's go ahead and move on
to test number two which is the screen
so here's our Moto 360 all nice and wet
after the water test and now it's time
to test the screen and see if we can
scratch it so as you can see in front of
me is a really rough looking really
beat-up railing and I'm just going to
rub the screen up against it and see if
I can scratch it so here goes nothing
all right let's take a look at it here
let me go and clean it off really quick
all right I'm going to zoom in for you
guys
so we can take a look and let's check it
out here and I actually don't see
anything it still looks really good then
clean it off a little bit more but yeah
I don't see anything eyes I don't even
see light scratches just it's just dirty
but right now it still looks pristine I
guess that makes sense because this
railing is metal and metal is softer
than glass so I guess even as rough and
beat-up as this railing is it's still
not going to scratch it so surprisingly
the glass is still in perfect shape even
though I just rub the hell out of it on
this railing but it's still not
scratched at all so let's see if we can
scratch it on a rub it on something else
to get it to scratch so this is concrete
and I'm expecting the motor 360 to not
fare anywhere near as well on this
concrete as it did with the metal
railing but let's go ahead just try it
anyways and see what happens
all right I think that is enough let's
go ahead and check up on it let me go
ahead and clean it off really quick here
and let's take a look actually I'm going
to adjust my camera angle here so we can
take a better look at it so here is the
glass of the Moto 360 after being
scratched up against concrete and as you
can see it's pretty beat-up at this
point it fared a lot better against the
metal railing but I guess you sort of
expected that because metal is a lot
softer than glass but the concrete
pretty much tore up the glass on the
Moto 360 here the rest of the watch is
fine though the body is still in great
shape but the glass is pretty beat up so
here's the final test and we're
basically just going to drop this brick
that I found onto the face of the Moto
360 and see exactly what is going to
happen so here goes nothing woo
that was crazy
who
that was crazy alright so my DSLR died
on me right in the middle of filming
that drop but I just wanted to quickly
show you guys the aftermath of the motor
360 and as you see the screen is
completely shattered
it's not even usable you wouldn't want
to use it could you probably cut your
finger or something and it doesn't even
boot up or anything so it's completely
broken but that is going to do it for
the durability test for the Moto 360
well that is going to do it guys for
this durability test for the Moto 360
I'm not even really sure if there's
anything that can be learned from this
video except for the fact that you
should not drop a brick on your Moto 360
because that's what your moto 360 will
become a brick but either way thank you
so much for watching and if you enjoyed
it give it a thumbs up down below and if
you want to see more videos like this
definitely leave a comment down below
letting us know what you guys want to
see if you guys want to see another one
similar to this but that is going to be
it thanks for watching guys and as
