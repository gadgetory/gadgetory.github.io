to become more potential replacements
for general computing and unfortunately
they haven't quite gotten there just yet
but Samsung is looking to put its best
foot forward now by taking it's already
well received top-tier tablet and quite
literally blowing it up out of
proportion well does it succeed well
that's what we're about to find out cuz
it's Joshua the guard from Android
authority what's going on everybody and
this is the Samsung Galaxy Note pro 12.2
and starting off with the design we are
going to get the obvious out of the way
first yes this is a huge tablet I had
12.2 inches in the screen you do have a
wonderfully big and very vast black
slate at the front but it's because of
this size it also comes with all of the
issues you would expect from it mainly
that you have to hold it in two hands in
order to have a safe grip on it you're
probably going to use this on a tabletop
more often than not and on top of all of
that it is also quite heavy at 7 and 753
grams
making this almost like you took a small
laptop and you just snapped the back off
of it and all you got left was this in
my hand but design wise Samsung went
with the tried-and-true aspects that
they usually do with their tablets the
button layout is on the top with the
power and the volume rocker the s-pen
and the micro USB 3.0 port are on the
right one real notable change is that on
the front button layout you have the
home button flanked by a back button and
this time instead of a menu button you
have a recent apps button so the kind of
coming in with the new here instead of
looking for a menu button they're going
to add a little bit more multitasking
functionality by allowing you to use a
recent apps button as far as the
handling goes when it comes to using a
twelve point two inch tablet like this
there's really only one way to put it if
you use a 10 inch tablet before and you
thought that that was too big there is
no way you're going to think that this
is any better
the bezel around the screen does make it
possible to hold the tablet with one
hand but you're going to need to really
pinch pretty much almost have a death
grip on the tablet lest you let it fall
to the ground and you destroy all of the
loveliness of that screen more often
than not you're probably going to be
using the note Pro on
tabletop especially when it comes to
typing because typing on this large
screen is one of the hardest things you
can do when you have it handheld and
quite obviously it is that 12 point two
inch screen which is the reason why this
tablet is so big but one of the greatest
parts about this tablet is that screen
because it is one hell of a performer it
comes in with a massive resolution of
2560 by 1600 which makes it one of the
best media consumption tools that is
still at least for most intents and
purposes pretty portable just about
anything you watch read or enjoy on this
LCD will shine through and even if you
have it on a tabletop and you are a
little bit over on the side the viewing
angles actually look quite great still
when it comes to performance it should
be no surprise that the current most
powerful processing package comes on the
Note pro 12.2 the Snapdragon 800 clocked
in at 2.3 gigahertz and then the audrina
330 with three gigabytes of RAM now I
did kind of want to address this issue
that seems to come up fairly often where
people are really I'll say kind of
sniping at the TouchWiz UI in that any
little stutter makes them think that
there's a lot of lag well the one thing
I want to address there is while
TouchWiz obviously is in need of an
update for more reasons than one which
I'll get into later but as far as those
little stutters you might find I really
didn't see that many of them and even if
it did happen it didn't keep me from
doing whatever it is I needed to do the
stutter is less about performance and
more of an aesthetic issue which is what
I'll give you but what I my point here
is that the stutter is not necessarily
because of the processing package
because it performs really well even
under all that TouchWiz demands of it a
micro SD card slot allows another notch
in the media consumption category for
the Note pro 12.2 as you can bolster the
already included 32 or 64 gigabytes of
on-board storage for further media
consumption as far as the battery goes
in the note pro you have a 95 hundred
million power unit in here that goes for
quite a long time and that is really no
joke because I let this sit for hours
and hours and the standby time proved
itself by not letting the battery life
go down even more than a couple percent
so you should be able to get two days
maybe even more from the no Pro
depending on how frugal your usage is
now one aspect about the hardware here
that was a bit of a bummer was the sound
quality there are dual speakers here one
on either
the device however despite it getting
pretty adequately loud I did wish that
there was a little bit more richness to
the sound for a tablet like this that
potentially could be a great movie
watching experience or even YouTube I
was really hoping for this thing to
really boom unfortunately it fell just
below those expectations and of course
there is the s-pen which includes every
new enhancement originally abroad since
the Galaxy Note 3 and thus its
functionality is very similar to those
so if you aren't familiar with it you
can refer to previous reviews of note
devices and you'll get the gist of it it
still remains as one of the best stylus
experiences available on pretty much any
peripheral to date usually there isn't
too much to say about a camera on a
tablet and that is also true for the
Note pro 12.2 and this is also primarily
because with such a large body
especially in this tablet we do run into
a very familiar problem nonetheless the
8 megapixel shooter comes with a rather
surprising number of enhancements in the
app that originated from the galaxy s4
and the quality of the photos actually
isn't all that bad but as is the case
with many different tablets when it
comes to their cameras you probably have
a better and much more portable shooter
in your pocket already and the tablet is
really just a backup more than anything
else and finally we make it over to the
software in which TouchWiz finally got
an update but it can be best described
as the my magazine second screen coming
to the forefront but before we get into
that will say that the elements you may
already be very used to have been
somewhat altered with more flat elements
and colors and a motif leaning more
toward circles as you can see in the
notification drop-down and speaking of
multitasking the screen real estate is
taken full advantage of with multi
windows new capability of simultaneously
running four windows at once now this is
a very welcome addition and while I
would argue that you may not often run
into situations where you need for
windows running all at once it is still
pretty damn cool and now the magazine UX
swipe over from the right and you will
hit the magazine UX that has its own
indications on the bottom for its own
home screens
once again the full screen real estate
is being taken advantage of as sizable
tiles quite literally take up every inch
of the display now you can't add regular
widgets to the magazine
as a set list of additions are available
for news applications and social
categories all of which focus on content
delivery for example the news widgets
take on a Flipboard back-end to provide
sources and avenues of contents when you
are looking at that tile you can change
which sources it pulls from via
Flipboard as the backend and you can
pick the different sources of the news
that you will find now when you consider
the magazine UX as sort of a at a glance
type of home screen you will get a lot
of content from the tiles and they are
customisable in a number of different
ways but there's really only one main
gripe that I had with it for example if
you look at the YouTube tile down here
if I was going to click on that I would
hope that it would take me straight to
that trailer that it is showing me
already but if I click on it right now
it will bring me right into Flipboard
which will essentially show me this same
exact picture again that I have to press
once more in order to open up the actual
video itself so instead of being
shortcut straight to the content that it
is displaying it actually brings you to
a couple more layers which is something
that it's a little bit of a bummer in
the end the magazine UX is a very nice
step forward but ultimately TouchWiz
still looks very familiar in its uber
colorful and somewhat bloated elements
now while the whole screen is being
taken advantage of and that is great
those other aspects are what we still
notice and those are the things that we
want to be updated at very soon so when
it comes to the price there's really
only one way to put it big tablet big
price the Note pro 12.2 comes in at 750
dollars and is as expensive as actually
a number of halfway decent laptops that
are available in the market but then
that brings us to our question that we
started this review with does this
tablet provide an experience that can
replace general computing well if
anything the Note pro 12.2 gets as close
as probably any other tablet has with a
screen that plenty of gaming laptops
just wish that they could have heavy
multitasking capabilities of very good
stylus experience if you need it the
Note pro 12.2 tries to be quite
literally everything for you and for
those of you that it succeeds in doing
that for the Note pro 12.2 will likely
be a
for you but for the rest of us this is
still a pretty damn good tablet despite
its huge size but in the end what is
important is it is also pretty damn fun
so as always thank you guys very much
for watching and I hope you enjoyed this
review of the Samsung Galaxy Note pro
12.2 it is definitely quite the tablet
to try and wrap your head and even your
hands around but in the end I find that
it is a nice experience and TouchWiz
being slightly updated with the magazine
UX was a nice touch but there's still
more that has to be done so keep it
tuned to Android 34 all of the best
coverage especially our upcoming Mobile
World Congress coverage as the show is
starting in just a few days I am
actually standing in Barcelona Spain
