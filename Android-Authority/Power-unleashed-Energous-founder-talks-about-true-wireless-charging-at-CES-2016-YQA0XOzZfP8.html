2016 with Michael the CTO and co-founder
of energist gonna meet you nice to meet
you too and he's just gonna talk us
through the company and they really call
wireless charging standard so let's get
into it what I'm what sets you guys
apart from other wallets sure I'm sure
so so when I started this company the
goal is started with trying to charge my
kids battery so it's constantly tired of
pulling them out of the toy now you have
to you know screw unscrew it take it out
charge it and I thought there's got to
be a better way than having to do that
every day and as soon as I start looking
at the problem realized it wasn't just
me it's not just toys not just batteries
it's cellphones it's wearables there's
just a whole host of different device
today to have batteries we know so many
smart devices that you know you need to
charge and there's got to be a better
way of doing that so it energized our
goal is to really be able to charge the
distance so you don't have to go find a
specific place to put your device you
walk into a room you put your phone down
you leave it in your pocket we find that
device wherever it is and charge it
remotely it's perfect so we keep it
obviously great because as I said you we
know that the pain points of wireless
charging is it's not really Wireless
when you have to then have a corded pad
and you have to have a specific
positioning so what kind of sets and
they're just different in terms of the
over-the-air stir just trying to talk us
through the over-the-air stuff you
showed up at CES 2016 and how we're kind
of that the springboard from that and
what 2015 was for you guys sure sure so
last year I think we really show what's
possible we showed our transmitters
embedded in a TV bezel we showed it in
speaker kind of showing where you can
put it in your home and where you would
see it in the future
this year has been all about
commercialization and miniaturization we
spend a lot of effort on making this a
you know product that can go in your
hands as soon as possible so everything
from you know effectively making a
smaller chips more cost-effective chips
it's been a big year for this on
miniaturization I think you saw two days
ago that we released our mini
transmitter and what we found is we did
miniaturization this year there's a
whole ecosystem that's not being
fulfilled and that's the wearable market
you know until today trying to put a
coil
and a Fitbit or a misfit or something
that's really small there's a very small
battery in it it's just not feasible and
being able to completely seal that
device so it's waterproof you can take
it swimming you can workout with it we
found that just untapped market and by
being able to take our smaller version
of our transmitter and put it in the box
the wearable we kind of solve the
chicken and egg you may find in the
ecosystem when you traditionally launch
a new technology we kind of need to
technology needs to innovate but then
you need someone to do something to make
it innovative and it's just I see
instead what the chicken yeah and again
you know we're not a product company you
know our goal is to enable always
different verticals so there's there's a
natural synergy of well what comes first
right and for us you know while we may
be a mobile device in the year from now
or any other time frame based on our
different strategic we're working with
there's certain market segments that can
be very fast to market and we want to
make sure that people with their pain
points can be solved right away and just
on the topic of you kind of because you
obviously and it just is the licensing
company it's like you said you're not a
hardware manufacturer I don't need
companies you're working with that you
can tell us now for specifically within
the mobile arena I wish I wish you have
to ask the question we did announced
last year right after CES and CES is
great for us we announced our first
top-tier consumer electronics companies
one of the top five in the world
unfortunately can't announce who they
are as it would be with most large
companies and want to keep it secret
until they launch working feverishly
last year we have said that we hope that
they'll launch the you know in the 2016
early 2017 it's really in their control
but certainly is a lot of market
segments are starting to address now
that we think can can come in to market
even sooner than than that time frame
again it's been it's been a good year
for us not just in terms of
miniaturization but in terms of you know
patents we got six patents awarded I
think it's important that as you come up
with new technology that it's defensible
and that it can have a you know a broad
appeal we've we're on a third version of
silicon so the silicon we have this year
that you would embed in you know and
your watch your phone or wearable or you
know a battery or camera any of those
things
production silicon it's ready to go you
know you don't have to wait another year
for us to to to flush it out you know
this is the version that we think is
good good enough to go that's one of the
reasons we announce that we're doing
evaluation kits this month for both the
miniature transmitter as well as a
longer distance transmitter and more of
enterprise transmitter that we showed
last year just want to kind of bring it
back a sec because you actually go into
one of the questions I was gonna talk
about which is your patents obviously we
had you had the patterns approved last
year but you've had we I know that every
final artifact that one's issued so we
filed over over 150 patents in the last
three half years I mean this company
started three and a half years ago or
three years ago there's only a couple of
us but we realized that there's so many
market opportunities that we wanted to
make sure we had ample protection so we
filed patents and everything from our
antennas to the architecture of our
ships to the different market segments
you know the Patent Office in the u.s. a
little slow so it's taken three years to
get our first six patents issued but we
have six issued issued in the last
couple months and every month we'll have
more that are being reviewed and issued
but you know that's very important
obviously as we grow our company if we
want to be like like an arm or others
who license our technology into these
different segments we need to make sure
that our partners are comfortable with
our technology and you obviously protect
your interests you look at the USPTO
these patterns are just in the US or giu
still no there are no they're both
they're both I mean if you count the the
US international patents they're
probably over 200 that we filed so we're
protecting worldwide I mean again our
view especially with our different
strategics and our Tier one this is a
you know it's the global market and the
global solution that they they want to
address so we're definitely seeking
protection everywhere that's awesome and
just on the topic of patents there was a
at least not so much larger bit kind of
the year before there were allegations
of that some of the patents are well
another company has a smaller company
has very similar patterns but okay
obviously with patents being issued are
there are the people working who have
almost very similar technology or as
energist doing something that is kind of
very unique to the company well I think
you know we do
you know Wireless has been around for 20
years there's thousands of thousands of
patents on Telecom for RF I've been in
the telecom market 15 years so it's very
hard to in general file you know new and
novel patents in this area there's a so
much innovation that we've we've done in
the last three years that there's just a
lot of stuff that we can patent that
makes us some difference HS you know we
have our core patents you know we do
things very different than others I mean
there's one or two other companies
looking at doing it with RF there's some
of RF some with ultrasound some with
lasers we have some great strengths at
the RF that we chose it could be very
very small and we'll show you some
pictures or you can take some video of
how small can get I think the wearable
market it's very hard to address with
coils very hard to address other
technology with our RF solution it can
be very very small so that's a huge
advantage but I think you know the way
we differentiate ourselves is in is in
cost I mean in the end consumer device
could be very cost effective and having
been in this market and our team has
done a lot of different Wireless
products for Wi-Fi WiMAX LTE we know how
to make very cheap silicon we know how
to make very cost-effective antennas you
really need to solve the entire
ecosystem to make this cost effective as
you do in a lot of new markets you can't
just say here's a chip for the receiver
we have to make a cost-effective
transmitter we need to be able to manage
this system and we'll show you later
today we have a management system that
sits in the cloud lets us monitor all
these devices so that when you walk into
a hotel you can get greed and so here's
your free you know free service you know
here we're charging your device you know
Starbucks and it can give you
information and statistics and and
useful data for those you know different
providers it becomes a win-win for the
company because they get information
with what you're doing and things like
that but also if consumers because it's
a reason to go in we mean if you go
around the CSO floor you see almost
everywhere is just offering you free
charging because you're right we've got
to the point where we use batteries
everywhere but the one thing that hasn't
been solved is always staying and I've
charged up and even if you use a
portable power bank
you then have to charge a power bank and
then you've got to charge it and it's
kind of just a vicious cycle of having
lots of information having lots of great
technology but then not actually being
able to use it when it
and about dreams right so could you just
want to talk a bit about the
over-the-air stuff we saw last year
because it was really cool being able to
kind of have within your home as I said
to earlier it was one of the biggest
pain points with me personally with
wireless charging is having to use a pad
that you have to have a certain position
but then you've got to plug into the pad
and then it picked it's slow charging as
well could we see the concept of at
least from the consumer aspect of
literally being able to not just have it
built in terms but do it as I've
knocking off to build modification at
home so you walk into a room you're
ready - absolutely so we have 1 or 2
vision models will show again today like
we showed last year where you know you
have a little sound bar that's below
your speaker I mean starts below your
monitor or your TV below the monitor of
your computer that would serve as a
smaller area so I think the scalability
part is really important then we focus a
lot on this year is you know you could
have a slightly bigger transmitter that
maybe 2 feet long by 4 inches wide that
you know serves a small area in your
office you can have a bigger transmitter
for enterprises that goes 15 20 feet and
serves a variety of people or you can
have a miniature transmitter that can
service a very small area near your
laptop so you don't have to worry about
plugging it in at all you can be
completely portable I think that's
that's something that you know a lot of
people have kind of you know really see
the the usefulness you know your laptops
everywhere with you but you don't
necessarily have a cord and so if you're
on your laptop being able to charge your
wireless device even just from your
laptop is something that again offers a
pain point that people have again I
completely agree Utes so the problem
with cables it's wireless charging but
it's only ever Wireless between its kind
of wireless conductive but as we said
earlier you have a pad you can't use it
laptop you can put it on top and charge
it stuff like that let's talk about the
miniaturization because that's really
where you got sharing in 2016
you said wearables but just moving
outside of just the core of mobile tech
marrows could we see the miniaturization
being sure I think you know wearables
Internet of Things
you know cameras batteries you know
anything that requires you know tenth
watt you know half a lot anything that's
lower in power that doesn't need the
distance but but needs to constantly top
up every night I think is where we think
there's a nice sweet spot
I mean gaming controllers perfect
pet peeve right your kids forget to put
it down they get upset like that work a
little it's right it was like you can
have the plug-in charged and it does but
then it eventually you like when you
want to go back to wide cable especially
if you've got a quite a large room and
you're like this doesn't fit over here
so so I think that's a great use case
that doesn't require 15 feet we can have
a very small effective transmitter on
top of you know whatever gaming
controller you have that charters your
you know your controllers within a 5 6 7
foot area so I think the the ability to
adapt these different markets again our
view is that we want to enable these
different market segments and having
something that's flexible as small as a
mini transmitter go as big as something
that you know transmits at a distance I
think that flexibility will enable
markets that we didn't see you know a
year ago and we were demonstrating it
we're showing the kind of the big vision
where we'd end up in the future you know
a year from now I think we want to fill
in that gap of things that people can
launch you know this year and I think
that's what we're trying to do and just
talking about obviously energist it's
kind of away from just a munitions visit
but what up and the whole product is a
kind of as a whole there are certain
wireless charging standards at the
moment which we know mhm would it fit
under one of them or would it have to is
it an entirely and you would have become
a new standard of its own so so the PMA
which is now called air/fuel that
consortium we're actually leading the
uncouple working group so if you look at
the there's three different working
groups there there's the couple which is
the older matt technology which got to
be you know directly on top there's a
loosely couple which is the you know the
resident which you can be you know an
inch or so away you know meant to do
higher power like cars and laptops and
there's the uncouple so we're actually
cheering on a couple of working group
and that's anything you know a distance
so whether that's 2 3 5 feet 10 feet 15
feet I mean it is a working group but
there is no standard for this but having
the working groups making sure that we
all interoperate from the network layer
so that you walk into you know hotel you
may put it on a map because you want to
charge a laptop at 40 watts we're not
you know we're not gonna address that
market it's very complimentary it may
have our technology in it so that when
you go at 10 15 feet we can top it up so
you know our view is I certainly my view
is that it's not one one solution takes
all you know every solution has its
unique
yes which applies to certain markets
we're never going to you know charge a
Tesla it's just not cost-effective for
the technology were deploying our
technology is really geared towards
anything that's 10 watts or less and
we're finding today is you know even
your your tablet that you could charge a
10 watts if you're constantly topping it
up during the day you know you don't
need to deliver 10 watt you can deliver
5 watch even though there were 2 watts
it's that that utility that we're
providing that you know is really
solving the problem awesome and then
what does the rest of 2016 and 2017 and
Beyond hold for energies sure I mean
this this year for us is the year
fulfillment I mean last year was showing
what's capable with the technologies
people love but now that we have our
final silicon this year all it's all
about getting our evaluation kits
getting chips in our partners hands and
letting them drive to mark with the
different products that they have
envisioned so it's all about fulfillment
commercialization you know privatization
of taking our chips and our reference
designs and putting into their products
obviously the biggest question is we
hear a lot about technology and a lot of
it just doesn't it's all concepts
concepts concepts that people get
excited about and a lot of times
concepts for what the wave side how real
is one of them you know I think it's a
natural question to ask I mean I'm
always curious about new technology how
far away is it and I think you know last
year we show what's possible and we did
so charging and we did show mobility but
we still had work to do in terms of
commercial you know commercialization I
think one of the things this year that
we want to just make you know infinitely
clear to people is this is real and this
is ready and so what we did is we
actually submitted our technology to
underwriter labs ul Labs one of the
largest labs in the world that does FCC
testing as well as other testing on
equipment
they're the ones who test how long it
takes to charge different phones and put
out reports and we said you know here's
our technology
here's we show last year here's our new
receiver chips you know you do your
independent testing you tell us what
we're receiving and and then reports of
public information we announced it a
couple months ago and it demonstrated
what we've been talking about for last
year you know we can charge up to five
six Watts within five feet you know to
two and a half watts at 10 feet and one
one and a half you know watch out 15
feet and so
you know technology's real we're
actually getting you know the the amount
of power we expect with our technology
obviously it's infinitely scalable to
higher power and lower power like we're
showing showing today but I think it's
important because a lot of technologies
come out there I mean we're a public
company so when we say something you
know we have to mean it
and I think you know there's a lot of
showmanship and there are always a
showmanship in companies but for us you
know we want to let people know this is
real and that's one of the reasons we
submitted it to show that this is ready
for primetime now fantastic brilliant
and just probably one last question I do
have coming to bring it back just to the
kind of the patterns and stuff like that
here with obviously coming and trying to
do something new do you have any kind of
concerns with the FCC approval processes
or any any issues with that always just
things it's quite simple to get around I
mean no I mean FCC is is always been one
of those barriers that we have to make
sure you know it's safe and and
certainly having kids that was the first
thing I want to make sure I'm not going
to put anything out there that's not
safe and since gonna be in front of my
kids and it's a process we talked about
a year ago again you know CES kind of
took us to next level last year because
we we got a lot of you know customer
traction in particular our tier 1 our
tier ones actually has taken the lead on
our FCC approval their view is that you
know they've done hundreds of products
and FCC approval they know exactly what
it takes to do that
so we've we let them take the lead on
that we think there's a very very clear
path to getting approved certainly it
takes time I mean it's a new technology
so there's no standards for this but
there's a clear path and and we hope
that in the 2016 early 2017 you'll
certainly see it in the hands with our
Tier one in the meantime you know our
goal is to enable these other market
segments and have them launched this
year obviously with FCC approval as well
this is the year this is the years it's
gonna be the year and that is the look
of a relieved man who's like this is
finally the year has arrived it's time
it takes time for technology so it's
actually when you're trying something
new you get to the stage where you it's
almost like it becomes it starts off as
a concept a dream and then you just it's
just fulfilling it so when you were
probably gonna be the most relieved man
ever
it's like when the t1 does come up and
you're like yes
it's I mean I think it's good validation
when you see you know our different
customers I mean we're solving their
pain points but certainly we all want I
mean I want the product out there I love
to be able to use our cheer wants
product right now but you know I can't
and so we'd love to so no I mean I I
think it's every entrepreneurs dream to
see you know their creation get deployed
in sala of a pain point and I know it'll
happens it's a matter of is it three
months now six months from now a month
from now me it's gonna happen this year
and and when it does I think all of us
really you know very happy so as a
consumer I mean my kids ask me daily
when's my Hexbug gonna have it in there
I'm like you know be patient be patient
it's coming it's coming
and that's it that's that guys and it
just is pretty much gonna bring wireless
charging to everywhere in your home
that's fair enough to but yeah
absolutely fantastic well thank you very
much to Michael taking time to give us
the interview we're gonna take a look
and we're gonna obviously see some of
the cool like the miniaturization will
show you just how small wireless
charging is because if you've had a
wireless charging phone you'll realize
that the coil can be absolutely massive
in the back of that thing so kind of not
really suitable if you've got something
like a Fitbit like you said so we'll
show you that now and yeah thank you
very much Michael thank you
have an interview</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
