one class of software and his reputation
where updates are concerned there's
clean and smooth as oxygen OS is the
company has historically struggled to
get Android updates out in a timely
fashion that's all set to change with
the new gow beta for the one plus three
though which has arrived right on time
and according to promises hey guys it's
Chris Colin from Android authority here
to take a closer look at what's new in
nuga on the oneplus three first thing
tonight is that the new Gavita on the 1
plus 3 is a lot more like marshmallow on
the 1 + 3 T than it is like the
community builds that have been floating
around in recent times notification
shade is where the action is happening
we've got mini toggles up the top there
and we've also got a redesigned quick
settings area it's also now a tabbed
view so you can have multiple screens of
icons and the screen brightness slider
has moved down to the bottom of course
you can always edit the quick settings
area if you're not happy with the order
of the tiles and any changes that you
make here will be reflected in the quick
settings toggles at the top of the
notification shade let's head on into
the settings menu where you can see we
now have a new color scheme that looks
like it came straight from the pixel and
just to show you we are indeed running
Android 7.0 on the 1+3
here is the Easter Egg screen if we long
press on the screen you'll see our
customization options have changed
there's a new settings option at the
bottom there just gives you a few quick
gestures as well as the ability to
disable shelf and then in our customize
button we now just have an option to
change the size of the icons on the home
screen fortunately now you also have the
dpi scaling option from stock Android
which means you can resize the display
and everything that fits on it at a
system level which will get rid of some
of the weird resizing bugs you would
have experienced with one Plus's
implementation of it on marshmallow of
course we have shelf over on the left
hand side in place of the Google now
screen that has been slightly redesigned
some people like others will just
disable it the after all has not changed
since marshmallow on the oneplus 3 it's
the same vertical endless list with the
scrubber bar on the side for quick
access
if we open up the recent apps menu you
can see that the cards are a lot larger
than they used to be and we have a
floating action button at the bottom for
clear all which has replaced the three
options we used to have on marshmallow
split screen mode can be accessed from
here as well just as it can be in stock
Android and you can resize the windows
as you see fit
quick app switching is also on board on
the new guard beta and we'll obviously
be making its way to the final build
which will be out in December in the
display menu will now find some of the
other customization options including
nine mode which looks pretty awful as
well as themes now the default menu
option is the one you've already seen
it's a light skinned with a blue accent
color but you can also change that to
dark and then you have the option to
pick your accent color same thing goes
if you switch over to the light theme
you again
get a light overall theme but you can
change the accent colors from the
available palette unfortunately if
you're using the default option you
don't have the ability to change the
accents you'll also have access to new
guys hamburger navigation menu so no
matter how far deep you are in some
menus you'll always be able to go back
to the top level of the menu the
software update page has also got a
couple of options added from the
community builds and if we head on down
to the very bottom here in the Advanced
section you can turn on and off pocket
mode as well as joining the user
experience program if you're into that
kind of thing there's plenty of other
great new girl stuff here as well like
the app blocker so you can keep your
sensitive apps locked with your
fingerprint unfortunately there's no
launcher shortcuts so we'll just have to
wait till Android 7.1 to get those and
of course quick reply bundle
notifications notification priority data
saver all that kind of fun stuff is
onboard as well you may have noticed
that I haven't mentioned battery life
general performers or the touch latency
issue but because there's there's a
video release it doesn't make much sense
to go into too much depth on those until
the official firmware is out in the next
few weeks it's a little early to say if
the company has magically managed to
turn around its software reputation but
if this is a sign of things to come I'm
looking forward to what comes next
