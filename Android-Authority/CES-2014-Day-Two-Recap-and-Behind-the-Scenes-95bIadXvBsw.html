going on everybody and just want to give
you a quick recap of our second day here
at CES now I want to reiterate that CS
actually hasn't started yet now the
reason why is because while the show
starts but for the press people we do
have some events days before the event
actually starts now we're coming up on
that first day so we're seeing a lot
more products and this morning we were
able to take a look at some products at
asu's however we saw some great
iterations from them including a full
zenfone line including the PadFone x
which is finally coming to america which
is awesome basically it's a smartphone
that docs into a tablet body so you have
a two and one there something that you
almost never see in the android space
which is an awesome innovation at
expensive like they say they're striving
for excellence but with that in mind we
were able to go through the entire day
to sort of reeling after the president
and we did try to get a couple looks at
them but we're going to give you a more
in-depth look at those devices tomorrow
however Samsung did come out with a
great great tablet line the proline now
the naming convention might be a little
bit odd with the tab pro one word note
pro one word but now we have eight inch
10 inch and 12 inch tablets all which
have great specifications a lot of power
and add a really great experience to
what would otherwise be your smartphone
your smartphone experience I was able to
review all of them and you can see those
videos here at the android authority
channel so make sure you check them out
and one of the great things about them
is every single one of them comes with a
Snapdragon 800 and 1600 p resolution in
the screens no matter what size you get
that's awesome after that as you can see
behind me we have we are in the mirage
hotel where we have been sort of kicking
it at Pep com digital experience which
is what a lot of the vendors end up
before the actual show itself and we got
to talk to a lot of different vendors
there weren't necessarily any videos
from this particular event but we
making contacts which will flourish into
much better content much more
substantial consummation safe than just
the small glimpse that we had today that
will include a lot of bluetooth speakers
a lot of accessories and whatnot but it
also was just a great time the theme was
the Wizard of Oz so you'll see some of
the b-roll from that showing a lot of
these characters from The Wizard of Oz
running around the actual event itself
but in the end when we were here at
capcom we did get a lot of great
contacts with some great vendors we are
moving a little bit more into the
accessory space so you're going to see
what ways you can further enhance your
Android experience after that we got
some drinks we got some food and now
it's time to call it a night so that's
day 2 for you from android authority at
CES 2014 make sure you stay tuned we
have a lot of great BTS that's behind
the scenes and even more recaps telling
you what we think of what our experience
is like here at the Consumer Electronics
Show
we still got em calm coming up it has
already been going and we're going to
head over there pretty much in the next
like 10 minutes or so and cover
everything that's at that power but
after all the last two hours of editing
at my way my back is killing me so in
the middle of the mirage hotel i'm gonna
do some yoga
all the way down all the way down
voiceover 0330 123123123 slow it 2 3 1 2
