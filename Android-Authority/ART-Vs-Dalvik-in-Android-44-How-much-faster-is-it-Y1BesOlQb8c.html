name is Kevin aka the tech ninja and
today I'm going hands-on with the latest
Android runtime so grab your pens and
pencils and your paintbrush because
we're talking about art all right this
is the Nexus 5 fresh out of the box the
only thing that I did was login to my
Google account and installed a few
applications let's turn on art now
remember this functionality is still in
the developmental stages and for what
it's worth
many believe that over time this should
become more stable and be a part of
stock Android now we're going to turn on
art go into settings about phone tap on
the build version until it says you are
developer now go into the newly acquired
development menu and then select the run
time and change it to art this will then
reboot your device once we are back into
Android I'm going to do a full reboot of
the device to get a clean starting point
and as you can see the device with art
loads into Android just moments quicker
the second test I'm going to launch
YouTube drive and Flipboard then we will
switch between the applications to gauge
the overall smoothness when running
multiple applications at first glance is
hard to see the speed differences
initially but if you watch frame by
frame you can easily see that the art
device is just a tad bit quicker now I'm
going to launch asphalt 8 and see how
long it takes to go from the home screen
to the main menu and then from the menu
into the game
now for my third test I'm going to
launch the application that is known for
long load times Photoshop Touch this
application takes several seconds to
launch
on every Android device Photoshop Touch
launches a few seconds faster as well
now just a reminder the Nexus 5 uses the
Snapdragon 800 processor which is one of
the fastest chips you can get in a phone
right now so pretty much every task is
fast hopefully when KitKat arrives on
order devices enabling art will speed up
day-to-day operation for the fourth and
final test I will load up Android
authority comm on Chrome and scroll to
the page as you can see this is not a
placebo effect the differences are
apparent art does indeed speed up
day-to-day process operation of this
device although the results may not be
as mind-shattering as you'd hope don't
forget this feature is in development
and should get better with time alright
to add one more thing once you get a
device in your hand that is running art
you will notice a difference the video
may not show it but actually using it
opening applications switching between
multiple applications and even scrolling
is a significant upgrade alright once
again guys I'm Kevin aka the tech ninja
