brought to you by the LG g3 now another
great part about the LG g3 is on its
back and that is the camera right above
that back button layout but these optics
not only come with LG's great optical
image stabilization there's an enhanced
version of it oh is plus but if you look
on the left of that unit there's a
little black area and from there some
powerful lasers come out and those
lasers are made for the auto focusing
system and now the use of lasers already
sounds pretty dang cool but what you
have to know about this is it really
makes the camera experience on here not
only fast but easy hey it's Josh magar
from Android authority what's going on
everybody and this is a look at the LG
g3 s laser autofocus now before we get
started I do want to do a couple of
comments when it comes to the image
quality you will be seeing a few images
on here but I do have a video about to
the image quality a camera shootout if
you will that will show you really what
this camera is capable of but for now
we're just going to focus on the actual
interface of the camera app and also how
fast the auto focusing is because of
that laser guided system all right so
here I've set up just a little bit of a
focus test something something really
simple on the left side there we have a
pair in the middle distance in the far
distance we have a bottle of Tabasco and
then on the right a lot closer to the
camera we have of course a bottle of
Nutella because who doesn't love Nutella
but as far as the interface goes you can
see already that's very minimalistic
I'll go through the modes and whatnot a
little bit later but you can see that
there's just a row buttons on the left
and a row of buttons on the right and
the other thing that you will notice is
that the entire large screen is taken
advantage of when it comes to using the
viewfinder because you have the back
button on the bottom right so you don't
even need that row of back home and menu
or recent apps which is great because
that means you can really use this
entire screen to really frame your shot
in a nice way but we're talking about
the focusing here and it's pinpoint
precision you'll be able to really just
sort of tap the area that you want to
focus and it'll really find it nice and
quick so we'll go ahead and do that
right now you'll see me go first to the
Nutella then to the pear and then to the
bottle of Tabasco
and you can see with the bottle of
Tabasco that it is incredibly precise
and incredibly quick right there that
little tiny point on that bottle of
Tabasco which one far away it actually
doesn't take up too much of the frame
and the focusing speed no matter what I
press is something like one second maybe
even less than that it's really quick
all it does is it shoots that laser out
to see what what it bounces off of if
it's you know the focusing point that
you are tapping and once it finds that
point very easily it will be able to
just focus it because it knows the
distance of your subject now one reason
why this is actually a big deal the fact
that you can focus very quickly is that
the camera app allows you a lot of tools
that help you to get a shot off really
quickly so for example if I'm in the
locked state I can just hold the volume
down button on the back and I'll go
straight into the camera interface now
that's pretty good we can just go ahead
and tap to where we're going to be
focusing get a picture off that's really
quick like that that's already pretty
quick but the other thing you can do is
when you first get into the camera
application not from the lock screen but
from the actual OS itself it will
actually open up like this you see that
the buttons went away when I hit the
menu button well that's because now
we're in a simple tap to focus and shoot
interface and you can see it focusing
very quickly on various areas already if
I were to go up there it would focus
right there it would focus on the
Nutella bottle focus on the table you
see it's already doing its job very
quickly but once you tap on an area in
order to take a shot of it it'll just go
right away for example right there
the focus was already taken because I
have it set to focus on whatever was in
the middle but if I move it to the side
I move it even more to the side right
there see it's focusing in the moment it
gets the focus it takes the shot super
quick imagine if you were just anywhere
and we wanted to take a picture of
something really quickly you just hold
on here and it already saves the state
that the camera app was in so let me
show you that again notice that we don't
have the buttons
there so if I was to hold the down
button volume down get it ready and boom
I just had a shot already taken in
seconds flat
now a couple of last notes here
regarding OAS Plus now for those of you
that don't know
OAS or optical image stabilization is a
hardware feature in which the actual
camera optics are able to move in such a
way that even if you have shaky hands it
will stabilize so that your picture will
be sharper because you're not going to
have that little bit of shake that will
blur the photo but oh is plus is the
version found in the LG g3 that not only
has the optical image stabilization
inside of the actual hardware bits and
pieces in there it also adds to a
software stabilization that takes
advantage of the hardware and really
creates a photo that is even sharper
than before and so there you have it for
this look at the LG g3 s camera and it's
laser autofocus system along with oh is
plus that really makes the camera of the
LG g3 one of the behemoths in the market
today primarily because it is such an
easy to use camera you just have to
really turn on the camera and as long as
that interface is not showing you're in
that tap to focus and shoot interface
you just have to tap on the subject that
you want to take a picture of and then
you're done in most cases if you are
already focusing in the middle it will
already get the focus of your subject
probably before you even know it so when
you take the picture it doesn't even
have to focus anymore it's just going to
go ahead and take the photo so you can
get a lot of really great photos just
really quickly on here which is
something that I know a lot of users out
there all will really enjoy so keep it
into Android 34 further coverage of the
LG g3 I'm sure a lot of you are getting
your hands on it right now as the major
