most ambitious phone the company has
ever designed and it takes a lot of
design cues from the rest of the
industry but it still feels definitively
one plus like with any other one plus
phone most of the changes in this
iteration are happening on the outside
one plus one with an all-glass body this
time around and even added a layer of
film on the outside which gives it an
interesting silky feeling now I am a bit
nervous about all glass bodies because
cracks are a lot worse than little dings
on the aluminum one plus sent me a bunch
of really really nice cases but I think
I'm gonna go naked this time around
because I want to see how it holds up to
average use now if you look at the back
of the phone you'll find dual cameras
just like last year's iteration but this
time they've been rotated about 90
degrees these cameras are 16 and 20
megapixels just like they were in the 5t
but they actually have 19 percent bigger
pixels so they should do better in
low-light circumstances the main camera
even has optical image stabilization so
your video and photos are going to be a
lot more stable oneplus has even thrown
in some slow motion video modes which
will let you record at 4k 60fps 1080p
240fps or 720p 480 fps the selfie camera
is 16 megapixels again but the company
is promising a upgrade to a portrait
selfie mode shortly after this home
launches the selfie camera is sitting
right inside well you guessed it a notch
oneplus knows this was a questionable
design decision but they did it because
they really think that extra bit of
screen is worth it if you do use it that
extra bit of screen equates to a 19 by 9
aspect ratio as opposed to the 18 by 9
aspect ratio of the oneplus v t1 plus
does know that a lot of people really
don't like this notch though so they're
gonna give you an option to fill it in
if you want to do that now that screen
is 1080p again am i annoyed no again
1080p looks totally fine if you have a
quality AMOLED display and I really
think that people have started to care
less and less over the years whatever
AMOLED panels oneplus has been
sourcing have been consistently great so
until I start seeing some pixelation
this resolution works perfectly fine for
me for IO we've got a power button
volume rockers notification slider
bottom firing speakers USB C port and
yes the headphone jack is still there
the i/o of oneplus phones hasn't really
changed since the committee started but
I think they're right to keep these
ports for at least another generation
you'll probably notice that bigger print
reader is oblong this time kind of like
the Galaxy S 9 one of us told me they
did this as a return to roots of sorts
because all the other phones in their
line except for the 1 + 5 t had
fingerprint readers of the shape on a
software front not a lot has changed
here this is still oxygen OS running
into at 8.1 though you do have the
option of trying to enjoy P beta there
are a few minor software tweaks - things
like gaming mode which can do things
like limiting bandwidth to apps in the
background or limiting fps or resolution
while you're playing games to save your
battery more changes to the software
will probably be coming in the future
but for now this is more of a hardware
update now since this phone is all glass
you think that it had wireless charging
right well no it doesn't oneplus told me
that - charge is so much better than
wireless charging that they really
didn't deem it necessary but I would
have liked to see that option here
because they're using those materials
now this phone isn't IP rated so it's
not technically water-resistant but they
told me that they did their own internal
testing to make sure that this thing can
survive drops and puddles or even
something like the toilet the specs of
this phone are probably the most
respectable in any Android phone ever
we've got Qualcomm as latest Snapdragon
845 processor 6 to 8 gigabytes of RAM
and 64 128 or 256 gigabytes of storage
oneplus has always been known to pack
these things with the best specs on the
market and they've definitely delivered
the main thing that concerns me here is
the battery it's 3300 milliamp hours
which is the same as the 1 + 5 t now
oneplus says that the Snapdragon 845
should save about 10 percent battery
life but the extra screen real estate
has me worried that it's probably going
to drain a little bit faster than that
that's been a one plus six it's gonna
come in here black midnight black and
the eliminate edition silk white color
and those colors will dictate what kind
of RAM slash storage configuration
you're going to be able to get they'll
be available May 22nd and will cost you
five hundred and twenty nine dollars
five hundred and seventy nine dollars
and six hundred and twenty nine dollars
depending on your configuration so this
phone is $30 more than the one plus 5t
was at launch but I think these upgrades
are well worth it
whether or not you think these upgrades
are worth it are definitely up to you
