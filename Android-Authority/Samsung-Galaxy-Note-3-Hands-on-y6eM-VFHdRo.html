Authority what's going on everybody and
here is your first look at the Samsung
Galaxy Note 3 what we heard a lot of
during the event and what you may be
hearing much of during the release of
the Galaxy Note 3 is that it is the dawn
of a new design language and also the
next step in Samsung's core user
experience in a lot of ways the Galaxy
Note 3 brings everything people loved
about the note 2 into the realm of the
Galaxy s4
while adding a few new elements into the
mix in design this expectation was that
it would be more of the same from the
note 2 but we actually do see some
changes this time around thanks to some
thinner bezels we have a slightly larger
screen at 5.7 inches that has also been
bumped up to a 1080p display the note 3
oath takes almost the same footprint of
the note 2 and makes it a little
narrower and thinner while shedding some
weight at 168 grams it is pretty light
for a larger device and has a decent
balancing that echoes the galaxy s4
handling the s-pen turns out smaller
than the one found in the note 2 and as
always has neatly nestled in a slot in
the bottom corner otherwise almost
everything about the note 2 like the
button layout has been retained what is
probably the most jarring change in the
note 3 is the new general material
people who were getting tired of the
glossy plastic that Samsung has become
very well known for will likely rejoice
at the updated material used in the note
3 from the get-go you can feel the
difference in this textured plastic that
also solves the finger printing due to
not being glossy the back cover when
removed is still very thin though and
quite bendy but this is probably going
to be a still very welcome change to the
general design they even get a little
tricky and had a stitching around the
edges that makes you think like it's
leather when it's really not as a larger
screen had 5.7 inch is capable of 1080p
this Super AMOLED screen is more of the
same great display quality that Samsung
has been capable of what we are
essentially seeing here is the very good
high saturation display of the galaxy s4
only larger pixel density gets to 338
PPI which is just between the s4 and the
note 2 overall it is most of the great
display experience that Samsung has been
able to achieve with the Super AMOLED
Wild representatives that Samsung we're
pretty hush-hush regarding the processor
package inside is pretty much a given
that the Galaxy Note 3 will come with a
Snapdragon 800
walked in at over two gigahertz and
backed by the updated Torino 330
variations with the octa-core exynos
processor will be available however
noteworthy is the upgrade to three
gigabytes of RAM which allows for even
more multitasking especially considering
there's more to do with the s-pen and
added functionality that was originally
found in the s4 speed definitely felt
very good in our time with the device as
everything from UI elements and S Pen
functionality continued on very smoothly
and without any hiccups it's looking
like a very snappy and speedy experience
indeed a 3200 milliamp hour removable
battery should bring pretty good
longevity while the 16 or 32 gigabytes
of storage can be expanded with a micro
SD card on the camera front we can
basically say that the Galaxy s4 camera
has made its way to the note a quick
look into the app shows that the
majority if not all of the functions the
s4 camera introduced have been retained
it should yield the same good 13
megapixel pictures as the s4 in this
cursory glance only one noticeable
addition was a golf mode which is
essentially a drama shot made
specifically for capturing a golf swing
and finally TouchWiz has been updated to
Android 4.3 in the note 3 for Samsung
this update means the adding in of many
if not all the gesture commands
originally introduced in the Galaxy s4
this includes hand gestures smart stay
and pause and air views even though you
could do this with the s-pen already
speaking of the s-pen it has been given
a new small menu accessed by pressing
the button while hovering this gives
access to five of the most used s-pen
functions main ones are action memos
which can contextually plug your
handwriting into appropriate apps
enhanced scrapbooking and even a pen
window function that essentially puts
Samsung's version of small apps onto
your screen this is pretty much the same
TouchWiz but s-pen veterans will
probably like the easier way of getting
to their favorite functions one last
addition is the my magazine that acts
like a second screen and consolidates
your news and social media feeds in a
somewhat Flipboard fashion and so there
you have it the Galaxy Note 3 set for
release pretty soon its most exciting
new feature is probably the new material
choice which may or may not completely
solve the issues people had with
Samsung's typical plastic but you know
what it certainly helps the s-pen has
been given even more life as a users
true companion and should please with
the new air commands menu
anyone hoping for customization can take
advantage of different color cases or
smart cases of which there are plenty
with much of what the galaxy s4 offered
in a galaxy note package we might be
looking at one of the hands-down biggest
releases of the year stay tuned for our
full review once we get time with our
own units and keep on Android Authority
