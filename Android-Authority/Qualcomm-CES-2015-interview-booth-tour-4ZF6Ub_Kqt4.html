live from CES 2015 I'm here with
Michelle lately senior director of
marketing at Qualcomm and we're very
very privileged to be able to spend some
time with welcome the makers of a very
famous chip that's just released here at
CES here to talk a little bit more about
the Snapdragon 800 absolutely so we
actually have Snapdragon 800 to your
products and our newest is Snapdragon
810 very no worries very very excited to
be showing that off here at CES in our
booth and also excited to have the first
commercial device out with Snapdragon
810 which is LG G flex 2 very very
exciting you know if you followed us on
the premium tier for a while you know
that we've really been pushing the
envelope in the area of multimedia key
reason being we do a lot of consumer
research and one of the things that we
found with folks who are in that through
cutting-edge community is they really
want to have the latest and greatest
camera the best video experience the
audio experience and so we've really
been driving that on the premium tier
one of the other reasons that we do that
though is because when we design at the
premium tier point we're then able to
take all of those blocks of technologies
and we're able to scale those across the
road map so even someone who is within a
budget of maybe a hundred dollar
smartphone or seven hundred dollar
smartphone they should still get a great
experience at their price point and
that's really our mantra so we design up
at that premium point but then we're
able to scale the technology down so
what you'll see on the Snapdragon 810 is
you'll see that this is now we're on to
our third generation 4k device we can
record and playback in 4k we've added
hardware compression so hevc if you're
familiar with that dot 265 so that makes
just a much better experience you know
you don't get I always talk about the
swirling circle of death right when
you're on your video the brain don't
want that right so you want it to be a
really really smooth experience we have
our fluence pro audio you can go down to
our our theater downstairs and here
bit about a little of our audio
capability and then we've really upped
the ante on the camera so most people
that I talk to now they may own a
standalone digital camera I do but I
rarely have it with me I always have my
phone so I want my phone camera to be
fantastic and so on the 810 what we've
done is we have a dual isp but we've up
to the bitrate to 14 bit so support for
a larger sensor better camera capability
but in addition to hardware we also
offer an array of software what i would
call middleware for camera capabilities
that take advantage of our heterogeneous
computing paradigm if you will so that
we can do post processing pre and post
processing that gets a better camera
experience and you can see a little bit
of that down in the booth that's me be
checking it out great know a lot of
people really interested to know about
the DSP and audio processing and
traditionally that's an area that
Qualcomm is really excelled in we spoke
with Wolfson and others you know they've
been adopted in some of the your
competitors products but can you talk a
little bit about what call comes down in
the audio set of things absolutely so we
have two pieces on the audio side we do
have a DSP integrated into the
Snapdragon the reason we do that is you
know you know we have an SOC not just a
CPU and the reason for that is because
the pre pre eminent piece of that we
have to keep in our mind when we design
is power goes right always so you could
probably process pretty much anything on
a cpu but sometimes it's completely
overkill you don't need it so we have a
DSP it's our own technology it's
incredibly low power it runs in parallel
to the CPU and it's very very efficient
and we found that for audio and in some
cases video it's a really nice little
efficient engine and we don't even have
to bother with the CPU cores we can run
it on the DSP very low power and so we
do a lot of our audio processing in that
DSP in addition to the DSP we also have
a codec that's part of the chipset an
audio codec and we use that and we've
been able to get just really
really good quality audio and then it
takes advantage of the pairing with the
DSP to do that at low power and so we're
able to do things like you know
background noise cancellation Multi
multi signal or for multi-channel excuse
me for audio you know just be more
technology so that you're going to just
get much that's not audio it's voice but
voice is still very important so you get
a really really nice crisp voice quality
so there's lots of things that we're
doing today in the fluence problem
sometimes I think that we forget that we
actually use our smartphones for calling
you do yeah it did we've been guilty of
it too we actually haven't reviewed the
voice calling because these devices are
so incredibly powerful yeah it's a big
it's a big update for Paul come
everything's moving towards 64-bit
arguably I mean quokka makes the finest
s of C's in the world I'm just curious
to know what you see kind of coming for
tablets especially you know we obviously
attending invidious press conference
where they release the Tegra x1 and
they're calling you there superchip one
teraflops under 10 watts of power which
is qualcomm going to be kind of
delineating further and offering
separate sses for the tablets well you
know it's interesting we actually we've
always sort of been somewhat a form
factor agnostic in how we do these and
if you look at how we're growing into
the Jason sees it becomes even more
apparent I think at the end of the day
are you know from your you know what we
really focus on is low power high
performance yes and when we do our
segmentation analysis and our consumer
research obviously would look at the
segments and what we see is a lot of
consistency in those two areas right for
both especially for smartphones and for
tablets yeah there there are other
things that you have to keep in mind for
example the tablets there are some skews
you want to just have Wi-Fi only you
don't necessarily want wireless LAN
although now we see that shifting we see
a lot more wireless LAN attached so
there's the things like that so we do
skews know of the products to address
some of those but for the most part we
try to build the best SOC best
performance best feature set for user
experience from music stands experience
standpoint and at the lowest power and
it's really interesting because as we've
started to move into the adjacencies and
I'll give you an example in wearables if
you go to our wearables display you'll
see Snapdragon 400 and a lot of the
wearables Android where's is one of the
os's that we support yes and you know at
first people said really really good
yeah but it's not because when you look
at it it gets you that really low power
but it's incredibly performance oriented
in terms of running a really nice high
level OS which increasingly especially
with Android wears a high level s
increasingly wearables is looking like
it's shifting in that direction right
not and it's not just watches it's the
glasses and other types of wearables so
you know we're kind of proud of the fact
that we have stayed somewhat form factor
agnostic but we've been delivering the
feature set that allows us to sort of
extend into these other adjacent sites i
think it's to do with your articulation
Balkans philosophy when they make
products that you always use for the
highest possible pinnacle you can
achieve and then you bring down all the
building blocks down to lower segments
no with value I mean consumers crave the
fluid experience no matter what's on the
wrist around the face or in the pocket
exactly so in terms of a kind of a power
thorough put increase from snapdragon
808 hundred you look at the phone like
LG g2 which i think a lot of people
really love to tell it very well is one
of the first to support snapdragon 800
look how big of an improvement are we
looking at from going from 800 28 10
yeah you know you have to look at
feature to feature so you know we used
sort of i'll step back from it it used
to be in the old pcs days you just talk
about raw in a frequency we just call it
speeds and feeds right most consumers
these days they don't really care about
that so much they want to be fast they
don't necessarily equate a gigahertz
number too fast right in the term in the
case of LTE it has nothing to do with
that right baby put your foot right so
what we look at is what how are we
increasing the feature sets that people
care about us so it's things like going
from Adreno 420 two or four hundred
initially 24 22 for
30 right and it's increasing the
graphics capability and there's a lot of
ways to measure that right Commissioner
by pixel count but we i'd say between
420 430 we're going to get a significant
increase in graphics performance right
that's important you I gaming or post
processing the GPU has a lot to do with
your fam processing yeah so all of those
things are important for that user
experience camera we went from a single
ISP then to a duel is P then to a duel
is p14 bit well so it's it's sort of
hard for me to say it's just a blonde
number right x % kappa formal tinkers
you can't really quantify you really
have to look at what's the user to that
experience is camera going to be better
yeah because at 14 bit i'm going to be
able to support a much larger sensor and
i'm going to get a much better
experience and if you see what we're
doing with even some of our firmware or
software packages if you downstairs
we're doing and we're partnering with
some some some companies to do you know
an increase in zoom like I've you ever
tried to zoom on a mobile phone it
drives you crazy right at a very good
experience well that's a problem so
we're trying to fix that right so it's
those kinds of things that we're looking
at we're not just looking at speeds and
feeds interesting I mean I'm trying to
think of good questions to ask you you
know you seem to have a great response
for everything so in terms of the market
share call come obviously as a
commanding lead you know had LTE
dominance and a lot of markets for a
long time you know look of mature
economy like South Korea where they have
faster LTE than we have Wi-Fi in the
States if you could just throw some kind
of prognostications out there for lack
of a better term like in the future do
you feel as though a smartphone will
have a potential to take over the
majority the functions that we use the
LMT
PC or tablet whoo it's interesting you
know I heard somebody say this the other
day and I thought you know that's very
interesting way of looking at it if you
look at go back in history and you look
at sort of the history of the pc and it
used to be years ago you come in and
you'd have a desktop though and nobody
had a laptop and only people have
laptops for maybe five or ten percent of
the workforce you know say in the
enterprise that traveled right then you
know sort of time went by and and the
laptop got better and better and over
time sort of the cost curve came down so
that they were in priority would be with
the desktop and eventually that toggled
so that eighty to ninety percent of the
workforce had a desktop so it was a p
was of the the desktop the laptop
initially was sort of a companion if you
will for certain number of people to the
desktop than the desktop one away and
then you had your laptop and now
increasingly your smartphone is sort of
your companion to your laptop but
increasingly your smartphone android
tablet are starting to get so capable
yes that you sort of don't even now need
the laptop and I always challenge myself
because I'm in the industry now when I
travel I travel only with my smartphone
or tablet and I try to do everything I
want to see the pain points yeah and if
I can go back and complain about
something get somebody listen to me we
get better so you know I'm at the point
now when I travel I can pretty much do
almost anything I need to do is with
maybe the exception of really hardcore
productivity no on my phone or my tablet
yeah and even the productivity with an
external keyboard i can do a metabolite
pretty much so you know I see that
direction happening the other thing that
I think is really interesting is if you
look at what's happening in the adjacent
markets it's all be driven by the
smartphone right if you look at
wearables if you look at even automotive
in a lot of ways because i think what
happened with automotive is people start
bringing in their devices into the car
all words i give an example and i was
look at my kids because they are the
future my daughter will get in with her
phone and it's her phone she didn't want
to lose his phone it's hurtful she will
watch in the house movies on her phone
sitting in front of the big screen
killer joe scream why because no she's
going to use the TV why i say yes
beats me why because it's mine it's my
movie it's my headset I'm in my own
little world I want to watch it when she
gets in the car she wants to take that
with her well of course you know we have
DVD player in the car right today she'll
take her laptop and with her but there's
no Wi-Fi connectivity in my car not you
know and no yeah right so unless I've
got my phone on a spot it was a hot spot
she's watching the DVD player well
that's that's not good experience I mean
she wants to go in with a movie she
wants may be moved the movie to whatever
screen is in the car watch it or game
and when she gets out she wants to take
it with her but see those are the kinds
of things that are really interesting
and that's driven by mobile because it's
that mobile in and around the car that's
driving that sort of latent desire by
consumers for that kind of seamless
experience I wouldn't like to view your
carrier bills though that's a different
story that's a business model and I
think over time you'll see the business
model if I had to predict because you
know if you look at past history
business models change as to adapt and
you know I would you know I can't say
for certain tea but I would suspect that
over time business models village I will
judge expensive us consumers very more
data yeah so I mean performance of all
our devices is excellent you know the
cross line even iphone obviously and a
lot of the Android devices even at the
budget segment sub one hundred dollars
it's still pretty experienced today it's
pretty remarkable thinking how quickly
we've come so welcome as a company you
talk about pain points a lot you know
and I think that's a really really good
sort of outlook you know because then
you can find better ways to improve
things so should we just kind of expect
you know consistent improvement in
performance obvious an adherence to low
power battery life and then you know in
terms of I'm just trying to find the
words to what else exactly what else
what else is goes back to my previous
point about we don't just look at speed
the beach we look at features and user
experience so I'll give you an example
sensors yeah I mean the amount of
sensors that are now on this thing and
sensor processing and that's only going
to increase so then you think about what
else you can do with those types of
sensors about and it divides a lot of
somehow so you're going to get all these
use user experiences and these new usage
models that we probably can't even dream
up today I mean one of the things we've
talked about is you know we've looked at
in terms of consumer researches in some
parts of the world there's a real
problem with them you know understanding
within a home if there's carbon yeah
monoxide or whatever and so you have a
sensor for that right and you think you
know but in some parts of the world that
would be really important thing to
feature to have on your phone I like to
alert there was talking to someone the
other day who has a child he's a type 1
diabetic and just having an alert for
when blood sugar gets low right so
things like that that we see that are
really interesting and it's again not
just the phone or the tablet but now as
sort of the mobile mobile sort of
permeates it's in it's in your connected
home it's in your connected car you can
have access to any of that anywhere and
without necessarily having to go look
for a Wi-Fi hotspot so it's not very
n810 obviously focusing on the features
all the great stuff that you guys do
high-performance fast LTE what does
service of the rollout of you know more
advanced sses in near future are we
looking at kind of a slowing down and
kind of maturity and focusing more on
the high growth areas of emerging
markets you know some of the 6 15's and
lower the 414 well i think as i
described our paradigm is to sort of
again design at the top and and
waterfall so we cancelled out right
because of it no because that that that
premium design point is the waterfall
for everything else and so if anything I
certainly I think the refresh rate is
not flowing down people with especially
with their smartphones are refreshing we
would say every sort of one to two years
and then phones themselves tend to sort
of get handed off to it you know like
I'm done like it gets my cell phone so
they were about yoga more happy years
yeah but but but it is you know people
consumers especially as they see what
they don't have they sort of tend to
them want more you know first year
you're really happy with it and then
it's like oh darn it why doesn't do this
right so we see that that pace
continuing but because we're also
looking at these adjacencies that's
another thing to think
about so you know as we as we design
we're going to keep the adjacencies in
mind and when those adjacencies grow
into you know sort of volume businesses
you know those that's opportunity for us
to look at doing you know things
specifically maybe for that industry so
I don't I don't think we're slowing down
in the air nobody wants to slow down you
know you look at Japan or South Korea
people switch phones every six months so
if you can kind of get up to that
schedule that mean yeah exactly oh very
cool well I want to say a huge thank you
thank you which creates interest no
absolutely interesting what you're doing
great continue to push the envelope and
deliver great experience for consumers
and as always you know we're grateful
for your support sounds good thank you
very much it okay all right starts look
away from CES 2015 hero's welcome
