create more than just smartphones with
their growing Nexus name and in a
partnership with a soos what came out of
it was the Nexus 7 a 7-inch tablet just
outside the comfort of one hand but in
the intersection of Portability and
power it sold like crazy primarily
because of its very affordable price
point but a lot changes in a year
smartphones grew to 5 inches and device
performance while just continued to grow
so the masses demanded an update and
last week we finally got one with
another year of further Nexus experience
under their belts have Google and Asus
created one of the best tablets ever hey
it's Josh of agar from Andhra Authority
what's going on everybody and this is
the Google Nexus 7
I'm going to go at some length about
design the new Nexus 7 is thinner
narrower and lighter than the original
further perfecting the 7-inch form
focusing on the front you see that the
side bezels have been shrunken down and
any space that was created by doing so
has been shaved off what you get is a
narrower profile that is almost 6
millimeters less than that of last
year's Nexus 7 the bezels at the top and
bottom basically stay the same and I
think that's pretty genius
but more on that in a bit the power
button and volume rockers remain above
where your right hand would land when
you come around the back that dimpled
design of the original has been done
away with for a slightly rubberized
material that makes grip even easier
couple this with the thinner profile and
narrower sides and you get a very
comfortable one handed grip in the very
corner you get a new rear facing five
megapixel camera and stereo speakers
that adorn the top and bottom or sides
depending on how you hold it the new
Nexus 7 is quite a looker slim sleek
simple but I really think that in design
they've truly figured it out you can
infer this from the Nexus logo on the
back it is now sideways implying that
this tablet is at its best one in
landscape mode the bezels support this
first let's say you're reading Flipboard
in portrait mode the thin bezels slim
profile and lightweight make it easy for
your one hand to perform the most
important tasks without any strain or
discomfort and when you need a better
grip you can really wrap your hand
around the entire device but then put
the Nexus 7 on its side keeping the
bezels thick at the top and bottom of
this tablet lets you get great
positioning on your gripping hand
without accidentally touching the screen
control is then easy and simple you've
heard me say before that I love black
slate designs that means a design that
is simplistically elegant and
unobtrusive so that it never gets in the
way of what is most important because
when you turn on that screen the
possibilities feel endless as a tablet
has easy to carry hold and throw around
as this the Nexus 7 is currently as
black slate as you can get
in just one year we've seen an
incredible boom of 1080p displays on
handheld devices the new Nexus 7 joins
that trend with a screen also capable of
323 PPI what results is one of the
sharpest midsize displays available
since a device this size is typically
geared towards reading rest assured that
the new Nexus 7 will be your new hub for
e-books magazines web news and the like
everything is crisp and sharp even
smaller text more on the media side the
screen delivers very good color range
and never struck me as dull viewing
angles are all great and the brightness
of this display helps it remain useful
even in the daylight gamers rather
quickly disappointed by the lack of
payoff in the original Nexus 7's gaming
promises we'll find them rekindled with
this new version the higher resolution
and overall better quality screen makes
gaming a treat overall you have a Nexus
7 that has leptin - the technology
present and this screen is a great
example of that
the original Tegra 3 powered Nexus 7
promised great performance at an
affordable price but users have been
recently complaining about lag stutter
and overall slowness in their 7-inch
tablets in that time that the Tegra 3
supposedly aged many other processing
packages have been able to prove their
worth plenty of people are using the s4
pros of yesteryear and they remain happy
just ask a nexus 4 user so this new
Nexus 7 took to that same package to
bring affordable performance the
Snapdragon s4 pro clocks in at 1.5
gigahertz and is backed by the tried and
true Adreno 320 and a bump up to 2
gigabytes of RAM scores remain high for
this package definitely higher than last
year's model in practice I have yet to
notice any real hiccups and all tasks
speed very well and multitasking
remained a breeze you don't necessarily
need the cutting edge to get great and
reliable performance and it shows in
this Nexus 7 simplicity is the general
idea when it comes to hardware in the
Nexus device you don't get a microSD
card slot or removable batteries but
where it counts the Nexus 7 looks to
deliver the base model comes with 16
gigabytes of storage with a 32 gigabyte
model available the bits underneath are
largely standard with Wi-Fi GPS
Bluetooth and NFC though now you can
charge this tablet with a qi wireless
charging
the real story here though is the sound
we know that front-facing stereo
speakers can be incredible but on this
nexus 7 they're still found on the rear
that's fine however because the stereo
sound from these speakers is a vast
improvement they are surprisingly loud
for a device this size and at higher
volumes offer pretty rich sound
at lower volumes however that richness
does taper off and some sort of noise or
hiss is audible it's a minor quip but it
is still noticeable with claims of nine
hours for video and 10 hours for web
browsing some real optimization must
have gone into what is actually a
smaller battery than last year's model
brought down to 39 50 milliamp hours you
get a smaller unit in this Nexus 7 than
before but it still does hold up in a
video looping test I got the battery
down to 75% in just under two hours
making a full rundown possibly cracked
seven hours standby time has been
greatly improved without plugging in the
Nexus 7 for overnight charging I found
that I had just about the same amount of
power
the morning after with somewhat moderate
usage you should be able to get a full
day and a half out of this tablet one of
the more significant updates to the
Nexus 7 is the inclusion of a 5
megapixel camera where previously there
was none it's a nice addition for a
tablet in this midsize for those moments
when you need just a simple shot and
really nothing too fancy because that's
what you get the camera app brings all
the usual capabilities you get in a
stock Android camera app and that
includes photosphere picture quality is
decent enough but nothing to get too
excited about the camera on the new
Nexus 7 is largely a feature that is
somewhat required but is far from a
selling point software is another place
where the Nexus 7 has an advantage as it
is the only device currently to ship
with the newest version of Android
version 4.3 to be fair this new
incremental update is no overhaul and
the changes added in may not be overtly
noticeable the main new feature you may
or may not use is with multi-user
restricted profiles essentially the user
gets more control over what content is
available for other users registered on
the device I do notice some improved
smoothness and overall speed that has
definitely been increased but ultimately
this is stock Android the way you
remember it as a Nexus device of course
it will be privy to new updates before
any other devices and that's always been
a draw
finally price the original Nexus 7
somewhat revolutionized tablet
expectations when it came at such a
great price point for this base model of
the new Nexus 7 at 220
in dollars what are you getting for
those 30 extra dollars simple you get
enhancements that now make the Nexus 7
possibly the best tablet available now
last year's Nexus 7 was a great start
that some say helped energize the tablet
craze and this year's model gets closer
to perfecting the form great power in an
easily accessible package sleek and
elegant design hiding reliable and fast
performance and quite simply an
experience that I think anyone can love
when a tablet has the ability to reach
everyone from general user to music
addict to power gamer and everything in
between I think that gives it the right
to be called one of the best and so
