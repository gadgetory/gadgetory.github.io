hands on a samsung galaxy note 6 well
there isn't going to be one at all now
this is all because Samsung is going to
unveil the galaxy note 7 this summer
completely bypassing the six according
to a new report published today in South
Korea Samsung is planning to skip the
six entirely and go straight to seven
and a move that Microsoft will no doubt
be familiar with according to ET news
they said this Samsung has decided to
skip over the galaxy note 6 to eliminate
any inconsistency with an image that can
occur as numbers of two product brands
are different now I know what you're
thinking huh well in much simpler terms
an unnamed source claimed this if you
have a galaxy note 6 you have a model
number lower than the galaxy s7 which is
the newest model and it could give the
feeling that you have an outdated phone
hence Samsung's decision now let's move
on the news from 1 plus who has some
good news for you virtual reality geeks
because launching new devices and
virtual reality events is already so
passe samsung did it and so did Google
last week at Google i/o 1 plus now wants
to offer the world's first global
shopping experience via VR the company
has teamed up with aunt VR to offer a
headset called loop VR pairing it with a
device will allow you to explore the
loop 1 plus his own little virtual space
station complete with a section where
you can actually purchase a 1 plus 3
ahead of everyone else now they are now
out of stock for the moment but they
were giving away the virtual reality
headset with the purchase of a 1 plus 3
now let's talk motorola motorola
recently filed for the trademark moto z
the trademark covers mobile phones smart
phones and accessories thereof namely
battery chargers and adapters the
application should not be taken as
conclusive proof but it does support the
venture be report from last week that
claimed Motorola would change the name
of its flagship phone to moto Z the Moto
Z or new Moto X will launch on jun 9th
in San Francisco according to a press
invite leaked by the generally reliable
hello moto HK the leak also mentions the
names of these so called amps that
Lenovo will be presumably launching
together with the Moto Z these are the
pro camera adventure theater stereo
power and style big in the news is also
that Google is pressuring OEM partners
for faster updates mother Google may
soon adopt a new tactic to encourage
partners to do their fair share of
housework regarding Android the search
giant has reportedly elected to create a
ranking system to publicly shame
manufacturers and carriers who take
their sweet time to roll out Android
updates the same system seeks to reward
fast adopters by making the fruits of
their efforts public knowledge or in the
words of androids hiroshi lock heimer at
Google i/o last week quote it's not an
ideal situation Android updates are the
weakest link in the security chain for
Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
