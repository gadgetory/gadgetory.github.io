northern Pakistan you may have seen this
bug droid pissing on apple literally
Google is issued a statement to the
Washington Post apologizing for the now
removed image of a bug droid peeing on
an Apple logo in Google Maps Google
spokesperson Mara Harris says we're
sorry for this inappropriate user
created content we're working to remove
it quickly we also learn from these
issues and we're constantly improving on
how to detect prevent and handle bad
edits user created content a no I think
someone at Google lost their job so
let's start off with Sony's flagship the
Sony Xperia z4 it's official at least in
Japan the Sony Xperia z4 is equipped
with a 5.2 inch full HD LCD panel and as
mentioned before it is thinner than the
Xperia z3
measuring six point nine millimeters in
depth keeping things moving along is the
Snapdragon 810 system-on-a-chip a 64-bit
octa-core chipset backed by three
gigabytes of RAM internal storage offers
just 32 gigabytes so far with the
ability to add up to 128 gigabytes via a
microSD card now the back side of the
device offers a familiar 20.7 megapixel
shooter capable of an ISO of up to 12
thousand 800 with camera shake
correction out of there boyens image
processor video captures up to 4k or
1080p at 60 frames per second the front
shooter is a modest 5.1 megapixel with
full HD video capture despite the
exposed USB port the Sony Xperia z4 is
dust proof and near perfect waterproof
and comes with a choice of colors from
white black copper and aqua green now
for those of you who are looking for a
more mid-range option let's talk the
Xiaomi me 4i the Xiaomi me for AI was
announced earlier this week a powerful
mid-range device with an impressive
price tag of roughly 200 bucks
the me 4i features a 5
Full HD display at Snapdragon 615
octa-core processor 2 gigabytes of RAM
16 gigabytes of onboard memory a 13
megapixel rear camera and a dual tone
LED flash with a 5.1 megapixel front
camera and with the bevy of software
features including beautify mode the
main camera is the identical 13
megapixel shooter found on the
higher-end me Note and offers a suite of
Shami enhancements to the HDR mode and
more there's also a beefy 3120 milliamp
hour battery in the meze for eyes 7.8
millimeter thick body which is actually
slightly better than the new fours this
is a dual SIM device with both slots
accepting LTE cards the me 4i is the
first Xiaomi device to run 5.0 lollipop
which includes a number of features
designed for the Indian market like
visual IVR which simplifies dealing with
automated phone systems typically
encountered in customer service it also
includes support for six Indian
languages hindi bengali telugu tamil
kannada malayalam now for those of you
in the market for a new android wear
watch you'll be happy to know that
android wear just got a lot more
powerful android wear now supports
watches with built-in Wi-Fi and the good
part is that the watch doesn't need to
be on the same Wi-Fi network as the
smart phone that means for instance that
you can leave your phone on the charger
on your desk and go on about your day
and still get notifications from it as
long as both devices are connected to
the internet now let's talk new gestures
for apps and contacts previously
accessing the apps on your device
required several swipes and taps which
made it feel a bit cumbersome now
getting the app screen is as easy as
tapping on the time while accessing
contacts is done by swiping to the left
voice commands are now accessible
through another swipe you know that neat
handwriting app that Google just
launched in the Play Store last week
it lets you convert your scribbling into
an emoji not just letters and now the
same feature is available on Android
wear so for instance you can doodle a
heart or a smiley face to quickly answer
a message with their respective emoji
pretty sweet and for those times when
you can't use two hands but you still
need to go through your Google now cards
a new wrist twist gesture will let you
do just that
now the Samsung Galaxy s6 versus the
iPhone 6 battle rages on and we found a
result about which device is perhaps the
best gaming device and the results are
not going to be what you think there's
no denying that the Samsung Galaxy s6
and the Apple iPhone 6 are two of the
best smartphones on the market right now
not only when it comes to aesthetics but
also performance Samsung's Exynos 7420
processor backed by three gigabytes of
RAM definitely gives apples a8 processor
with 1 gigabyte of RAM a run for its
money but when it comes to gaming which
device comes out on top the folks over
at gain bench put the Galaxy s6 in the
iPhone 6 to the test to find out which
device is the better gaming smartphone
the game bench team picked a series of
10 high-end games to run on each device
in the hopes to find out which
smartphone would run the smoothest while
achieving the highest average frame rate
as you can see from the graphic here
Apple's iPhone 6 was the clear winner in
this test when it came to performance
and overall stability game bench
explains the iPhone 6 tended to run
games more smoothly with a higher frame
rate that was very stable and rarely
dropped below 30 frames per second the
galaxy s6 came a pretty close second
with a greater frequency of performance
bottlenecks that pushed the frame rate
below the 30 frames per second threshold
hmm that burns a little bit maybe that's
where this came from thanks for watching
