Android authority and III is finally
over as you can probably tell from the
background here I'm actually coming at
you from the house that we have rented
here in LA but I wanted to quickly make
a video and talk about the game that I
got to check out from mad fingers called
unkilled and this is basically another
zombie shooter from mad fingers a very
similar to dead trigger and dead trigger
too so you're in a post-apocalyptic
world where you have to fend off zombies
and you have a bunch of different
weapons but there are differences from
dead trigger it's not entirely a rehash
of that game but you'll find a lot of
similarities as far as the missions go
and the graphics look very familiar but
the graphics do look a little bit better
than what we've seen from dead trigger 2
and the first dead trigger as well but
it does it is a great looking game and
if you played the previous dead row
games they'll feel very familiar to you
the missions are all very similar you
have missions where you go out and
though your objective is to kill a
certain amount of zombies or your
objective is to protect someone or snipe
ssam bees from a distance things of that
nature you'll find a lot of those
missions here in this game now there are
in-app purchases with this game just
like there are with a lot of other
madfinger games so you can buy things if
you want to advance yourself a little
bit quicker but obviously you don't have
to do that if you don't want to and the
game itself is actually free as far as
the actual gameplay goes there's over
300 missions in this game so that's a
lot of mission so you should be able to
play this game for a really long time
and obviously mad fingers will keep this
game updated and continually add more
missions to the game to keep you
entertained and the weapons there's over
50 weapons to pick from so rocket
launchers melee weapons long and
short-range weapons all that can be
found in this game to help you through
the game and kill all the zombies and
there's also some perks in this game as
well so for example you have a perk
where you can actually fire rockets at
zombies which I thought was one of the
coolest perks in the game so if you're
in a crowded room you're being bombarded
by zombies
just fire off a couple of missiles and
it basically wipes them all out so it's
really cool and one of the other new
things that they added to unkilled is
when zombies get close to you you'll
just automatically kick them and then
you can just start firing at them to
finish them off but it's a really cool
looking game obviously it just kind of
feels like a rehash of Dedrick or two
but the game is still great either way
so it'll be coming to Android and iOS
this summer so if you love zombie
shooter type games make sure to check
this one out it's definitely a lot of
fun but that's really it that's all I
really have to say about unkilled from
Mad fingers if you enjoyed this video
please give it a thumbs up down below we
definitely appreciate it and also
subscribe to the channel which is also
down below and even though I'm back at
the house here there's still some more
III coverage that we have coming your
way so don't forget to check that out as
well and as always thank you so much for
watching
keep it locked here on android authority
because we are your source for all
things Android and e3 2015</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
