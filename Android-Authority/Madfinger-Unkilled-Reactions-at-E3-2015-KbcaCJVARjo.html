android authority and III is finally
over as you can probably tell from the
background here I'm actually coming at
you from the house that we have rented
here in LA but I wanted to quickly make
a video and talk about the game that I
got to check out from mad fingers called
unkilled and this is basically another
zombie shooter from mad fingers a very
similar to dead trigger and dead trigger
2 so you're in a post-apocalyptic world
where you have to fend off zombies and
you have a bunch of different weapons
but there are differences from dead
trigger it's not entirely a rehash of
that game but you'll find a lot of
similarities as far as the missions go
and the graphics look very familiar but
the graphics do look a little bit better
than what we've seen from dead trigger 2
and the first dead trigger as well but
it does it is a great looking game and
if you played the previous d'Ãªtre games
they'll feel very familiar to you the
missions are all very similar you have
missions where you go out and though
your objective is to kill a certain
amount of zombies or your objective is
to protect someone or snipe some bees
from a distance things of that nature
you'll find a lot of those missions here
in this game now there are in app
purchases with this game just like there
are with a lot of other madfinger games
so you can buy things if you want to
advance yourself a little bit quicker
but obviously you don't have to do that
if you don't want to and the game itself
is actually free as far as the actual
gameplay goes there's over 300 missions
in this game so that's a lot of mission
so you should be able to play this game
for a really long time and obviously mad
fingers will keep this game updated and
continually add more missions to the
game to keep you entertained and the
weapons there's over 50 weapons to pick
from so rocket launchers melee weapons
long and short range weapons all that
can be found in this game to help you
through the game and kill all the
zombies and there's also some perks in
this game as well so for example you
have a perk where you can actually fire
rockets at zombies which I thought was
one of the coolest perks in the game so
if you're in a crowded room you're being
bombarded by zombies
you just fire off a couple of missiles
and it basically wipes them all out so
it's really cool and one of the other
new things that they added to unkilled
is when zombies get close to you you'll
just automatically kick them and then
you can just start firing at them to
finish them off but it's a really cool
looking game obviously it just kind of
feels like a rehash of dead trigger 2
but the game is still great either way
so it'll be coming to android and iOS
this summer so if you love zombie
shooter type games make sure to check
this one out it's definitely a lot of
fun but that's really it that's all I
really have to say about unkilled from
mad fingers if you enjoyed this video

definitely appreciate it and also
subscribe to the channel which is also

the house here there's still some more
III coverage that we have coming your
way so don't forget to check that out as
well and as always thank you so much for
