android authority we just want to kind
of give a quick recap i went through a
session earlier this is my first i/o
which in turn this was my first session
today it was a google+ fireside chat and
what that was was there was a lot of
people working on google+ in various
areas of interest with google+ and they
were just they just had a panel up on
stage there was really opening it up to
the audience for questions what i
learned as a user was that google+ is
really meant to keep you socially
engaged to be a little bit personal as
an editor with android authority
sometimes we wonder why we can't just
write on android authority and it
populates directly to google plus the
reason for that is they don't want sites
not particularly us but any kind of site
to spam your stream so you don't get
inundated with information you may or
may not want obviously you know that in
your circles you can adjust how much
information gets through but another
stopgap to that is they don't want
certain sites just spamming your stream
with everything we get some questions
where people say ask us why did I find
it on the site but I didn't see it on
your Google+ stream and part of that is
because we don't want to spam you and
with Google+ not making their API public
to where sites can't automatically post
to their stream that's just another
stopgap that's what I learned is a user
another thing is they want to learn as
much about you as possible that's why
when you look at things like the maps
where it'll suggest things that your
friends are interested in like
restaurants they get that information
from google plus it's about knowing as
much about you as humanly possible or as
googly possible i guess we could say
that's just meant to enhance your
experience another thing I took away
from this conference is google i/o is
very developer centric as such there's a
lot of very technical questions that
were going on in there
I don't necessarily know a lot about the
developer side effect I know a little
bit enough to where it makes sense to me
but in terms of getting very deeply
involved that's just not me and it's
probably not you so that is something to
keep in mind if you're ever interested
in going to I up this is a developer
conference as such the developers are
the ones that need to learn and take
away and they're the ones that are going
to be discussing a lot of what's going
on here so things things like coding and
things like that don't make sense to you
you're really not going to learn a lot
here and it's josh of a garden manager
30 what's going on everybody I to
attended a session here at Google i/o as
Nate was saying it's it's really not
that kind of conference for a lot of
users consumers who are looking for
products or the new announcements for
particular devices though that will
happen at i/o from time to time the vast
majority of the conference that you're
here for is for developing sessions a
lot of them are about creating software
the best practices different tips that
you would have for it in my case I went
to a session that was a little bit
offbeat which was nice it was about
leveraging YouTube for business I
figured I'd see what they had to say for
that for the most part I will say as a
critique it was pretty much a lot of it
was stuff that we kind of already know
but there were some nice tips in there
like for example make sure you making
sure to follow certain trends they were
telling people not to be afraid to
follow particular trends that might be
happening now on YouTube and just kind
of use that to your advantage to gain
more for example using a Harlem shake
like everyone did a couple months ago
but that was uh that was one of the tips
I was something that you kind of already
know but it is nice to be reminded that
you can you can go that route if you
want to have some fun with it but for
the most part like Nate said this this
really is not a conference for
particularly everybody it already costs
a lot to come here if you're not pressed
or anything like that if you want to
just attend as a patron it costs two
thousand dollars which actually for the
most part was redeemed when they did
give out all of those chrome pixels
chromebook pixels to everybody but it
may not happen quite the same way for
other iOS they do take care of you
though there's a lot here too
to to partake in like junk food on every
single floor free soda free water free
food all this stuff if they do Google
really does take care of you but as just
as a ploy to everybody that might be
watching this just letting you know
Google i/o is a lot of fun but if you're
coming here only for the fun stuff it
may not be particularly worth it
considering there are more people who
come here because they're learning and
because they're contributing to the
Google space to enter Android spaces a
google plus space to the YouTube space
even it may not be quite for you but you
know we're here to let you know what's
going on here at Google i/o and we're
having a lot of fun bringing all this
content to you so thank you for watching
and stay tuned because we got even more
for you tomorrow at the last day of
Google i/o 2013 so guys that's a quick
rundown of what a session at Google i/o
is all about it's really about
developers so Josh and I are going to
continue to roam around and find some
more cool stuff to look at so stay tuned
to our YouTube channel and you'll see
some really cool videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
