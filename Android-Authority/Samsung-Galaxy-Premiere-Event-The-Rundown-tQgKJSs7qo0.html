what's going on everybody and as you can
see behind me everyone has filed out of
the premier event and now they have
their hands on the galaxy tab s tablets
by samsung so with that in mind you know
what time it is it's time for the
rundown so as far as the event goes it
was pretty standard affair now you might
see this video coming out just a little
bit later than did the actual events and
the reason why is because I actually
wanted to get the live stream footage
instead of using the footage that I had
on my camera because I had to conserve
battery life nonetheless though then was
pretty standard there was a lot of
fanfare about these AMOLED screens
obviously Samsung is putting a lot into
their AMOLED screens and I'm actually
standing right beside one of the tab
into color advertiser's that's what
sliding me right now and it was pretty
much all over the place being able to
see the different technologies and also
the different ways that they're
implementing the AMOLED technology and I
will say I never really knew that there
was so much you could say about just a
screen and I think that's actually kind
of cool the fact that the adaptive
lighting is there so that if you have
particular types of lighting above you
it will adapt to that and give you a
better looking image that is something
that I was able to see during my
briefing and you will see that footage
right now and it does work but the
reason why I didn't really focus on it
too much is because I would love to see
it in a real-world setting where you're
going in and out of the house for
example and it was a very controlled
environment there are obviously so you
will be able to see what the adaptive
lighting would look like under those
particular conditions but even if there
is going to be an improvement with these
particular AMOLED screens over LCD
screens or more conventional screams
when it comes to being out in the
daylight I'm not too sure if it's going
to be that big of a change but even if
it's just a little bit I suppose that's
something to be excited about and then
later on in the presentation we saw a
lot of the reasons why this AMOLED
screen was being pushed so hard and from
from my perspective I saw it as an
opportunity for samsung to create
partnerships with a lot of companies and
you saw a lot of them there were
publications like National Geographic
and also netflix netflix is going to be
making 1080p ready content for these
particular tablets it's going to be one
of the first tablets to get that full HD
treatments from netflix but you already
have a bunch of different lines of
tablets but they're going to come out
with yet
another one you kind of have to question
and think to yourself well do we really
need another line well amoled apparently
is Samsung's forte and they're really
putting a lot of their effort into it so
I don't really blame them for wanting to
really push it and if they're going to
put it on their tablets it is an
improvement as you've seen in my videos
already I believe you can see that the
contrast and the you have darker blacks
inside of the AMOLED screens as compared
to the other LCD screens from previous
tablet offerings from Samsung you do see
a difference and it is a pleasant change
and AMOLED screens are actually really
easy on the eyes they are really nice to
look at they might be over saturated at
times but it does provide you much
higher contrast which might end up being
a much more enjoyable experience that is
true but I did question a little bit on
the way here if AMOLED screens were
really supposed to be the main trump
card for this new line of tablets was it
really enough to justify a whole new set
well luckily Samson did have a few of
the tricks up their sleeve not only with
the technology behind the screen but
also with all the partnerships that they
have and I will admit that it all sort
of came together in the end personally I
don't really use tell this as much
anymore and when it comes to these
particular tablets i'm not sure if they
would make me use tablets more often
just because of an AMOLED screen and a
few of the goodies that are inside but
once I get my hands on it i will use it
for a little while and see if that does
change because i have plenty of fun on
my 5.5 inch screen devices already
anyway so that's just the rundown in a
little bit of my commentary on this
particular event I just wanted to give
you some of my thoughts on there if you
