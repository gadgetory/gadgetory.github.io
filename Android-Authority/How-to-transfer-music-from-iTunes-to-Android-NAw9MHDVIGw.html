and organizer and if you have an Apple
device such as an iPhone 5 he can easily
sync your music collection from iTunes
to iPhone and vice versa but what if you
have an Android instead of an iPhone 5
can you still sync your iTunes music
collection with your Android phone hi
I'm mark welcome to Android Authority in
this video I'll teach you how to
transfer music from itunes to your
Android phone one way to transfer your
iTunes music collection from your
desktop to your Android phone is by
manually copying the music files this is
actually easier than it sounds so it's a
manual method first create a temporary
folder on your computer desktop then in
iTunes select the music tracks that
you'd like to copy drag and drop the
selected music tracks into the temporary
folder on your desktop
afterwards connect your Android phone as
a storage device to your computer then
copy the files from computer to phone
easy right there are also other easy
methods that allow direct transfer of
music files from iTunes itself to your
Android phone such methods however need
third-party tools double twist this one
such third-party tool for both Mac and
Windows that lets you sync music videos
and playlists from itunes to your
Android phone but there's a catch to use
double twist your Android phone must
support the USB mass-storage protocol
here's how to use double twist first
download install and launch double twist
on your computer then connect your phone
to the computer via USB cable making
sure to enable USB mass storage mode on
the phone your phone will be listed
under devices and double twist
click your phone's device name on the
list to view the device info page from
here you can copy all music from itunes
to your Android phone like this or you
can copy music files via playlists for
this you'll need to import your iTunes
playlist to doubleTwist
thereafter just mark the playlists that
you want to sync to your phone hit the
sync button and presto all music files
associated
the playlists are also synced to your
phone you can also drag and drop
individual or multiple music titles in
doubleTwist
like this if you want to tangle free
wireless way to transfer your iTunes
music from desktop to your Android phone
you'll find the air sync app quite handy
it's a paid add-on app for doubleTwist
for air sync to work install double
twist on both your computer and Android
phone both devices must also be
connected to the same network first
enable and configure air sync on your
phone to do this launch double twist go
to the settings tab and enable air sync
then select setup air sync and the five
digit passcode will appear on the screen
take note of the passcode launch double
twist on your computer you will find
your device's name with the air sync
logo under devices click on your devices
name you will see the passcode entry
screen enter the passcode to pair your
phone with your computer once the
computer and phone are securely paired
via air sync you can now transfer your
iTunes music wirelessly to your Android
phone
another alternative app for wireless
syncing is the sync Tunes for iTunes app
which has both free and paid versions it
works in a very similar way to ear sync
the free version comes with ads and
allows you to sync only one playlist or
category at a time with a maximum of 100
songs in the paid version though this
restriction is removed here's an
overview of how to use sync tunes for
iTunes first download and install sync
tunes on your Android phone and the sync
tunes desktop client on your Windows PC
run the sync Tunes app on your phone and
take note of the unique IP address at
the bottom of the screen open the
desktop client of sync tunes and type
the unique IP address displayed on your
phone once the phone in PC are connected

playlists on the screen to transfer all
of your music from itunes to Android
select music and click sync a window
will appear asking for your confirmation
to start the syncing process click yes
to continue you will see a confirmation
message once syncing is complete the
steps for syncing your iTunes music with
your Android phone is that easy you can
now see your music files
stored on your Android phone although
iTunes &amp;amp; Android represent two of the
world's greatest yet fiercely competing
companies they're not necessarily
mutually exclusive products as I've
shown in this video you can easily
transfer music from your iTunes
collection to your Android phone through
several ways I hope you find this video
