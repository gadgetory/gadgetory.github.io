for mother google google plans to take
over your public transit and parking at
least in the US Google's parent company
alphabet also owns sidewalk labs and the
Guardian has obtained documents and
emails that detail a proposal made by
sidewalk labs to the city of Columbus
Ohio of all places it essentially allows
Google to assume control over the city's
public transit and parking system the
information was obtained through public
record laws and details of an offer made
by sidewalk labs to provide the City of
Columbus with its cloud-based program
called flow for free flow would put the
city's public transit public parking and
transit subsidy program under the
control of Google sidewalk labs would
also extend the offer of a hundred Wi-Fi
kiosks the same ones used in its NYC
Wi-Fi project here's what the guardian
says about flow and I quote flow applies
Google's expertise in mapping machine
learning and big data to thorny urban
problems such as public parking numerous
studies have found that 30 percent of
traffic in cities is due to drivers
simply seeking parking spots unquote so
not only would flow help you find a
parking space
it could also ease traffic congestion by
up to a third field testing technology
like this is a large part of why
sidewalk labs wants to build a city of
its own it needs full scale environments
in which to test out its own
technologies and theories on urban
planning traffic management public
transit and of course superfast internet
as for how flow will work in practice
here's the guardian's explanation and I
quote flow will use camera equipped
vehicles like Google Street View cars to
count all the public parking spaces in a
city and read roadside parking signs it
would then combine data from drivers
using Google Maps with live information
from city parking meters to estimate
which spaces are still free arriving
drivers will be directed to empty spots
but sidewalk labs proposal isn't just
about getting you a parking space more
quickly the emails and documents also
detail a pitch to get businesses to
temporarily rent out parking spaces
otherwise reserved for employee
or shoppers there's also a proposal for
variable pricing based on demand for
example higher prices on weekends at
sporting events recreation areas etc the
public transit system could also be
revolutionized with the help of Google
Maps the plan outlines how Google Maps
could be updated to include all public
transit options as well as the means to
pay for them
this would include trains subways taxis
buses uber lyft and even car and bike
sharing services you see a resident
would simply plug in a destination and
be presented with all the available
transit options including the ability to
buy public transit tickets as well as
pay for taxis and other car services
this would not only be a massive
convenience for residents but it also be
massively beneficial to Google itself of
course if you guys remember from like 15
years ago when people were making money
hands over fist in the dot-com bubble
remember we didn't call it a dotnet
bubble or dot org bubble we didn't call
them dot biz billionaires we called them
dot-com billionaires because that's the
power of a dot-com now why is that
because no domain name extension tells
your story with the same degree of trust
as a dot-com or dotnet domain name.com
and dotnet domain name extensions inject
credibility into your online presence
save 15% on domain names and web hosting
when you use our coupon code Android at
domain.com check out when you think
domain names think domain.com so what do
you guys think does this scare you guys
let me know in the comments below I'll
be looking forward to reading them
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
