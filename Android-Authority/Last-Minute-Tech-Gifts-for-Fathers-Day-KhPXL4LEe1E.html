in you and when you were a young and he
said something like I can't help
thinking you might really amount to
something if you touch your mind and as
a dad I can tell you that most dad's
really want just one thing for Father's
Day a big hug and a heartfelt thanks for
doing a thankless job but if you want to
add to your dad's man cave we can help
you there just make sure you don't leave
it all in the hands of the mother
because if it's up to her it'll be
breakfast in bed he'll get flowers and
some shiatsu massage by a white guy with
a ponytail named Carlos so right off at
the top for a geek dads who love sound
and portability and don't want to be
hung up by a headphone they want to fill
the room with sound that's where bose
soundlink mini comes in the features
that stand out here is that it connects
via bluetooth or a one-eighth auxiliary
import it ranges up to 30 feet has up to
seven hours of battery life and includes
a charging cradle and the most compact
speaker that Bose offers now the one
downside and that's not really a
downside is that it really can't compare
with a full speaker system seems obvious
but it should be said that it's not
going to provide you with the same low
rich frequency that some bass lovers
might be looking forward to you're
really going to need a full stereo sound
system for that but if you love
portability this has outstanding sound
next up is the jaybird a blue bud ex and
in my opinion I've had them myself for a
long time they are the best buds out
there for the price so the two big
issues with most people who use ear buds
is the fact that they don't stay in your
ear very well if you're very active and
to the cords get tangled and wrapped
around things that they shouldn't and
the jaybird deals with this very very
well they have something called the ear
cushion and it takes a little bit of
doing to fit in the ear you got to find
the right one for your ear there's
different sizes and once you know how to
secure it properly it stays in your ear
better than any other buds I've ever
used and the chords itself is not
springy it's not coiled and so it
doesn't tend
to wrap around things like other types
of chords would I like it a lot I really
have nothing bad to say about it other
than the fact that they are a little bit
at the expensive end now for those of
you who love comfort and high quality
sound we got to talk the m50x in the box
includes a protective carrying pouch
which really comes in handy a six point
three millimeters screw on adapter a
three metre straight cable a 1.2 meters
straight cable and a three metre coiled
cable the positives here is that there
are great looking headphones fantastic
build quality has excellent sound for
the price and long cords are provided
now the negatives is that the cords are
proprietary cords if you lose them break
them you have to buy those specific
cords again from audio technica and the
sound stage is somewhat lacking so for
all you audio noobs out there what is
sound stage will sound stage is the
ability to perceive where the
instruments are laid in and around your
head so for example if I'm listening to
Beethoven's fifth symphony then I'm able
to perceive where the violins are where
the French homes are in and around my
head that is pretty cool and in this
headphone sound stage is not spectacular
but for the price it is a spectacular
set of headphones now let's talk about
what most dads are going to care about
most and that's their smartphone and
what can i list with this be without
mentioning the galaxy s5 one of the best
phones for 2014 it features a water and
dust resistant design beefed up
durability lightning fast performance
and quite frankly a fantastic camera
it's available for nearly every carrier
no matter what that uses it'll work it
features top-of-the-line specs run
across the board with a Snapdragon 801
clocked at 2.5 gigahertz at 1080p AMOLED
5.1 inch display 2 gigabytes of ram and
a 2800 million power battery with unique
power saving features now the second
phone to talk about if you have a big
budget for a smartphone is the HTC One
m8 it's often called the first phone to
feel like a piece of jewelry because
it's that refined it sports a five inch
adp display with a two point three
gigahertz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon
801 that means it's fast two gigabytes
of RAM it also sports an ultrapixel dual
camera now it has a 4 megapixel rear
facing camera but a 5-megapixel
front-facing camera proving that the
selfie is more important sometimes than
taking pictures of the world around you
and some people have knocked this phone
because it has that low megapixel count
but it does provide a almost DSLR
quality pictures and it performs really
well in low lights but if you have a
really big priority with crop factor
this may not be the camera for you but
it does also sport a 2600 milliamp hour
battery and it runs 4.4 kitkat if you
prefer a 5-inch phone and you're fond of
HTC Sense then this may be the camera
for you now for those of you who are a
bit more budget-conscious you may want
to consider the Moto G and while it's
not a mini edition of a phone the Moto G
does bear a close resemblance to the
flagship Moto X with the main difference
being a thicker profile and oftentimes
when you talk about a budget phone you
think that it is a low build quality but
the Moto G is quite different it's a
quality Android phone with a budget
price tag and that's the amazing thing
about it the Moto G sports a 4.5 inch
720p display with a Snapdragon 400
quad-core processor running at one point
two gigahertz it has one gigabytes of
ram 8 to 16 gigabytes of storage and a
2070 milliamp hour battery it also has a
5-megapixel rear-facing camera and a 1.3
megapixel front-facing camera you should
also know that the Moto G has received
its Android 4.4 KitKat update we can
recommend the Moto G to anyone looking
for an affordable smartphone but also to
anyone who wants a phone that just works
great right out of the box now we also
got to talk about the Xperia z2 for
those among you with a dad that
appreciates a relaxing moment on the
couch and likes to have a nice thin
top-of-the-line tablet that also is
water-resistant and durable look no
further than the Xperia z2 it's the
lightest 10 inch android tablet in the
world and boasts a beautiful angular
design it's one of our favorites for
2014
and we highly recommend it and of course
we have to talk about the Nexus 7 it's
still one of the best deals on the
market when it comes to android tablets
and will always be updated with the
latest version of Android to ensure that
it operates quickly and securely plus
the 7-inch tablet form factor is one of
the most loved around the world and for
good reason it's highly portable boasts
a best-in-class 1900 x 1200 IPS LCD
display and is a good deal at around two
hundred and thirty dollars there's often
deals on it so be on the lookout you
can't go wrong with a nexus 7 for those
of you considering a SmartWatch let's
talk the pebble steel pebbles latest
SmartWatch the pebble steel is the more
formal of their two versions it features
a cool e-ink display that boasts
exceptional battery life and is capable
of doing quite a bit it also has its own
app store via google play and plays nice
with all other major platforms it's
still considered to be the one if not
the best SmartWatch available to date
