for oneplus but for you the oneplus 5
user who may need to dial 911 emergency
now it appears that some 1+5 users when
they try to down on one one in case of
an emergency
have the phone simply reboot instead of
connecting them to an emergency dispatch
a reddit user was trying to down 9-1-1
after he witnessed a fire on the street
and the phone rebooted he tried to
replicate the problem again when he got
at home and sure enough it did check out
this video right here
looks like it's rebooting based on the
multiple comments and the reddit thread
some but not all one plus five units are
experiencing this issue however it is
impossible to say just how many units
are actually affected a thread published
on 2016 on the official one plus forum
suggests that this issue could affect
other oneplus phones as well that said
the user in question was using the
oneplus three running a custom ROM the
device in the video however is running
stock oxygen OS now in a statement to
the next web oneplus said this we have
contacted the customer and are currently
looking into the issue we are asking
anyone experiencing a similar situation
to contact us at support at one plus net
so please if you are a 1 + 5 user and
are experiencing this issue contact one
plus right there do it as soon as
possible then let me know in the
comments below that it's an issue also
I'd love to hear via Twitter what
response there was if any from oneplus
and with your permission I'll include
that in an update show possibly this
weekend so let me know let's chat
