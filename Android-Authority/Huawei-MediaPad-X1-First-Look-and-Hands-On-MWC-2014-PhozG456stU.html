by bitdefender mobile security huawei
7-inch offering is more than just a
pretty tablet hey Josh regard from
Android authority what's going on
everybody and this is the first look at
the huawei media pad x1 yes you are
looking at a 7-inch tablet that is
capable of also taking phone calls thus
making it one of the largest smartphones
we've ever had our hands on while not a
very profitable device by any means we
did find the handling to be as good as
we always claim of this being one of the
thinnest and lightest 7-inch form
factors out there the aluminum finish is
a very nice touch and the flat sides
make it pretty easy to hold in one hand
provided you're actually able to wrap
your hand around it the 7 inch screen is
no slouch as it packs Full HD resolution
at 1920 by 1200 giving this big phablet
the ability to provide some great media
experiences the small bezel helps keep
the entire tablet a smaller size despite
its bigger screen from what we were able
to glean in our time with the tablet the
colors were really quite nice and the
brightness is more than adequate
underneath the surface an in-house SOC
called the Huawei hisilicon Kirin 910
employs a quad-core cortex a9 and the
Mali 450 graphics with 2 gigabytes of
RAM to allow you to get some good
multitasking done the capability of
taking advantage of 4G speeds in at
least various markets in Asia can help
make this smartphone tablet speed right
through the internet and the on-board
storage can be bolstered by the included
micro SD card slot and a very sizable
5000 milliamp hour battery unit helps
the x1 truck along for quite a while the
camera on the rear will please shutter
bugs as it comes with a 13 megapixel
Sony Exmor R BSI sensor that packs quite
a wallop selfies are a bit of a focus
for Huawei as the front camera comes
with built-in tips for taking the best
possible self-portraits you can enjoy in
the time we were able to spend with the
software we saw how Huawei does try to
make the large screen more accessible
for users for one thing it is possible
to scroll through the elements with one
hand even while holding your screen with
the thumb on the other hand one aspect
that I thought was really cool was the
ability to hide the soft keys at the
bottom with the press of a little arrow
found on the left if you do need them to
come back you can simply swipe up from
the bottom of the screen and over
here and despite the lack of an app
drawer we still thought the operating
system looked pretty crisp and colorful
without really going overboard the media
pad x1 is one nifty little tablet and it
just so happens to have general phone
capabilities built-in as well so stay
tuned for more developments from the
Mobile World Congress from us here in
Barcelona Spain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
