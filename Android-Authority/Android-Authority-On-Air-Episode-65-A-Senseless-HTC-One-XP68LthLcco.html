authority on air the original android
hangout show on google+ I'm Derek Ross
I'm Scott Anderson I'm Dan Charlton and
I'm Johnathan Franklin and as you can
see in here Scott Anderson is back he
hasn't been on the show and all I think
three weeks ago the last two weeks he
was he was absence we've been seeing him
in a few weeks for those of you that are
fans of the show you'll be happy to know
that the reason Scott wasn't here for
the past three weeks he was actually
attending a seminar he was attending a
seminar on how to make your bed if you
look directly behind Scott you will see
the fruits of his labor have been
accomplished he he has successfully made
the bed this is an android authority on
air first um I don't even know if I can
go on I'm ecstatic right now I came back
a changed person I suppose I that much
look where the YouTube comments and the
Google+ comments about the bed being
made I have all been invalidated so
thank you Scott for at least giving us
something to talk about for the first
value really got to me and so I wanted
to make a change well that's that's not
good man I'm happy for you okay so so
besides beds being made and Scott being
back from the Land of Oz we're hit you
up with some ecosystem news uh yeah a
few things happen that the last day of
i/o we didn't have a chance to report on
so we're going to hitch with that
already talked about some rumors in the
Android ecosystem cards all the things
at least in terms of you I for apps and
then some device news you know some
galaxy s4 news will be the HTC One stuff
and uh some carrier stuff like Jennifer
Lopez I so so John I ok man's gone did
we miss anything last week a few things
from the the keynote and so forth yeah
hmm a couple of talks after you know
ours was on Thursday and they gave a
couple talks after
but there were quite a few hints and
upcoming version of Android which is
most likely to be called 4.3 um one
thing to really know twas a lot of the
talks were very heavily oriented toward
design and teaching developers good
design principles why they designed
Android you know in its current state
the way that it is and really how to
make your apps just really fast and
fluid but um another couple of things
that really did get shown off and are
coming to Android that they pointed out
war one is there's actually finally an
official library to implement the action
bar on versions of Android that don't
have you know honeycomb on forward where
it had that library baked in that'll
work very similarly to actionbarsherlock
which most of the developers have gone
with and the i/o 2013 application was
actually written using that library so
if you want an indication of how that
does and usually they open source the
iowa hap afterwards so you can kind of
see where they did with it the other one
was i was Romain guy and Chet passes
Android graphics performance talk and
the whole time they were talking they
were just kind of jokingly saying an
upcoming android release that shall
remain unnamed and they gave a couple of
hints that maybe it's not a full version
increase maybe it's just an iterative
thing and they did cover some
architectural things and two things that
they really mentioned was that the
system is automatically going to reorder
and merge GPU tasks which is something
that developers have had to do and
basically what that does is instead of
loading like a bitmap then text than a
PNG you then you know it brings all
those commands together what I'll load
all the images all the text in blocks so
it reduces the number of commands and
the GPU doesn't have to change states as
much so it really makes the application
a lot faster and more fluid the other
words that they're introducing some
multithreading into their actual
rendering pipeline so that you can use
instead of you know one thread you
four cores to do things like drop
shadows and basically more butter in the
next you know is this is just the next
kind of evolutionary step as far as them
trying to make Edward a lot smoother and
faster and easier for developers to get
a really smooth feeling really good
performing out and a couple of the web
talks we know that blink engine was
something that they forked from WebKit
and they're working on it very quickly
the question was how fast it was going
to evolve would they've already stripped
out 8.8 million lines of code from blink
engine so ya moving extremely fast and
it's good that they're not having to
kind of keep up with all the legacy
WebKit stuff because WebKit is spread
across so many types of devices but
they're really it's showing that they're
really serious about making chrome
capable of evolving in the direction
they want it to and be a real competitor
to you know WebKit which is on safari
and so many other different browsers but
yeah 8.8 million lines of code that's
crazy well no and they're there they're
thinning it down which can only make it
faster oh you're looking rid of unneeded
code so chrome is going to get faster
and I don't know about you guys but
loves me some fast web browsing so
absolutely it's easier for the developer
to know they don't have to maintain as
much so exactly no I think blink is a
really really good step for Google to
take and forking WebKit getting out from
underneath the shadow of Apple who Apple
maintains WebKit the same way Oracle
maintains their stuff which is to say
it's there they kind of half heartedly
support it so that they can run around
the world bragging about how they in
charge of it but it doesn't really go
anywhere do anything and isn't all that
great for people but they're kind of
stuck using it right like it's the same
thing with Java and with openoffice
that's now a defunct because Libre
Office killed it right like blink is
going to kill WebKit this is google is
actually going to maintain it and push
it and drive it and realistically google
knows a crapload more about how to serve
the web than Apple ever will because
that's what Google does right like their
primary
internet company Apple is not they trade
on the internet they work with the
internet they you know interface with it
and obviously do very well with us that
they're primarily a hardware company
that's their main focus that's what
they've always been if they'd already
wearing some software but you know
they're not an Internet company do you
think apple will start supporting us
more so now that Google is coming out
with a competitive or cook could
potentially be more competitive than
WebKit itself no because I don't think
the Apple gains anything out of being
behind WebKit yeah they gain some
compatibility which is nice but Google's
going to make sure the blank runs just
fine on Mac if they can leverage blink
into a iOS app that's even better for
consumers so I am this is pretty much
stuck with web get there so ultimately
if blink prevails and Apple keep
supporting WebKit they will be
supporting a dying you know a dying
breed if you will I mean look at it
right safaris not exactly a popular
desktop browser even on max people use
firefox people use chrome so far as the
default didn't then they replace it with
something that they like better just
like on Windows where it comes with
Internet Explorer and then they replace
it with something I like better the
difference is the population of Windows
computers vastly larger than the
population of next so safaris not really
all that used true right now it's not
like no help is forcing you to use it
like you do there as poor either yeah
the downside for Apple is in terms of
statistics reporting's one of the things
that we keep seeing is all these reports
about how people are far more engaged
with their iOS devices than they are
with Android devices part of the reasons
the statistics stay that is because the
people were analyzing the stats look at
WebKit stands right they see well
there's many millions of people
connected to the web from a mobile
device running webcam therefore it's
Safari doesn't matter if it's running
what kid on Android it's still getting
lumped in a safari so if browsers were
more accurately reporting that they're
blank and therefore google and not
WebKit and therefore Apple I think that
people get
better picture how few people actually
rely on Safari I'm definitely good there
they're already experimenting what the
engine do so all pan was one thing that
there oh alright so John did we have any
other tidbits that the past week from
the ecosystem um they talk a little bit
more about hangouts um this was on
google+ this wasn't really on the talks
at i/o but people were concerned about
the move to hang outs after gmail and
making outgoing calls and they basically
clarify the outgoing calls are coming to
hangouts very soon and it's also going
to be the future of google voice which
is very good news because google voice
is this is something that hasn't gotten
a lot of love lately and it's
interesting that that look going to the
last several years yeah it's interesting
that there I mean I ok I understand
making an outgoing call ok so that that
doesn't make it a google voice
replacement I mean you know unique
greetings for calls you need they were
talking about the integrated you could
already make calls from gmail and you
can't do it right now yeah yeah but I'm
wondering how well you know I I saw the
post where they said no case you haven't
figured out you know hang out is the
future of google voice so does that mean
that you're going to make an outgoing
call and that's it or are we talking
about like the two of them all coming
together when you're gonna get some type
of you know answering voicemail system
you know you know i want to know how
deep of integration and yes you are
going to bring i have to assume it'll be
pretty deeply integrated I mean already
you can have voice send your your
voicemails transcribed to gmail okay all
of your hangout targeting log to gmail
it doesn't seem that difficult to just
integrate the both of the done right
there in gmail and then as far as the
the calls right now well everybody's
been up in arms about the outgoing calls
incoming calls still come into hangouts
right I've been answering calls on my
computer all left and right through
hangouts because I'm sitting my desk
I've got a mic why wouldn't have it so
it was actually seem to work better than
gmail did yeah I would agree so my they
definitely still have the call
capacity it's just the outgoing and even
the out going to say it's go on is it
entirely true you can still place now
going call through a hangout but you
have to start a hangout first which
means you have to have another
participant right it used to be that you
could start a hangout just with you and
then invite people and that doesn't seem
to be an option anymore either do you
think that they're gonna go with voice
calling a VoIP way with regards to
mobile just over data the thing that's
gonna be the direction that carriers
eventually go once they all kind of may
it may not look like it they might keep
a plan like that but you know we're
eventually gonna be doing a lot of OI
over data anyway so yeah I really think
that they would I mean to compete with
skype in your facebook Messenger and so
forth me all competitors are doing it as
far as voice integration goes I don't
think so because right now they
essentially already have that
functionality with with hangouts with
the hangouts app right it's just video
only instead of video and points but
that's definitely void when you're doing
it you know the audio part of it so the
thing that they can do with voice that
skype and facebook and all the others
can't do is they can leverage actual
phone numbers and like the actual phone
network that's been in place for decades
right with voice you can call out to
other landlines you can do that with
skype but they charge you for it and so
anyway don't definitely interesting on
over the next coming week you know so I
I think it'll be exciting definitely
something that google voice users will
want to you know keep a keep an eye out
for ya I mean the big thing that the
google has with voice that they can
leverage is they can allow other people
to pick up there you know your
grandmother pick up her old school
telephone because she doesn't have a
cell phone because she's in her 80s and
why would she need one so she picks up
her landline phone and dials you and it
calls your hangouts app which movie and
it calls you no matter what platform
you're on exactly or where you're at
like and everybody else can't leverage
because they can't take incoming calls
to a number right a 10-digit phone
number as opposed to your skype handle
or your facebook camp unless you bought
a skype number with the pay
version yeah but I mean we're talking
about free yeah exactly yeah all right
so let's talk about some more things
that came out of IA let's not talk about
some rumors cuz you know what loves me
some rumors because that they get the
heart beatin you know it gets us excited
for upcoming products and you know what
that I don't I just like it I just like
it makes me smile puts a smile on my
face so Android and Nexus rumors that
came out of I oh so obviously we didn't
see it a new version of Android but we
know it's right around the corner from
server moms and so forth you know as all
sorts of hints you know and there's all
sorts of different hints and different
io sessions such as like Cthulhu type
monster from final fantasy and on all
the boss powers from the the slideshow
listed like jelly bean is a power key
lime pie was a power and then a little
bit later on during the design session
you know there was a an Android
character sitting on a park bench eating
some key lime pie you know so Google
pretty much did what they do best they
they told us they tease this and we love
them for it you know we know that key
lime pie is the next iteration name we
don't know when it's coming we don't
know the version number know that really
matters the fact that Google played
along with us and gave us tidbits of
info and dinner Oh yelled hollow Yolo
during the fireside chat you know I mean
it was it was all cool but but anyway so
let's go back to the so a white Nexus 4
was actually spotted and had IL and it
was running Android 4.2 point one right
now but I said version numbers don't
mean anything but it wasn't white Nexus
4 which we've seen leaked over the place
for months um rumor has it that that
device will become available or
announced on jun 10th and that is also
rumored to be the same day that android
4.3 becomes available
and maybe a nexus 7 refresh will be may
be made for pre-order or at least
announced on that date and maybe this is
a long shot here maybe another device
this past week after I owe a Google
branded media streaming device kinda
like a nexus q kinda like a google TV a
media streaming device passed through
the FCC and the neat thing about that is
it was actually called media player you
know and the device name was h 8 40
device and the the model number was h2g2
which i'm not a fan of this because i
had better read books but whatever
hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy that's
a little hat tip to them so i don't know
if it's coming to rest while it was
plastered with 42s everywhere yeah yeah
so it's gonna be like a towel we're
gonna get I guess that's something big
in that now scan there's been people
speculating that it's essentially a
nexus q well yeah well yes that and more
I'm you know I'm saying it's that and
more because there's been reports that
this is going to be heavily focused on
gaming so it's going to be a way for
Google to take over the living room um
now let's say all these things happen
here in another two weeks or so well
just so happens on jun 10th is the first
day of Apple's Worldwide Developer
Conference so dozens of times that Apple
doesn't attend yes but now it's that
would steal a lot of thunder from WWDC
if Google made all these major
announcements of it you know on the
Nexus 4 Nexus 7 and a android gaming
console or you know media streaming
player whatever the hell you want to
call it all in the same day of that
conference so I'll be pretty interesting
if those rumors and speculations do turn
out to be true I'm definitely going to
be having my my buttons and f5 and mouse
clicks and all that stuff ready to go on
the play store that day all day long
expecting to sell out roughly five
minutes after they go on sale 15 minutes
later and go on five after that yeah so
so you know in general Nexus device or
during Fashion be sure to press f5 all
day long to you know help crash the
servers you know we can because that's
what we do um but let's hope that
doesn't happen but uh I'm gonna be
curious if we'll see some new devices if
these rumors are there got definitely
coming I mean we we know that a new
device is coming on you know I pass
through the FCC so just a matter of when
doesn't necessarily mean it's coming oh
it's come lots of things go through the
FCC had never seen the light of day it's
coming in um so wha yeah that's right
for rude devices after I oh that sucks
talked about some stuff we do know about
such as Scott Anderson making his bed
and talking about the app updates yeah I
remember bed um okay app updates chrome
beta for android has kind of been on a
tear lately since I oh it's gotten two
updates a lot quicker the biggest
notable one was today google translate's
whenever you come across like a page
that's written in german or a language
that is not your native language it will
bring up a bar from the bottom asking if
you want to translate it pretty cool and
it works beautifully still a little bit
of bugs with just displaying the you
know translated text in my opinion but
pretty cool also full screen on tablets
which is nice and it was on phones
before but it's also nice to have on
tablets you know more screen space be
able to do more support for a full
screen API it's nice also that Google+
integration the scroll down thing a
little bit buggy on the most recent app
and also a new graph showing your
estimated bandwidth savings before it
just showed you how much data you
actually saved
now it has a little bit more of like a
the system level you I of how much data
you've used kind of like that and then
mobile friendly arrow pages kind of cool
also the new tab is on the top you don't
have to click uh you don't have to hit
the tab button and then click new tab
it's a one less cap yeah but that wasn't
going well um I'm also a lot of apps
Derek received card UI updates yeah so
card all the things as I said earlier um
you know the google play store has a
card you I google plus of your rock and
Google+ right now on the web watching us
you know has cards over the place so
Google's moving towards us you know card
you I kind of focused off of Google now
that you know that that type of a UI and
ask obviously they stole this idea from
iOS 7 well am sure come on Dan we're
getting questions about why you're so
anti apple here don't be sayin stuff
like that not the one pushing the rumors
about how everybody stole this idea for
life so anyway so anyway so so cartoony
eyes come to a bunch of apps besides the
google play store well play music play
musics gorgeous we got that last week
obviously we got books last week and
since then we got magazines you know you
two back she was updated before I oh and
Google Earth oh they don't really have
cards so much but they have the new
slide-out menu with the actual menu
buttons at the top depicting it's an
actual menu and then the Google Shopping
got updated that there's just and the
Google Drive got updated as well you
know these are the Google Drive update
is all just as awesome as the music
update is when it comes to cards uh
Scott you want to talk a bit more about
that uh the slide-out us now the Google
Drive you were talking about how you
were a huge fan of it earlier oh yeah
huge fan of it and huge fan of Werther
going with it it had a large update to
version 1.2 and basically you have a new
grid view that makes it easier to find
your files a new quick preview lets you
view photos and other files from within
the
app in scanned documents receive the
letters for safekeeping and drive this
with your camera or a previous file can
also download a copy of files to your
local device Oh finally yeah which is
very nice spreadsheets if you use
spreadsheets on a tablet or phone the
editor now supports changing fonts
colors and alignment which I don't know
why it didn't have this before but yeah
you can view the properties of files
from within the editors which is very
nice and lots of bug fixes and visual
improvements and my opinion performance
improvements as well it's a there's a
there's a new feature called scan mean
really it's just take a picture but but
it's called scan so it's a guy I saw a
neat boost case for this today and so
let's say you want to keep all of your
receipts you know for tax purposes or
whatever for a checkbook tracking you
know however you want to do it you you
want to keep all your receipts well you
just scan him in the Google Drive so you
take your receipt you open up drive you
hit the little Scan button and then
basically just take a picture really you
you take a picture with it in it you
know scans it but it actually does scan
it because it does OCR so in Arizona
that's fans yes so so now that receipt
becomes searchable so if you say when
the hell did i buy that oh uh lawn chair
you know yeah you need now you can go
into drive and just search for launch
hair and then it'll find the receipt for
you so it is a skin but it's a yeah it's
picture here's the don't know OCR is
optical optical character recognition
it's typically in enterprise-grade
scanning software and it's usually
pretty pricey yes so it again you're not
for your receipt so I mean you don't
have to use it for receipt but that was
a neat use case which I might try to do
so yeah you can search for the text and
the text become searchable but a true
OCR allows you to edit it no that's not
true it is an editable file an editable
file OCR doesn't make it editable OCR
just makes it searchable oh see oh see
oh see artists translate doesn't okay
you're outputting the format and if
you're putting it out as a PDF that's
not editable because it's good yeah
that's editable if you have a full
version of Adobe either way it has OCR
support we don't need to get into
semantics if it what it is or isn't it
has OCR support I don't know if it's
actually editable I didn't try that but
I did try scanning and receipt after I
saw the article online from remember
where those panini idea so you just they
just create a folder called receipts and
they scannable in there pretty cool then
Google Play magazines got updated card
you I knew slide-out menu bug fixes
flickr updated their app new UI for the
app also one terabyte of storage space
which is freaking awesome sort of isn't
it still just for pictures of videos
though yes think about it is there a
file size limit like for a file i do not
know those a file size limit but if
you're looking for a photo locker
freeing of your photographer I mean
google+ gives you 15 gig so one para by
debts is a lot of space but it seems to
me like it's overkill for for the way
its limit right like it's not just a
generic terabyte of space of online
cloud storage it is for photos yeah you
know but if you're taking a multiple
multiple me know I don't know how big
they you know fifth 50 meg raw files I'm
sure you can fill it up pretty quickly
if you're an avid photographer yeah I
mean that's why I wonder if there's a
file size line because I know you can
put videos there so they give you have
home videos or DVDs that you burn to
your computer if you could store those
out there but I mean that's potentially
a gigabyte plus biosigns yeah definitely
have it will be interesting to if you
can do that that's definitely worth it
back up your whole video library and the
app got a really nice update too yeah
it's pretty cool I recommend checking it
out if you're into pictures then also
the Opera browser got a UI overhaul and
it left the beta stage so that's big
news and
it's really nice it's I mean it's a very
popular browser for Android and I know
it's a lot of it's a go-to browser for a
lot of people that I know chrome is
becoming more more so you know
acceptable but it's good news and it's
pretty cool all right guys we're gonna
talk about some devices here um as
always if you have any questions feel
free to go ahead drop it in the comments
for watching the comments on YouTube as
well as Google Plus and yes we have to
get a lot of comments actually about
Scott's bed being made at least like
three or four or five d for comment
about say yes he he has made his bed if
you're tuning in late to the show he
that's why he hasn't been here for about
three weeks now he actually has been on
a a retreat a been going to a seminar
daily on how to properly make his bed so
she was right it was a free seminar is
it he's shaking his head but he knows
you're damn well went there it was free
alright so so let's talk about some
devices up so if you're on big red like
this guy and like another guy in here um
haha yeah yeah haha you're on verizon um
you can now hit the samsung galaxy s4 as
of today yay it's a hundred ninety nine
dollars with a two-year contract if you
don't like contracts 649 dollars you can
also actually get it on amazon wireless
and save twenty bucks for the two-year
contract so you can get it for 179 I
don't know how long especially available
but it is now so if you want the s4 and
your verizon your contracts up or you're
gonna be a new customer and save twenty
bucks needed for amazon do you know if
it's new only earth it's for any rules
as well it's for renewals new contracts
and new customers you can save 25 for
those a lot of times those special deals
are for customers only yeah yeah so you
might as well save twenty bucks if you
can name is on there gonna lie they just
might as well offered to renewals
because you get another two years of
service right so um samsung announced
the developer edition for both verizon
and 80 but that's yeah that's really
irrelevant if you're into a rootin and
ramen which why would you want the
developer version if you weren't so go
ahead and save yourself a couple hundred
dollars because Dan Rosenberg which is
really well known for cracking motorola
devices he took his knowledge and
applied it to the samsung galaxy s4 and
you can now use his program is called
low key to unlock the bootloader of the
samsung galaxy s4 so we came up with
this he came up with this process prior
to verizon releasing it and yeah dirty
one elaborate my idea he actually got it
to work i believe on the AT&amp;amp;T variant
but he didn't release it because he
didn't want verizon to do anything crazy
beforehand and patch the bug or they
exploit that he used i say so he waited
until the verizon version hit the store
is ok now release it cuz you can't patch
it now haha Harry wife yeah smart guy
well obviously he figured out unlock the
bootloader on one of the one of the
Lourdes devices John Locke bootloader on
I mean it's it's a very secure device so
you know if you want the s4 and you're
going to want to put something like
cyanogenmod they already have you know I
don't know if they're nightlies are
available yet but Steve Kondik posted
pictures a couple weeks ago with it
running on the international or the
t-mobile version i believe it was so
yeah its nightly as it if you're not
already out there going to be coming so
now that the verizon one can be unlocked
chances are some developer will pick
that up and i mean i'm not gonna speak
for the CM team but there's a high
probability that it'll be it'll be
available and when is that coming you
know soon always oliver look for tell me
to release candidate roughly the time
jelly 4.3 it releases um oh come on now
so you know you know what I wouldn't see
it taking entirely that long because all
somebody has to do is get a hold of the
google edition of the s4 and then they
basically have AOSP for it mean
yet minus the verizon birds yeah minus
the cdma you know radio minor detail
yeah minus the rail this rom on here but
it won't work like a phone yeah yeah the
rails always the pain in the butt I so
let's talk about some numbers real quick
the galaxy s4 sells a lot we know this
so in the past 25 days it's less than a
month they've sold 10 million devices
which yeah that's a lot we we know
they're gonna sell a lot no surprise you
know I'm really blown away that there's
10 million people that want that phone
and I know they're gonna keep putting
millions more well yeah I mean it did
they ask to was the number one selling
phone yes three was number one selling
phone so obviously s4 I mean they're
they're killing it um here's one let's
talk about that real quick they they
actually had some supply issues weren't
able to sell as many in the beginning is
they had wanted to they've sold 5
million which which is actually a pretty
good number if you think about I mean
five million there's it is a very nice
number for HTC they should be proud of
that it's a big bounce back from where
they were with one extra you know it's
it's it's doing uh see 490 RR for ya 4
million four hundred ninety or nine
hundred and I can't do math it's doing a
lot better than the HTC first yes yes
first that's already gone down to one
dollar because they did you give them
away well we would've expected anything
90,000 there we go you don't expect big
things but you don't expect it to drop
to one dollar on AT&amp;amp;T I'm contract like
a week after colors on each chapter was
debuted a hundred bucks you know it's
like yeah I mean yeah but uh I think
it's kind of cool that uh Oh was
arrested all right well you think about
it so so we all know that H nope we all
know that the samsung galaxy s4 has a
google edition and we just mentioned
well the day that that happened a
samsung or a HTC m employee tweeted hey
you can spend six hundred forty nine
dollars for plastic dot or you can wait
everyone's like holy shit the HTC one is
getting a AAA OSP
stock Android version then HTC execs
came out said no no that's not happening
wait no they came out and said we're not
building in Nexus device yeah they came
out and said we're not building a Nexus
device basically some excess device
either yeah so a lot of people including
loss actually last weekend you actually
made that point last week on the show
and we said yeah they aren't building a
Nexus device so Russell holly has been
on the show a couple times good friend
of mine he actually broke the news about
the google edition of the samsung galaxy
s4 the night before I oh and everybody
basically said your bullshit you're a
liar don't know what you're talking
about and then dr. da he was right well
he seems to know what he's talking about
so when he announced today that the HTC
One was in fact going to release a
senseless version of the one um I
believed him I think he knows he's
talking about and he he said that we
should see an official announcement
within the next two weeks so I'm gonna
say if you're looking to buy the HTC One
wait another week or two if you can you
know there might be some big news coming
there one so so I I have a question here
so that's awesome that HTC is going to
do this and you remember their whole
marketing thing is we have two big
things two big pushes with the HTC One
we have boom sound and we have this
amazing camera so how are those two
things going to work on nonsense wrong I
mean his boomsound gonna blow us away
and sound is amazing maybe but what
about that that that sense camera
there's no way in hell the cameras gonna
operate the same way so I'm really
curious as to you know how that's gonna
pan out what you know Dan woody what do
you think on that well if HTC was smart
and really if HTC Samsung any of these
companies were smart what if they would
do is build the camera app the way they
wanted and make it run on a stock rom
then they just replaced the stock camera
app once they're done with that when
they move on to the next one and
continue doing that through all of their
custom apps oh and wait now they don't
need a custom overlay at all well maybe
I don't need to worry about carriers or
they can do exactly what Google does and
release it through the Play Store and
lock it down to only HTC devices so
maybe it comes with the stock the stock
camera an HTC publishes an app to the
Play Store saying the stock camera is
cool but if you want to get the sense
camera and make it only available to
that device yeah oh yeah there's no
reason why google has basically through
io by not releasing an update to Android
and just releasing a bevy of app updates
shown we can update our entire ecosystem
and platform without touching the
underlying operating system there's no
reason that OEMs catch missing not at
all forgive sworn we live in the updates
month and that takes fragmentation and
updates and carry your bullshit entirely
out of the equation is no way out of
integration so speaking of OEMs do you
guys watching listening and also in the
Hangout right now think that this is
going to spawn some type of trend we
have the number one Android manufacturer
phone manufacturer having a stock
Android version now it's really
expensive only available in the play
store right now who know in an available
in the US so how many they really going
to sell but HTC is doing it to you know
so there's two big-name manufacturers
doing it you know and Sony they're very
developer friendly friendly they've
released AOSP for davaite you know
various Xperia devices in the past and
as well as the the tablet Z has AOSP
available for it too so you know do you
think we could see something coming down
the line is this is a trend you know
devices put out a flagship our
manufacturers put a flagship phone and
maybe they put out a you know a stock
Android version for people that want the
hardware but don't want the software
means well LG jump on this trend here
are we going to see an optimus g pro or
g2 with stock Android in the near future
it'd be cool well LG already did jump on
by releasing the nexus 4 if you want to
play on your
age is non-nexus love I spilled yeah
yeah non-nexus device yeah but if you
have an optimist g literally take a
nexus 4 rom and flash it and it will
boot you might lose network connectivity
if you're not on you know the right
carrier yeah in depending on what
version you're coming from you may need
to flash the extra partitions but the
nexus 4 is wrong will boot on every
other LG right they're identical phone
yeah just from the hardware perspective
so we already leave a comment here I
don't know that I see this becoming a
trend with OEMs just because there's not
a whole lot of incentive for them to
release the devices like this they're
going to sell enough of them to make a
profit off of it but what I think
they'll realize is all they have to do
is we'll publish the AOS decode that
will run underneath of their own there
you have their skin publish it to the
web somewhere and that's the people who
are interested in this that's all they
want is the code the underlying software
even if they releases a package rom
without the code it be hugely beneficial
to the custom development community they
don't even go out of their way to buy a
special AOSP device if HTC or samsung or
LG is just going to release the AOSP
software for all right Dan so we have a
common here from galen 20k and I think
that a lot of people were might be
feeling this way so he said you know the
HTC One is the absolute best phone that
he's ever owned and you guys should
really tried it if you haven't so so
that brings up a good point if you do
own the HTC One what are your thoughts
about an HTC One you know stock Android
senseless edition coming out are you
going to be upset that this was
announced you know a a month or two
later you know what is it going to make
you want to get that device are you
happy with what you have and you you you
like sense you know five point oh uh let
us if you already have an HTC one you
should not be upset at all this coming
out means that the brom itself will go
into your device with almost no effort
whatsoever yeah another
on the topic of well the trend start
catching is one hundred percent
depending on carriers because I think
the biggest problem with stock is not
that stock is stock is that stock
doesn't exist on carriers like verizon
or sprint I mean sprint you know you've
had more Nexus devices on sprint than
before but but the verizon the only new
flagship phone you have right now is a
galaxy s4 and that's sucks man it's not
that if you want a galaxy s4 that's good
if you don't want a galaxy s4 you've got
no options whatsoever for a new flagship
device so he releases the s4 Google
edition and what cares is it's on HD mt
and t-mobile in which both of those
carriers you can already use the Nexus
device on so maybe it's a better device
but it's also a lateral move so until
they get these devices on a carrier like
Verizon or somebody like that and by the
way verizon we hate you for this then
that's going to be when you know if AOSP
can really catch on with the masses
because until you know even when the
Nexus has come to verizon it doesn't
come every single year you can't
reliably to say I'm going to wait for
the nexus on verizon because you don't
know if it's coming or not yeah now
let's uh let's talk about another device
here and which is related to verizon so
this past week we saw some more some
more leaks and some more confirmations I
guess about the upcoming Motorola X
phone we saw in X phone with sprint
compatibility pass through the FCC so
generally that means it's probably
coming sometime soon you know once it
passes through the FCC and the guys over
at droid-life we're able to get a hold
of
the drivers file from motorola and by
looking at the ini file it mentioned a
device that would be most likely
verizon's model number so as the state
you said it's compatible with sprint but
not verizon well it was the sprint
sprint radios so I can't possibly
imagine Motorola being stupid enough to
build a device that works on sprint
that's not also capable of working on
verizon they would have to actively go
out of their way to make that happen or
maybe verizon doesn't want the device
and the no my point is the hardware
they're putting in it is going to
accomplish those goals they would have
to go out of their way to find some
obscure manufacturer who's making really
crappy hardware to come up with
something that's only going to run on
sprint or as a visitor choices remember
the at least the SOC that's in there now
isn't isn't a newer Snapdragon processor
I believe it was just the dual-core s4
yea which was would have been the same
processor that was in the galaxy s3 yeah
females really what is capable of
simultaneously running on Verizon Sprint
AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile but my point is is
that there was a samsung sprint variant
there was a samsung verizon variant so
it's not like it's isn't the outer if
this is you know it is someone at
something outlandish people have done it
with the radio in both of those devices
was identical that was the carrier's
pushing their branding on to samsung
well maybe it's gonna happen again it
mean it's certainly good I don't think
Motorola's ever released a you know
cross carrier device like that either
well they do have devices that now have
you know global you know gsm support
right right i mean a lot of the verizon
Motorola's have the global support but I
mean I don't think Motorola's released a
device on multiple US carriers like
under the same brand like the same brand
name yeah they haven't done
your samsung has done yeah well so we'll
see what happens here I mean obviously
this is just speculation based off of
some files that show up on the FCC's
website so anything's possible but we do
know that devices are coming since you
know we've seen a sprint variant in a
supposedly sprint or AT&amp;amp;T variant to
show up as well so usually that means
things are coming with multiple model
numbers the same phone start showing up
um on two devices that we can confirm
Google glass if you are an i/o 12 winner
or a signer upper this does not apply to
you already have your glass or it's
being shipped to you you picked it up
already at I over 13 so if you're an if
I had glass contest winner this news
applies to you yesterday Project Glass
announced that divider invites purchase
links are going to start being sent out
to winners and almost immediately after
that notice went out people started
reporting hey I got my purchase link I
got my invite link so there's already
people that are picking it up next week
from the if I had glass contest so
what's what's that mean you're gonna
have to or did they win the opportunity
to abide by oh you want the opportunity
to buy it yeah you won the opportunity
to spend sixteen hundred dollars plus
travel yeah that's fifty hundred dollars
plus tax plus travel but I just rounded
up to 1600 so you can go to la New York
City or mountain view to pick it up pick
it up in person yet paid up in person
you have to get basically I'm thinking
that I could be wrong on this but Google
thought that the i/o attendees are
smarter than the average bear because
they're generally a developer or a tech
savvy tech enthusiast so they could
probably figure out a lot of glass
themselves whereas if I had glass
winners are just random everyday average
Joe people a lot of the times who may
not be that text ad
I might need the hands-on training on
how to use it I'm I could be wrong with
that kind of makes sense to maloneys so
I so I'm thinking that's why if I had
glass users have to go in person to pick
it up so and that the Terms of Service
was updated yesterday to say you can
have it shipped to you if you're an i/o
12 sign up if you're an if I had glass
winter you have to go and pick it up so
John and I um Scott did you win as well
okay so John and aya haven't gotten our
purchase links yet but very soon we're
gonna have to decide as well as many of
you probably watching right now what you
know what do you want you want you are
cold you want she'll do want tangerine
sky or cotton you know that you know if
you're deciding to spend the 1,500 bucks
that's the next decision to make what
color are you gonna go for John hmm ok
purposely the single ladies you know
what I'm a fashionista apparently so I
started saying to myself you know what I
want sky like that stands out its it
purdy you know I said I went tangerine
because it's it stands out it's kind of
cool-looking and I start thinking myself
you know orange in blue tangerine sky
those colors don't go with everything
you know you know fashion wise so kind
of limit your wardrobe you know you know
you know some things could clash so uh
you know I'm thinking the charcoal and
shale which is black and gray um might
be the way to go and then I thought
white I don't know if I'm able to rock
white down you know I don't know if
that's me that's why it's just not gonna
blend it well um so uh google glass yeah
hopefully a couple weeks John and I'll
we sitting here doing like hangout on
air ception will be like doing it like
in front of the webcam and then we'll be
doing it on the on glass two anyway so
John let's not talk about glass and
let's talk about Nvidia shield
pre-orders went up and we didn't have a
chance to talk about it last week's
weird I oh and all the things you want
to yak about that for a minute
yeah they uh they started may twentieth
which if you order them now you can get
it for 350 which is actually a little
bit cheaper than I thought they were
going to be I thought they were probably
going to target about 500 bucks but it's
going to ship in June and if you missed
what shield is about it's basically kind
of like an android mini tablet as far as
the display goes it's a 5-inch 720p
display it also has an integral
controller integrated speakers which the
speakers from everywhere reviewer I've
seen that's held them said they're
actually pretty amazing considering it's
a portable device of the battery unit is
gigantic I mean it's I can't remember
what it is but it's way more than most
tablets have um it runs bone stock
Android and it does come with a Tegra 4
so you're going to get the Tegra
platform and all the Tegra optimized you
know Nvidia's own games but the biggest
thing is it links up with a any kepler
nvidia desktop GPU which is a dt k 6 50
or higher and you can actually stream
your pc games by a steam and play them
on the shield device so you could play
Skyrim on a portable controller shield
device or whenever you felt like playing
so that's just kind of the biggest
marketing thing behind it I get that in
videos trying to push like their own
technology with that but there's
absolutely no technical reason why you
need to have an nvidia kepler GPU in
order to stream content from your
computer to anything be interesting so
you do need to have some kind of a modem
yeah but it doesn't matter you even
don't worry here or so Nvidia would have
you believe yeah the big things are
drying so did you do the hard to keep
you actions to the secret like to the
desktop computer which I can't possibly
imagine they're doing they're just
trying to sell new things I can't
remember it there were some parts of it
that did require because Tegra 4 is the
only one that can do it to it required
some kind of hooks and the cap
architecture to be able to do from the o
know if it's from the cathode side
is really really bad dirty it could be
and I'm not going to analyze that part
of it but there was some requirement in
terms of you imagine of course the low
wedding cards would struggle to keep up
with an emulator being interesting
anyway to see how the device does i
don't i don't expect it to be anything
more than something to appease try to
sell more desktop GPUs well I'll tell
you what it's probably gonna be better
than the oh yeah that thing is I have
that thing and if my three almost four
year old son didn't love playing it I
would put it on ebay already that think
sucks um I will give the full review
later moving on Dan yeah so there's a
some interesting patent filings this
week the microsoft vs motorola case
which is in two parts and I've spoken
before about the first part of that
where the judge arbitrarily decided to
set a friend rate because you know he
thinks he has that kind of power um the
second part of that though the judge
sided with Motorola I'm pretty sure
that's the only time he sided with
Motorola ever in this case but agreed to
have the rest of it be heard by a jury
trial which isn't really all that
beneficial to Motorola considering the
jury pool is pretty much the population
of Microsoft employees so you win some
you lose some on that one really the
judge kind of had to side with Motorola
because otherwise he probably would have
gotten himself into some trouble for
just flagrantly violating the law pretty
much if any party in any litigation asks
for a jury trial at any point that's the
end of the discussion kiri they get a
jury trial that's the way the law works
once you want one that's it that's all
you got to do this case originally
started in Wisconsin and then got folded
into the Seattle case and in the
Wisconsin filings motorola very
explicitly and on the record asked for a
jury trial and then microsoft basically
tried to say clean they didn't that
doesn't matter mmm yeah it really did
matter and so the judge actually sided
with motorola on that one
the other Motorola case from Wisconsin
was the motor the apple vs motorola case
the judge posner had heard and tossed
out basically saying this is waste of my
time you people don't actually want
anything get out oh and attach prejudice
to that because I don't want to hear
from you again so motorola and apple are
both appealing it on different grounds
and motorola very recently filed their
brief in their key love it essentially
arguing that judge Posner's ruling
pretty much says if you've contributed
your patents to a standard you get no
more rights over your patents ever again
there's no infringement you can't sue
anybody even if they are willfully
infringing and utterly and completely
refusing to take a license like say for
example Apple who told a judge we really
don't care what value you set on these
patents we're still not going to license
them so when you're facing a potential
licensees utterly and completely
refusing to license your standards
essential patents you should probably
still be able to seek an injunction
against those people because otherwise
by submitting your patents to a standard
you are making them worthless and
useless so Motorola probably has a
pretty good like to stand out on that
one Apple's appeal is less penetrating
and more about wining pretty much about
how we should be getting more thought
and care and money but not actually
putting up any reasons why Posner's
decision wasn't valid um in other Apple
legal news the apple vs samsung to case
which is the one that's mostly centered
around search and they had previously
attempted to get injunctions against the
Galaxy Nexus over that case Apple is now
trying to fold the galaxy s4 and
potentially illegal now itself into that
case so they're really now very much
directly going after Google for search
you know because Siri does the same damn
shit that Google now does right because
you ask it a question verbally ask a
question and it returns results which
apparently Apple forgets that Google
search has been doing since Eclair well
then he got the fact this year was
bought my apple as a yes at the existed
RT voice actions about any large lake
since 2010 Siri was Archana by Apple in
2011 and Google now is all about
contextual data which Syria's naari it
would not even more than that seriously
Apple is now trying to attack google /
search related patents do you really
think Google doesn't have prior art or
better patents on search than you do the
biggest search provider in the world by
far that's what you're going to go after
you're gonna go after Google about
search rectangles and rounded corners
and black devices search is what you're
going to go after Google with you nibble
around the edges and don't go after
Google for everything else and all of
your other ridiculous nonsense like
invalid bounce back and invalid unlock
and invalid this that and the other
patents but search is what you settle on
is you're like missile for google that's
your thermonuclear war I'm pretty sure
that's more setting off a grenade in
your own house alright so any other
patent news no that's really it just to
Apple making themselves look like fools
I think we have time for some big
carrier announcements oh yeah yes a
verizon had an announcement this week uh
at ctia 2013 verizon has announced a new
store partner before the event the CEO
said they're gonna have an announcement
that we're gonna want to tweet about
everybody was really thinking this was
going to be the HTC one right for
verizon because because she said we have
an announcement you're gonna want to
tweet about me it's huge right yeah
you think it's big news something that
people are gonna be excited to that in
fact it was just Jennifer Lopez I mean
don't get me wrong Jennifer Lopez is
nice to look at but campaign not really
something that gets me all ready to
tweet about it oh my god Jennifer Lopez
ctia yes announced evil mobile which has
social shopping stores for Latinos and
stores opening in la New York and Miami
so I essentially love verizon know so
you're gonna be able to go to these
stores as well as Facebook and do social
shopping in its it's for Latinos which
is fine she thinks it's an untapped
market and that's fine but do we really
need a whole entire row on shopping
store dedicated to that yeah kind of a
lot of Latinos and I don't know any of
them that are like oh my god I was gonna
get a phone and I was just so blown away
waiting for a carrier the kid just to me
oh my god I need Jennifer Lopez kate is
for my phone where's my clitoris cum I
don't know any Latino who's sitting
there thinking God if only Jennifer
Lopez had tried to sell me this
smartphone then I would have bought one
from verizon my god we should do eat
this now what now to be honest with you
Dan the most interesting thing about
that is is she's actually not just a
talking head she's not just a pretty
face she's not just a spokesperson she's
actually a major stakeholder in a Viva
movil i gets actually you know partly
her company so it's she's actually doing
it you know which she does I mean real
the clothes line anything to or good i I
don't I just think I don't think there's
no audience for the market she's trying
I think that Verizon trolled everybody
ed and it basically showed that ctia as
this darkest us mobile-focused
conference is dying in bed I think
that's what the message was that Verizon
wanted us to tweet yeah don't waste your
breath uncie's you guys didn't ctia
merge with uh what do they merge with
something else to become super mobile or
something like that what's it called
yeah those Goods call like super mobile

relevance and it failed okay so more
importantly if you are of Latin descent
and if this made you excited if you are
going to now walk into one of these
locations and or like the page on
Facebook let us know because we don't
think that's that exciting maybe we're
maybe we're missing the buck maybe
Jennifer Lopez has more cool than we
think so let us know I'm actually very
serious or knowledge of what it's like
to be a Latino than I do yeah but I just
don't feel like Verizon AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile
and Sprint aren't already reaching the
Latino community I don't also think
t-mobile sprint and and no AT&amp;amp;T are like
damn it why don't we get in on this
