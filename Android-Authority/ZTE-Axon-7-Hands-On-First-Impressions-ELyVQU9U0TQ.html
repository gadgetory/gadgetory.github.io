with Android authority coming to you
live from Beijing China and today we're
checking out the ZTE axon 7 so ZTE has
provided a very nice and boxing
experience with the exon 7 and you not
only receive the phone and a quick
charge 3.0 charger but also a set of
earbuds a case a micro USB to USB C
adapter and a SIM door eject tool it's
clear that ZTE has spent a lot of time
designing the axon 7 and it shows in
terms of design with an aluminum full
metal unibody available in either iron
gold or quartz gray it definitely has a
premium feel and with curves in the
metal it has a great handling experience
it just feels great in the hand ZTE also
showed us just how strong the aluminum
shell was during our meeting and with
the added components this phone seems
nearly impossible to bend which is
always good to see from a flagship
smartphone it also has a F 1.8 20
megapixel Samsung ISO cell camera with
optical image stabilization electronic
image stabilization and phase detection
autofocus the software experience seems
very well-thought-out with a super auto
mode that automatically uses features
like HDR and offers easier methods of
taking photos like voice recognition and
actually you can just put your finger on
the fingerprint reader and it will take
a photo and from what we've seen the
photos look really good
there's also a recessed fingerprint
reader below the camera and that is
actually recessed so that users know
that it is the fingerprint reader and
not the camera so far it seems very fast
and accurate but the real highlight of
this phone is that it has two dedicated
audio chipsets the AKM 496 one and four
four nine zero the forward provides the
high fiber cording and playback and the
later is independent for further hi-fi
audio enhancement there is three channel
hi-fi and one channel VAD recording and
two mic noise suppression and a
conference mode which will actually help
the phone record up to seven meters in a
conference room omnidirectional of
course there is dual stereo dolby atmos
front-facing speakers and let me tell
you they sound amazing they're very loud
without any distortion and we would say
that they're probably the best on any
smartphone currently there's also an 8
megapixel front facing camera between
the speaker on the top left of the
device we also have the 5.5 inch 2 and
1/2 D glass and LED display which is a
quad HD resolution and is quoted in
Gorilla Glass 4 under the hood we have
the beastly Snapdragon 820 with an
Adreno 530 GPU the us model will include
4 gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of
storage which is even expandable up to
128 gigabytes with the hybrid SIM tray
setup since this phone will ship
unlocked with dual nano SIM slots it
also has a 30 140 milliamp hour battery
and while it does not support wireless
charging like devices like the Galaxy s7
because of its aluminium body it does
support quick charge 3.0 meaning that
you can get 50% charge in just a half
hour on the software side of things it's
running Android 6.0 point 1 marshmallow
with VTES refined me favored UI we
obviously need more time with it but
from what we've seen so far the
experience appears to be very good
especially with the attention to detail
and things like integrated voice
recognition
to top it all off the Exxon seven will
come with a 2-year limited warranty as
well as axon Passport offering unlimited
out of warranty repairs like display
replacements for cracked screens for a
deduction for two years keep in mind
also that ZTE will pay for shipping to
ZTE and return shipping if you do need
to repair although this does seem very
comparable to the galaxy s7 and HTC ten
the price of the axon seven will be much
lower as a way to undercut the
competition ZTE has also announced v2
EVR a VR headset which will eventually
work with Google daydream although there
will definitely be more details about
that on our website and there you have
it there's our first look at the ZTE
axon 7 please stay tuned for our full
review once we have more time with this
device and the software is finalized
