weekly show is brought to you by
chameleon color adapting live wallpaper
Logan ladies gentlemen I'm Joe Hindy the
android authority app guy and welcome
back to android apps weekly it's a
little bit boring because it's
summertime but we did still have some
headlines let's take a look at them with
a little bit of tinkering it's been
found out that you can in fact control
Windows 10 with your Android smartphone
it requires the use of tasker and a
couple of plugins still there is a
learning curve there but it's really
cool to see this being done earlier this
week the esteemed and unique browser
link bubble received a huge update to
version 1.5 on top of getting the update
the application also got a new owner as
developer Chris Lacey announced the sale
it was for an undisclosed amount and to
an undisclosed company I'm sure we'll
know more about it eventually speaking
of things being sold Nokia offloaded
their acclaimed here maps to various
German auto manufacturers such as Audi
and BMW for about 2.8 billion US dollars
this is a huge deal but interestingly
enough Nokia actually took a loss
because they originally paid 8.1 billion
for a few years ago square enix
announced a huge sale this week that
includes a number of their biggest
titles including some final fantasy
games secret of mana and Dragon Quest 8
square enix is known for putting out
some expensive games so this is a great
chance to get them for a little bit
cheaper a new humble bundle is out now
and it includes nine games from Games
Workshop which means there are a ton of
warhammer games to be had the whole
package would cost you forty four
dollars if you bought them separately
but you can get them all for just about
four bucks and donate to charity in the
process that's a win-win for even more
Android apps and games headlines updates
and new releases don't forget to check
out this week's newsletter which is
linked in the video description below
there we'll have all the stuff that
happened including this or in the video
if you want you can also sign up with
your email address and have this info
beam to your inbox every single Friday
and while you're at it don't forget to
check us out on twitch we're on a short
hiatus while I wait for my Nvidia shield
tablet to get replaced but we do have a
ton of awesome content already there for
you to check out don't forget to hit
that subscribe button and join in on the
next streams which will likely happen
next week I will actually see you there
ok functions take a look at the apps and
games that made a big splash this week
as usual if you want to check any of
these applications out you can find the
links in the video description below
the beta version of Google's Chrome
browser received a fairly significant
update this last week it will now have
chrome custom tabs enabled which for
those who may not know is something that
was announced for Android M back at
Google i/o earlier this year along with
that came an update to the bookmark
interface and playback controls for the
media if you want to see the future of
Google Chrome then give this app a try
the bar mark is an interesting and
unique adventure game that has no point
by that I mean there is no score no
goals and no 3 starring anything you
walk around in a fairly well designed
world and alter the landscape based on
what you think it should look like it's
kind of weird because it doesn't have a
goal or a point which technically
doesn't qualify it as a video game but
it is an interesting application
nevertheless it is two dollars and
ninety-nine cents but to beware of those
release day bugs gun jack is a new video
game that was developed specifically for
the Samsung gear VR platform by the
developers who brought us the eve series
of games it's a first person shooter
where you sit in a turret spin around
and shoot bad guys this is an awesome
premise of one of the few VR games that
really takes advantage of the platform
without feeling like it was
intentionally built around it it's done
but it wanders until this autumn the
fish brain is an application for fishing
enthusiasts that kind of turns the
actual act of fishing into a video game
it's a crowdsourced application that
allows you to see what fish are biting
where and keep track of where you are
when the fish actually do start biting
there are also leaderboards prayer
locations you can see who has caught the
most and biggest fish it's a fun little
application and one that all anglers
should definitely try out last up this
week is shooting star shooting stars is
the latest game out of noodle cake
studios this one has you suiting up and
battling aliens that are mostly
disguised as celebrities it's an arcade
shooter with retro graphics and tons of
rainbow lasers explosions and bright
colors the game also includes over 60
ridiculous weapons plenty of celebrity
cameos and there is also a hoverboard
it's fast paced and utterly ridiculous
and there are also no in-app purchases
thanks again for watching everybody but
let's get down to some serious business
this week's Android apps weekly is
sponsored by a chameleon color adapting
live wallpaper this unique live
wallpaper changes your background colors
based on your surroundings the way it
works is you set the wallpaper and then
find things you'd like and point your
camera at it to grab the colors it
includes a preview to see what colors
you'll be getting and it's pretty decent
on battery life it's an interesting live
wallpaper and it's
to go ahead and give it a shot once
