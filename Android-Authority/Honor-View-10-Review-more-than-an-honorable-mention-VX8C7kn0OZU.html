bit of money and one company that has
really done a good job of it is honor
with their budget smartphones they
already have a presence in the West and
now they're trying to hit the sub 500
dollar market with a high-end
specification smartphone hey it's Josh
Vergara what's going on everybody
and this is the honor view 10 now for
starters the on review 10 is only
available in certain markets not
necessarily available in the US just yet
but this model in particular is used in
Europe also I did something a little bit
different with this review check the
corner and keep your eye there just so
you can see when that stuff happens for
starters the view of the view 10 is
really not all that bad we have this
dark blue color here that shines real
nicely and is a little bit understated
until you give it a second glance and
realize that dark blue is pretty nice
it's also a very Spartan design as you
don't have too many elements all around
all of the buttons are over on one side
and on the back you just have the honor
logo with pretty much nothing else there
other than the dual lens package both of
those lenses stick out on their own and
it provides a pretty unique look for the
backing of this device the front is
pretty much all screen all the time with
an 18 by 9 aspect ratio and minimal
bezels this 18 by 9 aspect ratio also
allows for the phone to be pretty easily
handled in one hand even though the
screen to body ratio is quite good there
is still a capacitive key on the bottom
so it's not really all screen on the
front but it does a good job of being as
minimal as possible there is a
fingerprint reader embedded within so
that's where the fingerprint reader is
but the capacitive key can actually be
used for a number of different functions
namely the ability to use it for
everything that you would use soft keys
for back home recent apps and you can
even swipe up from the bottom of the
screen to trigger a Google assistant
that leaves more room for everything
that you would do on that large 5.99
inch screen
eighteen by nine aspect ratios are not
necessarily special anymore but it is
nice to see them coming in phones that
are more affordable this is a full HD
panel an IPS panel that comes in at a
size of five point nine nine inches like
we said before even though text and
media all looks fine on this screen I
did have to change the settings a little
bit because at first because this is a
full HD screen but it's a large screen
some of the elements were a bit too big
but it's easy to just jump into the
settings and just shrink things down a
little bit so it does look proper there
is one thing I miss on this display and
it's an always-on feature it's found on
plenty of other phones even ones of the
same price points and you kind of miss
it when it's gone however there is face
on lock which we'll get into a little
bit later but it comes with it the
ability to wake the device once you lift
it up so when you have face unlock
available you just lift up the device
and it unlocks immediately once it
recognizes my face pretty easy to get
into the interface honor spares little
expense and making sure the performance
is top-notch we're now only seeing this
trend start to occur more in the West
but the storage and the RAM are really
high you get six gigabytes of RAM and
128 gigabytes of on-board storage here
it is also a dual SIM capable phone but
one of those SIM slots can be used for a
microSD card where honor takes it a step
further is by putting in huawei's
high-end chipset the Kirin 970 yes you
heard that right
the cur√© 970 that comes with a neural
processing unit we're still in the early
days of consumers seeing this kind of
chipset so all of the benefits that the
NPU is supposed to afford the
performance aspect is yet to be seen
fully the main place that we might see
the NPU actually doing its job is in the
camera when it's trying to select the
proper modes for the scene other than
that however the ki-rin 970 still does a
great job of providing a speedy and
reliable performance with this version
of Android
as far as connections go pretty much
everything you would expect is here
including NFC sand you can use the view
tent for various payment platforms
now speaking of connections I did use
this phone which is a European model
with the t-mobile network but because it
doesn't really have the bands for it I
wasn't able to use LTE connectivity
instead I was on HSPA+ as far as battery
life goes there is a 37 50 milliamp hour
battery and here which is kind of
impressive for a phone at this price
point however the battery life is about
where you would expect it to be and with
that I was able to get up to 6 hours of
screen on time but there's one thing
that was clear it was able to get
through an entire day on Wi-Fi in my
case without any problems at all
so we finally make it to the part that
generally makes or breaks the full
experience of an affordable flagship
that's of course the camera now the
camera has two lenses on the rear the
main shooter has a 16 megapixel and a 20
megapixel monochrome sensor and together
they're supposed to provide pretty sharp
photos together with the potential power
of the MP you making sure that you're
using the right scene mode the combined
camera package should be able to get
some sharp and enjoyable photos and for
the most part that was the case but the
front-facing camera is a bit of a
different story now I hesitate to say
that the front-facing camera is actually
all that bad in reality when you turn
all of the modes off the pictures can
actually come out fairly decent but it's
when you turn all those modes that you
realize that the Asian market routes
this thing has greatly influenced the
experience I'm talking of course about
the beauty modes say what you will about
a beauty mode about whether or not you
would actually use it but it does do its
job here as my freckles actually just
disappeared from existence but of course
in the West that's not really a priority
when we want more detail and more
clarity out of our photos the best I can
say is that the front-facing camera is
not really a bad shooter it's just it's
priorities are a little bit different so
it depends on what your needs are from a
front facing potential beauty mode
camera and if that's really what you
want then the on review 10 actually does
its job quite well those portrait mode
and wide aperture modes are also
available in the rear cameras even one
year shooting video when used with some
extra care the photos coming out of the
phone can be pretty great sharpness is
where it should be especially on the
opposite end of the spectrum when
compared to the front-facing camera and
the colors are mostly accurate the
camera does tend to overexpose a little
but you just need to put a little bit of
extra care with that evey slider and
compensate for it there are plenty of
other modes as well including HDR which
is a mode and not a toggle which is kind
of a personal pet peeve but there are
also modes and more artsy modes if you
want to get fancy what I do like about
the video mode like I said is the
ability to use the wide aperture mode
while you're recording now technically
these numbers don't really mean anything
because the lens is already F 1.8 so
you're going to get depth of field
elements no matter what and as you've
been seeing throughout this video I've
been using clips to kind of break apart
the review a little bit so you've
already been seeing what the video
quality can be like the main issue with
the video is that there's no optical
image stabilization so you if you have
shaky hands then you're gonna get shaky
video
this lack of OIS is also
bad for low-light shooting where the
shutter has to be open for quite a while
and you have to be incredibly still in
order to get a well exposed shot but
even if you move just a little bit then
your shots might come out blurry so like
with most cameras and most phones
Rayleigh there is a bit of a give and
take situation at this price point
and finally we can talk about the
software experience which happens to
differ from many of the established
Android iterations that are here in the
West
like I've been alluding to in this video
there are some real Asian influences
here and the software with the emui
continues that trend the main thing
you'll notice is there's no app drawer
so you're going to have to make a bunch
of folders or just put a third-party
launcher on here but after that there
are a number of other features that are
available when you dive into the
settings I already mentioned the
navigation dock earlier where the one
capacitive key can be used for
everything that the soft keys would do
and then there are also app centric
abilities like putting access to some
apps behind the lockscreen and then you
can also have more than one instance of
any application which is mainly used for
social media apps speaking of social
media there is a button in the gallery
when you're looking at photos and video
to just send it straight to snapchat
when you click that button it will open
up snapchat and you're able to get
higher quality photos and potentially
videos then the built in camera that
snapchat has which we all know is pretty
shoddy the face on lock setup is a
little bit quick which makes me question
its level of security sometimes however
there is a feature here like we
mentioned before that the screen will
wake when you pick up the phone that
allows you to have a seamless movement
from prone position to getting into the
interface just as long as your faces in
view makes it for a pretty quick
unlocking experience and so there you
have it the honor view 10 honor is back
and is providing a affordable flagship
for the price of about four hundred and
forty nine euros at least for this
European version and then we'll see what
the price is when it finally comes to
the US overall it's a pretty good
package that provides a good alternative
to the one plus 5t which comes in at
pretty much the same price point and
provides a lot of the same features it's
really that honors just putting its spin
on it ends mainly the emui is the
biggest change that you might notice
from one to the other
we'll do a comparison between the two
soon but the bottom line is this honor
has done a great job of bringing a
high-end experience for a mid-range
price and with potential improvements
coming to the ki-rin 970 in the future
this phone could maintain its relevance
even longer than other flagship devices
the rest of the phone is done well and
at this point the whole package doesn't
have to make this phone achieve more
than just another on
will mention so thank you guys so much
for watching and hope you enjoyed this
review of the honor view 10 now it's
called the v10 in some markets and it's
not available in the US yet but in
Europe it does come in under $450 so
that's something you can take into
consideration when on or finally brings
it to the United States otherwise you
can keep it tuned to Android Authority

affordable phones and this particular
phone and all of the other ones we might
be seeing in the coming weeks and in
