authority we're here live at CES 2013
and on top of the recently announced
just today Tegra 4 nvidia also announced
something we had no idea what was coming
nvidia announced their shield gaming
controller which allows you to not only
play android games but also pc games on
any pc running a GTX cpu the shield has
a 720p display it runs Android 4.2 out
of the box but has a Tegra 4 processor
and is pretty much set to blow away the
Wii U or the PlayStation Vita if it's
given the chance we're going to see what
happens with that later on but it looks
very promising ladies and gentlemen
please enjoy this view
ladies German like to introduce you to
the project forward now excuse me crush
it
let's show them what what shield is all
about
of course shield is going to be the
world's first time before processors
next half with batteries 38 watt-hours
gives you someone to apply to 10 hours
of gameplay you don't have to use up all
your air battery life on your phone
anymore to play your games and all of
the games just show up obviously this is
in the Android Play Store it's integra's
own it's in the cloud that's of every
game that you will magically shows up
and then you can enjoy the finer 10
hours and you're just watching
high-definition video about 24 hours
gamers need game great game controllers
buttons and joysticks digital d-pads
bumpers
this period period way to put a scan on
top of it we didn't change it that's
pure in River tiger forth and the only
thing that you have to do is hit the
shield blood right in the middle it
hyperspace is you into the shield look
you hit it dr. that can handle pure
handling everything works exactly as if
you would expect and the Android device
to work nexus in his standard iOS no
proprietary interfaces proprietary
Jack's you'll have to buy yet another
charger all of you years of each other's
just works it's an open platform and so
you can add more 31 so there's a microSD
slot next person this is shield
first of all this is just this is just
no you can enjoy music
it will go cycle touch works just like
you can control it with the controller
or touch whichever you like an animal
movies work
human device
this
lots of you will travel with me were
growing up
so first of all this is an Android lysis
period or however however might simply
touching the shield one and now you're
inside game environment
these are the gauge aluminum here one
everything is hundred percent number
save your droid and these games are all
available on 10 personal and optimized
for the controller as you see what you
know driving a 4k display white out of
shape
let's notice the nose okay all right cuz
I'm pretty amazing however how do you
get your pc the sit next to television
in my house the BC is far away and so
the question is nothing we do that well
do they like to show you something then
it's possible as a result of all the
technology that you guys saw today
should be your shin you're sitting
anywhere in the house your pc is your
room and your they're sitting on the
couch pretending like you're stays under
your family and and more you're in bed
pretend to be sleeping or you're in some
of the room
Assassin's Creed that's amazingly
beautiful hey guys
good job I guess if you press thinks
enough time to work and so what you saw
shield enjoy games from two of the most
important digital stores in the world
the Google after work place or within it
a curated easy to recall TegraZone
everything you buy there on your phone
on your tablet from your PC using their
website just shows up on chill you
download it can you play the way to it
to be played you can also connect to the
other great story Steve with almost 2000
games with 15 minute 54 million users
all these games are now able to enjoy
their steam games from anywhere around
the house and hopefully the future even
beyond you for more news stay tuned to
android authority we're going to be live
