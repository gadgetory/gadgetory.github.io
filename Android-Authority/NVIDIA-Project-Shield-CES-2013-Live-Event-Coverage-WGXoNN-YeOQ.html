controller which allows you to not only
play android games but also pc games on
any pc running a GTX cpu the shield has
a 720p display it runs Android 4.2 out
of the box but has a Tegra 4 processor
and is pretty much set to blow away the
Wii U or the PlayStation Vita if it's
given the chance we're going to see what
happens with that later on but it looks
very promising ladies and gentlemen
please enjoy this view
ladies German like to introduce you to
the project forward now excuse me crush

let's show them what what shield is all
about
of course shield is going to be the
world's first time before processors
next half with batteries 38 watt-hours
gives you someone to apply to 10 hours
of gameplay you don't have to use up all
your air battery life on your phone
anymore to play your games and all of
the games just show up obviously this is
in the Android Play Store it's integra's
own it's in the cloud that's of every
game that you will magically shows up
and then you can enjoy the finer 10
hours and you're just watching
high-definition video about 24 hours
gamers need game great game controllers
buttons and joysticks digital d-pads
bumpers
this period period way to put a scan on
top of it we didn't change it that's
pure in River tiger forth and the only
thing that you have to do is hit the
shield blood right in the middle it
hyperspace is you into the shield look
you hit it dr. that can handle pure
handling everything works exactly as if
you would expect and the Android device
to work nexus in his standard iOS no
proprietary interfaces proprietary
Jack's you'll have to buy yet another
charger all of you years of each other's
just works it's an open platform and so
you can add more 31 so there's a microSD
slot next person this is shield
first of all this is just this is just
no you can enjoy music
it will go cycle touch works just like
you can control it with the controller
or touch whichever you like an animal

period or however however might simply
touching the shield one and now you're
inside game environment
these are the gauge aluminum here one
everything is hundred percent number
save your droid and these games are all
available on 10 personal and optimized
for the controller as you see what you

shape
let's notice the nose okay all right cuz

anywhere in the house your pc is your
room and your they're sitting on the
couch pretending like you're stays under
your family and and more you're in bed
