Authority and I wanted to show you all
the forests play-fi wireless speaker
this has just recently shipped to me and
when you look at it it basically looks
like Forrest is trying to become a
competitor against Sonos primarily in
the wireless speaker space for your home
that you can control using your Android
device looking at the design of the
forest play-fi speaker you'll see that
it's kind of like an oval-shaped cone
that comes up into a soft tip right up
here at the top nothing pointed but
certainly in oval shaped and this
360-degree speaker design so sound
should be coming out from all sides or
one big side rather because there's not
any side on this curvature looking at
the front of the speaker you've got a
nice forest logo it's very understated
right here you have a Bluetooth button
and a Wi-Fi button to tell the speaker
where it's going to be communicating
either over your wireless network or
directly to the Bluetooth on a phone
right here you have a power button of
volume down and a volume up and then we
have this kind of rubberized grip e
material right here for s promises that
you can dock and charge your phone at
the same time and while they're
technically true and saying that it's a
little bit deceptive and how they're
actually getting there yes you can put a
phone or a tablet here and a phone will
sit right nice in there but if you look
closely you'll see that there is
actually no charging port but when you
flip over to the back of the of the
speaker you'll see that there's a USB
port right here what force ended up
doing is they included a USB to microUSB
and a USB to mini-usb cable so if you
want to charge your device while it's
actually resting on the speaker you have
to have a cable coming from the back to
the front which means that most likely
your phone is going to have to be
horizontal instead of standing straight
up like you see so many high devices on
their docks
flipping back to the back of the device
there is the requisite power port right
there for AC adapter a microUSB port a
USB port this is a reset button right
here you see they're all nice buttons
down here or labels down here pardon and
then this is what appears to be jack a
three
a millimeter jack I have not had the
opportunity to set this up yet so I
don't have any audio samples for you
live on camera but I will when I put out
my full review also just because of
where I'm located in doing this you need
to have an AC adapter plugged into a
wall for this to be powered which is
another sort of deceptive thing in all
of the marketing materials in the
pictures on the box it shows this
beautiful speaker just sitting there
like that with a phone resting on top of
it and unfortunately there needs to be a
cable running out of the back to charge
the phone if you want to do that and
there needs to be another cable running
out of the back if you want to actually
power the device so just some things to
keep in mind otherwise that is the
forest play fie speaker they promise
lossless audio over Wi-Fi which is
supposed to be a big deal I will be even
you might in depth thoughts and opinions
on the quality of the speaker once I get
it set up and use it for an extended
amount of time but thank you for tuning
in to my hands-on of the forest play-fi
wireless speaker</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
