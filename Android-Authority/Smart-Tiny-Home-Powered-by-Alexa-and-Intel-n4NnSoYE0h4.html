and we're here at CES 2017 taking a look
at the smart tiny home it's a home
that's only about 210 square feet and
pretty much everything is practically in
one room with the exception of the
bathroom but what makes this tiny home
so smart is the integration that it has
with the Amazon echo and an intel-based
hub everything in the house can be
controlled through Alexa and the Intel
Hub from the lights the locks on the
door and even the BMW that's sitting
outside the entire home is filled with
smart home devices you can ask Alexa all
the basic stuff like what's the weather
or have her turn on the lights and
she'll do them just as you would
normally expect but because of the Intel
Hub she's able to do more complex tasks
and control multiple smart home devices
at once these tasks would go through
Alexa to the hub and sent up to the
cloud and that may sound like a lot but
it all seemed to happen pretty quickly
and this particular demo that I got to
experience they had presets were setting
the home to a movie time mode so with a
single command the blinds would close
the lights would dim the projector would
turn on and the home would be ready for
you to watch movies
another example they showed off was a
good morning mode so all you had to do
was say hey Alexa turn on good morning
and this would raise the blinds turn on
the lights turn up the temperature on
the thermostat and get your teakettle
going without you having to lift a
single finger the possibilities are
pretty much endless as to how you want
to control your home we saw a lot of
integration with Alexa here at this
year's CES and this is probably one of
the most impressive showcases of Alexa
and it's definitely a huge step into the
future that I think many people are
going to want in their home and even
some stuff outside their home but this
has been a quick look of the smart tiny
home here at CES 2017 thank you guys so
much for watching and let us know down
in the comments below on your thoughts
on these smart tiny home powered by
Alexa and the Intel hub also don't
forget to give this video a thumbs up
and also subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already and keep it tuned here
to Andra thority for the rest of your
CES 2017 coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
