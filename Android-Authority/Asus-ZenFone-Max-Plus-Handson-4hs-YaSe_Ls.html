their high specs low price flagships and
they she was really no different we got
a chance to visit them at CES 2018 and
they showed off their newest addition to
the zenfone line the zenfone max plus
now sure this thing isn't going to wow
you with a snapdragon 835 and an
insanely clean UI basis has always gone
after the budget minded consumers who
want a large amount of features at a
lower price and that's exactly what the
zenfone max is it's got three to four
gigs of RAM 32 to 64 gigabytes of
storage it uses a mediatek octa-core
processor to power it but the real
kicker here is the battery in the dual
cameras the zenfone max is packin 4130
million powers of capacity which is
enough to make anyone take a second look
at this to the fact that you're using a
full HD display instead of Q HD and
you're probably gonna have a ridiculous
amount of battery life out of this thing
it's still using micro USB though so
yeah no rapid charging this time around
as I mentioned earlier this phone also
has dual cameras now don't expect pixel
two levels of quality out of this phone
but for the time we had it it actually
seemed to perform pretty well the second
camera is wide-angle like the LG BT 30
so if you've been itching to get some
wide shots on the cheap this might be
worth a look it's also got a face unlock
feature which seems to be pretty popular
these days but I'd be careful how much
faith you put into this feature it's not
all rainbows and unicorns though the
metal they use on the body feels pretty
cheap and felt really tinny and slippery
in my hand add that to the fact that
genui is still pretty bad especially
sentenced running on top of android 7.0
nukid you've got something you're really
gonna want to skin pretty hard with a
third-party launcher still at the price
point asus is asking this is a pretty
interesting device a huge battery and
average screen will probably get you a
ton of london Tiffa t if that's the most
important aspect of your phone and the
wide-angle camera lens can be pretty fun
to play with if you're bored of the
average focal length you'll be able to
get the zenfone max plus in February of
2018
it'll come in deep C black in Azure
silver make sure you stay tuned to
android authority to keep up to date
with all
CES coverage because of course we are
your source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
