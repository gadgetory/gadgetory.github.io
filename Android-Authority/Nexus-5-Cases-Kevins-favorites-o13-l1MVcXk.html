name is Kevin the tech ninja and these
are my favorite cases for the Nexus 5
now these cases range between $20 and
$70 now let's figure out if it's truly
you get what you pay for there are four
cases that I really enjoy for the Nexus
5 two of the cases are official cases
and the other two are from a third-party
company the first case is the official
Nexus 5 bumper case this case comes in a
variety of bold colors and this is the
case that you put on your device if you
really want it to stand out burn into
the back of the case is the word Nexus
and that familiar font the cutouts are
precise and it does not have any wasted
space so for example on the lens only
the black part that is surrounding it is
shown and it has a separate cutout for
the flash top of the case has a cutout
for the headphones and also tiny one for
one of the sensors if you go to the
bottom side there are cutouts for the
speaker grilles and after the inspecting
is really close it matches up to the
actual speaker grille just overall
details with this bumper case is
something you cannot truly appreciate
unless you hold it the soft touch rubber
feels tight and secure around your
device and it should provide some shock
protection since there are no moving
parts the buttons are covered and sealed
and out of the box it does require a
little bit of effort to press them down
and since the case is tough and it's
flexible it really should last for a
while and also you can really tell the
difference between this type of case and
one of those knockoff cases you Bob eBay
for 39 cents this case cost 35 dollars
and can be purchased from the Google
Play Store staying with the trend of
official cases next up is the official
Nexus 5 quick cover case this case comes
in two simple colors black on black or
white on grey this is a slim case so the
top and bottoms are both exposed while
there in this case this asks the
lightweight and the unobtrusive nature
of this case just don't expect it to
protect it from a fall ocean the back of
the case feels just like the black Nexus
5 or the second gen Nexus 7 the inside
of the case is a soft velvet material
that should keep the screen scratch and
scuff free all the cutouts in the case
are precise just like the bumper case
and on the back
to the nexus word it has just a simple
LG local not as bold as the bumper case
but it's extremely sleek just like any
phone or case using this type of
material it becomes a fingerprint magnet
in this case is no exception I've seen
horror stories with every phone and to
be honest I'm just worried with this
case if I drop it the flap will open up
and the phone will fall screen first I
would have like some type of magnet
mechanism or something to actually hold
the protector on until you peel it off
but that's just my opinion ultimately is
your decision if a 50 dollar price tag
is worth it to you the third case is
called the Neo Hybrid in its bias vision
this is a combo case with hard metal
edges with a soft flexible rubber case
on the inside this concept sounds cool
but this interpretation of this fall's a
bit shorter of what I expect still once
the case is put together and the phone
is in it this case holds up well the
cutouts are not super precise as the
official cases they're a bit larger than
they should be it seems like spigen was
sort of estimating the size of these
cutouts but at the end of the day it
gets the job done
the back of the case has the same
fingerprint magnet matte finish that
we'd expect and the metal trimming
around the case makes it feel flush and
smooth the buttons are separate pieces
and this worries me about the longevity
of the case but as of right now these
buttons are doing their job on the back
of the case it has the patented spigen
logo
it also says Neo Hybrid along the edge
of the metal casing for what it is
it's a thin case and it feels just nice
to hold it adds a bit of weight to the
device but it makes it feel more solid
in my opinion this case is not perfect
but it's a great alternative if you want
a different type of case in this case
sales for $20 on Amazon my last case
that I have for you today is the most
expensive one if you're in the States
you may not have heard of this case
brand but they have a huge portfolio of
cases also for what is worth it's one of
the best cell phone accessories website
I have ever seen and I just feel so sexy
looking at it this is the LG Nexus 5
leather case by noir Eve the case itself
is a horizontal flip case
it hugs in groups my next is quite well
it's set to be made from premium leather
now I'm not an upholstery expert by any
means but it feels like real leather to
me this case does not have much
stitching where the stitching is it
looks perfect and one thing that makes
this case really unique is that it
doesn't have real cutouts but the design
of the case allows you to have access to
speaker grilles headphone jacks sensors
power button and SIM slot the cover is
also a smart cover so in opening the
case the screen will turn on this case
is beautiful when there's no other way
to put it the top edges are gripped and
also most of the sides so it should hang
on to your phone for a while there's one
minor gripe that I have in that it has
the logo on the front of the case and if
you're getting an all black case you may
want a sleek case that doesn't stick out
or have anything or identifying markers
while this logo is always going to be on
your case and that's one minor gripe
that I have but on the flip side what
you can do is you can actually customize
this case fully you can customize the
texture the color and also the inner
color as well now when you make changes
to the inner color or the lining that is
going to be an additional charge you can
also have a clip put on this either a
plastic one or metal clip and this
really helps you make the case into
something of your own if you're going to
spend a lot of money on something make
sure it's personalized to you not just a
cookie cutter generic random something
just something that has significance to
you is something that you really enjoy
