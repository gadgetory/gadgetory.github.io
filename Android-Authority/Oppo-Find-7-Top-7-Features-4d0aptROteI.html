the Oppo find 7 we have to talk about
that stunning display now in the actual
press events that happened or the launch
rather we did hear that they were
originally thinking of making a six-inch
phone but personally I think it was a
lot better to pick a 5.5 inch screen
that now has quad HD and now that's 2560
by 1440 resolution which is absolutely
incredible on top of that you have 538
pixels per inch
basically just beating out any other
device that's currently on the markets
and now while we might not be able to
actually show you in real time this
particular feature one thing we really
are very excited about is the ultra-fast
charging capability now the name might
be a little bit convoluted but the vu or
in our case we called it the multi step
constant current charging allows for
really fast charging from 0 to 75
percent in just half an hour now I don't
have any footage of the charging
actually happening and you don't see
that percent going up but in our testing
we did find that it went up by five-hole
percent in just a couple of minutes no
matter which way you slice it that's
just absolutely just really really a big
prospect and it's really amazing now one
thing we have to tell you is that the
phone requires a special charger or the
one that came with it if you want to
take advantage of that fast charging
capability the main reason being because
there is technology in the big block
itself that works with the battery that
has the same technology and they work in
congruence so if you use other chargers
it's most likely that you're going to
get a more normal charging speed we're
looking at aesthetics in the next
feature and that is the skyline
notification line that you find at the
bottom of the phone it is a nice curved
light at the bottom that where the light
starts in the middle and then it
permeates across the bottom it just
looks really attractive it's something
that you can't help but notice
especially when the screen is off and
you see that light just sort of come on
there's a little bit of special
technology under there but all in all we
find this to be one of the most
attractive notification lights out there
right now
and now we move on to the future that
I'm actually probably the most excited
about and that's the camera what we're
looking at here is a 13 megapixel new
Sony Exmor RS sensor that allows for a
lot of capability primarily because Opel
has really been trying to think outside
of the box when it comes to their
software package when it comes to the
app basically you have a pretty simple
looking app with a lot of power
underneath not only do you have 4k video
recording which you're looking at right
now even though this video can only be
rendered in 1080p but you also have a
nice feature oh yes we do have to cover
it the 50 megapixel super zoom
technology or rather that capability
that is built-in in which it takes a
bunch of different photos and then puts
the best ones together in order to
create from the 13 megapixel optics a
huge 50 megapixel shot after that though
there are a few features that I'm really
excited to put through its paces in the
future focus like shooting in RAW format
and of course coming back to that 4k
video capture we want to see how Opel
really does it and the sample that we
have actually looks quite great so that
is what we're focusing on in the future
once we get our hands on a review units
the next couple features are going to be
pretty simple but they are huge game
changers at least for oboe and one of
them is the expandable storage that you
now have underneath that back cover
which is now removable as well which is
another first underneath that cover
there is that little crevice that you
take that you use in order to take the
battery out and it is under that area
that you have the micro SD card slot and
also it is able to take the
high-capacity SD cards that go up to 128
gigabytes so you have a lot of storage
available to you on top of the 16 or 32
gigabytes depending on which model you
get and yet talking about another first
for Oppo is the fact that define 7 is
the first elbow device to be able to
connect to LTE networks which means that
you'll be able to take advantage of your
AT&amp;amp;T or t-mobile if you're in the US or
your high-speed pretty much anywhere you
are and that's a big deal because
anybody like myself who are kind of sick
of the HSPA+ connectivity will now find
blazing fast speeds when it comes to
their mobile internet and on a phone
that happens to be blazing fast itself
and our final feature that we're going
to cover in this top seven for the find
seven is the build quality that sports
either a brushed back or a carbon-fiber
back either one feels really nice and
makes it look really great though I will
say that the carbon fiber probably feels
a little bit more secure in the hand due
to which texture the fine 5 originally
was to me a little bit of a heavier
phone but I did not blame it at all
because it had that five inch 1080p
display and it was one of the first to
support that and it also had steel
elements in there well the fine 7
despite being just about as heavy maybe
a little bit more happens to have a much
better weight distribution and that's
the reason why I actually really loved
using it even at 5.5 inches in the
screen it wasn't that hard to maneuver
around the phone but overall you have a
very attractive device not only with
those little aesthetic changes like the
LED notification light and the carbon
fiber on the back but ultimately you
have what might be one of the prettiest
looking phones available out in the
market today and so there you have it
for these top seven features on the Oppo
find 7
like I said we're finishing up our
coverage on the Oppo find 7 the launch
and this was just a quick look at some
of the best ones that we think really
set this phone apart so stay tuned to
Android Authority for all of the best
coverage including our Oppo find 7 first
look in hands-on that you see right here
and is linked right over on the side
stay tuned for even more coverage of it
including some verses and once we get
our hands on a review unit we're going
to give you all of the great bits and
pieces that really make this phone very
special so keep it tuned to Android
authority for all of that and remember
to head on over to the website in order
to see our even more in-depth coverage
