Hindy the android authority app guide
are you big into reading the news but
you're kind of tired of reading articles
all day long a new application called
Newsbeat may be able to fix that and in
this video we're going to check it out
okay so what does this app actually do
it's a news aggregator not unlike RSS
you tell it your interests and what
publications you like and it will fetch
news from sources that report on that
kind of news what's interesting is that
while you do get the option to read the
articles you also get the option to
listen to them that's right this app
will read you the news in a news radio
style format so you don't have to read
it yourself the voices aren't perfect
but they are pretty good they even have
voice inflections to make themselves
sound more real some who have used the
application already have stated
preferences between the male and female
voice but frankly both of them are about
equal there is still that robotic tone
every now and again especially when they
try to pronounce difficult words or
people's names but they do well it's
sounding real enough to where it isn't
distracting when listening to the news
newsbeat goes the whole nine yards to
make it sound like a radio show when you
open the app it'll greet you by name if
you have your name entered into the
application it'll then give you your
local traffic rundown sometimes which i
thought was a nice touch it then
proceeds to read the news articles back
to back until there are none left when
it reads news articles it'll state the
source and the author in a manner you'd
expect a radio host to do of course you
still do have the option to read the
news if you so choose you can pause at
any time and scroll through the articles
on your own if you prefer the only real
issue we found where a lack of sources
it seems to take more from local
publications and worldwide news sources
so you don't get too many options when
it comes to where it reads the news from
the design is pretty decent it's not
overly colorful but it is easy to
navigate so no one should have any
problems figuring out where to go or how
to use the app there is a hamburger menu
on the left side where you can check out
the app preferences or get the news
articles have two interfaces you can
look at them one at a time or you can
use the second interface to swipe
through them if you prefer it was a
little laggy here and there but not so
much to make the appt unpleasant once
the voices start to read the news there
will be a notification that pops up you
can swipe it away without interrupting
the voices but it apparently comes back
after a short time which can get
annoying if you're OCD about keeping
your notification drawer cleared out in
the notifications there are skip buttons
as well as a pause in a play button so
you can skip the news or pause it if you
have to ok so here's what we liked about
Newsbeat this app is just a great idea
reading article after article can be
tedious and trying to keep up with the
news all day that way can be tiresome
and frustrating with this you turn it on
connect some headphones or a speaker if
you want to and let some robot people
read you the news it's much less
stressful on your eyes as well since you
don't have to stare it a little screen
to read it if you don't want to the
voices are actually really good as
mentioned there are moments when they
sound blatantly robotic and you never
shake the knowledge that they are fake
voices but they read the news so you
don't have to and they do it pretty well
this includes small things like
pronunciations that a lot of robot
voices usually screw up Newsbeat strings
together the intro when you open the
application the local news and each
story in the flavor of a radio show this
includes short music bursts between
stories and specific phrasing that you'd
hear a radio show host make the male and
female voices also interchange
occasionally giving the illusion of
multiple hosts these aesthetics are
purely atmospheric and not really
functional but it makes the whole thing
sound coherent and it makes the
experience more enjoyable lastly the app
content is fairly customizable while the
sources are seriously lacking you still
get to choose what topics you see if you
have no interest in say politics then it
won't read you any political news ok and
here's what we didn't like so much this
app seriously needs more sources we
assume they'll be adding more as time
goes but for the time being there aren't
all that many places to draw news from
so don't expect to be able to follow
your favorite blogs like android
authority just yet while the topics are
customizable they aren't totally
customizable for example I like hockey
but I dislike pretty much every other
sports I can have the app deliver sports
news but not specifically hockey news so
it'll read me a bunch of football free
agency signings and some baseball news
that I don't care about before it'll
actually read me the columbus blue
jackets game recap that's just one
example there are plenty of others the
playback controls notifications etc are
a little wonky sometimes clearing out
the notification usually results in it
coming right back a few minutes later
and the apt has started reading articles
on its own when a story hits the news
feed it's not terrible but some more
control over the controls would have
been nice overall if you're into RSS and
reading the news then this app presents
a unique premise that is difficult to
pass up it's not difficult to read while
on a subway or a train but if you're
driving or walking it's
more convenient to listen to the news
rather than to try to read it and this
app shines in those kinds of situations
that said we wish there were more
sources that's really the only weakness
that newsbeat has and unfortunately it's
a pretty bad weakness to have we're sure
they're gonna add more eventually but
until then you're stuck with the biggest
dogs in the media who don't always do
the best reporting on things even so the
app is wonderfully done and we recommend
you give it a shot if only to see if you
like it once again I'm Joe Hindy the
