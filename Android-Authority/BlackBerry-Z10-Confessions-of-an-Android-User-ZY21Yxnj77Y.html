what's going on everybody and I do have
something to admit lately I've been
using the BlackBerry z10 as my main
phone remember this phone
the original BlackBerry Bold almost four
years ago which is an amount of time
that equals an eternity in technology
however back in those days a majority of
people I knew rocked Blackberry phones
bbm was the main way of communicating
with friends and the bold used to be the
biggest phone I ever worked with boy did
that change quickly years later we have
a touchscreen blackberry and with OS
version 10 the hope that this platform
can gain back all of the fans lost to
iOS and Android so seeing as I have some
comparisons to do with the z10 and
current top Android devices I wanted to
know if it stood a chance does it the
short answer is not really but it's a
hell of a start and could lead to better
days for blackberry this edition is
black all around and with a 4.2 inch
screen opposite a back covered in an
almost rubbery feeling plastic the great
thing about the bag is that it's
removable giving access to the
replaceable battery and SD card slot
it's a nice feeling phone too but I
think the wait leaves something to be
desired here it's not light enough to be
considered cheap but it also lacks a
certain heft that maybe 5-inch phones
typically have that we've become used to
considering this is a 4.2 inch screen
with 1280 by 768 resolution there really
isn't a whole lot to complain about
otherwise it's not one of the bigger
1080p screens we're seeing and loving
these days but it's adequately bright
and the color production does justice to
videos pictures and games like Angry
Birds you do get a dual-core 1.5
gigahertz Snapdragon processor in there
with adreno 2 to 5 graphics so there is
plenty of performance to go around
little lag is found once you get to the
OS I thought that was going to have a
bad time with the z10 when it took and
does still take quite a while to boot up
it's the only real performance issue
though honestly it is a pretty big one
battery life is a mixed bag I would have
no problem texting writing emails and
checking Facebook on a fairly constant
basis one day and then on another day
when I leave my phone in my pocket for a
long time it drains quicker than I
realize and I'm out of juice before the
end of the day it probably has something
to do with constant syncing but honestly
the consistency
is still annoying I guess if you take
the average though the 1,800 milliamp
hour battery does a decent job at best
then finally we have the camera before I
get into the software with the 8
megapixel shooter on the back and a 2
megapixel camera on the front you pretty
much get what you expect here the rear
camera performs pretty well though some
pictures have grain even in decent
lighting otherwise you get one
particular capability called time shift
essentially it takes a very fast burst
shot and you pick between the various
shots to find the one you want bottom
line there are plenty of much better
cameras out there quality and function
wise but the z10 is certainly capable if
not overly simplistic alright so now we
have blackberry 10 this is a big change
from the BlackBerry OS that we might
know from before certainly a change from
the days of the original bolt brought
into the current century with a
touchscreen interface you have your apps
in the main screens the recent apps
screen and blackberry hub running apps
from the app screens is pretty
straightforward but it's getting back
home that is different notice there are
no buttons anywhere that is because
basically all navigation is done via
swipes swipe up from the bottom within
any application and it seats your
current app in the recent apps screen
you can only get a total of 8 running at
the same time here but that shouldn't be
a problem for most the cool part about
this recent apps functionality is that
anything put there continues to run in
real time so it's kind of like quickly
creating a widget blackberry hub is
another new function meant to integrate
all different services like messaging
Google Talk Facebook Twitter and emails
into one location it's all in a list
format that basically makes you edit
every item one by one because
manipulating groups of messages can
sometimes be a little difficult and
cumbersome having everything in one
place unifies the notifications which is
kind of cool from within any app swipe
up but then hold there to see if you
have anything new while holding you can
swipe to the right to go straight to
those messages you don't get previews of
your messages though because you
actually have to access the hub in order
to see them ultimately provided that you
keep your inbox is pretty clean the hub
is a pretty elegant and nice way of
putting all of your messaging needs
under one roof of course as an Android
user I found myself missing my OS of
choice but only one I couldn't find
that I depend on the main ones were
Spotify for music listening and Google
Voice the solution for Google Voice was
to use the mobile web version which
actually worked out because the built-in
web browser is simplistic unobtrusive
and actually pretty easy to use putting
a bookmark to the mobile Google Voice
website on my app screens was a nice
workaround mind you this is how
blackberry does YouTube as well so
remember that any missing app might have
a capable web version there's still
nothing available for Spotify though for
the typical tasks like messaging a web
browsing though the z10 is actually a
pretty good experience it takes a bit to
get used to the swiping navigation but
once you get the hang of it you'll be
zipping through apps in the hub easily
and honestly it's kind of cool since
it's supposed to be a messaging Beast
the z10 has perhaps one of the best
keyboards I've ever used
somehow the great experience of the
physical keyboards on other BlackBerry
models was translated perfectly for this
touchscreen the fretts space things out
a little making touch typing even easier
while predictive text pops up words
above the next likely letter of whatever
word you're typing just swipe up from
that letter to autocomplete it's clear
that BlackBerry hasn't lost its touch
with messaging keyboards making it the
highlight of my experience the only real
blemish in my otherwise good messaging
experience was no one I know uses bbm
anymore so that was kind of a big bummer
and so there you have it I do have to
admit that blackberry still has a knack
for messaging and the typing experience
on this phone is one of the best that
I've ever had on a touchscreen still if
you want to do anything more with
BlackBerry 10 it's still lacking
primarily because of its lack of apps
sure you can find games some old ones
that were ported over and functionality
like Google Voice requires you to use
the web versions which is honestly just
a simple workaround still what you do
get inside of this phone is pretty nice
looks good and functional and for the
most part it is able to stand on its own
as a smartphone operating system but
compared to the big guns like iOS and
Android it still has a long way to go
however I'm pretty excited to see where
they go with it
we'll be comparing the z10 to some of
androids main players so stay tuned and

YouTube channel for all the action and
remember to keep up with Android
