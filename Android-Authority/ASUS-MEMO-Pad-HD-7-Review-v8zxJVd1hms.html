google fight tablets the Nexus 7 both
versions which were both great offerings
however a soos doesn't stray away from
creating tablets for the more
budget-minded and this is a great
example age Josh magar from Android
thority what's going on everybody
and this is the asus memo pad HD 7 as a
7-inch tablet by a soos you can expect
the memo pad to take a few cues from its
Google 5 brethren this is mostly true
but not for the latest version of the
Nexus 7 however this tablet can be best
described as the fully plastic slightly
hefty a version of the original set
Nexus 7 from 2012 right down to the
button layout and the speaker grille
found on the lower back plastic is the
name of the game here and while I
wouldn't call it a poor build you will
pretty much get what you pay for at the
front you get the 7 inch screen with a
respectable bezel around it it isn't as
thin as we'd like but it is manageable
front facing camera is centered up top
with the Asus logo centered on the
bottom around the sides you see how this
tablet is pretty thick and is like 2
whole parts glued together the button
layout is on the right while the micro
SD card slot lies just opposite of it I
did find the button somewhat odd because
they lie at an angle on the back and
thus feel a little bit weird to press
anyway USB and headphone ports are up
top around the back we have the rear
facing camera in the hand of this budget
tablet toes the line of comfort by being
almost larger than a 1 hand grip usually
would allow it is actually well balanced
it isn't light or heavy by any means and
while the plastic might allude to how
cheap the memo pad actually is it does
feel decent in the hand as it lacks a
slippery touch ultimately you do get
what you pay for with the memo pad but
what you do get doesn't feel too bad
the HD in the name of this memo pad
means that it is packing a display
capable of 1280 by 800 resolution and
216 PPI while quite a few tablets out
there sport less resolution there are
plenty of others out there capable of
more so the memo pad pretty squarely
sits in the middle as an IPS display it
gets nice and bright and colors get an
appreciable amount of vibrancy viewing
angles are actually pretty good all
around as well while the pixel density
might seem a little low
it doesn't make as much of a difference
when the screen is some distance away
from your face luckily when brought in
somewhat closer the pixelation is kept
to a pretty nice minimum while the build
in the screen actually turned out pretty
decent performance is usually where the
budget tablet starts to show its cards
Billiton is a mediatek mt6752
graphics are handled by the power S VR
SGX 544 MP 1
ooh that's a mouthful for a cheap tablet
you shouldn't be expecting the cutting
edge in performance and this is
basically the case scores an NT to keep
things fairly low and in practice I did
run into pretty common instances of
stuttering even in the general UI games
can get hindered quite a bit as well as
the stutter can just get worse and
impede your ability to play well
multitasking isn't helped by the one
gigabyte of RAM doing too much makes the
stutter even worse for simple tasks the
aptly named memo pad could do a decent
job but anything more than that and
you'll probably end up seeing it
struggle the biggest story in the
hardware department is pretty obviously
the inclusion of a micro SD card slot
while cloud computing is something
Google tries to push in its Nexus
devices I couldn't help but feel just a
twinge of jealousy at the expandable
memory that the memo pad can boast aside
from that however you get the standard
package here Wi-Fi Bluetooth 4.0 GPS but
no NFC it's about as bare-bones as you
can get so it makes some sense that Asus
would put in at least a micro SD card
slot to sweeten the pot as much as it
could now battery life on the memo pad
is another example of how this tablet
hits the middle ground
with a 38 90 milli amp power units it
isn't a very high capacity but it did
get the tablet to handle my looping
video test for almost seven hours power
saving certainly helps in this regard as
a soos added in its own power saver to
help you
the most longevity ultimately it will
pretty much survive a day's work
perhaps just barely though depending on
how heavily you use it and you're
probably going to find yourself relying
on that power saver we never really get
all that excited about cameras on
tablets there are rarely ever any flash
diodes and that usually tells us a thing
or two right off the bat about their
quality at five megapixels the memo pads
camera isn't really anything to get too
excited about the app has a good amount
of filters and scene modes on top of the
panorama and HDR picture quality like
pretty much any tablet in any range is
good for pictures in a pinch colors are
a little muted and lacks some vibrancy
while the sharpness leaves a little to
be desired
especially in shots with some depth
ultimately this is what we should expect
from a tablet especially a cheaper one
such as this now a soos didn't spare any
expense in the software department
adding in a myriad of its own tweaks and
extras the Android 4.1.2 version of a
Seuss's own UI comes with a lot of them
aside from the power saver already
mentioned built-in apps include a movie
studio for editing recorded video and
even a couple Asus branded creative apps
like artists for drawing and studio for
gallery editing the most glaring changes
are in the general UI
like the power widget in the
notification drop-down that gives access
to some of the most used settings in a
rather garish purple color hold the home
button down and you'll get an arch of
shortcuts that are customizable and
finally an extra button on the left of
the soft keys gives you access to small
overlay apps that stay on top of
anything you're already doing you get a
lot of tools but I can't help but think
that the sheer number of additions just
further bogs down a tablet that is
already struggling to perform well and
finally as I've mentioned often already
in this review the Asus memo pad HD 7
comes in at $150 a pretty great price
for at least a decent tablet and so
there you have it that's exactly what
this tablet is decent no real
advancements involved and while on the
outside it's pretty simple Asus
certainly did all they could to enhance
the user experience but might have done
more to just slow it down than anything
at an extra $80 you can get them much
better performing and overall much
better put together current Nexus 7 at
the sacrifice of expandable memory and
if all you need is an entry-level
experience then perhaps the memo pad can
give you what you need but putting down
that extra
money for the nexus7 could mean a tablet
that will be able to keep up with the
growing demands of Android users
something the memo pad just might not be
able to boast even just a year from now
more importantly you have to weigh the
options of saving money or quite simply
having a much better experience and time
