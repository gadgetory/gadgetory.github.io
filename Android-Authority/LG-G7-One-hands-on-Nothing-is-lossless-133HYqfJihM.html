got all the bells and whistles that you
probably want in a modern-day smartphone
but its biggest problem when it launched
was that the price was just a little bit
too high now the prices come down in the
last couple of months and that's led
people to kind of take a second look but
at this point
LG wants to lower the price even further
by introducing a separate phone called
the LG G seven one the LG G seven one's
body is extremely similar to the LG G
seven you probably wouldn't even be able
to tell that they were different except
for the fact that the one's body is
actually brushed glass instead of that
other glass the g7 used
so there's actually way less finger
prints to be seen on the back of the
phone even the back of the phone looks
pretty much exactly the same the camera
sensor it looks just like it does on the
g7 but where you usually find that
wide-angle sensor that LG is pretty
famous for there are other sensors like
a proximity sensor that just helped the
irregular camera take images as I change
with the wide-angle camera this is
pretty much the same body it still got
the headphone jack with the quad act so
that's really awesome and the Google
assistant button is still really useful
I'm really glad they kept it there it's
even still ip68 water-resistant which is
really great because they didn't
actually take that out even though it's
a more budget phone but they did remove
the wireless charging so you're not
gonna get that feature but I don't
really think it's caught on yet anyway
so I also got the same 3000 milliamp
hour battery that you're gonna find it
in the g7 but it uses quick charge three
instead of quick charge four so it's
probably gonna take a little bit longer
to charge up there's also only four gigs
of ram versus the six gigs of ram and
the original g7 but phones on the
Android one platform are usually a lot
more lightweight anyway so there's not
gonna be a really heavy duty launcher
that's pulling this thing down probably
the biggest spec disappointment in this
phone for me is the 32 gigs of storage
that comes standard with it and I know
that 32 gigs is probably enough for a
lot of people but I feel like in 2018 we
should have at least moved up to 64 gigs
of storage and I like having at least
that because I store a lot of media
locally on my phone now like I said
earlier this is name
one device and again Android ones not
actually a forked OS of Android it's
just a program where Google develops
phones in collaboration with other
companies and that way they can kind of
put their vision for Android on
third-party hardware and finally the LGG
7-1 is running a snapdragon 835
processor so it's last year's flagship
it's not the newest 845 that's out now
but I don't think that that really
matters to them they 35 is still a
really good chip and if they're able to
make this phone super budget because of
it then I'm all for it now the problem
here is that LG hasn't actually
announced a price or availability for
this phone and I think that it kind of
needs to be under $400 for people to
actually consider it the book of home by
Xiaomi is out now and that's got a ton
of press because it's got a snapdragon
845 a ton of RAM and 64 gigs of storage
and that's $300 so I feel like LG is
really going to have to step up their
game in the pricing department if they
really want anyone to buy this thing
anyways I only got to spend about an
hour with the g7 one but if you have any
questions make sure you leave them in
the comment section below and make sure
you stay tuned to our website you can
