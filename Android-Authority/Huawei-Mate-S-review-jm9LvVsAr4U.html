Android authority now recently for
awhile we announced the qual way mate s
now it's built on the great foundation
that was through mate 7 however it is
quite a different phone and today we're
going to take an in-depth look at it the
mate s features a similar full metal
body design as Pascual way high-end
devices but this one comes with an
updated build including a curved rear
and 2.5 d Corning Gorilla Glass 4 while
I says that the curvature has allowed it
to thin out the edges and yet keep the
overall profile just seven point two
millimeters the result is a handset
which is good to look at and
surprisingly easy to hold
looking around the device the volume
rocker and the power button are found on
the right hand side all the buttons are
very responsive and easy to press and
offer a good amount of tactile feedback
although the phone comes the DoubleTap a
knuckle gesture to switch it on this
becomes redundant once you have
configured the fingerprint reader but
we'll talk more about that in a moment
up on the top is the headphone jack and
the microphone at the bottom is the
Micro USB port flanked by two grills
giving the appearance of a dual speaker
setup even though there in fact there's
only one speaker the one on the
right-hand side above the display is a
speaker grill along with an 8 megapixel
front-facing camera which also has its
own flash on the back is a 13 megapixel
camera sensor coupled with a dual tone
LED flash and the fingerprint reader the
mate s features a 5.5 inch AMOLED Full
HD display with a screen colour
saturation of 105 percent of the RGB
gamut and the contrast ratio of 1.8
million to 1 the result is the viewing
angles are good and display is bright
enough for comfortable outdoor
visibility while it has also built in a
way to change the color temperature of
the display first I think the default is
spot-on however if you'd like to make
the colors cold or a warmer than the
option is available under settings
display while quad HD is the buzzword at
the moment the full HD resolution with
this size of display is more than enough
and no one will have any complaints with
regards to the viewing experience the
display adds to the over
all great experience of using the mate s
and the AMOLED technology brings with
the deep blacks and vivid colors that
make using this handset a flagship
experience under the hood the huawei
mate s packs the optical high silicon
Kiran 935 processor it has four cortex
a53 cores clocked at 2.2 gigahertz
another for propped-up
but five gigahertz this is backed by a
Mali t-62a GPU and three gigabytes of
RAM performance is as smooth as you
would expect from this Huawei made
processing package and very rarely will
there be any signs of stutter or lag
moving through the various element of
the UI is smooth and opening closing and
switching between applications is fast
and snappy the device also handles
gaming pretty well say for the most
graphically intensive games where you
might notice drop frames could use my
test the mate s can run Epic Citadel at
thirty five point six frames per second
in ultra high quality mode and at 56.7
frames per second in high quality mode
as fan to to the may test scores fifty
1397 the mate s comes with 32 gigabytes
or 64 gigabytes of internal storage and
this be expanded by a further 128
gigabytes via the microSD card slot
there is also 128 gigabyte variant of
the phone which includes the
pressure-sensitive screen ie force touch
however this model
only be available in certain markets
although the entry model is quoted as
having 32 gigabytes of internal storage
only about 24 gigabyte is usable this
basically means that eight gigabytes of
the flash memory is used for the system
this figure is a little excessive and it
goes a long way to explain why the 32
gigabyte variant is the entry-level
point not a 16 gigabyte variant device
come to the standard suite of
connectivity options as well as NFC and
4G LTE looking at the band's supported
by the two different models that are
available it is clear the quarrei
intends this to be an internationally
available handset as mentioned there is
a fingerprint reader on the back place
within easy reach of your index finger
as with the mate 7 before it the
fingerprint reader on the mate s is of
exceptional high quality I've never read
any of the smartphone fingerprint
readers and personally I think Samsung
have done a bad job with a fingerprint
on the s6 on the note 5 however the
fingerprint reader on qual way make as
is a joy to use yes it's definitely one
of the fastest I've used and yes it's
also one of the most accurate but the
critical point is how it is used quite
always implementation is second-to-none
using it is easy you just need to
register a fingerprint under settings
fingerprint ID and then set which
options and gestures you want activated
eg take photo stop alarm and so on I
reach to the index finger from both my
left and right hand which means I can
pick up the phone with either hand and
just press my finger on the reader to
unlock and open the phone instantly also
the center on the back is not just a
fingerprint reader it also acts as a
swipe gesture area you can swipe down to
pull down the notification panel touch
to take a photograph you can even touch
it to answer a call you can also use it
an app like the gallery to swipe through
your photos moving on to the audio the
quality of the speaker itself is
certainly quite good for a single
speaker and it can be very loud in fact
almost too loud I there found that for
listening to music I had to reduce the
volume to almost half but for those who
like it loud the good news that even at
these highest volume levels the sound
does not distort
Cheil word with digging deep to know our
father's heart reaching out to show them
who you are as for the battery the mate
s packs are non removable two thousand
seven hundred million power unit which
allows for an excellent battery life
with around five or six hours on screen
time during a typical day which would
include watching videos internet
browsing and taking calls and using the
camera I did some individual app testing
using game Finch and you'll be able to
stream YouTube video over Wi-Fi for
around five point five hours and play 3d
intensive games around four hours
the bottom line is you will get a full
day's use out of this battery without
worrying about how you've been using
your phone preserving the confusion
about if the huawei mate s includes
quick charge functionality all I can say
is that from my testing it does not the
supply charger that comes with it is
rated at just 5 volts at 2 amps what
this means is is that you can charge the
phone from almost zero
to fully charge in about two hours and
15 minutes while mate s comes with a 13
megapixel rear camera and includes a
four color RGB W imaging sensor +
optical image stabilization also the
camera housing is scratch proof thanks
to a sapphire protection the camera app
includes some nice features to enhance
the shots that you take including a
super night mode panorama HDR and
time-lapse there is also a light
painting mode for long exposure shots
the built-in filters include car like
trails light graffiti silky water and
star Trak the image quality is excellent
and the camera is capable of taking some
really good shots with a good amount of
detail and good coloring as with most
smartphones the best results come from
well-lit environments however indoor and
low-light shots from the main s are
actually quite good
there is one weakness it seems with the
huge processor rekt too strongly to
bright red but has it capable videoing
full HD in sixteen by nine from both the
front and rear cameras however as you
expect optical image stabilization is
only available via the via camera the
eight megapixel front-facing camera is
coupled with a flash which is more like
a dim flashlight but its
to get that extra bit of light into a
shot the quality of shots possible from
the front camera is quite impressive
with nice colors and lots of details but
as expected some gradients is seen in
poor light environments there's also a
host of beauty mode features so the
selfie lovers among you will not be
disappointed by what can be achieved
with a little bit of digital magic the
Maties is running android 5.1.1 lollipop
with the latest version of Wali's
emotion UI on the top this is a
deliberate choice by far away and get
rid of the app drawer leaving you
dependent on folders to keep things
organized some people insist on a stock
Android experience however personally I
found the emotion UI is a joy to use the
notification shade is divided into two
sections shortcuts and notifications
although it would have been nice to have
these two sections combined notification
section is quite nice little timeline on
the left keeping your notifications very
bit organized there is also a theme
engine available to change the look and
feel of the UI should you desire the
size of software to manage the
fingerprint reader there are a few other
built-in bits of functionality one is a
simple always on speech awareness system
that allows you to place calls by saying
ok ma call Joan and others is it emotion
controls like flip to mute and of course
a knuckle gesture system there's also a
one-handed layout mode which temporary
reduces the size of the UI so that it
can be using one hand find the emotion
UI has some support for jeweled
windowing mainly for use with the stock
apps like gallery notepad videos and so
on overall while ways take on Android is
certainly different from the stock
experience however it can be said it's
very sleek and very well designed and
there you have it the huawei mate s it's
got this excellent 5.5 inch I'm going to
display a good processing package and an
excellent camera but when you add that
fingerprint reader is very easy for us
to give it our editors choice award
