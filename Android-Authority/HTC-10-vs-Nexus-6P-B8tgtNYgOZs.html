offering goes up against the Nexus its
charge of agar from Android thority
what's going on everybody and this is
the HTC 10 versus the Nexus 6p now
before we get going I do want to let you
know that our HTC 10 and Nexus 6p
reviews are available at Android
authority comm and here at the YouTube
channel you'll find links for them here
on the video and also in the description
below so if you want more of my new
details and even the spec sheets for
both of these devices make sure you go
and check those out and yes my Nexus 6p
my personal one has been skinned to have
a wooden look on the back but we'll be
looking at the Nexus 6p as it is out of
the box
metal is of course the name of the game
for both of these phones as they take
metal to different places in their
design the Nexus 6p has metal with a top
bump area which has been a little bit
polarizing in terms of whether or not
it's actually fashionable for the phone
but ultimately here at Android authority
we do think it's a nice touch that is
different from other phones of its type
it is a little bit bigger as well being
a little bit wider and taller and also a
little bit heavier than the HTC 10 but
ultimately it is still a pretty easy
phone to use in one hand the other thing
to notice about the Nexus is that it is
symmetrical you have a speaker at the
top and speaker on the bottom for dual
front-facing speakers that is not the
case anymore with the HTC 10 which has
one speaker on the top and then a Wolfer
at the very bottom right next to the
USBC port which brings us to the HTC 10
which brings a couple of subtle changes
to a design language that we've already
liked from previous HTC one devices now
if you take it you look at it and it
might seem like an HTC One m8 but there
has been added to it a bit of girth all
the way around on the edges these
tranfered edges provide a silhouetted
look which we think is nice subtle and
it does provide just that little bit
more to differentiate this phone from
its predecessors even if the phone might
feel just that little bit wider than
probably should be the HTC 10 still
provides a better handling experience
because of its overall smaller size
but when it comes to having metal and in
this case we have grey metal for both of
these phones it does still slip about
quite easily in the hand even if it
doesn't necessarily get too smudged up
by one's fingerprints the HTC 10 now has
a Super LCD 5 a quad HD resolution that
adheres to the NTSC standard and it
actually does so with impressive
saturation and overall performance
HTC does claim that the screen has low
latency when it comes to your touch and
what actually happens on the screen and
while the
may not be something you really notice
on the daily it is still something nice
to add to the overall performance of the
phone but the Nexus 6p is nowhere behind
at all it has a quad HD display that is
an AMOLED display and of course with
AMOLED you're going to get the deeper
blacks and also much higher saturation
but in this case we actually don't think
that there's that much of a discrepancy
between the two it is definitely more
enjoyable on a larger screen if you want
to have more real estate but as far as
overall color and performance we think
that both of these devices do a really
good job at providing good media games
video and even text performance is it
another place where we might not find
that many differences between these two
phones and that's because the Nexus 6p
just came out earlier in the year last
year and the HTC 10 obviously won't
benefit from being the later device it's
a Snapdragon 820 versus the 810 not too
much really different in when it comes
to real-world usage because four
gigabytes of RAM in the HTC 10 is pretty
much the only differentiator that's not
to say that the Nexus 6p will get
overwhelmed with the number of
applications that are running in the
background but for those of you who are
spec hungry the four gigabytes might be
what you need the processors themselves
however provide a really good experience
especially when you consider how
streamlined to these two versions of
Android are especially in the Nexus
because after all that is stock Android
which brings us to the hardware
offerings and both have fingerprint
readers now the positions of the two are
different on the Nexus 6p the finger per
meter is on the back and it's pretty
easy to just land a index finger on
there in order to easily unlock and wake
the phone at the same time but the same
can be said for the HTC 10 even though
it's fingerprint reader is up on the
front embedded into the capacitive home
key and as far as storage goes the Nexus
actually falls behind against all of the
different flagships this year because
plenty of the flagships in 2016
including the HTC 10 now include a
microSD card so you can bolster the
on-board storage connectivity across the
board is about the same between these
two phones they provide pretty much
everything you would expect though and
focus on audio and streaming that audio
brought airplay support to the HTC 10
but speaking of audio those dual
front-facing speakers on the Nexus 6p
give it the original feature that is no
longer around to the HTC 10 dual
front-facing speakers now you get one
speaker above the display and then one
on the bottom a woofer rather next to a
USB C port and that means that the lows
in the mid will be a little bit better
on the HTC 10 but it certainly does not
get as loud as the
dual front facing speaker setup of the
Nexus 6p but it's really when you plug
in headphones into the HTC ten that the
meaning of boom sound truly comes out
boom sound is dolby enhancements coupled
with audio profiles that can be created
by entering some questions or by
actually going through different
frequencies inside of a more advanced
tutorial but once you get your headphone
set up and plugged into the HTC 10 audio
sounds amazing on here a 24 bit DAC
provides even clearer audio and a wider
soundstage for good headphones and an
amp will provide the loudness that
plenty of other smart phones can't
really provide and that includes the
Nexus 6p a larger battery in the larger
Nexus 6p does give it a little bit more
longevity overall with a 34 50 milliamp
power units you can get about 2 days
worth of battery life especially if you
stretch it out with the doze feature in
which you will be able to get a lower
power state by just keeping the phone on
a surface and prone and not used at all
the same can be said for the HTC 10 but
it's 3000 milliamp hour battery provides
about a day and a half worth of
longevity and in our case we haven't
really had any problems getting through
one full day's worth of work and play
with any issues at all fewer pixels but
bigger pixels for the Nexus 6p it was a
move towards an improvement in low-light
but for the HTC 10 is just another day
for the ultra pixel but other companies
have done it with less branding and less
fanfare and in the Nexus 6p you get 12
megapixels at 1.5 5 micron sizes at F
2.0 with optical image stabilization and
laser focus when compared to the HTC 10
which has 12 megapixels at 1.5 5 micron
sizes with an F 1.8 aperture optical
image stabilization and laser autofocus
both of the applications opt for more
simplicity as the HTC 10 app has been
streamlined to make it a little bit
easier to use but it's not as easy to
use as the Nexus 6p which doesn't
include that many modes and lacks a pro
mode which you can use on the HTC 10 as
a manual mode to change a lot of the
settings but optical image stabilization
is available on the front-facing camera
of the HTC 10 which is a first for
pretty much any camera on a smartphone
now generally this does mean that lower
light situations for selfies might be a
little bit better on the HTC 10 but it
also might help with some video overall
we don't think that it's really that
much of an improvement but it is a very
subtle and very small change and we do
applaud HTC 10 for having OAS in the
front-facing camera first
the HTC 10 did get a few updates to its
camera recent
and we're going to explore that in a
future video again however up until then
you can have these verses videos and
comparisons to see if the HTC 10 now is
going to be really on par with the
competition but since both of these
cameras are actually quite similar the
pictures were actually a bit of a
toss-up in terms of quality the Nexus 6p
does opt for a little bit brighter
exposure now that the HTC 10 has dialed
it back in its updates but it's really
just in low-light situations that we
found some true differences mostly in
the color temperature the HTC 10 still
opts for a warmer color temperature in
low situations and that makes it a
little bit distinguishable from the
Nexus 6p but really in low-light
situations both of these cameras do
their best but still provide some pretty
grainy some pretty noisy photos but the
car that the HTC 10 does have to play is
for sound and high res audio recording
is available no matter which of the
cameras you're using on the phone but
that doesn't mean that processing the
videos from it requires some tinkering
as we did find after our camera shoot
out that the mkv files that the HTC 10
puts out have to be unwrapped and
tinkered with before they're actually
recognized by most video editing
software's and finally we can talk about
the software and it's about stock versus
HTC Sense but really the two aren't very
radically different especially when you
compare them to the Samsung synergies of
the world currently using the N beta on
the Nexus 6p will make this a little bit
difference but basically that is one of
the main stories for the Nexus line is
the fact that you'll get all of the
updates and be able to try out some of
the new versions of Android before
pretty much anybody else and any Android
purists will know exactly what to expect
from stock Android it has everything
that you would expect it to
including the DOS feature and a couple
of extra features like Google now on tap
in order to provide some easy searching
no matter where you are in the phone but
ultimately stock Android is what a lot
of Android users enjoy because it keeps
things simple and it prioritizes
function which brings us to HTC Sense or
rather Android with HTC Sense which is
actually a skinned version of Android
that doesn't add too much to the formula
and that might be the best part about it
since it's still more utilitarian when
compared to TouchWiz or the LG UX and it
doesn't prioritize eye candy as much and
besides the blinkfeed
it keeps everything pretty familiar
there aren't too many extras like multi
window or even any small overlay
applications that go on top of the
workspace and because of a close
relationship with Google HTC has
eliminated
redundancies in the apps so if you have
Google photos you're not going to have
HTC gallery if you have HTC messages
you're not going to have Google
messenger HTC Sense also makes
everything a little bit darker maybe a
little bit easier on the eyes even
because it's not trying to go too
cartoony with things but it does still
have a themes engine in order to change
the look of everything so if you do want
that change HTC Sense does provide it
but overall it's about utility and
function is definitely king no matter
which of these two versions of Android
you use there are a couple of extras and
cents but they don't really change too
much of the general Android formula so
one way to put it is that while we do
love our stock Android if we had HTC
Sense we don't really feel the need to
actually replace it right away out of
the box with a third-party launcher the
HTC 10 is available for the premium
price on carriers but it will also cost
about $700 if you want an unlocked
version compare that to the Nexus 6p
which currently is going for 399 dollars
in the Google Play Store now that does
make the Nexus 6p especially when it's
considered unlocked a pretty good
prospect because you're able to get a
full device for a lower price that
provides a lot of the same features and
so there you have it for the HTC 10
versus the Nexus 6p these two phones
actually have quite a bit in common and
if you're looking for a metal clad
smartphone you probably can't get any
better than these two right here the
Nexus 6p is still a bit of a better
steal because of its lower price but the
HTC 10 has prioritized a couple of main
features in order to really entice the
user and the main one is definitely the
audio experience it's camera is a little
bit improved by now and we will explore
that like I said again in a future video
but for now you can see how the HTC 10
stacks up to other devices when we bring
you more verses and you can stay tuned
to Android thority for all of that keep
it tuned to Android 34 even more and
remember to check out all of our
coverage of both of these devices and
you there is going to be more to come on
the HTC 10 because we are your source
