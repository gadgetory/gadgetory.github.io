Android authority and we're taking a
first look at the Samsung Galaxy s4 and
we're going to be doing an unboxing for
you today now just to be clear this is
the snapdragon 600 powered variant
it actually features a beautiful box
that we thought was actually made with
wood when we first opened it up as you
can see it really matches the table the
box itself is made of 100% recyclable
material with organic ink and we really
really have to commend Samsung for their
choice saving the planet is always
something we all aspire to do as you can
see this one is fully sealed here and so
this is going to be the first time we're
gonna be doing an unboxing for you so
let's to cut it open and see what's
inside
I'm gonna truth oh what that hurts
doesn't matter okay let's see what's
inside and as we can see we have a nice
man on here from Samsung just contains
some stuff that really we don't care
about oh and here is the device itself
very difficult to get out of the box now
as we told you before really this is one
of the thinnest bezels that comes on the
market and the device is extremely
lightweight without the battery inside a
beautiful thin profile with the improved
aesthetic of it mimicking a metal on the
side and what else is in the box for you
okay so more instruction manuals and
warranties and things of that nature we
have a handbook and a Kooser lectin
obviously a micro USB cable typical
Samsung white plastic and here we have
the headphone so now we're gonna fake
closer attention these because
headphones are actually a really
important part of the device so we'll be
taking a closer look at these in just a
moment and here's the nice beefy 2600
milliamp battery which is a nice
improvement on the galaxy s3 and
competing devices on the market and it
looks like we have been given a Power
Core that is specified for a European
market which is fine some more earbuds
and nothing really else so let's take a
look at the headphones here
I know headphones are something that I
burn through a lot of time let's try and
get these open here all right
we're going to be a little more
challenging than I anticipated
my gosh there we go
so actually interesting so what we're
having here just to pay attention we
have a microphone here as you can see on
the side and it's really nice we have a
double click or a single click so if
you're going to be exercising or running
you're gonna be able to change your
music and we also have an up and down
volume rocker now the air bus themselves
are very very similar actually it looks
like the drivers have been increased in
size at least the size of them and we're
going to be using a typical plastic
earbud but it has a variety of different
sizes so for those of you that have
different ears that's going to be nice
and it looks like we're looking at a
sort of a beach style a ribbon flatten
type cord which as we know it tends to
be a lot more durable just than the thin
rounded style so hopefully these are
gonna be a lot more durable than what we
experienced with the Galaxy s3 but
either way good stuff here yeah it looks
like they put some thought into it so I
have to commend Samsung for that now
with regards to the device itself as you
can see now I used to own the Galaxy
Note 2 and I'm thinking about switching
up because there's so many great devices
coming out on the market but my main pet
peeve essentially was that I was unable
to access most of the device with one
hand and as you can see this really is
virtually perfect so much screen such a
thin bezel I really really have to hand
it to Samsung so here we are taking a
closer look let's just open it up at the
back here
taking plastic off there either way guys
that's what the battery's gonna go
obviously we have the memory card and
this micro SIM slot we have a speaker
here in the rear so that's what we're
looking at for the RCS for this is our
first unboxing from Android Authority my
name is Darcy la cuvee we're here with
Android authority if you like what we do
we have tons of great videos coming up
all the time so don't forget to
subscribe to our YouTube channel and let
us know how we're doing in the comments
thanks a lot guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
