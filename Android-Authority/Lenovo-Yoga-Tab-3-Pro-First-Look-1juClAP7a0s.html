two yoga tablets and puts them together
to make this the yoga Tab 3 Pro a 10
inch tablet is one thing and we do love
that the 10 inch quad HD display on here
are still really thin on one end of the
tablet and then we have the other side
that a lot of people may not know too
much about if you haven't been following
the yoga line the yoga line of lenovo's
tablets has this one end over here that
has a kickstand built in and it's also
where the battery lies but that
kickstand is what makes the yoga the
yoga tablet bring that thing out and
you'll have a hook area in the middle
that you can use to hang this tablet
wherever you so please and now the whole
tablet is also splash proof you can't
submerge this tablet obviously but you
can maybe get some splash of water on
there and it's still going to be fine
but that kickstand is the main story
here that not only allows it to stand up
on end or on its back but it also has a
projector built into it that does rotate
180 degrees based upon how you have the
tablet standing now talking about this
projector it is the feature that came in
a pro tablet from the previous line of
yogas and now it is in a much better
place instead of on the side where the
kickstand came out it is now part of the
kickstand so you can actually sit the
tablet down in a nice way and have the
projector projecting the screen onto the
wall in front of it it can project a 70
inch screen at 480p resolution at 15
it's so it's maybe not the best
projector that's out there but then
again having it put into the actual
tablet itself is a pretty nice
application and you can do a lot of
stuff including binge watching things
like Netflix on the yoga tab 3 Pro other
specifications include that quad HD
display that's 2560 by 1600 and an IPS
construction and underneath the surface
there's the Intel Atom processor a quad
core processor that should be able to
let this tablet work pretty well for all
of the main applications that they
believe is basically media and some web
browsing and maybe some text but with
the quad HD display pretty much anything
should look pretty good on here 2
gigabytes of RAM which you get
underneath that with 16 gigabytes that
are built in 32 gigabytes is an option
as well but of course there is a microSD
card slot for all of your extra media
now speaking of that tablet battery that
we have on the end there where the
kickstand is it is ten thousand two
hundred milliamp hours in capacity which
should make this go for quite a long
time now going around the actual
elements obviously we've talked about
the kickstand quite a bit but the tablet
itself still looks quite nice handling
it might be a little bit of a chore when
you're trying to get a good grip around
that kickstand area but it's nice to see
that the actual whole tablet itself
above it is pretty thin and on the back
they have added this leather on the
backing that makes it look quite nice
and gives it a little bit of a grip a
camera is available on the rear at 13
megapixels which is kind of nice but
also we have a five megapixel camera on
the front now speaking of the front
there are also JBL speakers and we got a
bit of a demo of just how loud this
tablet can get even in a noisy room we
were able to hear it very loud and clear
and with 360 degrees sound you can
actually hear the nuances in the left
and right channels and it was really
nice to have that on the tablet if you
don't have any other audio sources you
can just let your Bluetooth speakers set
aside and this tablet might be just
enough for you to really enjoy your
media so that was just a look at the
yoga Tab 3 pro by lenovo and what we do
like is the projector being in a much
better spot than it was before and we
always did like the kickstand design
that does prove handy in those
situations where you just don't want to
take out a stand or lean your tablet up
on a wall of some sort it's still a
pretty versatile tablet and there are
different versions of course this is the
pearl one with the projector but there
is a yoga tab 3/8 inches and another 10
inch that both don't have the projectors
but the pro is the top of the line and
that's the one we wanted to show you
here so keep it tuned to Andrew 34 even
more as we are here at Aoife in Berlin
we have more lenovo coverage coming for
you so make sure you stay tuned here
because we are your source for all
things Eva</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
