invites to the oneplus 2 but first it's
got to be asked do you think this is the
new LG Nexus the renders here are based
on factory schematic information
provided to a third party accessory
maker so the dimensions are quite likely
to be accurate although the final look
may vary a bit especially when it comes
to build materials on the back we see
the fingerprint scanner that has been
rumoured numerous times in the past LG's
signature rear vine controls seem to
have given way in order to include a
scanner which sits just underneath the
protruding camera module the camera
comes with an LED flash and also what
appears to be a laser autofocus module
we can also spot the reversible USB
type-c socket at the bottom of the
smartphone and this past week Motorola
has been a real tease Motorola posted
then quickly deleted a video on a
Twitter account of what appears to be
the new Moto 360 giving us a pretty
clear look at the devices new form
factor the video also appeared on the
company's Instagram account but that
video was also deleted soon after it was
posted the screenshot here shows off the
supposed next-gen device which features
a power button that sits at the two
o'clock position as opposed to the three
o'clock placement of the first gen watch
the device also looks to have newer
loves that perhaps will make it easier
to swap out watch straps also featured
in the new render is the flat tire from
the last year's model which is a design
element many consumers weren't happy
with the first time around apparently
Samsung believes that flip phones may be
making a comeback last month Tina which
is the Chinese version of the FCC
revealed information on a new samsung
flip phone that was powered by Android
and offered fairly high specs and now
it's official dubbed the samsung s mg 90
198 the new flip phone is powered by a
Snapdragon 808 a curious move
considering Samsung has been less
reliant on Qualcomm and more dependent
on its own in host X nose chips as of
late other specs include two gigabytes
of ram 16 megapixel rear cam a 6
megapixel front cam 16 gigabytes of
storage with microSD support dual three
point nine inch Super AMOLED displays
with a resolution of 1280 by 768
eight there are also a 2020 milliamp
hour battery which is said to last 189
hours of standby time dubbed the samsung
s mg 90 198 the new flip phone is
powered by a Snapdragon 808 other specs
include two gigabytes of ram 16
megapixel rear cam a 6 megapixel front
cam 16 gigabytes of storage with microSD

hundred and eighty nine hours of standby
time now Google has also been getting
into the teasing game and teasing us for
what M will be in Android M they showed
us this a new teaser video from google
employees NAT and low indicates that
we're getting closer to finding out what
the M stands for the video goes through
the Android release names we've seen up
until now and ends with a little teaser
portion talking about various M name
desserts as expected both marshmallow
milkshake and Moon Pie are highlighted
as just a few possibilities personally I
prefer milkshake but Google's playful
they're probably going to go with
marshmallow we'll see and no I haven't
forgot about the oneplus two invites
it's all linked up in the show links
below click on that article and follow
the instructions best of luck to you you
don't want to forget about my brothers
and sister and Android who are working
super hard to be your source for all
things Android
