uh hey for a hundred-dollar phone you
might as well go sign off real simply
just got to click a few buttons and send
out a few likes and posts and tweets and
circles and social media all the things

not
50 entries counted before the contone
yeah so if so we try to open up to new

done it you can only base you're
basically the maximum entry ticket to
the public yet is uh three if you've
already subscribed to our YouTube

twitter so we still have a chance but um
i guess we kind of waited it so the new
fans get a little bit of an edge I guess
so but either way you still get yourself
in there and so the chance to win okay
all right well you know one chance is it
for an eight-hundred-dollar device now
you mean you might as well do it no
matter how many oh yeah so those of you
that aren't aware I guess what all the
features are the power and everything
behind the sgs3 as I said Clayton is our
resident YouTube reviewer for android
authority and he has been playing around
with the sgs3 for about the last week or
so he he knows it inside out in a few
days ago we asked our audience and say
them I had any questions about the
galaxy 3 s 3 and wanted to see if
there's any more questions about it so
right now if you know you're watching
this you have any questions about the s3
feel free to leave us a comment for
Clayton here and we'll go ahead and
address it but while we're waiting for
your comments to show up let's uh let's
answer a few questions and it looks like
we got a few right here let's get into
long's question it says TouchWiz how bad
is it um you know it's it's not that bad
i'd say that the Ice Cream Sandwich
touch woods is a lot better than it was
for gingerbread os's and stuff like that
um I hated TouchWiz on the Galaxy Tab
10.1 too and they kind of had a like a
lot of the same elements have gone into
the injury the Ice Cream Sandwich bill
that the touch was for the sgs3 the
folder making I don't like that but you
know it's kind of nice if you like
TouchWiz you'll love this
what uh what difference is with the
between the gingerbread touchwiz and the
ICS TouchWiz are there you know what
stuff I mean the core functionality of
ICS of course is there other than that
like the skin it it's hard to compare
just the overlay I'd say you know
there's some of you features of course
to do apps included like s voice and
stuff that come pre-loaded with TouchWiz
and whatnot but uh I don't know it's not
it's kind of hard to compare just the
skins instead of it they're very active
molasses compare how computing sense for
uh from what I'm seeing it looks like a
bit you know very very very heavy yeah
yeah sense for I like sense for and I
like the Optimus UI on LG's probably
both of those I like a little better
than TouchWiz for the sgs3 i mentioned
new apps um I specific at this voice is
that anything special to in your
experiences than anything special or is
that just kind of a high on a future I
think it's something it's sort of
gimmicky I don't love it and I wouldn't
find myself use do it a lot but it is
you know it's a cool little gimmick it's
nice it if you want something to compete
with Siri you know something like that
but does it actually work I mean some
reviews that I've read it said you know
how I try to just didn't connect
anything yeah that's the thing it it
searches all right when you get it to
work but a lot of times you'll just be
talking at nothing to it won't do
anything really and you kind of have to
and I don't understand if you have to
press the button and hold it to speak
sometimes that works for me and
sometimes I can just talk right to it
and I don't get the hi galaxy thing like
that again I've spent enough time with
it it's still just kind of difficult to
navigate I won't find myself using it
for that reason it I think it's neat um
but I don't think you know me maybe it
has a honeymoon phase to it you know
yeah a lot in the beginning because it's
something new but it might uh it might
die down over time it did again yeah
there's so many things about it you know
uh you might find yourself using
a lot you know maybe you know of the
weather or something like that you know
is that for Siri yeah yeah he liked it
because it was something that I often
parties for the simple things like it I
think you could use it if the boy if the
voice recognition is good but you know I
I don't think that that's it technology
is there yet um I think that more is
coming and I think that you know maybe
in a couple days we might figure out
something better that's coming but uh I
just don't think it's there yet so the
way I question your clean what's the
battery life like on that all the
battery life is pretty good it's better
than the Galaxy Nexus which I also run
um I can get a full 24 hours out of it
again I don't have a sim card and so I'm
not actually connected to mobile data 24
7 i'm always connected to Wi-Fi and I've
got everything pushing I've got all my
accounts thinking and notifications and
whatnot and it plastic at 24 hours just
on why I that's a yeah kind of you know
I said I have been switching batteries
very frequently I got a few expenditure
incredible on Wi-Fi only with everything
syncing with last like three lemons I'm
going into my battery stats right now
will get a good idea what I can't even
believe it's that short for not having a
mobile connection yeah but you know what
then he was using it for reviews so I'm
sure you James crap out of it there we
go it's right now I've got a 27-percent
and discharging and it's been eight
hours 10 minutes 54 seconds on battery
so that's pretty forward yeah what's
your what's your screen on time right
now green on x 36 percent and the cell
standbys for win7 hit the screen on
button and i'll give you an actual time
there we go they x 40 41 minutes
everyone minutes out of eight hours and
you've gone through 75% that is not
impressive yeah this is the UH Wendy
this is the expandable I mean the
aftermarket battery in here after check
one oh no this isn't this is actually
the samsung NFC battery and you know it
does take me two days
does you have to get that battery up to
where it should be so with him swapping
batteries and you know doing reviews on
and everything the battery life might
not be off the moment I know whenever I
first got my got to Nexus I got the
extended battery it took good four or
five days a full discharges you know
before I got no my battery to where I
liked it damn s so what about the
physical buttons on there um we got 32
haptic and to have big one physical the
home button is physical and then the
menu in the back or haptic and they're
kind of cool but one problem i ran into
is when you're fooling with the phone
here in a landscape mode the palm of
your hands sometimes hit the capacitive
buttons here and you'll actually be
clicking with like keep the palm of your
hand and stuff so it gets in the way
actually I think unless you've got a
case on there it's got like a border
edge there but now we have a question
here the eye tracking feature you how
you look at your phone smarty stay oh
yeah oh uh how the hell's that work how
does it work for you well I've had it on
the entire time that I've had the phone
and I've yet to see it work um sometimes
the little eyeball comes up in the
notification bar and that's my cue that
it might be working but I've never I've
never been able to kind of look away
from the phone and then the screen will
turn off never happened for me get me
the camera running all the time anyway
your phone running all the time it's
really not too surprising that you're
going to battery that fast sure yeah
yeah I'm push me that's trailer we got
right here of Adrian asks how's the
quality of the camera I really like the
camera quality it's nice I did some
tests pictures you can find in the
review I think our review of the sgs3
versus the LG optimus you can check out
some tests pics there but it's really
nice it's you know it's 8-megapixel on
the rear it's got the burst shot like
the HTC One series phones
and autofocus is sort of a bitch but you
know so everything the menu button um
how is that with you know Google's
pushing too many buttons in the app and
on screen so how is it just seemed kind
of redundant to have the menu button or
um I'm actually a fan of physical or you
know many buttons that are actually
there I like them a lot because I'm
always just deserting to like the you
know the on-screen buttons on my galaxy
nexus i installed aokp so can have the
actual menu button on there I don't like
searching through an app that basis to
find where the little three dot menu is
not so i kinda like Senator in the
reaction mark um yes yeah especially
well we'll Gil has a question here we
wanted to know about the face
recognition compared to the One X or the
one asked the Galaxy Nexus yeah you know
it's basically the same thing you've got
different hardware on the cameras but
the software is the exact same thing you
know it's it's AOSP android software
compared to the Galaxy Nexus I think
we've got a 1.9 megapixel front-facing
camera and then the 1.3 on the Galaxy
Nexus not imagine hardware can make a
difference you know if you're getting
down to it no call about I wonder will
maybe you were referring to was it
called s tag or know where did tagged
you all did you have a chance to get
yeah yeah I was able to do that um it on
all the devices it doesn't just as well
in my eyes you know from what I've
noticed they all recognize a face in the
photo just as well as the next so and
this I'm supposed to recognize the
person as well I know that it would
recognize a face but over time went
recognize the actual person and what
their name is I believe that's a
functionality um you I don't know where
what a string of reference would be yes
if you oppose to do that you have to
have contacts and yaptap yeah people
saved as a contact
and everything for that to actually work
with maybe a test set out for us and let
us know here in the future something I
work yeah well that's a feature I
wouldn't be surprised if google released
in the next update I think it's a very
simplistic thing that they can integrate
with Google Plus because google plus re
as a facial recognition already hacked
in so I I think that that would be a
very good and incremental update to um
you know android I'd make me out
definitely let's see we have any other
questions for Clayton about the samsung
galaxy s3 yeah as yours blown up you
have a few oh yeah it did I had to get
another not that actually moves us on to
the next thing and we'll just go ahead
will incorporate that here up yesterday
I believe for maybe even the day before
we found out that the galaxy s3 was in
fact the hottest android phone available
I'm so hot that it will actually melt so
Clayton the fact you've been playing
with it for pass to be able does it does
it get pretty warm no we're we're
actually can you show us actually where
it's more Matt on the phone yeah what
I'm doing like graphic intensive apps I
just playing some shadow gun and then
when i'm downloading a lot of updates
and stuff like that it gets really hot
right here the bob they're actually if
anyone's seen the picture of where it
did burn I'll peel the backing off here
but almost right down below to sim card
and just to the right of the charging
port is actually where the sgs3 burst
into flames and I think that could be
where the processor that I'm not sure
about the internal store I really seen
this thing busted open but we were
discussing before the show and it's not
really anywhere near the battery or
where any sort of uh terminals would be
or anything like that but I wonder if
we'll have to look at the FCC sexy I
wonder if that's where any radios are
you know yeah making something hot down
there
yeah and that device that got off was in
the UK and that was on a international
version so everybody running bs4 um
you're fine it hasn't happened your life
yet oh it's been released yet I just
because I before can't melt butter yeah
so I mean there's really no need to
panic this is just one device you know
what other other foods of nodes in the
past right Scott yeah there's there been
uh i mean the iphone on your plane
remember those phones going down on your
plane trips that's crazy but I mean this
has happened to many devices before uh
Samsung is aware of the problem and
they're gonna sing it so um yeah not
much good man that'd be ridiculous if we
saw recall yeah like how are we gonna
dress or as Adrian said maybe that's
something you know phones overheating
and catching fire maybe that's something
at Apple patented dinner to be suing
Santa no Lord Samsung up to copy
everything delray I wouldn't put it past
it ah then it's a feature it's magical
you were talking about the s for not
being released yet I only go into delays
so the samsung galaxy s3 yeah so we
don't really know what the s4 is going
to do in terms of heat and also the LTE
radio but when we do that we'll get back
to you on that but the reason we all
know is because yeah basically every
single carrier that had touted over the
past couple weeks are getting it here's
on release dates pre-order dates and
everything and that that's really not
happen people that were ordering a tease
sgs3 some of their orders are coming up
now is backordered and it really wasn't
any official word yet when the delay
will be rectified but this is only
applying to the 16 gig model because
that's the only version at eighteen t is
offering Sprint is soon same type of the
lace no the 16 gig yes three for them is
being delayed in models are going to
start shipping maybe around the 21st or
a day or two later at most as far as the
32 gigabyte model is concerned people
are going to have to wait at least until
next week for those to so they're a
little behind as well and then lastly
t-mobile believes the statement saying
due to the massive pre-order and the
demand for this we're gonna do something
completely different and a lot of people
think it's a little strange there they
plan to ship out there sgs3 s by the
21st which was yesterday to only their
top 29 markets so if you live in a
heavily blanketed t-mobile air area and
they're going to shift their phones
there everybody else if you're outside
those marquetry have to wait another
week until the 27th so once again if you
pre-ordered that phone through t-mobile
there's a lot of people in your area
that use tmobile chances are you're
going to get it but if you live out in
middle nowhere and nobody has t-mobile
out there you have to wait an extra week
so I don't know why they're doing it
that way it's they should do any on the
first come first serve basis in my
opinion but hey that's what they're
doing so yeah let us know whenever you
start receiving those phones from any of
the carriers uh verizon hasn't said
anything yet so i think there's isn't
going to be released in another few
weeks here later in july so I'm 10 video
and what the 10th 11th or something like
that so we don't know if they're going
to experience any additional delays on
top of that now it is this a major fault
of Samsung not keeping up with
production or is this some specialty in
their manufacturing process or is there
just a huge huge demand for these phones
a huge demand cookies in OC overwhelming
the wrong parts of marketing the
marketing soon as you know it's a man
yeah because he looks a little
comparison but let's say you know apples
always short on devices but it's they're
okay with it the users have you know
to know to know that it's fine they
accept it but when Samsung or any
Android manufacturer you know it's a
delay that are their anger so I wonder
you know they need to ramp up production
or did they underestimate it or is it
just pure marketing yeah you know one
got epic you know well I think that
probably the TSMC shortage on the 28
nanometer crepe processors is probably a
contributing factor you know I mean
that's also what pushed back the asus
padfone yeah that is true it's also
slowed down HTC a sudden slowdown
shipments of some of the one devices yes
I mean I'm sure that's going to be
playing a role in it too is they just
can't get the parts that could be in
them that wouldn't necessarily be their
fault no I mean I'm also sure that
having the millions and millions of
devices you know get pre ordered to
didn't help either I can all it can't
all be just marking you know I mean is
it it's making a lot of people mad you
know mm-hmm by the way there's still
even if they're mad they're still going
at what other phone can compete with us
three right now yeah yeah that's very
true they got a window they got they got
some time you know until the next yeah
and then after I owe somebody releases
something else and then they'd be like
oh I gotta wait for me yeah looks like
we got a few questions if we feel like
answer those nail for the ass full of it
on ps3 there ya go ahead alrighty we've
got one that ass Manny's asking if
there's a swipe option under the
language and input for keyboard there's
not there's no swype on this keyboard we
do have a gesture swipe here in these
settings which allows you to swipe
horizontally to switch between letters
and symbols but no swype you'll have to
download slideit keyboard or something
from the market or sign up with swype
beta i would assume it works on the SGS
300 I wouldn't obviously we haven't
tested that but I wouldn't know what no
I wouldn't you know works for pretty
much every device out
I'll post the two gigabytes of RAM some
been I mean about this this has one
gigabyte because it is the international
version will be seeing the two gigs oh
snap dragon models some people say that
it's going to offset the lack of the
other two cores on the Snapdragon but
we'll just have to see I don't know I
mean that's something I was debating a
lot of people ours whether they're going
to go ahead and purchase the lot version
or if they're going to wait and get the
Snapdragon but you know who's to say I
guess we'll see when benchmarks come out
no sedan being being my Hardware friend
what do you say about that having it
offset the lack of two cores isn't it
you know that it doesn't really matter
about the number of cores does it really
doesn't I mean it really doesn't the
benchmarks are already coming out I've
seen them lr yeah the Exynos the quad
core Exynos does beat yes for in
benchmarks by a little but we're talking
like maybe a ten percent Navy ten
percent I'm different benchmarks better
that's I'm not impressed when you're
talking a hundred percent more cores
you're only getting ten percent more
power out of that yeah that makes sense
but they're not impressive in really I
mean obviously I don't know this because
I haven't seen any benchmarks but
remember the way that Android works is
that yeah more memory is obviously
better means you can have more run and
you know you can have a larger skin you
know loaded into memory and so forth but
just because it has two gigs of RAM
doesn't mean that you're going to be
sitting there with one gig of ram free
all the time yeah you're gonna be
sitting there it you know one point
eight gigs of ram the entire time
because the way that Android works it's
going to consume as much memory as
possible for all three you know all your
at more apps you keep opening it's going
to keep loading them into memory that's
what its personnel is that yeah that
some Android works and I remember having
a discussion with one of my friends
about the the s3 and he said he's tired
of running out of memory on his Galaxy
Nexus is like I'm always sitting it like
200 megs of ram free you know so I can't
wait to get the s3 because it's going to
have to get
Aram and I'll have a whole gig to play
with I was like yeah until you open a
few extra apps and I have and then
they're gonna sit there and memory
that's the way Android was design that's
why it's bad it's not just an interim
it's I mean it's sort of fundamental
processing organizing decision I mean
don't need just free ram sitting around
what are you gonna do with it why do you
want free ram you don't you want ran to
be use to do something so I always be
using or are used to I mean you look at
let's say windows right you know you
look for your desktop OS when you close
an application is long stop one down
there in the system tray you know you're
so you're gonna get you're gonna get
most of that memory back so you're going
to look at your computer and you're
going to see maybe fifty percent memory
free or something like that so people
want to see that on that phone you know
what maybe you'll see that when I first
boots up but but after that you know it
once you start opening and closing apps
you know it's just the way that yeah
it's supposed to be using the memory the
more it's using the better it's running
exactly that's how that's why you can
switch between applications real fast so
memories good means you can run more or
you can have a thicker beefier you I
running you know like mytouch woods well
speaking of the galaxy line of phones on
samsung galaxy s2 now the AT&amp;amp;T version
got ICS update and yesterday it was
available it was not over the air update
it was actually available with Samsung's
utility manager hi as I think it is and
it was available for a little while and
I got taken down and then people
supposedly was like oh their servers and
they'll often the amount of requests was
putting on their servers um but
apparently Samsung replied and said that
they were just kind of doing a soak and
the ICS update will be back shortly they
said very soon so oh it could be any day
now you know I hate this with the
passion because the s2 is an extremely
popular phone and a lot of people aren't
going to get that update a lot of
because
a lot of people aren't going to take a
cable and plug their phone into a cable
on their computer and download it and
set it up people aren't going to do that
you know what techies are sack tech
savvy people are but the average person
is not going to do that I know it's a
300mm load I don't and that's probably
why they're not pushing out over the air
because it's so large it has a chance to
fail I'm assuming I don't know you know
if people have to sit there forever to
download it over if they don't over 3g
or 4g or hspa+ whatever they call it
these days you know you have to sit
there and download it over that you know
you have to sit there for maybe an hour
the same spot you know to get to get the
300 great file so there's a chance that
it could be corrupt out of that md5 hash
so maybe that's the reason why we did it
over keys but I'm sorry but if you have
a if you have an update that is any size
and you don't push it over the air and
you're a carrier that says that you
don't have faith in your your network
and that I mean seriously come on like
over the air don't have people go
directly to the computer that just you
know we pass those days of connecting
our phone to our computer and sinking
our contacts phones and does that remind
you something yeah the iphone from like
a year ago exactly so no no one's gonna
get the substation Lester savvy or they
know somebody that is and that's sad it
real okay in every group of friends
there's one tech savvy person there's
one Android friend and I think that
they'll make them aware I've notified
three of my friends at FS too so they
know how to get it down and they're
itching for it so we'll see we'll see
you next month when I will look at the
end the Android distribution chart and
we'll see if it jumped off a massive
amount because of ya till ya that will
be interesting it was seven point one
percent last month so we'll see what
happens here in a month moving all other
phone news last week we talked about
you're holding it wrong from HTC oh
well HTC finally acknowledged that that
there is a problem and they are taking
steps in their production process to
rectify the problem so it doesn't happen
in the future on the One X what does
that mean I don't know they're going to
fix it on the fracture lines of new
devices I won't have it what does that
mean for existing users affected by it
yeah I don't know I'm sure no they
didn't least that to the public they
just let some news sites know about it
so that wasn't a public statement item
which is kind of interesting as well so
yeah we'll see what happens to the
international one exit I'm sure they can
throw some more juice at it you know by
a software update but to really fix the
hardware issue i don't know that's gonna
do anything on Ice Cream Sandwich wha
was rolled out this past week to the
Sony Xperia S as well as starting today
rollout begins for verizon's razr and
razr maxx remember these phone the razr
and razr maxx why is the flagship phone
from verizon besides of Galaxy Nexus
actually started today and it's kind of
it's great I mean that these phones are
getting nice yes they needed ICS has
been available for seven months now I
always say we've gotten in a long time
ago you can see it we've been seeing
weeks for the razor for months and
months and months and months so I
hopefully they got it right and
hopefully motorola did a good job with
it users should start seeing it soon so
if you don't have it yet you know bit
about film settings check for update and
everything and start hammering to get it
to start rolling out today now this is
one of the phones that you know I can
understand why it was the lead because
you've got ice cream sandwich to try to
figure out how do we work that with our
motoblur um you know skin and then we
have a web top that kind of needs to be
refreshed as well so they they did a
complete
refresh on their web top and I think
that update that software but I think
they're looking at the videos from
Motorola there were a lot of updates and
a lot of useful things that were
developed into the ICS version of webtop
just kind of cool to see if you guys use
web top I don't know if anybody uses
webtop was pretty expensive when it came
out but it's an interesting feature that
more choices are good at yes also the
HTC Rezound from verizon almost almost
yes HTC posted a couple days ago on
their website full support information
full install instructions saying that
the update was available here's I do it
and revive verizon remain silent number
I didn't say anything few hours later
somehow the information with rude that
there's an ice cream sandwich update was
available but those of you that are into
rooting and robbing and customizing the
heck out of your phone well you'll have
to worry if you're already running the
latest leak however this thing's been
leaking since februari it sounds pretty
key so if you're staying up to date with
yours allies gas leaks and you're on
last week's update you're running the
exact same radio band and you're running
the exact same Android build number that
supposedly the official version was
going to have so at this point you're as
official as it gets if you have it um if
you don't have it go out there to your
favorite wrong community and find it
downloadable post links for it later ah
said it's official official moving on to
the most on my personal most exciting
part of the show jellybean rumors my
favorite you know lovey loves me some
rumors you know i've been i've been
called Peter Pan but I certain people
would enjoy community when it comes to
the leading rumors and not we know what
not wanting to grow up being excited
about the rumors so I'm gonna love
talking about our next thing so if you
think this week the asus
Nexus 7 that's what's what we called the
MIMO 370 teen whatever it was how did or
spotted via PX I asked image data on
google+ what happened was somebody took
two pictures with the phone and then
uploaded them on jun 7 and jun 13 now is
it what's interesting about this is the
location data from the images and all
people plus shows that it came from
google building 44 you're like okay now
no big deal but then you go back and you
look at the guy that posts them and he's
been posting random images of similar
shots you know nothing really
extraordinary for many many months from
the nexus s 4g so it seems after doing a
little bit of research that this guy is
friends with a couple Googlers maybe he
you know does some type of its awning
line I'll know I know he's friends with
Googlers it looks like and they let him
close the device may be so he shows up
yeah yeah he shows up and he uses it and
he takes pictures of things in the
office such as ceiling tiles and lights
and uploads those images to Google+ um
because he probably didn't mean to
they're probably just automatically
uploaded yeah well you know what you
turn that instant upload yeah yeah it's
instant upload yeah I had instant upload
turned on he would have to actually
share suppose that's true but so what's
interesting about the the images that
were posted like I said something
special ceiling tiles and lights um but
the image resolution was 1280 x 960 and
because it was facing a ceiling it kind
of makes sense that that resolution by
the angle that it's probably a
front-facing camera so then there's an
additional rumor on that that aligns
with the previously rumoured hardware
specs saying that it probably doesn't
have a rear facing camera it only has a
front facing camera so 1280 x 960 front
facing cameras not that's nice so we're
going to be able to have you know
they've had to be accomplishing and outs
from it and we don't need to offer
found and take pictures with a 7-inch
slate you know you don't need to do that
so we're so now when my one us can
capture 20 like what is it 36 exactly
you know what is just trees while
sitting there on the couch with my nexus
7 tablet doing something in my son or my
daughter does something cute I guarantee
you my galaxy nexus is probably within
arm's length of me because it's my phone
that I use so I'm going to reach over
and grab myself I'm going to take a
picture of them and I'll be said I'm not
going to worry one bit to my tablet
doesn't have a rear to him so the fact
it has a nice quality front-facing
camera I'm excited about that um the the
second thing that came out this week
about jelly bean uh actually I reported
about it was yesterday afternoon someone
over to XDA noticed first that if he
went to the play store and bought the
hspa+ Google Play Store version of the
galaxy nexus upon checking out it had a
different thumbnail image and the
different thumbnail image wasn't the one
we've known to come in love over the
past seven months it didn't have the the
same wallpaper didn't have the same
icons it had a pink blue green yellow
ish a home screen wallpaper and had a
white with a low of a city search widget
at the top yeah it's nothing like
anything we've ever seen before even the
icons were actually different you know
it wasn't the same full near the google
folder icon on one side the camera on
the other so it was a completely
different screenshot so you know
whatever they updated no big deal you
know it's kind of makes you think about
it but then if you actually proceed to
check that when you agree to the terms
and pay by credit card you were the item
line description read you know the hspa+
Galaxy Nexus quote the latest smartphone
from google soon the first phone with
android 4.1 jelly now I mean they ran
out of space for the word jelly bean and
what else starts with gel you know and
will you know android 4.1 GL it's not
jello that's trademarked the Hindu XL
that's up and you know art if you call
it je l oh yeah now what's interesting
about this is that it was eventually
removed now this you know right now you
can go to the Play Store and and add the
Galaxy Nexus to your shopping cart and
you can see the new icon on the new
thumbnail but if you actually try to buy
it the text has been completely removed
it's all blight now there's nothing
there so they remove the fact that
saying this was going to be the first
smartphone with 4.1 now that that leads
me to two assumptions here one google is
going to give their own device 4.1 first
and it says it's the first phone it
doesn't say first device you know or
anything like our first to receive
because rumors are that they're going to
push out you know the Nexus 7 tablet so
chances are we're going to get a tablet
here in a week at i/o and in the very
near future 4.1 is going to be pushed
out first to that version of the galaxy
nexus and then you know who knows it
could be in a weeks months whatever
before it hits AOSP and then the gsm
version and then in 2013 Verizon's will
be enough why why I've got the verizon
version the developers are ported over
soon enough exactly you know as soon as
it hits AOSP I i would say give it a
couple days you know at most and you'll
start seeing Papa towers yeah you know
we'll start someone will build an AOSP
build from it right away and throw the
binary there's a handful of proprietary
binary is he a Fatah Sam yeah yeah I
mean we'll get it so I take that what
you will I'm pretty you know fingers
crossed and confidence extremely high
the Play Store doesn't lie I don't need
4.1 it's coming very very very soon yeah
yeah the place where doesn't lie and
Google doesn't roll so
the hell out of people so did they do
that on purpose that's the next question
right I wonder if it was another
marketing scheme which I assume it might
be but it makes sense you know like like
if you remember last actually earlier in
the week the google i/o app was was
updated for 22 well in this one of the
screenshots showed the actual new well
it looks like it looks like ICS because
that's what yellow he looks like but it
had a different search widget at the top
it was the white opaque know Aloha paste
the search bar the same one during the
thumbnail so those match up it also had
the timeless that is 25 out of 10 ya
know that there's 25 hours a day that
was done on purpose what does that mean
tell people are saying October 2015
something so either Windows XP is being
relaunched on that day or something have
to happen on that day maybe yeah i guess
the i just find out a week right
mayor they set it to know boom time moon
time talking about it's not ours new
moon day but so I was talking about
tablets with jelly bean Google i/o and
stuff I want to bring up just kind of
being other player in the game I believe
that it's a true player that is trying
to lay all our cards right now um
Microsoft and they released their
surface windows windows it aight RT
tablets and is there going to be a big
demand for these types of tablets a pc
in your hand and and it's rumored the
the price is rumored to be around six
hundred dollars for the RT version and
about 800 and 900 Oh Probert which runs
a full version of Windows 8 let's be
clear about Windows RT that is not a
full PC experience it arm yeah yeah it's
only metro and unlike windows 8 pro the
pro tablet that you know is still
x86-based so we can run every program
that's
been written windows on any version of
windows in the last 140 years yeah yeah
this new one can run only programs that
have been written yesterday specifically
targeted to it yeah the new one the pro
that would be the windows RT it can all
be ours me run nigga it like so all of
the windows software that you have can't
use them yep and in terms of marketing
this consumers they're putting tablets
that look almost identical next to each
other and saying buy them this one over
here it can do everything that every
computer you've ever owned can do and
doesn't have office on it and this one
here can't do anything that any computer
you've ever owned can do but it comes
with office so it's all better yeah it
is it's really a wake-up call people by
their bodies version and they think that
they're going to be uninstalled or
anything for getting a windows computer
no one it's going to be like it's going
to be like the the kindle fire they
thought it was a real tablet it's more
of a consumption device I think it'll be
kind of one of those times you know I
when I saw it you know my Microsoft has
an insane market share so I think that
alone is going to be good for them bad
for existing you people in the tablet
space but then I saw a report the next
day that said Microsoft is only selling
the tablet online and in their 20 retail
locations so 20 locations the entire
world how many people walk in there how
many people know where a Microsoft story
is I don't have no clue can they don't
even know they well I got them all
American so I assume that there's one
there to sell so building a feel of what
New York City probably has one so we all
want at least me you a small America
maybe two so yeah travel hours to the to
wherever this store is to go play with
that you can't go the best buy take a
you know fries or whatever you're not
going so you go online and buy it so
they're pushing this new technology that
no one else has ever used before that
they've never had distributed anything
like it and yet you can't even pay even
try to have a great buy it that's
hopping
kind of pass anyone does anyone remember
a few years back when Microsoft marketed
the surface technology and did anyone
see the video where it was the top of it
or a table yeah yeah form a they hate
for other bill wise yeah circle I love
me yeah you see this really brilliant
like social computing sort of experiment
and then they scrapped the name and
they're clawing at something stupid like
pixel some such now oh yeah as of like a
day ago I don't know Microsoft was doing
I yeah just bad decisions left and right
yeah and bring back two phones how about
Windows Phone 8 not being available for
any existing Windows Phone device like
what are you kill me but when you look
at your lack ship windows phone nokia
lumia 900 bia real brand new phone and
find out in six months it will be
completely dilapidated well now you're
going to get some paid action but it
just would be 78 no well and even one
those are the most hilarious thing about
the seven eight it's so it's what they
did with vista and windows seven
basically you know they gave it a
slightly different start menu and kept
know the underlying come on say it it's
going to be a new you're gonna get the
same home screen and that's really about
it yeah nokia is trying to talk up the
fact that there's are going to get a lot
of the apps that they're providing to
Windows 8 Phone or Windows Phone 8 but
only the Lumia is gonna get those not
any of the other existing I think the
biggest thing that we're going to get
out of this is competition I think
Google is gonna one-up them and I think
it'll be good for consumers in the end
evil mayor written now yeah I don't
think it's competition there on thurs
like high low key items are we dos coded
America than using symbian cynthians
never even been marketed in this country
and there's almost as many people using
that as Windows Phone ok this is in
competition but you need to figure out
that the market share windows-based pcs
is insanely high
upwards of ninety percent so they could
weigh that market share as off as well
as xbox integration if they have a huge
ecosystem that they're trying to pull
together so I wouldn't underestimate
them but I like the fact that they are
in the market competing there's a
problem that they're going to have is
now they're trying to compete with
ecosystems if at this point you're smart
enough to realize that you're
subscribing to an ecosystem you've
already subscribed to one and changing
at this point is not something that
you're going to just want to up and do
with your random untested windows 8/rt
things the camp honey exactly you know I
I think you microsoft is going to sell
some because I mean xbox with pockets
you know businesses use it you know ah
there's my they're going to sell stop
it's not a flaw but uh I think I think I
might flop well little will see it I
play one on on Episode seven the UH
about a map kouri pissed at each entry
draft give it two years there's yeah
alright so let's move on talk about some
more things we know more about you know
android stuff right let's talk about the
samsung galaxy tab line edward earlier
talking about ICS update in heaven that
we have an ICS update coming to every
single galaxy tab except for the
original seven inch tab which samsung
said a long time ago the original seven
inch wouldn't get due to hardware
restrictions so nothing new there but
they did say that the ICS updates are
scheduled for july and august so here
here in a month you should start getting
them on every single version the Wi-Fi
and 3g versions every form factor and
yes oh yeah that's my snug you know
there'd be people informed i'm just
waiting for them to get the camera
functional on cm9 i'm not going to
install the TouchWiz for my galaxy tab
10.1 they I'm not going to do the OTA
I'm just going to wait until the devs
get the everything lined out for the
camera and whatnot
and we also have a another tablet update
just have authority has ICS so anybody
go stability update to the Asus
Transformer Pad 302 guy over the air
update earlier this week add the Wi-Fi
fix it gave me some better audio better
camera focus better came with
performance you know I even know I said
I don't like taking pictures from a
camera hey you can improve the one all
right but but most importantly it
apparently improved the Chrome browser
stability and I mean that's an amazing
browser so yeah yeah by all means
improving improve that stability on our
on our tablets good job asus so you
haven't gotten that yet go ahead and hit
about tablet check for updates yo yo you
know the drill its version nine point
four point 3.30 um moving on here to app
and rom news us not what we got we got a
swiftkey three that's now available in
the Google Play Store or one week it's
fifty percent off so that makes 71 99 um
I used to use swiftkey and then I've got
the stock ICS keyboard and I stuck with
it because it's better I love to stock
ICS keyboard I admit it is perfect for
when I use it for my fingers are not
formally typing I don't have big fingers
so I don't really necessarily need the
prediction now on my old droid x it was
useful but ICS hands down you know what
uh I i agree i was a big swiftkey user
on my incredible but the moment I got my
god see Nexus back in December you know
i love the ICS keyboard but the other
day whenever it was announced i download
it i tried it for a half hour um I
figured you know what it can't be that
bad for one the 2012 webby awards and it
won and it won the most innovative app
you know uh 2012 Mobile World Congress
it has to be decent right so I i
downloaded to give the new version to
try and i even put in the holo theme so
it look like ICS and it's the same
keyboard i remember you know
a parent you know with anything it gets
better no predictive text gets better
the more you use it I only used it for a
few minutes and I said this isn't
benefit me if I already used it for a
week I probably wouldn't notice the
difference I bet but I didn't give it
that time and I wanted to get my refund
before before it ran out so yeah if you
are famished with the you know for
tablets the split functionality on
tablet act is pretty nice I'll tell you
that right now if you're holed up your
tablet and trying to type if you can
split it down the middle and just use
your thumbs on the side the type it's
that's pretty nice so that might be
worth two bucks right there so go and
check that out on the google play store
um real quick about rom news on main
thing that caught my eye this week
actually and i was actually corrected by
Steve Kondik so Steve Steve is cyanogen
from san jinn mud um we posted the story
about how Steve made an executive
decision to not use linaro code in cm9
then I posted on google+ and actually
tagged steven the post and he corrected
me saying that that's not really all
entirely true and you know I feel like
bozo because yeah I know that for a fact
I've been watching cm's Garrett and I've
seen Lamar Oh Cobie be merged and
approved and I've seen a bunch of sick
you but you know my Peter Pan is you
know took a hole in there and I didn't
dud and follow up with that anyway since
Steve said they've already merged much
of a llamar of code and more sitting in
the queue but he did say though is that
he doesn't think that the GCC which is
the new see compiler version 4.7 is a
great idea he said that more work still
needs to be Donell on it 4.7 is still to
bleeding edge and makes it harder for
developers by breaking features or
breaking devices so too because of that
they're going to stay with something a
little more stable of because you know
cm supports insane amount of devices so
what works for one is not going to work
for everything and they won't try to
make it stable for all their devices so
with that said Steve you know of I agree
that's you know
what you guys are doing you need to be
stable on as many devices as you can so
yes you guys are doing it right so yeah
thanks for clarification on that then
patent wars uh we have a few things this
week that happened in the world of
patents not um the well Apple's going to
be paying for damages oh yeah it which
is nice right we love to hear that yeah
I like that it's like to get that out
there um but basically Samsung was
saying that Apple was free writing their
technological innovations and basically
they're going to seek compensation for
the damages from the apple and its
product its products had caused so this
is good news for android fans and it's
good news i mean i don't like the fact
that patent wars are even there um you
know it's corrupt i think but um it's
the system but yeah but yeah but it was
a 3g patent actually yeah yep the
important thing with the decision was
that they did not allow the import ban
because it's what's called a fran patent
or a standards-essential patent
basically the court said yes you're
absolutely entitled to damages and the
longer that things go like from the
decision until once those damages are
finally paid they keep accruing and then
basically they're basically they're
forcing Apple to agree to to royalty
terms more or less Google and Samsung
and others have gone around and said
look we had all of these standards
essential patents because you know these
are companies they've been making cell
phones for decades not just the last
couple of years like Apple so they have
one or two patents to do with making
cell phones go figure um but they have
the license done because in order to
make a cell phone you have to use these
patents yeah but apples been refusing to
license them saying oh no these are fair
and reasonable terms well now they're
going to get terms whether they like it
or not I'm excited to see what comes
with this oh that for hearings on we had
some other news in the in the patent war
space i believe too right oh yeah girls
are not going to pay anything to own it
um
and nothing so how much per six billion
dollars yes yeah google you and Larry
Ellison got any money we just bought
when I you know he bought ninety-eight
percent of Hawaiian Islands so they
don't yeah but what not but really I
mean I don't even know there was
something that was for sale if you were
having you'd buy it to the venue do with
the Android but uh the you guys remember
the nine lines of rain check code and
and handful of decompile java files well
those are the only two things that
Google could have to pay damages on to
Oracle and most it can be three hundred
thousand dollars which you know it is
nothing now when you will have a hundred
all cash or 50 billion whatever was it
so 50 yeah yeah yeah 15 so three other
jobs dollars uh that's that's almost
laughable so work will said yes clean up
from six billion dollars it's a waffle
said we're not going to pursue the edges
um that's not worth our time we're gonna
go ahead and try to appeal this decision
that the judge actually asked when they
said zero dollars in damages just like
I'm sorry is there catch ya know no sir
no cashel really know last but not least
carrier news the two little tidbits
information here the verizon they're
constantly expanding their 4g network
they announced this week that 46 new
markets we're going to be lit up and 22
existing markets we're going to expand
go ahead and check our website for the
full list i'm not gonna name you know 60
different towns and cities but there it
spread all throughout the entire country
you know there's everywhere with me you
know i got chef on that one too yeah but
getting idea how widespread that market
coverage of 4g is there currently out to
304 markets and their goal by the end of
2012 is over 400 markets so i think
there they are on track
and these updates are also 4G is
definitely awesome last but not least i
have a rumor from an anonymous source he
told me earlier today that AT&amp;amp;T is
definitely going to be getting shared
data plans similar to verizon's and
they're going to launch in about a month
he told me they're going to launch the
last week of July nobody else has
reported on that this is the first
announcement of it so yeah take that
with a grain of salt but I trust I trust
my source so whoa we'll wait for a tan
theta officially announced that but you
know those two you know verizon and AT&amp;amp;T
and a piggyback and copy each other all
the time so chances are it's gonna
happen oh and why are we sharing funny
things to laugh oh I love you Plus
hangouts okay so ya see do we have any
questions here and we could we haven't
checked questions in a while here um
nope i saw one though I think Adrian
asked if I had routed the s3 and yes i
have routed it i installed the paranoid
android rom yesterday so completely
straight away from TouchWiz and i'm
happy to say don't around just might
android available for the s3 yeah i made
a video review that should be out
tomorrow as you guys can check that out
on the android authorities you too ya
know and we'll share that on google+ to
us you guys can check that out that's
awesome on i I'm a big fan of that wrong
even though I have not aired on my
galaxy nexus don't know why I just
haven't but I love everything about it
and all the screenshots one of these
days I'll put it on enough Oh y'all
about to you guys but yeah that's great
it's available for it you know it makes
perfect sense because yeah the s3 has CM
and paranoid android is built off the CM
so very good to know very good to know
definitely I've also overclocked a
device i installed sigh as colonel and i
flashed it and then I got the care of
date wasn't one morning at one point
