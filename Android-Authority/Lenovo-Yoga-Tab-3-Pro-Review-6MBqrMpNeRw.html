with Android authority and here I have
Lenovo's latest tablet the tab 3 pro
it's a 10-inch tablet with an integrated
projector and a friction kickstand let's
take a look with our for review of the
Lenovo yoga Tab 3 Pro when picking up
the yoga tab the first thing you'll
notice are the material choices with the
pro 3 Lenovo brings a leather rear and
metal kickstand held together by a
plastic frame despite some initial well
awkward handling the yoga tablet feels
quite nice to hold this is on the
heavier side at 667 grams however
especially when compared to the Galaxy S
2's 392 grams but that's likely due to
the yoga chip significantly larger ten
thousand two hundred milliamp hour
battery a trade off which we think many
users will actually appreciate in
addition to the Tab 3 pro's strong build
quality it also has a splash proof IP 21
certification meaning that it is
protected from small amounts of water of
course we can talk about a yoga tablet
without talking about the versatility
offered by its kickstand in terms of
functionality the Tab 3 pro brings the
same friction kickstand found and last
year's model in addition to the ability
to hang the tablet from a nail or coat
rack the latter is admittedly very
gimmicky but the kickstand is of
definite utility whether you choose to
place the tablet in tilt mode where the
tablet sits with subtle elevation near
the rear or stand mode where the tablet
is quite literally standing the
kickstand is a feature that you'll
absolutely love it makes contact
consumption much more convenient when
you don't necessarily have a free hand
and it's also nearly essential for
getting the perfect angle when
projecting lenovo has really seemed to
focus on content consumption here
especially when you consider the tab 3
pros for front facing speakers those
speakers are being marketed as JBL
speakers with Dobey Atmos
and they sound pretty good with a good
amount of volume the tab three pros
power button is located on the top and
is surrounded by a notification LED ring
the volume rocker is located just to the
right and the headphone jack can be
found on the very bottom with a 10.1
inch quad HD IPS display the yoga Tab 3
pro offers a respectable PPI of 299 the
display looks great with accurate color
reproduction and great viewing angles
it's also bright enough to read in
direct sunlight although the adaptive
brightness is very buggy and the display
itself scratches pretty easily there
also appears to be a slower response
time when scrolling which causes a
noticeable ghosting effect we were very
disappointed to see this especially
considering the tablets $500 price tag
finally although the super sensitive
touch screen is very nice while wearing
gloves we really wish Lenovo would have
included a setting to temporarily
disable it the display is oftentimes too
sensitive where we'll start taking input
from things like sweatshirts leaves to
headphone cables it's not a major
drawback but it is quite annoying at
times and could be easily resolved by
adding an option to disable it through a
software update
unlike many Android tablets the Tab 3
pro uses a quad core Intel Atom
processor performance was very good for
the majority of our testing save for a
few minor hiccups here and there
Absalon fairly quickly and the tablet
feels fast but there's still some
occasional lag interestingly lenovo has
included just 2 gigabytes of RAM which
well enough for basic use cases can be a
bottleneck gaming on the tab 3 pro was
excellent
with smooth performance and asphalt 8 on
high settings it's not just the graphics
performance that makes gaming on the tab
3 Pro a joy however the speakers also
make the experience much more immersive
the Tab 3 pro includes support for 802
11 AC Mima Wi-Fi GPS and Bluetooth 4.0
the Wi-Fi antenna is notably strong
something which is sometimes overlooked
in Android tablets out of the box the
Tab 3 pro includes 32 gigabytes of
internal storage with the opportunity to
expanded via microSD card up to 128
gigabytes as noted just a moment ago the
Tab 3 Pro offers an integrated projector
adjustable with the friction kickstand
that projector can output an image of up
to 70 inches at 50 lumens and 480p
resolution it's not going to rival
traditional projectors in terms of
quality or resolution but that's really
not the point
it's more of a novelty than anything and
we can think of more than a few
interesting use cases for example it was
great to have during a recent power
outage where I used it to produce just
enough light to continue working without
being stuck in the darkness it's also
excellent for sharing content like when
I used it the other day to watch Netflix
after class regardless of how you use it
the integrated projector is a great
feature to have even with its limited
brightness and resolution with a ten
thousand 200 milliamp our internal
battery the Tab 3 Pro offers great
battery life during my battery life
tests I was able to average little over
seven hours of screen on time with 36
hours of usage that was with pretty
heavy usage - with hours of YouTube and
about a half hour of projecting Netflix
during each test if you scale back your
usage - web browsing and reading for
example it becomes much easier to extend
the battery life further one notable
aspect regarding the battery life is the
temp three pros - standby efficiency
well it doesn't quite match the
seemingly unbeatable standby usage of
the iPad it did very well in our tests
this is great for light to moderate
users who use their tablet more
passively but still want it to last as
long as possible
although the temp 3 probe does include a
13 megapixel rear camera it would likely
be best to stick to using your phone it
does seem to be an improvement over the
tab - pros camera but it's still lacking
a good amount of detail and does very
poorly even the slightest of low-light
conditions
the five megapixel front-facing camera
also isn't that great suffering from
similar issues the camera app offers a
fair amount of control but still focuses
on ease-of-use the app itself is very
nice but it seems to be unstable at
least on my unit I noticed that it
frequently crashed to the point where it
would sometimes refuse to take pictures
all together requiring a device restart
hopefully lenovo can resolve these
issues with a future software update
speaking of software the yucatan 3 pro
is running part of Lenovo's vibe UI over
android 5.1 lollipop out of the box
interestingly lenovo chose to keep
certain stock android aspects but ditch
others like the notification shade and
app icons we're happy to see the return
to a traditional Android launcher as
well as a return to the stock
multitasking menu thankfully lenovo has
kept the bloatware to a minimum shipping
the tablet with only a few third-party
apps like Evernote and McAfee security
the latter is likely due to a deal with
Intel but it can be easily uninstalled
without resistance
lenovo zone apps are also kept to a
minimum the most interesting being
lenovo sketchpad app it's pretty sweet
for quickly jotting down notes
especially considering that you can use
any stylus thanks to lenovo's any pen
technology we do wish it had multi-touch
support however something that seems a
bit odd to exclude there are still a few
areas where the software feels
unpolished but it's much better than
last year's attempt hopefully lenovo
will fix the buggy aspects and improve
the general user experience with future
OTA updates a Wi-Fi only model of the
Lenovo yoga Tab 3 pro is now available
for $4.99 within the US in an LTE model
is expected to be released soon the yoga
Tab 3 pro offers excellent battery life
very good audio and a great display
there's also bonuses like the kickstand
and projector which make this tablet one
of the best for content consumption if
you want to use your tablet for other
things however the yoga cheb 3 probe may
not be the best option there's a lot of
minor issues the performance can be
inconsistent and the software while
improved from lash
cheer is still lacking in terms of
stability we wouldn't consider these
issues to be as big of flaws and a
tablet costing $300 or even $200 less
but given the yoga chat free prose
premium price tag we were disappointed
to see a lack of attention in areas
other than content consumption if you're
looking for an Android tablet with
exceptional video playback capabilities
or tablet with a built-in projector for
that matter the Tab 3 pro is the best
option available to date you'll love it
but if you're looking for something a
bit more well-rounded you may be better
off looking elsewhere thank you for
