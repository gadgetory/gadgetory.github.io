spectacles in all of sports and Super
Bowl 52 is just right around the corner
millions and millions of people are
gonna be tuning in to watch it and
there's gonna be several different
options that you have when it comes to
watching the Super Bowl this Sunday so
let's go ahead and check out what those
are and they're all completely legal of
course so let's start with the most
obvious and probably the most
traditional way that most people are
going to be watching the Super Bowl you
can simply just go to your local sports
bar or bar which is most likely going to
be showing the game or attend a Super
Bowl party that your friend is throwing
it's inexpensive
there's a ton of food and it's a social
environment so it's a really fun way to
enjoy the game if you'd rather watch the
Super Bowl in the comfort of your own
home just tune into NBC this Sunday as
that is the channel of choice that the
Super Bowl is going to be airing on this
year you can also download the NBC
sports app if you want to watch it on
your mobile device like your phone or
tablet and all you have to do is enter
your cable provider credentials and you
are good to go another really solid
option for watching the Super Bowl is
internet TV and internet TV is services
like Hulu with live TV YouTube TV
DIRECTV now PS view sling TV all these
services will be showing the Super Bowl
this Sunday but you want to double check
to make sure that you can actually
receive NBC through these services and
typically you can easily do that just by
going through their respective websites
and just entering your zip code another
thing to keep in mind is that these
services are paid services but most of
them do offer a free trial so you want
to sign up for a free trial you can do
that and most of them don't typically
have a cancellation fee associated with
them if you decide to cancel afterwards
if you don't want to go the internet TV
route or you don't have cable television
you can purchase a digital TV antenna
and these are pretty easy to get a hold
of you can buy one through your local
Best Buy or through online websites like
Amazon they're pretty inexpensive and
very easy to set up and before you buy
one you can check the digital TV
reception maps online so you see exactly
which channels you
are going to get when you get a digital
TV antenna if you want to keep up with
the Super Bowl but you don't necessarily
want to watch the entire thing social
media is going to be a really great
place there's gonna be a ton of people
tweeting about it a ton of people
writing on Facebook and you're most
likely going to catch a lot of game
recaps a lot of highlights as the game
is progressing you're gonna see a lot of
reactions to the game itself and the
halftime show so social media is gonna
be a really fun place to be this coming
