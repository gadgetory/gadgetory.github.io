Authority what's going on everybody
and right now my hands I have the LG
littlejoy this is a competitively priced
mid-range device the lowest of the four
that they are announcing here at MWC
2015 and if you can't already tell this
is going to be the lowest of the line
and probably the most affordable and you
can already tell because the other three
phones that we are looking at here at
MWC with LG have the iconic now LG rear
facing button layout it's not something
that you will find here on the LG joy
and yeah that is one of the main markers
that makes this a different phone from
the rest what we have here is a pretty
small phone quite a bit to think over on
the sides with a 4-inch WVGA display
that comes in at 222 pixels per inch
underneath is a 1.2 core or a dual core
processor depending on the version that
you get and from there you can also get
either eight or four gigabytes of
on-board storage along with one or half
eight gig of ram the software in here is
that you buy of course and this Android
build that will bring the Android
experience to a very affordable price
point so if you can't afford the
flagship devices from LG you still have
the mid-range lines that are going to be
competitively priced if you remember the
Optimus L and F lines that they used to
have this is going to be very much alike
at those we don't quite have the flight
price and availability information quite
yet but nonetheless you will be able to
get a pretty good Android experience on
these for a pretty good price if there's
anything like the original final line a
nineteen hundred million power battery
underneath is also removable so you'll
be able to replace the battery as you
see fit if you need to get a little
extra power in there and Android 4.4
KitKat is what you're seeing on here but
there is a version out there that has
the 5.0 lollipop as well of course
backed by the G you
which were quite familiar with already
in lg smartphones nonetheless this is
the LG of joy just want to bring you
this particular device the lowest in the
segment of their mid-range phones and
probably going to be the most affordable
one as well so keep it to tears
Android 13 for all the best coverage of
MWC 2015 once again this is Jeff regard
from androids are you reporting to you
