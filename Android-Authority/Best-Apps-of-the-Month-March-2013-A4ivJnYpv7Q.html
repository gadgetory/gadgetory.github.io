hindy the android authority app guy
after the intro we're going to show you
the best apps for march 2013 first on
our list is a game called ten million
this game is a mash-up of dungeon
crawling RPG goodness mixed with a
puzzle game for the premise you are a
guy who is trapped in a broken-down
castle and you must fix the castle and
escape you accomplish this feat by
dungeon crawling during a dungeon crawl
you slide icons across the board until
you hit at least three of a kind
depending on which icons you match up
certain things will happen you reach
freedom when you hit 10 million overall
points this game is not only really fun
and addictive but it's also pretty
challenging once you get to higher
levels so if you're into puzzle games
that are actually difficult to play this
one is really good next up is armor for
Android this application has so many
uses that it's unfair to classify it one
way or another so if you're one of those
paranoid people who need their Android
devices to wear tinfoil hats then armor
for Android is for you the app triples
that's right I said triples as a task
manager antivirus app and permission
manager using these tools you can make
your android device squeaky clean and
keep it that way wrapping up all these
features is a clean easy to use
interface that even beginners can
understand despite an overwhelmingly
negative reception by critics the alien
vs predator series continues to thrive
and now it has a game on android much
like the movies the application has been
very popular despite less than shining
reviews from critics the game features a
hack-and-slash style gameplay along with
some pretty impressive graphics like the
movies there isn't much of a storyline
but let's face it we only subject
ourselves to this to watch the monsters
Duke it out with some special skills
like the cloaking and predator vision
included gamers can enjoy this monster
brawl firsthand the chameleon launcher
has been around for quite a while but
only for tablets that run Android
recently the app was retooled and
re-released to be compatible with phones
as well despite its new functionality
chameleon launcher remains one of the
most unique custom launchers on Android
so far it's been quite popular even if
its users have been a little critical
the developers are working on chameleon
launcher widgets and people can actually
create their own if they go to the
official website it's smooth on most
devices it looks good and there's a huge
potential for customization if you've
owned an iphone in the last few years
and you've no doubt heard of doodle jump
the immensely popular iOS game has
finally made its way to Android and
already several million people have
downloaded it
the graphics the gameplay and pretty
much everything else is on par with the
iOS version so Android fans won't be
missing out much like the iOS version
you play as a little thing that jumps up
ledges for all eternity you can use
items like trampolines jetpacks and
spinny has to propel yourself upward and
you can tap the screen to shoot it bad
guys it's an addicting little game
that's perfect for killing a few minutes
if you're a fan of our review videos
then you've seen our take on Google keep
already it's the latest app to be pumped
out of Mountain View and perfect for the
casual note-taker who doesn't need all
the bells and whistles of more
complicated note taking applications
even though some bloggers used Google
keep as a whipping boy to express their
unhappiness over the whole google reader
debacle many people chose to ignore them
and enjoy Google keep anyway this is
great because it really is a rock-solid
application you can take notes a number
of different ways and they're not only
stored on your mobile device but also
online at dr google com backslash key
next up is a fun little puzzle game that
has gained a great deal of popularity in
a short time it's called icomania and
the premise is simple the app will show
you a picture of something and you have
to guess what it is it's kinda like a
one-sided version of draw something we
never did stumble across any pictures
that were overly difficult to guess but
as the game progresses so does
difficulty so if you're in the brain
teasers icomania is worth checking out
the realtime strategy games are pretty
complex these days our next at ninja
village is an RTS game that keeps both
the gameplay and the graphics simple the
premises you're a ninja running a ninja
village that helps unify the country by
taking down the bad guys ninja village
is refreshingly addictive if you're into
real-time strategy games you raise your
village with workers and shops which
then gives you the resources to raise an
army which you then use to take down
rival armies the game is officially over
after 16 hours but you can keep on
playing until you feel like starting
over if you want to imagining life
without photoshop is difficult for some
people whether it's being used for hobby
or professionally Photoshop is ingrained
into many people's lives Adobe seems to
have realize that something like this
could be so on an Android device and
thus Photoshop Touch was born
unfortunately this version has scaled
back a lot from the desktop version but
there are still enough there to deem
photoshop touch genuinely useful like
its desktop sibling there is definitely
a learning curve once you find your way
around though this app is more than
adequate for most hobbyist and many
professional uses simply put people go
nuts for Pokemon it carries almost as
much popularity online as cats do and
the TV
showing video games are among the most
popular in their respective genres if
you're a fan of the show you'll get a
kick out of our next app called
pokemontv this app is pretty simple it's
a video streaming upper you can watch
random episodes of Pokemon straight from
your phone it covers a lot of episodes
from various storylines in the available
episode seemed to be randomized daily
Pokemon TV is an app that no pokemon fan
should be without rivals at war is a
type of card game that has some real
time strategy elements you by and
collect cards with either in-game money
or real money and use those cards in
combat to battle other people it's
important to note that this game is one
hundred percent online multiplayer
rivals at war differs from typical card
games in one key aspect instead of
playing with the cards there are
soldiers that are used as
representations of the cards the
soldiers on either side then simulate a
real battle based on the cards you used
at the beginning of the game the
graphics are really good for an Android
game and it is a unique experience there
are a lot of system monitor apps out
there but that doesn't mean there is no
room for improvement this system monitor
app plainly named system monitor can be
considered an improvement over many
similar apps on the Play Store and is
good enough to compete with the best
while it is a simple application it has
a lot of features it comes with widgets
you can create floating windows you can
put it in your notification bar or you
can just open the app and look a measure
CPU Ram network and disk input/output
and you can create all of the above with
any of this info overall it's a really
solid offering it should be of no
surprise to anyone that when a temple
run game gets released that makes the
best apps of the month Temple Run in
general is hugely popular and its latest
release called temple run oz is no
exception as with the other temple run
games you can expect the same sort of
fast-paced gameplay where you jump slide
and tilt your way around levels all the
while you're being chased by spear
wielding flying monkeys which is where
the Oz part comes in in general there is
no significant difference between it and
other temple run games but it's still a
blast to play if you've been looking for
a substitute 2 angry birds then Toy
Story smash it may be for you this game
is developed by Disney and it puts you
back in the only world where Randy
Newton's music is tolerable the premise
is that the evil Emperor Zurg sworn
enemy of the Galactic Alliance has come
back and he must be stopped the gameplay
is very similar to Angry Birds the
little alien sit on top of various
structure is made out of various things
and Buzz Lightyear gets to throw balls
at them as always the fewer shots it
takes to win the higher the score you
get unlike Angry Birds this is a 3d game
so you can move side to side and take
shots from different
angles if you're a big fan of angry
birds that we think you'll at least
enjoy toy story smashing last on our
list is a park or game called vector
widely hailed as one of the best free
runner games out there vector is a
unique game with a simple premise and
simple controls that is oddly fun to
play despite its simplistic graphics in
the game you use a series of swipes to
navigate levels as you progress new
levels and tricks are learned which
makes the experience all the more fun to
watch some have complained that you have
to grind a little bit to get new tricks
however thanks to the quick gameplay
this didn't seem like a big deal to us
if you take a look at our free apps
leaderboard you can see how these free
apps stack up against one another as
usual there is no bias on our part
because these are arranged based on how
you the people rated them in the Google
Play Store and our other leaderboard you
can see how the paid apps stacked up
this month some of these apps are ranked
as high as 4.9 in the google play store

impressive once again I'm Joe Hindy the
