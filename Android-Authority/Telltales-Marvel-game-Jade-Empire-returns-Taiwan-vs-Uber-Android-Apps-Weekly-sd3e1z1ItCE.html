handy the Android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 166 so let's get
started the developers of critical ops
announced this week that their game has
over 10 million downloads and 300,000
active players for those who don't know
critical ops is a first-person shooter
that's been in a perpetual beta ever
since its release even so it's a solid
game with decent graphics and mechanics
it's a free download in the Google Play
Store if you want to try it out for
yourself it's a worthy competitor to
more popular shooters like modern combat
5 a new study done this week shows that
Android users are more than twice as
likely to uninstall apps and games than
iOS users the study indicates that 43%
of games and 21% of app downloads
eventually get uninstalled on Android on
iOS those numbers are 13% and 9%
respectively
whether Android users simply try more
things or are more particular about
their apps are open for discussion
either way it's pretty interesting word
around a digital grapevine is that
Telltale's upcoming 2017 Marvel game
will be based around guardians of the
galaxy the information comes from a
supposed leak originally covered by
comic book movie comm along with that
the leak also allegedly lists The
Walking Dead Season 3 as a game that's
totally happening we hope all of these
leaks are true because that would be
awesome
Taiwan is currently trying to have over
banned from every App Store in its
country here's what happened in Taiwan
transportation services pay a different
set of taxes from technology platforms
uber classified itself as a technology
platform while the Taiwanese government
is well aware that it's essentially a
transportation service well let you know
how this turns out in the long run but
it's not the first time uber has been in
hot water Facebook and Google are making
some moves to prevent the circulation of
fake news Facebook will simply no longer
allow these stories to trend on its
website while Google removes their
Adsense money and also effects their
search results we don't know what this
will mean for the satire community but
it's actually kind of sad that we have
the culmination of human knowledge at
our fingertips via the internet and this
is still somehow a problem we'll see how
this turns out as these changes roll
cinepak is a voice recorder application
that lets you record yourself and it
does the standard recording stuff pretty
well you'll be able to record yourself
doing whatever and then export those
files to your internal storage dropbox
or google drive another feature is the
ability to let's nip back run as a
service that can temporarily record all
the audio all of the time and then let
you recover it if you want to we don't
recommend leaving that on all of the
time but it's a nifty little thing to
have haunted rooms is a VR puzzle game
that was released earlier this week it's
an escape game which means you'll spend
most of your time solving puzzles in
order to get out of whatever scenario
that you're in it boasts decent graphics
a short story line and a spooky ambience
the developers have also stated that
they'd like to bring more episodes to
the adventure over time it was made for
Google cardboard so it should work with
almost any similar VR headset and it's
also free to download fingerprint
gestures is an application that allows
you to use your fingerprint scanner as a
gesture pad the way it works is you
assign actions to a specific activity
for instance you can set recent apps to
a single tap of your fingerprint scanner
when you perform the activity it then in
turn performs the action it's a little
rough around the edges and it doesn't
work with every device you'll also need
a device that's running at least Android
marshmallow in order to use it Jade
Empire began life as an action RPG on
the original Xbox all the way back in
the mid-2000s it was eventually ported
to PC and now it's been ported to
Android the game takes place in a land
inspired by ancient China and the
characters were as well it's a Bioware
title so fans of their games know what
kind of experience they're going to get
with this one it's a tad expensive at
$9.99 but it comes with full controller
support on screen controls and
additional content that wasn't in the
original release photoscan by Google is
an application that helps you digitize
your photographs you use it to kind of
scan your real-life photos which are
then added into your gallery it also has
a few tools to help things along for
instance you can use a crop tool to get
rid of any frame or background that you
took in your original image it doesn't
take long to learn how to use and it
only really does this one thing anyone
who's been meaning to get digital copies
of their old photographs you should
definitely try this one for even more
