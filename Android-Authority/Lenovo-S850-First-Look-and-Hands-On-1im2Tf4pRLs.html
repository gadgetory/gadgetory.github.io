by bitdefender mobile security hey Josh
of agar from Android 30 what's going on
everybody and here we're taking a look
at the Lenovo s8 50 now in terms of
design the Lenovo si 50 might be the
second device and the budget-friendly
series launched by Lenovo at MWC 2014
but it does come with a beautiful all
glass design that will somewhat remind
you of the Xperia Z lineup now while it
is great-looking durability does come
into some question when you have this
glass finish with the flat sides the
rounded corners and the thickness of
just eight point two millimeters the
sleek device is easy to handle and
pretty comfortable to hold even if it is
featuring a 5-inch display now one thing
that we weren't able to show you and is
actually quite interesting is that the
Lenovo logo on the back actually lights
up where you can also choose what color
it can be depending on what notification
you're getting on the phone when it
comes to the display you get a 5 inch
720p IPS display and the brightness
isn't an issue knowing that it is an IPS
display and the colourful UI of the
device does seem to come through quite
nicely at least in the time that we were
with it now as far as performance goes
das 850 is powered by a quad-core
MediaTek processor clocked in at 1 point
3 gigahertz now coupled with 1 gigabyte
of RAM the performance is satisfactory
but it is definitely slower than some of
the other devices out there especially
the flagships you do get 16 gigabytes of
on-board storage here and it is not
expandable now what is impressive about
the device are its cameras as it does
come with a 13 megapixel rear shooter
and a 5 megapixel front facing camera
these camera specifications are
increasingly being found with mid-range
devices for example with the HTC Desire
a16 that we looked at and now does also
come with a decent 2000 milliamp hour
battery which should last a while with
the promise of at least 13 hours of
talktime and finally in the case of
software we do find that like other
Lenovo smartphones that were launched
here at MWC 2014 you get a customized UI
that does away with the app drawer
completely now this could take some
getting used to and depending on how
many apps you download this could lead
to your home screens getting cluttered
very quickly but as far as the apps go
you do get the full duit suite of apps
that were introduced by the company
including the security to share it the
scene gets nab it and
applications which allow you to do a lot
of different things when it comes to the
camera but also in terms of the shared
it does allow you to control various
other forms of media using just your
phone now in the end this is all priced
at $269 and will only be available in
select markets or through lenovo's
webstore it is a pretty budget minded
device and does provide quite a bit so
stay tuned to Android thority for more
on the Lenovo smartphones as we keep
rolling out the videos from MWC</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
