Authority and with the Galaxy S eight on
its way those of you with an s7 or s7
edge might be contemplating an upgrade
and some of you might consider buying an
s7 especially since it's going to be a
lot cheaper with the release of the SI
let's revisit the galaxy s7 now that
it's a year old and see if it's still
worth it when I reviewed the s7 edge
last year I was really impressed and
loved the phone so much that it became
my daily driver of choice of the
majority of 2016
one year later and many of the aspects
of this phone still hold up extremely
well it's still one of the most
beautiful songs that Samsung has ever
made the curved edge glass design felt
really sleek and refined and pretty much
solidified that this was going to be a
permanent design change going forward
and not just an experiment so design
however it wasn't without its flaws and
accidental touches on the sides of the
screen is something that still happens
from time to time but for me it was
never so problematic to the point where
it kept me from using the phone the
screen itself is just as gorgeous as it
was on day one it's large vibrant and
easily one of the best screens on the
market even in 2017 it may not feature
HDR support or the new fancy aspect
ratio of the SI but at least this means
that you won't have to deal with black
bars with apps that aren't optimized or
when watching sixteen by nine video in
landscape there are things on this phone
that now do feel outdated like a
microUSB port and for someone like me
who has fully transitioned to USB type-c
going back to this port does take some
getting used to but shouldn't be that
big of a deal if you haven't jumped on
the USBC train just yet I've never been
a fan of capacitive keys or physical
home buttons either but Samsung made
really clever use of it when they turned
it into a shortcut to launch into the
camera it's extremely quick and felt
very intuitive and it's something you
won't be able to do with the software
cheese on the s8 the physical home
button also meant that the fingerprint
sensor is in a much more convenient
location and I think most people will
agree that this is a better spot over
the awkwardly placed rear mounted one of
the s8 Samsung's latest software update
brings Android nougat a cleaner
interface and many features that are
available on the SA out of the box over
to the s7 and this essentially breathes
new life into the s7 you won't really be
missing out on much with the software
but considering that the update is
pretty new you might still be stuck on
marshmallow at the moment which my s of
an edge currently is
the s7 edge may not offer the latest and
greatest processor anymore but it's
still a speedy and reliable phone
battery life is also fantastic even
after a year's worth of use and the 3600
our battery is one of the largest
battery Samsung has ever put in their
phones and this is an area that didn't
see much of an upgrade on the s8 at
least not in terms of battery size if
you want the latest and the greatest
you'll of course have to shell out the
extra cash for the SA which will get you
a faster processor and other fancy new
features like Bixby and Samsung decks
but if you don't care about any of that
the s7 edge offers many of the same
features that the s8 does like built-in
wireless charging and ip68 dust and
water resistance the camera in last 7 is
still extremely good it was one of the
best cameras on a smartphone in 2016 and
it's a camera that I still be more than
happy to use in 2017 I think that's the
testament of how good Samsung smartphone
cameras are and although Samsung has
made some upgrades to both the front and
rear cameras on the SI I don't think the
camera is going to be one of the top
reasons for anyone to switch from an s7
to an S 8 or buying the SI instead of
saving some cash and getting the s7 the
s7 maybe last year's tech but in most
aspects this phone doesn't feel outdated
at all it's aged very well inside and
now into the phone that you should be
happy with if you already own one or if
you're considering buying one despite
the new s8
with the price dropping it's going to be
a steal of a smart phone and with the
money you save that can go towards other
cool gadgets or accessories for your
smart phones the point is the s7 and s7
edge were great smartphones when they
came out last year and they're still
really good smartphones now as always
