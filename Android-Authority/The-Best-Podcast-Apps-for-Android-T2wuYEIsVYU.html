handy the Android authority app guy do
you like podcasts I know I do and after
the intro we'll check out some of the
best podcast apps for Android first on
our list is dog catcher this app
features a very busy and cluttered
interface but it's so you can see all of
the information it has to offer you can
find a wide selection of podcasts to
subscribe to which is always important
for a podcast app it also has a lot of
customization options you can auto
download podcasts to your device and it
also has support for both audio and
video podcasts with ease of use that
makes dog catcher one of the most solid
podcast apps for Android pocket casts is
a solid podcasting app like podcast
attic pocket cast allows people to
browse using a variety of options
including top audio top video featured
by Network and by category it makes
finding new podcasts just that much
easier once you've found what you're
looking for playing them is easy and you
can even categorize your podcast
subscriptions for easier listening it's
gorgeously designed and it's easy to use
and really what more can you ask from a
podcast app next up is podcast addict
unlike doggcatcher podcast static takes
a much more simple and less cluttered
approach to a podcast app and makes up
for this by having a lot of screens to
navigate as with nearly all podcast apps
on this list we were able to find all
the podcasts we searched for without
issues when adding podcasts there is a
lot of options you can search manually
add an RSS feed browse by top podcasts
in port via opml and even browse podcast
networks like Twitter revision3 BBC and
others so it's definitely a great app if
you're looking for new podcasts and
listening to old favorites next on our
list is pod kicker this podcast app has
a beautifully simple interface combined
with easy controls in a sleek look this
can be of course good and bad it's good
because it makes things easier to use
it's bad because that means there are
fewer features than most of the others
on this list the podcast is available to
listen to is user driven so if there's a
podcast you like it isn't there you have
to submit that podcasts RSS link to the
official pocket to get it on there this
minor inconvenience aside this is a
great app for people who just want to
listen to their podcasts without all the
bells and whistles last and certainly
not least is RSS daemon this is really
more of an RSS news app than a podcast
app but it does have the capacity
to search for and play podcasts this is
the only app on the list without a
dedicated player so you'll need to use
your music app to actually listen to the
podcasts like the others the
availability is fantastic although it
does lack the ability to discover new
podcasts like podcast addict or pocket
cast so if you're looking for more of a
mix between RSS and podcast instead of
the separate apps for both our SS daemon
fits the bill if you take a look at our
leaderboard you can see how all these
apps stack up against one another as
always this is how they were rated by
you the people who download and use
these apps there is no bias on our part
to get these apps the download links are
in the video description while these may
have the highest ratings the best
podcast for you may not be what's best
for everyone some of our honorary
mentions include beyond pod podcast
manager IPP podcast player pod trapper
podcast manager feed plus news and
podcast manager and Slacker Radio has
some good podcast options as well of
course if there's a podcast that we did
forget feel more than free to comment
below and tell us what your favorite is
