my name is Jace and today we cover
everything from flexible displays to the
best mid-range phones to even settling
some controversy that I stirred up last
week here it comes question number one
came from conan conan said will the
samsung galaxy s5 be released with the
flexible OLED display well no there's no
credible rumor out there right now that
the Samsung Galaxy s5 will come out with
a flexible display of any sort but
Samsung has demonstrated that they do
have that technology with the galaxy
round which does have a flexible display
now some might say that there's real no
practical use for it the way it stands
right now but it is just a prototype
Samsung has demonstrated that they do
have that technology hopefully they'll
be employing it in the new phone sooner
rather than later but what has been
officially announced is the LG G flex
which indeed does have a flexible
display now the flex will come with a
six-inch 720 video display that great
Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor 2 gigs
of ram and a 13 megapixel camera and I
know you're gonna love this the 3500
milliamp battery now I know what some of
you might be thinking you're thinking
Jace this is all just kind of gimmicky
and fluff until we use this oled
flexible displays for the really sexy
stuff like improving wearable devices I
mean who needs just a slightly flexible
phone yes there may be some truth to
that unless you put stock into the crazy
bold claim that LG made that their new
OLED screens will heal themselves after
being scratched so yeah you could
scratch out the coin turkey or something
a few minutes later the screen heals
itself I see some great opportunities
there to inflict some justice on a
particular wife who may have dropped and
broken multiple multiple devices of mine
mmhmm yeah but that wouldn't be true
justice would it you don't think I'll do
it
from here five feet up where's my tablet
the second question comes from Francisco
Francisco said I'm a teenager and a huge
tech fan since I can't afford the best
smartphone on the market what mid-range
device would you recommend I'm going to
assume here Francisco that by mid-range
you mean anything under three hundred
fifty dollars off contract now the Nexus
5 is really the premium phone right now
at that mid-range price and is really
the best bang for your buck now for the
rest of the world who can't get their
hands on the Nexus 5 right now we
recommend the Sony Xperia L it can be
found for around two hundred and fifty
bucks us question number three comes
from Peter Peter said I'm thinking of
buying the samsung galaxy s4 I'm
wondering what are the common problems
with the phone well Peter some people
are a complain about the plastic like
less quality feel of a premium priced
phone number two although the phone is
generally very quick with its tasks it
is very slow to upload its gallery the
problem is compounded with the micro SD
card and the more stuff on the card the
more the phone has to parse and number
three when it comes to the air view and
air gestures and smart scroll a number
of people have complained that although
they're very cool in their own way they
are flawed and overly complex and really
marring the overall simplicity of
Android question number 4 comes from
adam adam said i have a question about
how best to charge the battery on my
phone for example if it's at seventy
percent should i just charge it to a
hundred percent before i go to work is
it bad to charge my phone repeatedly
normally i would only charge at night
when i sleep i'm just curious on how
best i should charge it thanks for your
time and your help great question Adam
and I learned a lot about this here to
it turns out that we should avoid fully
charging or fully discharging our phone
avoid letting your phone's battery run
all the way down unlike nickel-based
batteries lithium based batteries are
designed to be charged early and often
and letting them get too low can damage
the battery if it's done repeatedly with
lithium based batteries doing shallower
frequent charging prolongs the
battery life this is according to
independent tests done by gizmodo and by
battery University calm so guys last
week most people seem to love the first
to a but some people thought i was just
blatantly you know incompetent and
didn't know what i was talking about and
giving a bad information so if and when
that happens again please kindly share
it in the comments but as adults give me
some backup verifiable info where I can
you know you know back up your claim and
and if I stand corrected to correct
myself and then share it in the next Q&amp;amp;A
the next week I'm more than happy to do
that so there were some other questions
about leaving XDA and is XDA and android
authority merged and why are all the XDA
host leaving well they're not it's just
for me XD i decided that they could no
longer continue their weekend shows on
saturday and sunday so you know i had to
move on and and her authority was was
there for me and i'm happy to be back in
the saddle creating shows for you all so
i'm also trying to make a balance
between the easy beginner questions and
the more hardcore questions so please
keep the hardcore questions coming I
like it how do i fix my crack screen a
lot of love and forgiveness</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
