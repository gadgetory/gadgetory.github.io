wanted to show you some of the weirder
things we saw this year
now we're only a month away from Mobile
World Congress so there weren't that
many phone announcements here but
there's still a whole bunch of fun
products you're probably gonna like
Moe Dias is a headset that's promising
to help you lose weight by stimulating
the part of your brain related to
metabolism the brace in San Diego and
they're currently in the shipping stage
of their IndieGoGo campaign they look
pretty ridiculous but we'll wait for
reviews before we totally disregard the
technology
the Fisker electric car is a new concept
vehicle that's made to compete with the
likes of Tesla we've seen a few other
companies like Faraday future announce
competitors as well but we still haven't
seen one in the wild this car looks much
more like a traditional sports car and
it should be launching in 2019 or 2020
the Toyota I pala is a new self-driving
vehicle which is designed to help
companies move information and product
more effectively
so far they've already partnered with
companies like Amazon Pizza Hut and uber
but we may see more partnerships
announced in the coming weeks
ssam NOx is a smart pillow which can
help put you to sleep and help you fall
back asleep can you wake up in the
middle of the night it breathes with you
as you hold it and it's supposed to help
slow your breathing patterns help you
fall asleep faster this may be the first
year we've started to see TV shows
promoted at CES Netflix in particular
was promoting an upcoming series they're
calling psycho sec which gained quite a
lot of attention at the convention it's
interesting to start to see these
streaming companies be considered
technology companies but it's a good
indication of the times</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
