authority released just under two weeks
ago the pantech discover is the
company's latest mid-range android
powered phone how does it hold up find
out in our review now android phones
have come a long way in a very short
amount of time we're at a point where
even phones running pretty modest
hardware can provide a great experience
and while pantech may be known as a
maker of budget phones the hardware in
the pantech discover isn't actually all
that modest so let's get started by
taking a look at the specs the pantech
discover runs a Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
plus chipset with a 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core processor as one gig of ram
and 16 gigs of storage which is
expandable via microsd the screen is 4.8
inches and 720p HD with a resolution of
1280 by 720 the front and rear cameras
are 12.6 megapixels and 2 megapixels
respectively with the rear camera
capable of capturing 1080p video finally
the battery has a capacity of 2,200
milliamp hours for a fairly inexpensive
mid-range phone the pantech discover has
a nice solid feel while remaining light
at 4.7 6 ounces or 135 grants the design
flows nicely with a bump on the back
housing both the rear camera lens and
the dual 3d surround sound speakers the
shape is a major plus and combined with
the textured back this is one of the
most comfortable phones I've held in a
while hardware buttons are minimal with
just the power button on top and the
volume rocker on the left side
everything else is handled via on-screen
buttons the 4.8 inch 720p display may
not be the best display we've ever seen
but it's far from the worst especially
considering the price point of the
discover video looks nice colors are
vivid and rendering of text and icons as
sharp matching or exceeding the displays
we've seen on pricier phones with the
specs being so similar to the LG
spectrum to we reviewed recently I had a
fairly good idea what to expect
performance wise and the pantech
discover met my expectations
it isn't going to blow any high-end
phones out of the water but in
day-to-day use the discover is going to
be up to most challenges you throw at it
especially apps which rely most heavily
on the CPU and that does account for the
vast majority of apps available the
pantech discover runs a skinned version
of android 4.0 ice cream sandwich we've
heard that an update to jelly bean is on
the way but we're not sure whether it'll
be 4.1 or if pantech will skip directly
to 4.2 the usual suite of Google Apps is
included as are some pre-loaded AT&amp;amp;T
apps which as usual can't be removed but
generally there seem to be less
bloatware than we've seen on other
recent devices one major plus for me at
least is that swiftkey is included out
of the box which i prefer greatly to any
other keyboard the pantech discovers
camera may be a bit bare bones compared
to those found on other phones but I
found it to be quite usable with decent
focus and low-light performance HDR and
panoramic modes are included and options
like exposure white balance and focus
mode can be adjusted the 1080p video
capture was decent as well with fairly
accurate color representation and a
steady frame rate of 30 frames per
second battery life on the pantech
discover is pretty much what you might
expect from a device with the 2200
milliamp hour battery pantech claims
roughly 10 hours of talktime and those
numbers usually match up with what I
think of as moderate use time video and
games are obviously going to drain the
battery faster but in normal use the
discover should easily last through a
day without charging though you'll want
to bring a charger on weekend trips and
there you have it in the end the pantech
discover is a solid stylish phone that
isn't going to break the bank if you'd
like to know more about the pantech
