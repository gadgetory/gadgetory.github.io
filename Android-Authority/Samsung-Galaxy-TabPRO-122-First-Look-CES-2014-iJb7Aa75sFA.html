by Toyota the Galaxy Tab line now has a
new big member of the family H Strasburg
are from Andhra Authority what's going
on everybody and this is the Samsung
Galaxy Tab pro 12.2 today's Samsung
announced a brand new line of tablets
holding the pearl moniker but in the tab
line that also meant a new huge addition
was made the Tab pro 12.2 essentially
takes on many of the same elements of
the note Pro that was also announced
today a 12 point 2 inch behemoth of a
screen packing 2560 by 1600 resolution
the Snapdragon 800 or the Exynos 5 octa
4 power 3 gigabytes of RAM and a
whopping 5 in 9500 milliamp hour battery
that will help it go the distance
essentially the only thing that makes
the tab pro different from the note pro
is the lack of an S Pen but that doesn't
mean there aren't still enhancements in
the general experience Samsung has
finally given TouchWiz a refresh and
while it does drop much inspiration from
the my magazine interface introduced
earlier this year
it does take advantage of the large real
estate quite well pages can now be
created with different sizes of
specialty widgets aligned on a grid
making for a tiled but very clean and
functional interface productivity has
also been given a boost as TouchWiz
takes advantage of the huge canvas with
an enhanced multi window where once you
could create two windows for
multitasking for well sized segments can
now occupy the entire screen making your
high work and play now easier than ever
without the s-pen there are obviously no
pen commands or any stylus options
available but if you are alright having
the world at your fingertips this
mammoth device allows you to do so
pretty well it's a beast for sure but
luckily that applies as much to the
outside as a does to the inside of the
Tab pro 12.2 stay tuned for more
coverage of these tablets as well as the
rest of our show coverage live from CES
2014 in Las Vegas and once again thank
you to Toyota for sponsoring our CES
