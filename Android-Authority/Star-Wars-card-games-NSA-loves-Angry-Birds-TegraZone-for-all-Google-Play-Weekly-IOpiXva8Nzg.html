hindi the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly this
week we had the usual array of app
releases and news but we also had a
little bit of controversy so we're gonna
talk about that and a lot more right now
first up this week is some good news
Nvidia's Tegra zone received an update
that removes device restrictions so
pretty much anybody with an android
device can use it it's in the Google
Play Store right now so those with a
Tegra device will simply get an update
while people with non Tegra devices can
now see the app in the Play Store for
the first time it's compatible with most
devices running Android 2.2 and up and
you can find the link in the written
companion which is in the video
description there are some things to
note many Tegra zone games are developed
for high-end machines like the Nvidia
shield so if you're rocking a 2.2 phone
with a single core processor chances are
you can't play most of these games
anyway after all you don't expect a
Chromebook to play Skyrim right even
still it's worth a look around because
there are some really great games in
there the Google Chrome has been busy
lately this last week they released an
application that allows developers to
turn their Chrome apps into Android and
iOS apps also they released an
experiment that lets you play with Legos
first let's talk about the app porting
according to the documentation The Fader
program can take applications developed
an HTML CSS and JavaScript and wrap them
in an Android or iOS app shell so they
can be immediately used on those
platforms this can be a great step
toward the unification of the mobile and
web platforms but it is still in beta
and thus not a lot of data is available
as to how well these apps will run when
porting if app development isn't your
cup of tea another Google experiment
released this week lets you play with
Legos and no that is not a metaphor in
this neat little app you can construct
pretty much whatever you want out of
Legos and then share it with your
friends if you want to or let Google use
your location data to put your creation
on a world map in your actual location
if you looked at blizzards hearthstone
and thought to yourself well gee whiz I
would love it if that were in a Star
Wars flavor in this next story is gonna
make you really happy the Disney has
announced that a new turn-based card
game called Star Wars assault team will
be making its way to Android and the
premise is you'll be collecting cards of
characters from the Rebel Alliance to
battle villains on the digitally
remastered sets of the original trilogy
Disney hasn't released all that many
details yet otherwise we tell you more
we know it slated to be released
sometime this spring and yes we will
probably be reviewing it there are hints
of there being multiplayer support but
aside from what I've just told you there
really isn't any more info about it for
right now immersive mode is one of
KitKat's best features and even though
not a lot of people are running KitKat
yet game developers like Gameloft are
preparing for it
Gameloft has announced that they'll be
adding immersive mode to a number of
their titles in the coming weeks
asphalt 8 has already received the
update and game off classics like order
and chaos online total conquest Dungeon
Hunter 4 GT racing 2 and others will
also be receiving the update as if that
weren't enough Gameloft has also stated
that many of their older titles would
eventually get the update as well and
that it would simply take them a little
bit longer to get it all done also most
if not all future titles will come with
the feature baked in game off games are
traditionally hit and miss on whether or
not they're any good but kudos to them
for making the effort to stick with the
times in our last bit of news this week
there was some controversy in the app
world after some documents released by
Edward Snowden showed that the NSA
collects personal data from applications
like Angry Birds this was pretty
unsettling news when it first popped
since Angry Birds is one of the most
popular game titles of all time via
console PC or mobile according to the
documents the NSA and the GCHQ are
capable of grabbing data from apps like
Angry Birds Twitter Facebook Google Maps
and others although frankly Angry Birds
was pretty much the only one on the list
that we didn't already know about Rovio
was pretty quick to retort stating that
no one took data directly from them and
it was through third-party advertising
networks that the spying was actually
taking place they then mentioned that
pretty much any app or site that uses
advertisements could be susceptible to
such a surveillance this hasn't stopped
people from being upset about it and
some hackers even went so far as to
deface Rovio's website it's about that
time to be talking about some trending
applications as usual if you want to
check any of these applications out you
can find the links in the written
companion which is in the video
description
Lumos is a newly created icon pack for a
couple of bucks in the Google Play Store
it features a whopping fourteen hundred
and eighty icons a cloud-based
wallpaper gallery and even a dashboard
application to help you assign icons the
icons are colorful and dark with a
modern and sharp design it's compatible
with about a dozen launchers and that
includes
the best options so if you're a fan of
icon packs give this one a look stack
exchange made our best apps of January
2014 list and for good reason it's a
highly informative app that can help you
find the answers to the questions that
you have
it's like Yahoo Answers on crack it has
a well designed interface and offers
quick access to all of stock exchanges
sites including the popular Stack
Overflow also it's free so there's no
real reason not to try it out rupak is
an interesting third-party camera
application with but one purpose and
that is to get the photographer into the
photograph here's how it works you snap
a photo and then you go situate yourself
in the shot and somebody else snaps a
second photo then group ik morphs the
two together so that it's a nice picture
of everybody it's free to use and
recommended by a lot of prominent blogs
including this one the dungeon keeper is
a multiplayer strategy game where you
must build a dungeon and then attack the
dungeons of others it's gaining
popularity pretty quickly and Garner's a
fairly high rating in the Google Play
Store considering it's a game made by EA
and they've had some pretty questionable
tactics in the past when it comes to
freemium titles this is still a game
worth checking out if you're into online
strategy games also it's free so it
can't hurt last up this week is a new
application called dash called by many
the Fitbit for cars
- connects you to your car using the
same technology the Progressive
Insurance does with their snapshot
device here's how it works you plug in a
device underneath of your dashboard and
then you use dash to interface with it
you can check out a myriad of stats
including driver scores check engine
light data car location and a whole lot
more well that about does it for this
