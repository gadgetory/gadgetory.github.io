material to some internals that you
might already be kind of familiar with
but it's really the price you got it
here it's Josh of agar from Android
authority what's going on everybody and
here is your first look at the oneplus X
1-plus is bringing a device that looks
very different from anyone's that they
made in the past dual glass panels are
held together by a metal frame that
feels incredibly sturdy actually even
though this is a somewhat smaller device
than many of the ones we have in the
market today it actually feels heavier
than all of them
you have the Onyx version that has black
glass on both sides and the handling on
that is quite easy especially when you
have the flat metal sides along with the
somewhat smaller five inch 1080p display
but there's actually another version of
this phone that is made of a fire
baked ceramic on the back now this
material is kind of hard to create as
oneplus told us and thus this phone will
come in limited quantities and at a
higher price but you can already see the
difference between these two devices as
the Onyx simply has the two glass panels
and the ceramic adds a bit of a
chamfered edge onto all parts of the
back going around the sides we do have
all of the buttons on the right side
really easy to reach but opposite that
is the returning alert slider now the
alert slider returns on the oneplus 2
and is an easy way of changing what kind
of notifications you get on the device
either all probably already or nine now
returning also from the oneplus 2 is the
ability to put in dual sims on this
phone
but what's great about this particular
device is that one of those trays will
be able to house a micro SD card slot
yes you will be able to expand the
storage in here and that is a big
feature that the oneplus X is able to
tout overall we're really happy with the
craftsmanship on this device already
even though it does seem like a little
bit smaller of a device it actually
feels heavier overall and the dual glass
panels give it a very good black slate
design that you may not be able to
customize per se but a bunch of
different cases will be available for
you to change the look of it personally
though I'm not a big fan of the cases
because they look out of place when you
look at just how elegant this phone is
that said however it is a very
fingerprint prone device we have to wipe
the device off plenty of times during
this shoot and that's something that
you're probably just gonna
to expect when it comes to a glass
design in the oneplus X we already
alluded to this display being of 1080p
resolution but also of an AMOLED
construction now we'll always think that
that's a pretty good choice but here in
the oneplus X it gets an added benefit
because oxygen OS now supports the
ambient display one of the features from
earlier versions of Android that allows
you a quick look at your notifications
and you can actually wave your hand over
the device in order to trigger it
underneath the surface we have a pretty
familiar processing package the
Snapdragon 801 which returns and as
oneplus said they did a lot of testing
on the Snapdragon 801 and found that not
only is it still reliable it is actually
still a bit faster than the more recent
Snapdragon 617 it's backed by the
adrenal 330 and 3 gigabytes of RAM which
is going to help with multitasking
across the board a 25 25 milli amp hour
battery which with the 5 inch display
and the Snapdragon 801 might be able to
go for quite some time but we'll have to
wait for our full review to test that
out now when we move on to the camera
there are a couple of changes here as
well as the camera comes with 13
megapixels in the rear and 8 megapixels
in the front which should do pretty well
for this selfies the camera app itself
however is really similar to the oneplus
2 and that you can swipe among the
different modes in the viewfinder in
order to change it and aren't really
that many manual controls on it at least
not for the moment and finally in
software we have the oxygen OS returning
from the oneplus 2 with many of the
difference features that it had but it
still looks very stock like in nature
and is pretty easy to use especially on
this 5-inch display the Shelf is there
but it is off by default the dark mode
returns and is the default on here so
you can see everything pretty easily
especially in darker situations so
you're not really putting too much
strong light into your eyes and then we
already mentioned the ambient display
but there is also an FM radio in this
device so if you want to listen to
something a little bit more local in the
airwaves than you certainly can and from
there oxygen Noah still has plenty of
the different gestures the app
permissions also do a return and r1 plus
is flavor of that but it's really a
software suite that manages to bring
some marshmallow features without truly
being marshmallow but that update will
be coming at some point later on
and that should do it for the look at
the oneplus X the oneplus one is still
one of our favorite devices and we're
happy to see that kind of experience get
slightly updated and put into an even
better looking body even more accessible
even with the smaller display and a
couple of features are added in like the
alert slider and of course the
expandable storage which we are always
really happy about but what really makes
us happy about this device is the price
at two hundred and forty nine dollars
this might be one of the easiest entry
points into the world of Android and it
should be pretty high quality as well
the ceramic version will only be
available for a higher price in Europe
but those invites will be going out as
well
shortly after the release of the
original onyx version of the oneplus X
as far as the invite system goes there
are going to be pure invites for the
first month of the release but gradually
over time there will be open sales times
that slowly get bigger until the oneplus
X will be made fully in open sale market
so keep it tuned to Android authority
for that and even more stick around for
your invites and then you'll be able to
see if this phone is the one that you
should be getting when we give you our
full review very soon so keep it tuned
to an authority for that and even more
because we are your source for all
things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
