my name is Jace and this is where we try
and answer your most pressing Android
questions but to start off we must on
behalf of Android wish you a happy 2014
and on behalf of Apple we will wish you
a happy 2013's
let's get started first question is
about alternative mobile operating
systems from Lam dude man
12 why don't developers create more
operating systems instead of just
Android and iOS
good question Lam dude man and the short
answer is because it's really hard it is
hard to create your own operating system
even harder to do well but it is being
done I mean there's the obvious right I
mean there's Windows and Blackberry and
all that but there is something a few of
you will know about called the bun 2 and
a bun 2 is making moves in 2014 so I
really encourage you to check out the
Android Authority comm article here
about what's in store for Ubuntu for
2014 but the following is my personal
understanding or personal opinion on the
subject I've said before that I think
the entry-level smartphone market the
much bigger market and the much cheaper
market is underserved these are people
who they're not very tech savvy they're
not web savvy but they sure want the
newest you know mainstream killer app
they want to play Angry Birds they they
want to play you know plants vs. zombies
on a phone and you know most of the
really cheap phones on there just don't
do these things very well those people
don't want to spend four or five hundred
ollars on a smart phone but they want a
smart phone so I think a bun two could
work a miracle here and do what Windows
and Blackberry haven't been able to do
and that's but that's take a huge chunk
out of androids market share and that is
by serving that you know lower end
market and not creating phones that are
just have this planned obsolescence
built in right they you know 200 all our
phone might be great for the first six
months but a year later it's like it's
laggy and it's slow I think this is a
great opportunity for a bun to I have
interviewed developers from upon too
before or canonical canonical is the
company responsible for going to and
there's some really inspiring guy
they love open source bun too is open
source and because it's open source they
have a little bit of an advantage in
creating a bigger app ecosystem than
that most other alternative mobile
operating systems would have so it's
exciting we'll have to see what's in
store solar shits who says hey Jase how
can I get the dust out from in between
my screen great questions Solar Shih Tzu
great name by the way I did some
research for you and found some
information that people really
appreciate it on XDA developers comm
we're one of the developers goes through
a breakdown of how you could take apart
your phone and clean the screen and get
out from under it now again I have to
give you a warning this is for geeks
only if you do not feel comfortable
taking apart your phone and successfully
putting it back together and following
those detailed instructions take it to I
fix it I fix it does
do you know Android devices - if you
don't have an eye fix it in your area
you could consider taking it to someone
who is a geek and who's comfortable with
taking these things apart and putting
them back together but there is a
step-by-step guide there you can check
it out the link is in the showings below
hey Jase why is it that users all over
the world can't access the same content
in Europe we can't get the same content
and features you guys get in the u.s.
that's crap didn't you guys know that
Canadians get a little sensitive about
being called Americans love Americans
great country but I'm a proud Canadian
well what you're really talking about
here is content distribution deals and
the geo blocking that's used to enforce
those deals so for example if I want to
watch The Daily Show of Jon Stewart and
I go to the comedy channel online and
watch it I get a notification that says
this content is not available in your
country that is geo blocking geo
blocking is a program that stops or only
allows certain countries to watch
certain pieces of content and that's
because of distribution deals so for
example if I want to watch The Daily
Show I have to go to a Canadian Network
television show that does have a deal
with the Daily Show content owners right
so for example if Android Authority comm
became a television show was on you know
cable television we would make deals
with different networks within different
countries and if we don't have that deal
in that country we're not gonna give our
content away for free right so that's
why you you can't watch that pieces of
content now you were talking about the
Google Play Store and movies within the
Google Play Store and those content
distribution deals would apply to the
Google Play Store google has to abide by
those distribution deals now these
distribution deals are our old world
media you know it's a residue of old
world media in new media like like us
our audiences you know vastly
international I mean we have more
viewers outside of North America than we
do in it I believe so as media companies
become more and more international those
distribution deals won't be as much of a
factor at least we hope andreas asks hi
I need a phone with a 1080p screen good
speakers and a powerful processor at
least 2.3 gigahertz
is there any phone like this out there
or should I wait for 2014 smartphones do
not consider the HTC One I hate that
phone well address is unfortunate you
don't like the HTC One because that
means almost all of your requirements
except for the processor so you may want
to consider the LG g2 and the Galaxy
Note 3 now they don't have the same
speakers that the HTC One has so you may
if you don't want to go that big you may
want to wait for the m8 know codenamed
m8 which is supposed to be the successor
to the HTC One now it's supposed to be a
little smaller it's rumored to be you
know five inches 1080p great speakers
and using a Snapdragon processor so if
you can wait three months you may want
to wait for that thanks for watching
android peeps my name is Jace and you
can connect with me here on Twitter and
Google+ don't forget to connect with my
brothers an Android Josh Joe and the
tech ninja Kevin and yes all the items
that I spoke about have links in the
show links below go check them out I
shall see you next week on androids Q&amp;amp;A</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
