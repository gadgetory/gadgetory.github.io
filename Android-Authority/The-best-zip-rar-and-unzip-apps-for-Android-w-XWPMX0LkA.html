handy the Android authority app guy
compressing and decompressing files is a
problem we don't normally think about
until it's something we actually have to
do so this week we're going to take a
look at some of the best apps that
compress and decompress files don't
worry we're gonna be talking about zip
stars and roars first on our list today
is easy unrar unzip and zip this is the
most simple app on the list and it's
literally only good for three things
that is viewing archives unzipping
archives and creating archives so if
that's all you need this is a great app
to get started with the design is a
little amateurish but it works as
advertised and it really isn't all that
bad
there are a few features that require
the premium version like archive
encryption but like most on this list it
supports a variety of file types like
rar zip tar and others next up is and
Rosoff it is yet another one of those
Android relic apps because it's been
around for ever so long in fact that it
still carries an outdated Gingerbread
interface but that's ok because it
doesn't affect the functionality at all
like many others on this list and ROS it
can do more than just create and extract
packages it has a task manager a root
explorer should you need one and a few
other assorted tools like most on this
list it can handle more package types
including zip rar tar and 7-zip number 6
on the list is called 7-zip err this
powerful zipper and unzipper program may
look a little outdated but it actually
works fairly well among its features you
can drag and drop files it has a special
interface for unpacking things and it
even works pretty quickly it also has a
plethora of other features it's a task
manager FTP client and it can even
backup applications there is a route
manager for our routed friends if you
need one of those it does what it says
it does and it does it well and that's
really all there is to it
the solid explorer is not just an
archive app but actually a full-featured
file explorer as it turns out unzipping
archives is one of its many functions so
if you're looking for something that's a
little more feature filled here's a good
place for you to start like the others
it supports many file types it's
definitely one of the better designed
apps on the list there are little
animations that make things look nice
and the functionality is smooth in terms
of zipping things up you can do that in
either tar or zip only but it can
decompress more than that number four on
our list is ES File Explorer and as a
file explorer it's actually really good
it has a lot of features a really nice
look and is usually really enjoyable to
use as luck would have it it can deal
with compressed files too if need be
it can only compress into zip format but
it can deal with a lot more than that
like most of these file explorers you
have to browse the menu a little bit to
find the functions but it does work as
advertised so if you need an all-in-one
solution here's another good one for you
the first in our top three is b1 File
Explorer this nifty little free app
gives you a full compression and
decompression solution free of charge
and all you have to deal with is some
subpar design elements it's not terrible
but it's also nothing to write home
about it unzips just about everything
and if you need something compressed it
can do it in both zip and b1 format it's
simple it's quick it's easy to use and
it's free there really isn't much to
complain about except the app design
number two is Z archiver and if you want
things compressed and decompressed this
has earned its spot as one of the best
on the list it unzips pretty much
everything you can think of and it's
usually the archiver people have to use
in tutorials for other processes like
removing ECM encryptions on playstation
roms it's not much to look at but it
does have some theming options also it
can compress to 7-zip zip and tar so if
you need something different you're out
of luck it's quick reliable and there is
a free version all you're going to do is
get over the gingerbread style design
elements
and here it is number one on our list
and it's rude Explorer this app has been
featured on our top 10 list before for
productivity and it makes it here again
this app is easy to use root user
friendly and it can decompress pretty
much everything there isn't much more
that you can ask it to do it also
functions as an all-in-one File Explorer
if you need something to that extent it
also has a pretty nifty design that
looks pretty slick if you're not rooted
you can't enjoy all of the features but
for compressing and decompressing files
it should do just fine if you take a
look at our leaderboard you can see how
all these apps stack up against one
another as usual we didn't rate these
ourselves you guys did we put them in
list form and put up this snazzy video
to help you guys out if you want to give
them a shot the links are in the video
description we wanted the maximum
possible choices for this list it ranges
from simple zip and unzip apps to
full-blown file explorers there are free
and paid options as well so whatever
you're looking for you should be able to
find it somewhere on this list as usual
