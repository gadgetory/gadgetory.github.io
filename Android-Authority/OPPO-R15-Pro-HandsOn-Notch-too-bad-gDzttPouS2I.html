into markets across the world even if
they have a hit the u.s. yet well most
of their phones hang out in the
mid-range section of the market they can
offer features and form factors that
might make you believe they were
full-fledged flagships the company
brought me out to Shenzhen
to check out their newest phone that was
just made available for sale and while
it might not compete with Samsung or
huawei's best and brightest it does have
a charm that makes me think it's not
always the insides that matter this is
our hands on of the Oppo ar-15 and ar-15
Pro just to get it out of the way
neither of these are running Qualcomm
Snapdragon 845 the standard ar-15 is
running a mediatek helio p60 processor
while the pro model adopts qualcomm
snapdragon 660 the brains might not be
fully up to speed on the cutting edge of
the industry but the rest of the
internal features of this thing rival
pretty much every other flagship on the
market right now
it has 128 gigabytes of storage and a
micro SD card slot to store all your
movies and music which you can enjoy
through the included headphone jack and
the six gigabytes of ram should help
make multitasking a breeze
top it off with the 18.9 nine by nine
six point two eight inch OLED display
and you would think that you had a
high-end flagship in your hands
considering this is probably almost the
exact same body as the oneplus 6 though
this body will likely make its way to
flagship territory in the coming months
the standard ar-15 is using a 3450
million power battery while the pros
port a three thousand four hundred
million power option and while this is
fairly standard for phones right now
we'll have to see how that enormous OLED
display effects battery life yes this
phone has a notch but whether you like
it or not that's going to be the trend
for smartphones in 2018 to the phone's
credit the notch is a bit smaller than
other knotch devices coming out this
year and it's housing a 20 megapixel f/2
sensor that actually shoots pretty great
selfies this was probably made to
accommodate the extensive AI based face
mapping software that oboes just stuffed
into this thing and while I had a lot of
fun with the software we probably won't
be seeing these features come to the
one plus six later this year face unlock
is also present here so if you don't
want to use the oblong fingerprint
reader sitting in the back of the phone
you can always just hold it up to your
face I did find this feature a bit and
consistent in my time with the phone
though so you might want to stick to
your fingerprint for now the rear
cameras are also fairly high resolution
with the pro model sporting a dual 16
and 20 megapixel shooter while the
standard edition employs a 16 megapixel
and a five megapixel lens the photos we
shot at the event looked pretty good but
Oppo did set up a really fancy room with
really fancy lighting so we're gonna
have to see how this fares in the real
world later on I'm still pretty
disappointed to see that Oppo hasn't
included USBC in any of their devices so
far microUSB just feels old and outdated
at this point though the inclusion of
vogue fast charge does help ease the
pain just a bit color OS 5.0 is based on
Android 8.1 oreos so I am glad to see
that Oppo is keeping their phones
up-to-date at launch you might mistake
the OS for iOS though because there's no
app drawer and a lot of the icons look
really similar to the iPhone equivalent
still it's not a bad skin by any
standard and it feels pretty light
overall the standard ar-15 comes in red
white and a gradient purple color while
the pro comes in black and a gradient
read this gradient trend kind of came
out of nowhere with the recent Huawei P
20 but I'm not complaining because it
looks pretty great so this has been the
Oppo ar-15 and ar-15 Pro the Chinese
version is available now and we're not
sure when the international version will
hit other markets but be sure to stay
tuned to Android Authority for more
information the minute that happens
