authority coming to you live from CES
2016 and we're taking a look at the blue
vivo 5 and the vivo XL these are the two
latest smartphones to come out of the
Florida based manufacturer and for the
most part they're pretty much the same
phone with the main exception being the
actual hardware the vivo 5 features an
all-metal design with chamfered edges
all around while the XL is entirely made
of glossy plastic both of them feel
solid in the hand despite the difference
in material choices but the 5 is
definitely the more quote-unquote
premium feeling phone you're also
getting 3 gigs of RAM while the vivo 5
versus the 2 gigs of RAM on the XL and
the vivo 5 packs 32 gigs of on-board
storage which is double that of the XL
the display is a 5.5 inch Super AMOLED
screen with 720p resolution which is
perfectly fine for a phone of this price
point and still looks pretty good in
terms of colors and viewing angles the
camera on the vivo 5 + XL is a 13
megapixel rear shooter with LED flash
eff 2.0 aperture and support for 1080p
video at 30 frames the front camera
comes in at 5 megapixels which should
get the job done for selfies and video
chats again we haven't really had much
time to test these cameras out but Blue
has done a decent job with the camera
software and it offers quite a variety
of shooting options Blue has a few other
things up its sleeve with these devices
to both the vivo v &amp;amp; vivo XL sport 31 50
milliamp hour batteries USB type-c ports
for charging and data transfer as well
as fast charging technology software
wise you're looking at android 5.1
lollipop wood blues custom skin and it's
a pretty standard blue phone experience
you will find a few custom features like
shortcuts on the lockscreen but
otherwise it's a pretty familiar
experience from what we've seen from
blue in the past both of these devices
will be going on sale very soon for both
under $200 the vivo 5 will be available
in white silver and a solid gold color
option in February on Amazon and through
Best Buy for $1.99 the XL will be
available in liquid gold chrome silver
midnight blue and rose gold color
options sometime in January through
Amazon and Best Buy for 149
but that's going to do it for this quick
hands-on of the blue vivo 5 and Excel
hopefully you guys enjoyed this video
and found it helpful and stay tuned for
the rest of our CES 2016 coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
