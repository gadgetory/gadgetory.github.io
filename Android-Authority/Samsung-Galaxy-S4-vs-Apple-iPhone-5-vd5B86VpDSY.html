hand we have Samsung's newest flagship
phone and on the other hand its biggest
non Android competitor hey Josh so
fagged our firm android authority what's
going on everybody
and this is the Samsung Galaxy s4 versus
the Apple iPhone 5 it's obvious that
we're dealing with two very different
devices with different looks form
factors and in some ways different
philosophies from a first glance you
notice the size difference samsung's
galaxy s4 is the latest in a barrage of
5-inch screen smartphones to come in
2013 and it happens to be one of the
easiest to handle taking general design
and layout cues from the previous Galaxy
s3 the s4 has thin bezels around the
large screen and adds flat sides to what
is essentially the same footprint has
its predecessor plastic is Samsung's
go-to material and it certainly inherits
all that plastic entails it shine can
get tarnished by fingerprints and it can
get a little slick to the touch
coming on the opposite end of the
spectrum the iPhone 5 opted for a taller
screen rather than an all-around larger
size it's smaller form factor does make
it a nimble Handler and with its
aluminum finish it is widely regarded as
a good looker the obit kudus home button
graces the front with the power button
up top and volume rockers under the
silents toggle on the side this is a
very flat device aside from the rounded
corners a look that Apple has made
rather iconic since introducing the look
in the iPhone 4 Samsung's plastic is
generally controversial but what
shouldn't be ignored is the ease by
which the s4 and its large screen can be
handled if you really do believe that
your hand can't handle that size the
iPhone 5 is about as nimble a performer
as it can get without being too small
since the iPhone 5s release smartphones
have been receiving significant upgrades
in their displays Apple's own device was
given a boost by including the Retina
display that comes in at 11:36 by 640
resolution with 326 PPI it is very much
a good performer with nice contrast and
color reproduction as far as the size
goes it was Apple's deliberate decision
to keep the screen as easy to handle
with one hand as possible that is
certainly the case here Samsung on the
other hand has joined the 5-inch screen
era with their high performing 1080p
display capable of 441 PPI what the size
increase comes greater okay
abilities and that is very true for this
Super AMOLED display it is quite a
saturated display experience with colors
really popping out of the screen for
some this might be too much but it's
hard to argue with how the screen makes
just about anything vibrant the 5 inch
screen might be a little harder for
people to handle but the S form makes it
as easy as it can possibly be
you will likely need your other hand for
just the top most opposite corner it's
also worth noting that with a larger
screen comes easier on screen controls
for gaming with both screens sporting
the proper specifications for their
respective size you get a great
experience going either way
performance typically benefits the later
released device
unfortunately for benchmarks 3dmark
isn't out for iOS just yet so I had to
go with Geekbench for now but the
outcome seems to be where most of us
would expect with the galaxy s4
outperforming the iPhone 5 Apple
smartphone sports their in-house a6 a
dual-core CPU clocked in at 1.2
gigahertz with 1 gigabyte of RAM and the
power VR SGX 543 mp3 backing it this
package might be paling in comparison to
the powerful bits found in the s4
Samsung's flagship in the West is
powered by the quad-core 1.9 gigahertz
Beast the Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 which
is backed by the tried and true Adrina
320 and 2 gigabytes of RAM
it definitely flies through its elements
and has rare cases of stutter though one
could still say that about the iPhone
while the actual chips powering these
phones are a ways apart software and
rendering optimization is still a factor
at Apple's locked-down
ecosystem definitely benefits from it
Android has made it strides to achieve
the same with project butter but the
bottom line is this the speck hungry
will likely go for the more updated
galaxy s4 though a new user of the
iPhone 5 will still find a fast and
fluid experience after all when you are
the only phone that runs your own OS you
better be good at it when it comes to
hardware we have two different
philosophies the unibody of the iPhone 5
makes it a what-you-see-is-what-you-get
device not only is its battery fixed
there's no way of expanding the 16 32 or
64 gigabytes of onboard memory it is
capable of the typical bevy of
connections though it is missing NFC the
galaxy s4 on the other hand takes
advantage of the plastic design by
having a removable back underneath it is
a removable battery
micro SD card slot there on top all of
this the long list of new sensors and
you have a smartphone capable of a whole
lot I do have to mention however that
the iPhone benefits from an extensive
accessories pret agree while its new
docking connector has been rather
controversial it is still possible to
use an adapter for the hundreds of
accessories already available
Samsung hopes the s4 will follow suit
with its own laundry list of accessories
and growing third-party support started
by the s3 the s4 offers more in included
hardware but if you are coming from a
previous Apple device you might have a
better time going with the five as it
will allow you to continue using the
many accessories you may have invested
in size perhaps matters most when it
comes to battery life in this comparison
the iPhone 5 sports a 1440 milliamp hour
battery which is a very low number
compared to many smartphone offerings
found these days it is worth mentioning
however that the a6 processor does its
job of being powerful it gets a very
decent battery life given its battery
size though the end of the day is often
a bit of a gamble we all have friends
who have asked that typical question
time and again anyone have an iPhone
charger the s4 on the other hand has a
whopping 2600 milliamp battery that can
last for up to two days with normal to
below average usage great standby time
makes it last and even then straight
usage can get 8 to 10 hours plus bring a
spare with you and take advantage of the
power saving options and you have a
phone that can really go the distance if
you need a long lasting performer
there's no doubt that the s4 bests the
iPhone in that sheer amount of time the
camera situation is rather interesting
while the iPhone has been regarded as
having great optics that have been used
for a few indie films the galaxy s3 was
able to rival it coming in at 8
megapixels Apple's camera is capable of
the panorama and HDR modes its picture
quality is certainly very good with good
detail and accurate color reproduction
of which the video modes also benefit
from what it lacks however are further
app features you get HDR and panorama
but not much else
not even the ability to change the
aspect ratio of your photo
enter the 13 megapixel performer in the
galaxy s4 it also produces pretty nice
photos in the app you get HDR panorama
best shot sound and shock eraser mode
drama mode dual recording you get the
picture for good quality production you
can go either way here but from
or ways of bringing out the fun in your
smartphone photography the galaxy 4 does
offer much more and finally we have the
software what is interesting here is
that iOS and TouchWiz both suffer from
the same general problem now we've seen
them before a lot
I owe a says evolved since it's early
days adding features like FaceTime and a
notification drop-down originally
popularized by Android but for the most
part it has remained the same
it still is a perpetual app drawer
organiza bewilders and then pages and
pages of icons multitasking is typically
done app by app it works though it does
take quite a few presses of the home
button to achieve Siri has proven useful
in most situations but it's far from the
go to navigation choice for many users
enter TouchWiz the uber colorful and
bloated UI that people either love or
hate it looks better on the large screen
of the s4 but brings with it a ton of
new features multitasking is still
generally reliant on the recent apps
function but multi window helps you when
you really need to do two things at once
S voice is useful but just like Siri
isn't completely practical for go-to
usage now what Samsung has added in
however our new navigation controls
aside a few added applications air views
give you previews and air gestures allow
you to move around with the wave of your
hand
see our in-depth videos for a better
look at all of these it seems that both
of these operating systems have come at
a crossroads of sorts becoming generally
slightly updated versions of their
former selves Samsung might have added
more fun bits in with this version of
TouchWiz on the Galaxy s4 but who knows
what Apple will have in store for the
next iPhone device and OS finally price
despite the iPhone having been released
for sometime it's price is still around
$700 for the base model unlocked the
same goes for the galaxy s4 unlocked on
US contract plans both phones come in at
the $1.99 mark for two year plans and so
there you have it for a lot of people
this will come down to brand loyalty but
I will say this if you purchased a lot
of accessories for a previous iPhone the
iPhone 5 might still be your best choice
that way all of those investments will
remain relevant otherwise the galaxy s4
has a lot to love and a lot of people
will have a ton of fun with it but this
is the exciting part Samsung has really
made a splash with their newest flagship
device so
