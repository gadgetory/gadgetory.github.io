called daddy long legs it was
recommended to us but to at least Josh
and I by our forum guru mr. Luka so my
heightened blood pressure over the next
ten minutes is fault thanks a lot bud
here the bed but nonetheless we have Joe
and Kevin in on this video so why don't
we just go ahead and jump right in I'm
number two on my list out of 3,000
people have in my circles let's not
forget that Joseph Hindi is sixth on my
list and you know what I don't think
josh is even near me man Josh's name is
smelling the leaderboard okay okay so
let's uh let's try this game here
oh what the is this step step step ok
the moment you get your frickin legs
crossed you're done that's pretty much
the way it goes you need to get it so
that they're actually step step step
step so it's a pretty quick tapping sort
of maneuver that you need to do and we
are a stroll in it's like taking a you
know taking a walk down the park we are
strolling and get my top hat oh all
right hang on i'm playing like Joe right
now job Joe
damn it reminds me a quap has anyone
ever played qwop before a qwo piece that
stupid game on the computer where you
had to like make the guy run several
meters and extremely difficult
no you know what I'm going to keep this
PG 13 cuz I'm a man who believes in
using his phone acular skills rather
than swearing all the time so i'm going
to say things like shizzle dizzle damn i
mean crap darn balance of like a toddler
I've seen one year olds walk better than
this I wonder how many times Joe has
cursed this game out already let's try
this again here as you can see you know
I out damn what backwards I didn't even
make it past the finish line negative
meters you walked negative meters
oh my goodness alrighty um he got stuck
look at this I'm just gonna leave him
there you know cuz the moment i press it
he's gonna fall just gonna leave him
right there see how long it takes for
him to fall it's like mmm cold chillin
he's stuck he doesn't want to go
anywhere
Oh get that strolling back what this is
embarrassing the idea is dill I keep the
the head like in the center so it's like
let him move forward a little sure screw
you okay fine I got impatient fast steps
in beginning they're gonna launch it out
to end here we go oh boy stopping me oh
except for myself and a long legs
receives the handoff he's running down
the field he could make it to the 10 oh
he's pulled down at the 14 meter line
come on lift your leg what is the
frickin cut guy oh he lifted it he sure
lifted it but I didn't do crap
oh come on give me some walking whoops I
didn't mean to sit like that okay oh

of meters earlier so I think I've done
with this I think I've had about all the
fun I can have with this game oh damn ok

don't think I'm gonna get that far I'm
