Android Authority and Chinese OEMs are
slowly but surely starting to take the
US market much more seriously and the
latest flagship in the Nubia line is
bringing top-tier specifications a
borderless display and some unique
software tricks but does it do enough to
earn a spot in your pocket when it
finally hits us Shores well that's what
we're about to find out with the Nubia
z-9 from a design standpoint it's easy
to say that Nubia went with a
conservative approach and by
conservative I mean it's a design
formula that we've seen a few times over
but is that a bad thing
not necessarily the Nubia z-9 is a
rectangular slab that utilizes a glass
sandwich design so there's glass on the
front and rear and a metal frame with
chamfered edges holding it all together
lending for a very solid and
high-quality feel in the hand for being
predominantly made of glass it's not
slippery to hold thanks to the angular
design and chamfered edges which
provides a fair amount of grip but as
you might expect the use of glass on the
rear does make the phone somewhat of a
fingerprint magnet the z-9 measures in
at roughly nine millimeters thick so
it's certainly not striving to be the
thinnest phone on the market and with no
taper on the backside to create that
illusion of thinness you're definitely
going to feel every millimeter each time
you pick it up it's also not the
lightest phone at almost 200 grams in
weight so it can be a little bit drawing
to use at first especially if you've
become accustomed to lighter and thinner
devices the weight however does make it
feel substantial further reminding you
that the Z 9 is meant to be a high
quality device every time you hold it
going around the Z 9 you'll find the
buttons and ports and typical locations
with the 3.5 mm headset jack microphone
and IR blaster up top metal power and
volume keys on the right side both of
which are very clicky and easy to press
and there's even a dedicated camera key
to quickly launch the camera and take
photos which is a rarity on Android
phones continue along on the bottom is
the charging port which at first glance
might look like USB type-c but it's just
a standard microUSB flanking that is
what appears to look like dual speakers
but again it's just an illusion when in
fact only one is a speaker and the
is a microphone and finally the left
side of the phone is completely bare
with the exception of the dual SIM card
slot for a touch of color there's a red
ring around the camera lens and glowing
red capacitive menu home and back keys
on the front that's very reminiscent of
the old Droid line back in the day
by default the Menu button is on the
left and the back button is on the right
but this is completely interchangeable
in these settings to suit your personal
preference the main attraction of the
Nubia z-9 is easily the display it's a
5.2 inch screen with 1080p resolutions
so if you're expecting quad HD you're
not going to get it here with the z9 but
it's still a fantastic looking screen
it's bright colorful vivid with great
outdoor visibility and good viewing
angles and with a ppi north of 400 is
plenty sharp for reading text and
consuming all sorts of media it's made
of 2.5 B glass for that subtle curve
along the edges but the interesting part
about the screen is has been raised
above the frame giving it a much more
prominent curve that makes swiping
across the glass a very pleasurable
experience it's not curved to the point
where alters your viewing experience
with media like the s6 edge but there's
just enough of a curved edge that Nubia
was able to add some software tricks to
take advantage of it but more on that
later the raised glass also creates the
illusion that the screen is entirely
bezel is on the left and right sides
when looking at it head on which really
makes the screen the star of the show
and you almost feel like you're holding
on to just a screen but upon closer
inspection the bezels are definitely
still there
they've just been cleverly hidden by
being curved downwards along these sides
providing for an almost bezel experience
and it's quite an impressive feat in
engineering to say the least as far as
the specs go they're going to vary
depending on whether you go with the
classic elite or exclusive editions of
the phone all versions of the Z 9
features a snapdragon 810 processor but
the classic Edition which is the version
we have for review comes with three
gigabytes of RAM versus the 4 gigabytes
of RAM on both the elite and exclusive
editions regardless performance has been
quite great on z-9 even if it is being
powered by a somewhat scrutinized
Snapdragon 810 performing basic tasks
like navigating through the UI and
opening applications is super fluid
and multitasking and playing graphically
demanding games also poses no problems
now for those of you wondering if the
device runs warm after lengthy sessions
of heavy use like gaming the answer is
yes but it was never anything out of the
ordinary nor was it ever concerning in
any way storage will also vary depending
on which version you go with the classic
model comes with 32 gigabytes onboard
and if you want more you'll have to opt
for either the elite or exclusive
version of the phone which comes with 64
gigs of storage but those are basically
the only choices you have for storage as
the z9 does not have expandable storage
if you're an audiophile the z9 comes
with hi-fi audio and Dolby 7.1 surround
sound for improved audio quality
especially with headphones and speaking
of audio quality the single bottom
mounted speaker gets loud enough to hear
even in relatively noisy environments
and delivers a fairly clean sound but
again like all bottom mounted speakers
it can be easily muffled by the hand
especially in landscape and also leads
to a lopsided listening experience with
only one speaker fiying out the side one
feature that is exclusive to the
exclusive version of the phone is the
inclusion of a built-in fingerprint
sensor which neither the classic or the
elite models have and it's a very
different implementation from what we've
seen from the likes of Samsung with
their home button or even Huawei with
their rear mounted fingerprint sensor
and on the z9 is actually mounted on the
side of the phone now as to how well it
actually works I can't really comment on
that because we don't have that version
but if a fingerprint sensor is a
must-have feature for you then the
exclusive version is going to be the one
that you want to go for if nubia really
wants to go toe-to-toe with the major
flagships on the market it's going to
need a great camera and for the most
part dz9 handles itself pretty well
there's a 16 megapixel camera on the
rear with optical image stabilization
and Nubia didn't skimp on the front
camera either which comes in at 8
megapixels for some fairly high
resolution selfie shots outside of smile
detection and beauty mode there isn't
much going on with the front-facing
camera software before the rear there
are a handful of options and shooting
modes like time-lapse multi exposure
slow shutter and many others including
typical ones that you might expect like
HDR and panorama
the Pro Mode is also available for full
control over exposure white balance
shutter speed ISO and even manual focus
to help you get that perfect shot in
fairly good lighting conditions like
outdoors for instance picture quality
was surprisingly great with a nice
amount of color reproduction dynamic
range and a great amount of sharpness
and detail HDR is always available when
needed but is extremely aggressive in
its image processing colors are a little
too oversaturated there's a heavy
reduction in the shadows and it doesn't
handle skin tones well leading to some
very unnatural looking photos in certain
situations the extra saturation can
create for a very appealing photo to the
eye but in others they begin to look
more like a watercolor painting than an
actual photo in low-light and nighttime
shots the camera becomes more or less an
average performer nighttime shots are
decent and the camera is able to handle
prominent light sources like lamp posts
and street lights without over exposing
but take the camera indoors to
environments like dimly lit bars or
restaurants and the level of detail
begins to deteriorate quickly there's a
big increase in noise due to the camera
operating at higher ISOs and not only do
the images look muddy and appearance but
they also exhibit some noticeable
artifacting that's really the biggest
downfall to this camera but in most
situations you shouldn't have much of a
problem getting the shot that you want
battery life on the z-9 has also been
very respectable with the capacity
measuring in just shy of 3,000 milliamp
hours even with several hours of heavy
gaming and lots of picture taking the
phone was still able to go over a day
off the charger with anywhere between
four to four and a half hours of screen
on time and with more casual use you'll
easily be able to extend those numbers a
lot further keep in mind that this again
is the Chinese version of the phone
which does not have Google Play services
installed so you're not going to be
dealing with the typical data syncing
that you normally would with your Google
account this may have an impact on the
z9 s battery life on the US version the
phone which will undoubtedly ship with
Google Play services out of the box
in terms of the software the Nubia z-9
is running lollipop but because of nubia
skin you really wouldn't know it without
jumping into the settings and checking
the version number with Nubia skin you
won't find Google's material design and
instead what you'll get
a much more colorful UI filled with
transparency effects across the board
fortunately there's a built-in theme
store with a handful of themes to tailor
the UI more to your liking there nothing
most intricate themes out there
especially in comparison to theme stores
on competing flagships theming only
basic elements like the icons and
wallpaper but it's still great to have
some variety like many other Chinese
Android manufacturers the Nubia z-9 also
ditches the standard Android app drawer
in favour of an all homescreen
experience so you have to resort to
folders for homescreen organization or
download a third-party launcher you'll
also notice that because this version of
the z9 is geared for the Chinese market
there's a lot of Chinese applications
installed but most of them are just
substitute applications for the lack of
Google Play services
the z-9 also packs a lot of really neat
software tricks up its sleeve
you've got screen division which is
basically Nubia Zwerg a multi window for
some split screen multitasking and a
one-handed mode that shrinks the screen
down to a smaller size just by long
pressing the back button there's also a
series of touch based gestures built-in
like double tap and awake the display
dragging three fingers upwards to take a
screenshot or putting the phone to sleep
by placing your palm on the screen where
it starts to get interesting are the
unique gesture controls that utilize
what Nubia calls frame interactive
technology or fit you can swipe up on
either side of the glass to launch a
specific application or switch to apps
that are currently running in the
background or quickly launch into the
camera just by turning the phone
sideways and touching four finger tips
on the edge of the glass you can also
perform various grip based gestures to
unlock the phone or take a screenshot
just by simply squeezing the phone many
of these may sound a little bit odd at
first and the grip gestures definitely
take some getting used to but Nubia says
they'll save you a lot of time over more
traditional methods if you can manage to
get them to work on the first attempt
the Nubia z-9 is already available in
markets like China but for those of you
waiting for it to hit stateside the z-9
will be released in q3 of this year with
a starting price of 564 dollars for the
classic edition 645 for the elite and
725 for the exclusive version which
again features a built-in fingerprint
sensor
the Nubia z-9 is no doubt a flagship
device that's aimed to go squarely
against phones like the galaxy s6 and
the LG g4 and with very little presence
here in the States Nubia will have a lot
of catching up to do
Nubia looks like they're taking the US
market very seriously with the z9 unlike
some other Chinese manufacturers who are
only releasing their budget phones here
in the States
the Z 9 will be going up against the
best of the competition and it's got all
the right specifications to do so and
these software tricks while very
different and new aren't necessarily
going to feel like a game-changer to
most people what is a game-changer
however is the screen if you've been
looking for a truly bezel-less
experience on a flagship z9 is probably
the closest you're going to get at least
for now
