reporting from Hong Kong we're taking a
first look at the iPhone 5 versus the
HTC One X now both are remarkably
beautiful devices marvels of engineering
really nice thin profile brilliant
beautiful displays that are large
obviously they are competitors now the
HTC One X did come up a little bit
earlier than the s3 and the timing was a
little poor on HTC spart
it really is a beautiful device and it
features a remarkable display brilliant
white high resolution very responsive
but the iPhone is no suction this
department either it has it its own
beautiful display as well now obviously
we are looking at was substantially
larger footprint with the HTC One X just
to give you an idea it has a larger
width and it's slightly thinner as well
excuse me slightly taller as well now
bring it into specs and whatnot with the
HTC One X in terms of his physical
dimensions we are looking at a five
point two nine inches in overall height
with a 2.75 inch width the thinness of
it is 0.35 inches making it quite svelte
very nice and a hand
easy to hold it feels really good and
although it isn't actually curved the
design does give the impression that it
is in fact a curved device much like the
Galaxy Nexus the iPhone 5 is four point
eight seven inches high by 2.3 one
inches wide and it is thinner 0.3 inches
thin to be fact versus the 0.35 of the
HTC One X now in the hand both actually
are very comparable yeah HTC One X is
only 130 grams whereas the iPhone 5 is
112
but really it's very difficult to notice
what makes an impression on the hand is
the actual width you know my hands
aren't large by any means but they're
not swelling either and the HTC One X
is substantially wider and a screen is
substantially wider - and speaking of
screens we're looking at a super LCD
display with an HD display it features
the 1280 by 720 pixel display 4.7 inches
and the iPhone 5 features the odd but
high-resolution retina if Apple would
have us fall under marking features a
pixel of 11:36
excuse me 11 36 high by 640 wide making
it 326 pixels per inch whereas the HTC
One X is 312 pixels per inch
with this 1280 by 720 display which is
becoming the standard for phones going
forward we won't really see any phones
with any pixel density or PPI account
less than 300 it almost looks like a
painting actually the HTC One X and the
iPhone 5 is remarkably beautiful with
this brilliant IPS TFT LCD display of
course there are other differences as
well of which we'll talk about like
battery the foot of the camera itself is
quite similar and others but getting
into memory the HTC One X is one of the
few devices due to its polycarbonate
unibody that does feature no expandable
memory now you can't get it in a 32
gigabyte flavor which is enough for most
people making it satisfying and with
cloud and Dropbox and other such
services getting mobile content on the
move isn't going to be a problem so long
as there aren't any bandwidth
limitations in place the iPhone 5
features 16 32 and 64 gigabyte
iterations and like the HTC One X has no
expandable memory whatsoever in terms of
batteries
they're also comparable as well in that
they aren't removable now of course the
HTC One X features a larger battery
which is necessary due to its large
display we're looking at 1800 milliamp
hours for the HTC One X and as I said it
is not removable for the iPhone 5 it is
only 1400 mil app now in terms of
talktime we have eight hours of talktime
with the iPhone 5 and
we have up to 11 hours of talk time with
the HTC One X of course these are always
manufacturer suggested so there are
obviously going to be differences in
terms of your network or how you use the
device and that's just for talktime now
bringing you back to the internals of
the device they're very different this
features Apple's own design Apple a6
processor with design references board
from arm which of course is powering you
know hundreds and hundreds of millions
if not billions of mobile devices today
of course Intel is going to try and
change that but that's the topic for
another time
now this features the Tegra 3 SOC now it
is clocked at a very high clock speed
but it does feature a different
architecture so though it is a quad core
it is still only going to be actually
probably about 10% slower in terms of
benchmarks and benchmarks really have
very little to do with real-world
application but just to give you guys an
idea i've loaded up a benchmark excuse
me a bookmark or android authority here
i'm just going to open obviously you see
both open quickly just going to type in
and here on both okay all right and
let's push it at the same time now it
should be known that i've cleared the
cache on both to give this a real fair
world example demonstration for you guys
let's just click it and see what loads
first there we go detected oh all right
HCC's off to a good start
okay
now it looks like okay the iPhone 5 did
finish slightly before and it should be
known though and we're still working on
the HTC where that the iPhone 5 doesn't
have flash support now we are running
flash sure obviously a little bit of lag
flash is extremely demanding and in fact
as we know Apple has suspended excuse me
adobe has suspended support for Apple
and mobile devices and we are going to
be moving towards the html5 standard now
let's just see the rotation okay so now
Apple has develop a great reputation for
having an extremely responsive devices
and the iPhone 5 really is no exception
extremely fluid to the pinch-to-zoom is
just I mean it looks like it's even
faster than the jelly bean potentially
90 or 120 frames a second and it's
next-generation LCD display a really
renders images and text remarkably well
now dolphin of course if we want to give
a truer test we probably should give
Chrome but it is nice actually to have
flash it is still not been replaced by
any existing technology online and you
will still find out in the majority of
sites but you know that's not to say the
HTC One X is loved it's still renders
content very very quickly and it's very
beautiful it's just because there is no
flash and because Apple controls the
browsing experience essentially on on
iOS and they are able to optimize it in
addition the processor on this features
specs that best the world's best-selling
Android device
of course the galaxy s3 now but only by
above five to ten percent either way
both are beautiful and both are fast
let's bring it back to the home now of
course these are competitors now this is
an Android based device and it's running
Android Ice Cream Sandwich at 4.04
iteration with Sense 4.0 overlay now
jelly bean which is the next generation
of Android is promised for HTC's devices
we haven't been given a release date yet
but it should be coming soon now the
iPhone 5 features iOS 6 which a lot of
people love and also a lot of people
hate the mapping solution that's
contained within sadly
itself a lot of bad press and for good
reason it's it's just nowhere near as
good at what Google has offering and
it's just it's just nowhere near as good
it was just simple as that you can talk
to anyone that's used it so far whereas
obviously Google Maps is substantially
better either way that's a small part
but in an important part of what makes
these devices different now bringing it
back to other things on the front we
have a 1.3 megapixel camera for the HTC
One X and live phone five has a 1.2
megapixel camera making them very very
comfortable other than that we have a
micro USB plug in excuse me on the HTC
One X so that you can add your own
movies and music without the need for
any third-party software suite sadly
with the iPhone everything has to go
through iTunes
now you could jailbreak this device and
you could make it your own but a lot of
people are scared to do that what else
so we have an an S LCD to display on the
HTC One X it is really one of the best
displays in the market and a lot of
people really really love it
when the HTC One X came out all the
device whirs on all the prominent tech
sites were saying that arguably was one
of the best displays that ever laid
witness to now this does feature a
higher ppi count what it is negligible
you really have to look at it with a
magnifying glass that really spot the
difference so let's see a camera test to
see how quickly both can take pictures
I've used both and both are remarkably
fast let's just try and take a pictures
of yes three here get them both in the
hand let them focus which one focuses
first okay this appears as though the
iPhone is struggling with a close-up
there we are okay and let's just take
pictures one two three
okay thank you so basically for every
picture they are able to capture with
the 1x you were able to capture as
essentially three or four with the
iPhone but it does have a problem
focusing I'm trying to hold my ends as
steady as possible okay now it's just
clear that the iPhone is lightning fast
let's just take a look to see if they're
actually clear not bad really not bad at
all okay and let's look at the HTC One X
to see okay also quite clear and so
essentially after you get them focused
they are very comparable of course both
are both our LCD technology rotation
okay so I would say that they were very
close to being on par now we're going to
follow up with a much more thorough
device review obviously in one of our
articles in our site in which we're
gonna be looking at benchmarks camera
and all the other important features
that matter to smartphone owners so
talking about the iPhone 5 for a second
this device launched today September
21st and they've sold millions them in
fact they sold out of pre-orders and the
lineups they actually still had to
suspend lineups here in Hong Kong
because there were fights last year and
there's so many scalpers since so much
animosity that Apple put in place a
lottery system in which you have to go
online and order one so now this is an
a6 processor inside on the clock to
1,000 gig excuse me megahertz whereas
this is a Tegra 3 quad-core so dual core
1,000 megahertz versus quad-core at one
point form gigahertz so with the HTC One
X we're looking to be powered by the
tiger 3 clocked in at 1.5 gigahertz and
it does feature a remarkably powerful
1.5 gigahertz clock speed now Tiger has
excuse me NVIDIA has vast experience
with gaming so taker is gaming
they always have their own market the
apps and the games available there are
gonna be optimized for that and so you
will enjoy your extremely fluid and
immersive gaming experience with the
Tegra powered device the iPhone 5 though
is powered by a 1 gigahertz dual-core
ne6 processor which Apple design
themselves but initial benchmarks are
showing that at best the HTC One X in a
variety of situations
albeit only slightly other than that
obviously very different operating
systems with iOS 6 versus Android it
really depends on what you're looking
for a lot of things that matter to
smartphone owners I like one-handed
operation no it is all really easier to
use the iPhone 4 100 operation you still
have a large display the width obviously
is nowhere near that of HTC One X but it
is comparable in terms of how tall it is
so it's really up to you a lot of people
don't really mind tapping it and having
custom keyboards and everything with
Android you can really customize the
experience to make it your own
and it's really funny to see how Apple
is incrementally incorporated features
into its software suite that mimic and
emulate many many features of what
Android already has on the table but
they do say that copying is the best
form of flattery or something similar to
that
so maybe apples just following androids
lead either way these are two of the
leading devices in the marketplace today
so we wanted to give you a hands-on
comparison of the gala excuse me in the
HTC one extras to the iPhone 5 I'm
really liking both simple as that
obviously I'm an Android fan you know
would have hundred authority here but
competition between you know the serious
players in the mobile business is really
good thing for consumers and we need to
we need to engender that
need to encourage that people vote with
their dollars more than anything today
and there's no doubt in anyone's mind
that the iPhone 5 will probably be the
best-selling mobile device for the next
little while either way I would have to
say it really all depends on your
personal preferences iOS is arguably
more intuitive intuitive albeit less
customizable than Android the response
time of operation is slightly better and
web browsing shows that - but you will
be missing out on some key features like
flash in addition to that the ability to
add widgets and whatnot to your device
makes the HTC One X and other Android
devices very very appealing to many that
like to own their experience - to
maximize and to explore to create and to
really make it their own whereas sadly
unfortunately iOS is really adhering to
a strict sort of top-down vertically
integrated approach with its iTunes and
the way that it it just mandates that
you connect to a computer to get music
on there and movies and so forth either
way guys like I said two of the best
devices on the market today
iPhone 5 for stage 2 c1x we're reporting
