of the flagship smartphone game have
some competition hey it's Josh of
Agartha mantra' authority what's going
on everybody and this is the oneplus one
versus the Samsung Galaxy s5 in this
quick look now the oneplus one features
a minimalistic look and a premium feel
almost without any embellishments with
its slightly raised display on the front
surrounded by a chrome frame and ass
clean smooth hard plastic back the
Samsung Galaxy has five features a good
feel as well with its soft touch plastic
backplate and that has a perforated
design now the dimpled design of the
back may be a little controversial to
some on the s5 which might put the 1
over in the looks department the front
of the oneplus one is all black with no
logos or physical buttons to draw the
attention away from the display you get
capacitive buttons but you also get the
option to switch from using those two
on-screen keys the galaxy s5 on the
other hand comes with Samsung's
signature button layout on the front but
the physical home button being flanked
by two capacitive keys and the major
difference being the replacement of the
Menu key with a recent apps key in terms
of dimensions the oneplus one is
obviously the larger of the two devices
courtesy of its bigger 5.5 inch display
compared to the 5.1 inch one of the
Galaxy s5 as a result the handling
experience is certainly easier with the
galaxy s5 while the one-handed use will
be more difficult on the oneplus one so
you do get an overall handling not given
to the Samsung Galaxy s5 but we are
dealing with a very pretty device in the
one which will further be enhanced in
its look when the different material
backs are released now both of these
phones feature 1080p displays with the
difference being obviously in the size
5.5 inches for the oneplus one and 5.1
inches for the galaxy s5 resulting in a
pixel density of 401 and 432 pixels per
inch respectively as for the
technologies underlining the screens we
have a beautiful IPS LCD display on the
oneplus one which also comes with touch
on lens tech and is also said to be
significantly more shatterproof than
other screens you also get great viewing
angles with this 178 degree possible
vision the galaxy s5 on the other hand
features the vivid Super AMOLED display
that provides vivid colors great
contrast high brightness and colors that
jump out of the screen and pretty much
punch you in the face at first glance
we're looking at pretty much the best
that either of these screen
architectures can all
super amoled continues to create highly
saturated colorful experience while the
JDI IPS screen on the one is a great
performer in its own right get inside of
these phones and you'll find the same
quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor
clocked in at 2.5 gigahertz and backed
by the audrina 330 in either but the
oneplus one does come with one extra gig
of ram more than the galaxy s5 but in
either case performance should be smooth
and fast and both should easily handle
anything you throw at it
the galaxy s5 does feature expandable
storage which is one of its main options
that puts it over some of the other
flagship phones and it's not one that
you get with the oneplus one which does
attempt to make up for it by offering a
version with 64 gigabytes of built-in
storage Samsung always packs its
flagship releases with everything it can
and so the galaxy s5 comes with a heart
rate monitor on the back a fingerprint
scanner that is integrated into the home
button and it also has to be mentioned
that the galaxy s5 comes with an ip67
rating for protection against dust and
water the galaxy s5 also features a
smaller twenty eight hundred million
power battery compared to the 3100
milliamp hour unit in the oneplus one so
while the battery of the latter is large
enough to comfortably provide a full day
of use the power saving features and
modes baked into galaxy s5 would help it
get a lot done as well and even with the
promise of better battery life with the
oneplus one the galaxy s5 does also get
a slight advantage by virtue of having a
battery that is removable giving you the
option to carry around to spare for when
you need it
overall Samsung's penchant for putting
everything in their devices does put it
somewhat over the more simplistic
outlook of the oneplus one but if the
two main aspects of the removable
battery and expandable storage aren't as
important to you the core experience
here is still pretty comparable between
these two phones now in the optics
department we do find a 13 megapixel
Sony Exmor RS sensor in the oneplus one
and it is constructed of a six-part lens
with the F 2.0 aperture and a dual LED
flash and as far as the software package
goes it does provide a lot of options
that should be able to give a pretty
wonderful smartphone camera experience
bring it around to the front and you get
a 5 megapixel camera with a wide lens
that enables an 80 degrees field of view
now the Samsung Galaxy s5 of course
comes with the 16 megapixel ISO cell
camera that provides some pretty great
photos that we've already covered
extensively in the review and a camera
shootout you get good images with
great detail and while some software
features like the selective focus can be
hit and miss at times when it does work
it does add a little bit of style to
your smartphone photography
now obviously the oneplus one camera
will be put through its paces once we
get our hands on a review unit so you
can stay tuned for comparisons between
these two packages in the near future
finally in software we'll look at two
slightly different philosophies as the
oneplus one run CyanogenMod 11s a
special release built specifically for
the one to take advantage of all of its
hardware and its features and is based
on Android 4.4 KitKat
you get the clean minimalistic stock
like experience with a lot of
customization found underneath to really
give you freedom on the core experience
but useful software features include
voice commands that let you wake the
device or you can launch your favorite
apps by drawing preset gestures on a
sleeping screen and as mentioned before
you can even choose between on-screen
and capacitive navigation buttons to
suit your preference further supporting
the notion that cm can really be cater
to your liking and with the Samsung
Galaxy S five you get the familiar
TouchWiz UI with some elements that have
been updated and of course the number of
new features as well
big changes include the new circle motif
that is found in the notification
toggles and the settings menu
and the addition of the my magazine a
second screen that works as a news and
social media aggregator after that you
get a few different tools like the
toolbox and even a download booster so
there is a lot to see inside of the
TouchWiz UI updated for the galaxy s5
now while TouchWiz ultimately packed so
much in order to provide
supplementation's to your Android
experience CyanogenMod takes a slightly
different approach in that it allows you
to the freedom of customizing the
already well-received shell that is the
stock Android experience now price is
where these comparisons will probably
get pretty nuts because while the Galaxy
s5 is available on to your contracts at
$1.99 on the various carriers in the
States you can also get one unlocked at
the base model for over $600 on the
other hand the oneplus one brings you a
great core Android experience at the
incredible price of $2.99 now for all
that is offered in the one that is one
hell of a price and while whether or not
this is truly the flagship killer
remains to be seen
$2.99 is probably one plus biggest trump
card in the battle between it and here
the incumbent samsung so stay tuned to
android authority for the future
comparison between this and the samsung
galaxy s5 and also stay tuned for the
rest of our
of the 1+1 because we are your source
