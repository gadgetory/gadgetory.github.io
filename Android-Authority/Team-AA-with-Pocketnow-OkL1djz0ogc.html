here that this video has a lot of static
especially users wearing headphones so I
want you be mindful of that prior to
listening to this video but we decide to
keep it anyways because pocket now is a
friend of android authority and we've
been planning this video for a very very
long time so hopefully you enjoy it and
please accept our sincerest apologies
for the static enjoy wasn't ready or not
it's josh McCarthy rose what's going on
everybody and I know a lot of you out
there are probably really loving the
video right now because you see who's in
the middle between me and lawn over
there we got pocket now in the house
michael fisher and Jaime or Nevada and
we go ahead and hand the mic on over to
you guys and you can just sort of give
our viewers a little bit about
yourselves a little bit info especially
for the few the very very few i'm sure i
mean i know who you guys are if you dick
oh he's the actor he's the one who extra
for robert downey jr's outright photo
double but it was summer recovering i I
am I would say I'm i would call me
pocket now is lead review device
quarters that suppose i do most of our
video content and jaime hangs out hangs
out in honduras wanting more bluetooth
headsets as i write you thank you i
appreciate it i'm still waiting hi I'm
is on your screens every day actually on
the pocket now daily bringing you three
minute news show that I quite like every
time I watch it which is about once a
month right exactly you know weekly
every week and that's about what we do
we talk about mobile technology just
like you do Josh beautiful it's worth
mentioning that right before this video
was here we were chumming it up I'm sure
that there was a little bit of footage
of that already and in the moment I have
Michael the mic he gets all professional
and he sounds exactly like his videos
that's that every single time Leon comic
it is extremely on y'all normally I'm
just dropping f-bombs and driving badly
this is the scoring and ordering bad
coffee oh man we should we are the
competitive snorers i'm not sure if you
do that but it's a lot of fun no one has
been ok set up the decibel meter and
well the fact that no one has told me
tells me either i'm really bad or really
good so I'm just afraid to hurt your
feelings that's okay
sure like gorillas oh thank you the
feeling is mutual especially between our
two respective channels we have lawn
over here and yes he did we were able to
go out and see and yes this is the first
time hi mate has seen the hair right all
right video even yeah we had that on for
first recap video actually are weird
here at CES video anyways we got a lot
of great feedback you know what we're
gonna take this time then there's got to
be a story behind it aside from you just
coming here I want to do that what is
the story behind that because it also
says 2015 back there so tell us about
that I mean I already said it several
times it's it's it's my dream it was my
dream to come to this show and this is
you know you guys already know I've said
it a couple times already it's my first
time here and I wanted to make it
special by by doing something different
and that's the whole reason behind you
know the CES on the side of my head and
the 2015 on the other side so they'll
need air I need a I need to follow your
example yeah well I'll get one next year
yeah sorry Michael hey Michael hey but
yeah that's that was really the whole
idea behind it is just I wanted to make
my first time you know memorable and
special in some way and I figured you
know why not getting cut inside of my
head so and I ever really got good
barber so I trusted him and the funny
thing is like when he cut the 2015 on
the side of my head he actually put 2014
so you had to fix it yeah it says 2015
but yeah
awesome job yeah he had I was scared for
a minute so but you know it's it turned
out good so so that's really story
behind it does good man dude all right
that's an awesome story because I think
we can all remember a time in our lives
before we covered this stuff and if you
were me you read everyone else covering
the stuff and you thought like man I
must be a biggest weirdo in the world
for wanting to go to like a trade show
but I was so so enamored of CES in
particular then I I totally feel you on
that I think it's really cool that you
expressed it that way so that's awesome
man yeah well absolutely and we had a
pretty eventful day already I'm not sure
how you guys to stay white I mean you
you were able to go see those tvs that
you wanted to see so much over at Sony
the Android 4k bravia that's awesome I
actually had a really interesting a
run-in with foo who you know foo who
they create the newbie and you bi they
remember correctly every time at the
clothing designer not FUBU yeah right
that's what we thought for a second too
but they make these tablets that are for
adolescents from from from infant age
all the way to pre teen age and their
focus is improving education for all
kids rather than just have a
manufacturer create like a parent mode
they created a whole ecosystem around
the education of a child I thought I was
amazing and we were able to take a look
at that for a little while yeah it was
really awesome but what has Jeter guises
they've been like so far and and even
this is our for today is the actual
start of CES but we've been at this for
about 23 days now how was your guys's
experience with so far experience for
the show is easier to answer because
days are not really if you know how it
is i don't know what today is relative
to yesterday yeah but we have we have
been really really really excited and
really really disappointed and it
happens every see it happens at every
trade show for that matter it but it's
specifically what we cover we focus on
mobile promised CES is not really a
mobile show that's gonna happen two
months from now that's really the issue
i I try not to be so picky about ces
because this is really the whole banana
not just mobile it's got everything
vehicles it's got TVs right it's got
everything and a lot of people cover
more than
mobile and then that's the reason why
I'm like okay there's a lot of
innovation probably not what we're
looking for makes it a little difficult
for us but so far I like I like what
I've seen in the show and it's always
interesting when like people who do not
make a specifically mobile product would
like you to cover their product because
it has a mobile element and sometimes
that's too much of a stretch but
sometimes it's really really cool like
just outside of our frame we have a
heady pronounce it sous-vide I a
sous-vide by anova yes and I was you
didn't it's not our meat so I was
ignoring it until someone started
shouting me shouting at me from it yeah
and I realized it was my my first
employer the very first person to give
me money for professional voice-over
work that it hired me in 2005 are you
serious okay to go are you serious small
world so this is why she has its cool to
this is it's like well you said it small
world small world and it that's exactly
what it is I mean a lot of us here have
I guess Nicole from mobile geeks one of
our good friends called it a solitary
existence where we we kind of work for
what we work for but it usually is just
our own existence then we get to hang
out with our friends you know that's
what that's what shows like this or like
you know lon you know your your this
your first CES and you know by the way
on behalf of everyone congratulations
for coming and you know if it was your
dream you're living it and I hope that
has been working out just fine for you
but you know yeah like you've been
meeting all of these people that you've
only seen on computer screens how's
how's that experience been for you man
it's it's kind of surreal in a way
because I'm like Michael Fisher's right
here Jaime's right here and I just fist
bumped him it's like any shorter than AI
I wasn't expecting that it's it's just I
don't know it's almost kind of like I'm
starstruck in a way cuz I i watch these
guys and I look up to these guys so it's
just it's cool i like like even you I've
told you before you know like I I
watched your videos before I even was a
part of android authority so for me to
even be a part of the team it's it's
crazy for me you know cuz like I just I
mean you know the story of how I applied
for android authority I just shot off an
email just on a whim I didn't think
anything of it
what you want to know something true
story yeah we all did the same yeah we
all did they say we had nothing to lose
yeah that's that's pretty much how I
thought of it too so but well and you
know it's great and honestly you've been
doing an amazing job here and I've seen
you guys just work as well like really I
said in the last video when we were with
DOM and Marco we're killing it out here
honestly we're killing it and CES is
where Beth yeah and CS has been pretty
good to us now speaking of CES is what I
wanted to move into now we already saw
we would heard from you lon yesterday
that the 4k TVs from Sony are your
favorite thing so far I want to ask you
guys what's the best thing you've seen
so far why the actor well i was gonna
say hi mez answer is mine so we're gonna
steal each other's thing but i'll say it
the G flex 2 from LG I was a big fan of
the original G flex it is my show phone
now that the blackberry classic is given
up and well how does that happen I ran
out of data on our review sim card which
is fine that was a great network us
mobile but also I got tired of using a
platform that could not support the kind
of traffic we needed to send to our
surprise you survive yeah but you know I
will have more thoughts on it later I
don't want to take up the floor talking
about it but then I've got the Lumia
1020 but I use the g flex because it
lasts so long and because it has a lot
of wonderful features that I that helped
me out at CES and the G flex 2 is
nothing but a honing and a reinforcement
of everything good about this and a
reduction of everything that was really
kind of underwhelming quick thaw quick
hug flatten the G flex 2 and it's a one
plus one except with a with us half
dragon a 10 and a cell being accepted
the invitation system and
oh we don't know them and everything
well I meant design-wise okay you notice
the top and bottom that's what I'm sorry
no totally totally totally there are
some keen similarities between the two
hi Mei how about you men G flex 2 you
know I wish I would have seen it's not
because it's the only flagship that got
launched at this event it's not because
of that I've been an LG fan since the g2
I mean forget about the one in the
design and the UI a battery life it's
like what's important for me it it's
reliable and I feel that the Jesus
really good job than when i moved to
Jesus wasn't that good um and then this
wasn't a schedule it didn't defy
anything like the g2 did I know in the
Kennedy in the case of the jeepers I did
not like it too big was it hey give you
too many things it doesn't have a
defined and then the duplex it refine
its smartphones for me honestly that's
high praise it's uterus thick its
futuristic it's well-designed and they
focus on the things that matter they
didn't go for 2k displays do you really
even care about that can you really
notice the difference I mean for me the
over sharpening on the g3 was a
disappointment so for me for the G flex
2 to be you know the essentials a good
display good battery life hopefully we
have to test that will see it's a
smaller battery ergonomics hopefully a
durability hopefully we have to test all
these things your drop test haha
that's that's that's what's gonna play
it all I'm looking forward to watching
your drop test and if we didn't do that
like it's been hasn't been something
that we done for a little while but I
want to be surprised if we did for that
honestly perverse well coming from the
guy who put the g flex in a bag and
start shaking the crap out of it I
didn't like it I do I was forced to do
and you think I like dropping phones
yeah oh God thank you oh do it for a
living come on well yeah we're in total
agreement here I do believe that the G
flex 2 is probably best in show or at
least a top five at the most but you
know honestly um ergonomics i think is
already kind of the jury's not even out
for that I think it's a great feeling
phone off for yak and I are economics
yeah and yeah the curved display is the
only thing that I think aside from like
a 2kg screen that actually proves itself
to the usage of the user a 2k screen you
can't really prove that that's actually
really useful to somebody yeah so that's
the thing lon your your 4k bravia sore
though still your answer for for the
thing yeah that's that's still my answer
cuz I saw him again today and it's just
they're so freakin sweet I mean you
gotta see how even if none of us
combined can afford him I don't care if
I can't afford him but I'm just gonna
enjoy them while they're right here all
right I mean they're so thin it's crazy
it's crazy how thin they are I mean I
mean Sony thats own even made that a
point when they said it's thinner than
the xperia smartphones obvious thinner
than a lot of smartphones yeah like I I
held up or I had Kevin hold up his
experience it and I even had one of the
Sony guys there he said his four point
nine inch or four point nine centimeter
millimeters thin so it's crazy yeah
I did have a chance to look at them and
it's just technology as we coming in
because inconsistence picu asst sorry
too much wine inconspicuous and i like
that i like the fact that it's becoming
invisible yeah and that that's really
the point you don't really look at a
wall anymore it's it's your flat-screen
TV right there you're actually enjoying
your experience that's really what
you're looking for you don't really like
you sure we come from the geek days
where we like gadgets but we like the
fact that they're becoming less and less
predominant and it's all about the
experience not necessarily about what's
providing it that's really what I like
big chunky I know I know all right so
I'm not running not like last night
where I was running out of space on the
card we I have plenty of space on here
hi well maybe so but I did want to say
this we're gonna what I was gonna say
was our viewers are not complaining at
all we got android thorium pocket now on
the same video come on now but but with
that in mind with the width with uh with
in mind that we do have a little bit of
time left here people are kind of
rolling out just a little bit um biggest
disappointment so far SE yes I'm really
looking forward to I'm gonna have the
mic to you and you guys just have fun I
was uh I was slated to see I'm not gonna
say the brand name because I trash him
but I I was slated to see a wearable
that was going to sort of redefine my
perception really solid wearable not
gonna do it and you know it was much
smaller than a smart watch it was
arguably more useful in certain
situations and it may well be all those
things but to be frank we were promised
a working prototype and I went all
across Las Vegas to find not really I
went a quarter of the way across Las
Vegas in rush hour traffic anyway I left
this place to go to a different place
you know this trip is on yeah man I've
traveled a great long ways to find to
find a block of resin that was
non-functional it was a mock-up unit
that was a big big frustration because
this could have been a really cool thing
and so that was a disappointment for me
I'm not ready to say what the the
finished product isn't one yet to see
we're gonna look at but maybe hi mate
has an idea of what that might be for us
I don't know I don't know I it's hard
for me to declare a disappointment there
are so many again the good the cool
thing about CES is there's a lot of
innovation behind it there's a lot of
purpose for it some of the products here
are vaporware it will never reach the
market we we know that for the longest
time but then again I guess companies
like for example Samsung I was expecting
for a company that's making a comeback
it's trying to make a comeback good
point to at least bring something to the
show you know this show this is the
market that makes Samsung what it is and
yet we got nits tiered in lower tiered
phones but then again again the problem
is CES is more than just about bones
they do tvs they do everything so
probably it's because of our scope they
disappoint me not necessarily which is
why I take it like with the Crimson
exactly exactly I mwc that's going to be
the show that's going to be the show
indeed Lana I don't remember what your
answer was last night oh no you weren't
there that's right what is your biggest
disappointment of CSF are I'm gonna have
to because I think you mentioned it in
one of our recap videos I'm gonna have
to go with nvidia just just because
yeah I read the the chip it's it's
awesome we know it's it's a powerful
chip and text yeah yeah on paper but
like historically we haven't seen like
Nvidia chips in a ton of devices like
it'd be one or two and then it's just
for a reason the Tegra 3 was such a
disappointment I feel OMG became
skeptical about yeah that's that's
that's true i suppose but i don't know
it's just I want to see their chips and
more products and and then the whole
thing with the parking the autonomous
car it's just the way they presented it
like you said it just wasn't presented
in a fashion that everybody that got
everybody excited about it so I would
say that that's probably my biggest
letdown how about you Joe for me it was
the same thing it was in video because I
was there to you by the first ever event
i did for in viet for us for android
authority press conference that is was
in video 2 years ago when Jensen Huang
accidentally called shield project Thor
and it was hilarious and but the thing
is after that it turned out to be an
amazing press conference and the shield
was an amazing product I'm a big fan of
the shield tablet by the way I'm sure
our viewers know but the yeah the thing
is this time around automotive
technology which is the which is kind of
the story of CES in certain ways they
provoke it's been the focus they they
presented it in a way that honestly it
almost put us to sleep it really did you
know don't get me wrong there were
plenty of people in that press
conference that were right there with
them they knew what teraflops meant for
example and um but the rest of us who
were here for different focuses the
Tegra x1 was a great announcement we
were expecting to hear something like oh
look how fast his tablet goes the x1
will change the game and then they put
it in a car and then they showed his
four videos over and over again of a car
parking on its own and it and that car
took like two miles an hour it took so
it took so long for it to park it wasn't
necessarily the release that was bad it
was just the way it was presented um but
I'm about to say actually i was about to
sign off the yeah we've definitely put a
little bit of a longer video there but
i'm sure a lot of you guys don't mind
because we have a great group of people
over here we've actually been been
buddies for a little while so it's it's
great for us to finally get a video
together that is even at this length no
one cares you guys love it I know you
know we got we do we do too so and thank
